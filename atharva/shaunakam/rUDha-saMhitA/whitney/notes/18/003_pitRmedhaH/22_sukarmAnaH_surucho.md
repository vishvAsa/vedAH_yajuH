## Translation
22. Of good actions, well-shining, pious, heavenly ones (*devá*),  
forging the generations as \[smiths forge\] metal, brightening Agni,  
increasing Indra, they have made for us a wide conclave (*pariṣád*),  
rich in kine.

## Notes
The corresponding verse in RV. (iv. 2. 17) combines in **a-b**  
*devayántó ‘yo*, has in **c** *vavṛdh-*, and for **d** *ūrváṁ gávyam  
pariṣádanto agman;* its *pada*-text in **b** reads ⌊jánima like ours⌋.  
⌊Weber, *Sb.* 1896, p. 263-64, takes *devā́* (*jánimā*) as = *devā́nām*  
and the whole verse as a parallel to vs. 23, where the phrase *devā́nāṁ  
jánimā* occurs in full.⌋

title = "६२ विवस्वान् नो"

## Translation
62. Let Vivasvant set us in immortality; let death go away; let what is  
immortal come to us; let \[him\] defend these men until old age; let not  
their life-breaths (*ásu*) go to Yama.

## Notes
In śśS. iv. 16. 5, and MB. i. 1. 15 are found as the first two pādas of  
a verse our 62 **b** and 61 **a**. ⌊For the *na āitu* of our 62 *b*,  
both texts have *ma ā gāt* (the *me* is incongruent with the following  
nas*);* and for the *vivasvān* of our 61 **a**, both have *vaivasvato*,⌋  
thus rectifying the meter. The mss. accent *vivasvān* as in 61 **a**. We  
need to resolve *mó* to *mā́ u* in **d** to make a good *triṣṭubh* pāda;  
but the Anukr. would apparently read *mo* and balance the lack of a  
syllable by the redundancy of one in **c**. Possibly *ā́* is intrusive in  
**c**, and the meaning was 'defend from growing old.' The ritual use of  
the verse was explained above, under vs. 61.

## Translation
29. Dhartar the maintainer shall maintain thee aloft, as Savitar the  
light (*bhānú*) to the sky above; to the world-makers etc. etc.

## Notes
The translation follows the comm. in connecting *ūrdhvám* with what  
precedes, instead of (as the meter suggests, and as is perhaps rather to  
be preferred) with what follows it.\* The definition by the Anukr. of  
the meter of these five verses is not very acceptable; the refrain of  
25-28 has 35 syllables (12: 12 + 11); the prefixed variable part varies  
from 12 to 14; 28 has 46 syllables (11 + 12: 12 + 11). ⌊Cf. note to  
excerpts from Anukr., above, p. 847, top.⌋  
  
\*⌊There is a clear play of words in *dhartā dharuṇo dhārayātāi*, not  
without conscious reminiscence, perhaps, of the familiar plays in  
*varaṇo vārayātāi* at x. 3. 5 and vi. 85. 1, and in *vār idaṁ vārayātāi  
varaṇāvatyām adhi* at iv. 7. 1.† Moreover, I think that these  
derivatives of root *dhṛ* make clear reference to *dhruvā diś*, the  
'fixed direction' or 'steadfast region,' and that *ūrdhvam* makes  
similar reference to the 'upward region.' Render perhaps: 'Let the  
Steadier, steadying, steady thee \[in the steadfast region\], as aloft  
\[that is, in the upward region\] Savitar \[steadieth *or* maintaineth\]  
the light, the sky above.' Cf. my note, p. 847, ¶ 8.—†Cf. xix. 36. 6  
**d**.⌋

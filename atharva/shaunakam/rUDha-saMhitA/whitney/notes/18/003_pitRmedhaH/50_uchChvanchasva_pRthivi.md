## Translation
50. Swell thou up, O earth; do not press down; be to him easy of access,  
easy of approach; as a mother her son with her skirt (*síc*), do thou, O  
earth (*bhū́mi*), cover him.

## Notes
The corresponding verse in RV. (x. 18. 11) has at end of **b**  
*sūpavañcanā́*. TA. (in vi. 7. 1) has in **a** *úchmañcasva* and *ví  
bādhithās*, in **b** *-vañcanā́*, and at end of **d** *bhūmi vṛṇu*. We  
had the latter hall-verse above, as 2. 50 **c, d**. The comm.  
paraphrases *uchvañcasva* with *ucchūnāvayavā pulakitā bhava*. ⌊W.  
appears to follow the comm. in rendering *úc chvañcasva* by 'swell thou  
up.' I do not see why he quit his old version, 'open thyself.' In my  
*Reader*, p. 385, I said "Note the meaning of *śvañc* \['open itself;  
receive in open arms (as a maid her lover)'\] and its concinnity with  
the metaphor of *yuvatí*" \[of the vs. which precedes alike in RV. and  
AV.\]. At RV. x. 142. 6, Ludwig renders *úc chv-* by 'gäne empor': cf.  
Eggeling's version of *ucchvan̄ka* and the context at śB. v. 4. 1⁹. In  
neither RV. passage does Sāyaṇa seem convincing.⌋

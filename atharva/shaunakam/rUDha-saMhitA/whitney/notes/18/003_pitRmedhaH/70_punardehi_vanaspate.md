title = "७० पुनर्देहि वनस्पते"

## Translation
70. Give back, O forest tree, him who is deposited here with thee, that  
in Yama's seat he may sit speaking counsels.

## Notes
Two of our *pada*-mss. (Bp.Kp.) read *vidátha* in **d**. The verse is  
repeated, according to Kāuś. (83. 19), when the bone-relics are removed  
from the root of a tree, at which they had been for some time deposited:  
the comm. adds "provided they have been previously so deposited." It  
reads more as if it were originally addressed to the (hollowed) tree in  
which a corpse is buried (in which case, *tváyi* ought to be rendered  
'in thee'). ⌊With regard to *vanaspate*, see my note to 2. 25, above:  
and as to *vidáthā*, see Geldner, ZDMG. lii. 735.⌋

## Translation
7. Here is one for thee, beyond is one for thee; enter thou into union  
with the third light; at entrance be thou fair (*cā́ru*) with \[thy\]  
body, loved of the gods in the highest station.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 56. 1, which reads in **c** *tanvàs*, and in **d**  
*janítre* (for *sadhásthe*). It is also found in SV. (i. 65), TB. (in  
iii. 7. 1³), TA. (vi. 3. 1; 4. 2), and Āp. (ix. i. 17); in **a**,  
TB.¯Āp. have *u* (for *ū* before *te*); in **c**, all have *saṁvéśanas*,  
while SV. gives *tanvè* and the others *tanúvāi;* in **d**, TB.Āp. read  
*priyé*, and SV.TB.Āp. agree with RV. in *janítre*. According to Kāuś.  
(80. 36), the verse accompanies the carrying of the fire at the head of  
the procession to the funeral pile; as the comm. states it, carrying the  
three fires, in the case of one who has established sacrificial fires.  
The three "lights" are thus understood to be the three sacrificial  
fires; but they are probably, in the original meaning of the verse,  
rather three regions of light, to the highest of which the deceased is  
to be translated.

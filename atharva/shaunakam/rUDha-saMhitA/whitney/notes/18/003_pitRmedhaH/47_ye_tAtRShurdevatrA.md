## Translation
47. They who thirsted panting among the gods, knowers of offering,  
praise-fashioned, with songs (*arká*)—come, O Agni, with the thousand  
god-revering true poets, seers sitting at the *gharmá*.

## Notes
⌊This verse and the next correspond to RV. x. 15. 9 and 10; but AV.  
makes the third pāda of 9 change place with the third pāda of 10: cf.  
the shuffling at xviii. 2. 2 and note.⌋ The RV. verse occurs also in TB.  
ii. 6. 16² and MS. iv. 10. 6. All these read in **d** *kavyāíḥ  
pitṛ́bhis* after *satyāís;* and TB. has in a *tātṛpús*, and in **b**  
*hotrāvṛ́dhas*. Nearly all our mss., but, according to his account, only  
one of SPP's, accent *ṛṣíbhis* in **d**.\* The comm. glosses *jéhamānās*  
with *prayatamānās;* his explanation of the strange compound  
*stómataṣṭa* is in part lost; he understands by *gharma* the *pravargya*  
soma-offering; and he paraphrases *sahasram* by *aparimitaṁ dhanaṁ yathā  
bhavati*. This verse and the next are used by Kāuś. (87. 22) as  
explained under 2. 34. \*⌊SPP. plausibly suggests that the *madhyodātta*  
of *ṛṣíbhis* in this vs. and the next is to be accounted for by the  
*madhyodātta* of the corresponding word in RV., to wit, *pitṛ́bhis*. If  
he is right, the case is very probably similar to that of *ṛṣíbhyas* at  
xix. 22. 14 (cf. the *śiṣíbhyas* of many mss. in the next vs.!) and to  
those noted under xiv. 2. 59: other cases at xix. 22. 9, 10; 38. 1  
**d**.⌋

## Translation
10. Let the soma-drinking (*somyá*) Fathers anoint me with splendor, the  
gods with honey, with ghee; making me pass further on unto sight, let  
them increase me, attaining old age, unto old age.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Some of the mss. (including our D.R.p.m.T.) read *ájantu* in **b**;  
possibly it is their way of emending the false accent of *áñjantu;*  
doubtless we ought to change this to *añjántu* rather than to admit the  
modulated stem *áñja*. The *pratīka* (*varcasā mām*) applies either to  
this verse or to the next, or probably is used to include both; whatever  
it applies to is used, according to Kāuś. (81. 47; 87. 4), in connection  
with rinsing the mouth at the end of the cremation ceremony and at the  
beginning of the *piṇḍapitṛyajña;* and also (86. 17), with 3. 61-67, in  
the ceremony of interring the bones, in connection with supporting the  
*dhruvanas*\* on the north-west of the fire. The comm. takes notice of  
only the first of these three applications. \*⌊Caland, WZKM. viii. 369,  
would read *dhuvanāny upayachante* at 86. 16: I suppose he would render,  
'they offer fannings \[to the relics\].' But are we sure that 86. 17  
goes with 86. 16 and forms a part of the *dhuvana* ceremony?—Cf. my note  
to vs. 17 below.—The non-lingualization of the first *n* gives the  
strongest possible support for *dhuvanāni* as against *dhru-*.⌋

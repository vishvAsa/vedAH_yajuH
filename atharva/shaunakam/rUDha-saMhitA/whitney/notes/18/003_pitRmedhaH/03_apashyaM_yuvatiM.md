## Translation
3. I saw the maiden being led, being led about, alive, for the dead; as  
she was enclosed with blind darkness, then I led her off-ward (*ápācī*)  
from in front (*prāktás*).

## Notes
The translation of **b** implies, ⌊not the *jīvā́m ṛtébhyas* of the  
Berlin text, but rather⌋ the reading *jīvā́m mṛtébhyas:* his is accepted  
by SPP. and is supported by the majority of his authorities ⌊including  
two reciters⌋ and by the comm. and by some of our mss. collated later  
(O.Op.R.T.), ⌊and especially by the variant of TA., below⌋. ⌊Compare the  
cases of *yame dīrgham*, etc., discussed in the note to xviii. 2. 3.⌋  
The version in TA. (vi. 12. 1) is better than ours in **a, b**:  
*ápaśyāma yuvatím ācárantīm mṛtā́ya jīvā́m parṇīyámānām;* but not so good  
in **c, d**: *andhéna yā́ támasā prā́vṛtā́ ’si prā́cīm ávācīm áva yánn  
áriṣṭyāi*. According to Kāuś. (81. 20), vss. 3 and 4 are used as the cow  
(to serve as *anustaraṇī*) is led, at the funeral pile, around (the  
fires) leftwise; the comm. gives a corresponding explanation; and the  
comment to TA. also understands it of such a cow (*rājagavī*); ⌊cf.  
Caland, *Todtengebräuche*, p. 40⌋. It is very difficult to believe that  
this was the original meaning of the verse, and that it did not rather  
refer to some rescue from immolation of a young wife. The comm.  
paraphrases pāda **d** by *enāṁ gām pūrvadeśāt śavasamīpād apān̄mukhīṁ  
śavāt parān̄mukhīm asmadabhimukhīm prāpayāmi:* this is of no authority.  
Pāda **a** can be made full only by the unacceptable resolution  
*ápaśiam;* the TA. reading of the word would remove the difficulty.

## Translation
52. I brace up (*ut-stabh*) the earth from about thee; setting down this  
clod (? *logá*), let me take no harm; this pillar do the Fathers  
maintain for thee; let Yama there make seats for thee.

## Notes
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 18. 13) reads in **c-d** *dhārayantu té  
‘trā* ⌊p. *te átra*⌋, and ends with *minotu*. The TA. (in vi. 7. 1)  
reads *tabhnomi* in **a** ⌊despite the interposition of *te:* an  
interesting variant; cf. *Gram.* §185 c, *aty aṣṭhāt* etc.⌋; in **b**,  
it substitutes, as do two or three mss. (including our O.) and the  
comm., *lokám* ⌊surd⌋ for *logám* ⌊sonant: cf. note to ii. 13. 3⌋; at  
the juncture of **c** and **d** it agrees with RV. ⌊*-yantu té ‘trā*⌋;  
and ends with *sā́danāt te minotu*. ⌊As to *sā́danāt te*, cf. the contrary  
blunders at xv. 10. 2; xviii. 2. 3, note.⌋ Nearly all the mss. (all save  
our R. and one of SPP's) have *riṣan* at end of **b**; but both editions  
emend to *riṣam* ⌊as RV. reads⌋. Our mss. vary in accent between  
*sthūṇā́m* and *sthū́ṇāṁ;* in explanation of *etāṁ sthūṇām*, the comm.  
says *etām prasiddhāṁ sthūṇāṁ tava gṛhanirmāṇāya*. As a *triṣṭubh*, the  
verse has really three syllables in excess instead of one. Kāuś. quotes  
it (86. 8) in the ceremony of interment of the bones, with the direction  
*logān yathāparu*, doubtless '\[laying\] clods for each several joint';  
the comm. does not notice this.

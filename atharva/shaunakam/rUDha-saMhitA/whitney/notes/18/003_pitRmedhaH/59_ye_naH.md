## Translation
59. They that are our father's fathers, that are \[his\] grandfathers,  
that entered the wide atmosphere—for them may the autocratic (*svarā́j*)  
second life today shape our bodies as he will.

## Notes
The first half-verse we had above as 2. 49 **a, b** ⌊and its prior pāda  
also at 3. 46⌋; the second half-verse corresponds to the second half of  
RV. x. 15. 14 (and VS. xix. 60), but is much corrupted, even to  
unintelligibility, so that the translation is only mechanical. RV. reads  
*tébhiḥ svarā́ḍ ásunītim etā́ṁ yathāvaśáṁ tanvàṁ kalpayasva;* VS. has  
*tébhyas* and *kalpayāti*, but the rest like RV. The last pāda is  
identical with vii. 104. 1 **d** above.

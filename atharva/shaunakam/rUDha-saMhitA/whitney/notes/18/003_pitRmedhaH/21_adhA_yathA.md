## Translation
21. So then as our distant Fathers, the ancient ones, O Agni, sharpening  
the rite: they went to the bright, they shone,\* ⌊*should be* shining⌋,  
praising with song; splitting the ground, they uncovered the ruddy ones.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. iv. 2. 16, found also in VS. (xix. 69) and  
TS. (in ii. 6. 12⁴) which read precisely with RV. The variants of our  
text are no better than corruptions; the others have at end of **b**  
*āśuṣāṇā́s* ⌊p. *āśuṣāṇā́ḥ*⌋ and in **c** *dī́dhitim*. The translation  
follows our text.\* The comm. takes *āśaśānā́s* (p. *ā॰śaś-*) from root  
*aś*, and glosses it with *vyāpnuvantas!* The "ruddy ones" are in its  
opinion the dawns ⌊or else the stolen cows which the An̄girases got back  
from the Paṇis⌋.—\*⌊Whitney's ms. reads "they shone": this is probably  
an oversight and should be "shining"; his Bp., to be sure, but Bp.  
alone, has *dī́dhyata*, not *-taḥ*.⌋

## Translation
65. Agni shines forth with great show (*ketú*); the bull roars loudly  
unto the two firmaments (*ródasī*); ⌊even⌋ from the end of heaven he  
hath attained unto me (?); in the lap of the waters the buffalo  
increased.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 8. 1, and is also found as SV. i. 71 and  
in TA. vi. 3. 1. RV. and SV. read in **a** *yāti;* in **b** ⌊which  
occurs again as RV. vi. 73. 1 **d** also⌋, TA. has *āvír víśvāni* (for  
*ā́ ródasī*); in **c**, RV. has the far more acceptable reading *ántāṅ  
upamā́ṅ*, while SV. gives *ántād upamā́m* and TA. *ántād úpa mā́m;*  
⌊moreover, TA. accents *udā́naḍ*⌋. The AV. mss. are at variance in **c**;  
all read *ántāt* save our K., which gives *ántām;* the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
generally have *upamā́m* (K. -mā́n), and Bp. *upa॰mā́m;* but some (Op.D.,  
also T.) and two of SPP's *pada*-mss. have *úpa: mā́m*, with TA., and  
with the comm.; and this last is implied by the translation, though both  
editions adopt *upamā́m*, with SV. ⌊Pischel, *Göttingische Gelehrte  
Anzeigen*, 1897, p. 811, renders the verse.⌋

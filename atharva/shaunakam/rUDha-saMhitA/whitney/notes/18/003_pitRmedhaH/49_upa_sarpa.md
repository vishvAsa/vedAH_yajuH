## Translation
49. Approach (*upa-sṛp*) thou this mother earth (*bhū́mi*), the  
wide-expanded earth (*pṛthivī́*), the very propitious; the earth  
(*pṛthivī́*) \[is\] soft as wool to him who has sacrificial gifts; let  
her protect thee on the forward road in front.

## Notes
The RV., in the corresponding verse (x. 18. 10), reads *yuvatís* for the  
repetitious *pṛthivī́* in **c**, and, at the end of **d**, *nírṛter  
upásthāt;* and TA. (in vi. 7. 1) agrees in general with RV., but  
substitutes the ⌊modernized⌋ equivalent form *nírṛtyās;* it also has the  
real variants *dákṣiṇāvatī* in **c** ⌊and *upásthe* in **d**⌋. SPP.  
makes no remark on *ū́rṇamradās*, but three of our *pada*-mss. ⌊Bp.D.Kp.⌋  
have the blundering division *ū́rṇam॰mradāḥ*, and nearly all our  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (not R.) correspondingly *ū́rnaṁmradās:* the blunder  
grows, of course, out of the equivalence in grammatical theory of *mr*  
and *mmr*. The verse (according to the comm., vss. 49-51) is used ⌊Kāuś.  
86. 10⌋ with 2. 50 (see under that verse) in covering the bones.

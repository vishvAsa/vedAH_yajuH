## Translation
66. As, longing with the heart, they looked upon thee, flying up\*  
\[as\] an eagle in the firmament (*nā́ka*), golden-winged messenger of  
Varuṇa, busy (*bhuraṇyú*) bird (*śakuná*) in the lair of Yama.

## Notes
The RV. has the verse (x. 123. 6), and it is found also in SV. (i. 320  
and ii. 1196), TB. (in ii. 5. 8⁵), and TA. (vi. 3. 1); all read alike  
throughout, save that the RV. (not the SV.) pada-text has the bad  
division and accent *abhí: ácakṣata*. Our P.M.O. have at the end  
*bhuraṇyám*. It is noteworthy that vss. 65 and 66, which have no  
apparent connection with funeral rites, and are not used by Kāuś. save  
in the group 61-67, are found almost together (separated only by our 3.  
7) also in the funeral collection of TA. \*⌊W's "up" for *úpa* may be an  
oversight: render perhaps 'they looked upon thee, flying onward (*úpa*)  
\[as\] an eagle'? Our comm., taking 'thee' as the dead man, construes,  
'flying unto the eagle'; but is not the verse addressed rather to Agni?  
cf. Griffith and comm. on TA.—Sāyaṇa, commenting on the RV. vs., says  
*he vena;* but in his comm. on TB. he says *he pravargyasvāmin:* an  
interesting diversity of opinion! Perhaps RV. ix. 85. 11 may throw light  
on our verse.⌋

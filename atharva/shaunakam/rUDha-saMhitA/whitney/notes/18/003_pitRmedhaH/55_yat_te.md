## Translation
55. What of thee the black bird (*śakuná*) thrust at, the ant, the  
serpent, or also the beast of prey (*śvā́pada*), let the all-eating  
⌊*viśva-ád*⌋ Agni make that free from disease, and the soma that hath  
entered the Brahmans.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 16. 6 without variant. TA. has it also, in vi. 4. 2.  
TA. reads in **c** ⌊for *viśvā́d* ('all-consuming') *agadám*, the  
curiously perverted⌋ *víśvād* ('from every') *anṛṇám* ⌊which is glossed  
by *sarvasmād upadravād ṛṇarahitam upadravarahitam*⌋. In **d** it has  
*brāhmaṇám* (also, in the printed ⌊Calc.⌋ text, *āvivíśeṣa;* but its  
comm. ⌊Calc.⌋ explains *brāhmaṇe* and *āviveśa*); ⌊in the Poona ed. the  
comm. seems to show an alternative reading, either *brāhmaṇe* or  
*brāhmaṇam*, glossed by *etadīye brāhmaṇaśarīre;* and it reads of course  
*āviveśa*⌋. ⌊Our *pratīka* is cited by Keśava, p. 368¹⁰, as *yat te  
kṛṣṇaḥ śakunīty ṛcā:* is *śakunī* a blunder? cf. *idáṁ yát kṛṣṇáḥ  
śakúnis*, vii. 64. 1, 2.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
In Kāuś. the verse is used (80. 5) in the very introduction of the  
*adhyāya*, before the handling of the corpse begins; and Keśava says it  
is in case the man dies of the bite of a crow or ant or the like; the  
comm. makes the same condition, and adds that the wounded place is to be  
burned with fire; this is then probably the meaning of Kāuśika's  
direction *ity avadīpayati*. The verse appears again (83. 20) in  
connection with the strewing and covering of the bone-relics.

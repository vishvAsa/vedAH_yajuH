## Translation
25. Let Indra with the Maruts protect me from the eastern quarter;  
arm-moved \[is\] the earth, as it were to the sky above; to the  
world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice, whoever of you are here,  
sharing in the oblation of the gods.

## Notes
⌊As for this whole passage, vss. 25-37, see my introductory notes, p.  
847, ¶ 8, and Caland's orientation of it in his *Todtengebräuche*, p.  
154.⌋ This is a very curious and obscure refrain (its last two pādas  
occur again as refrain of 4. 16-24). In **b**, *bāhucyútā*(which ought  
to mean 'by a mover, or a moving, of arms') is rendered as if it were  
*bāhúcyutā;* ⌊Weber proposes to emend to *-tām;*⌋the comm. also takes  
*-cyutā* as past pass. pple., glossing it by *vinirgatā*, or, in an  
alternative explanation, by *prāptā:* either "proceeded out from the  
arms of the givers" or "arrived in the arms of the receivers"; the  
allusion being to the giving of land to Brahmans: "as land given  
protects in the future (*upári*) the heavenly world which is to be  
enjoyed by both parties"! The use by the *sūtras* casts no light upon  
the meaning. Vāit. (22. 3) prescribes the verse for use with an offering  
to the Maruts in the *agniṣṭoma* ceremony ⌊doubtless on account of the  
word *marutvān*⌋. In Kāuś. (81. 39), this verse alone, so far as appears  
⌊but the comm., p. 152⁵, says vss. 25-29⌋, is combined with 1. 41-43  
etc. to accompany the offerings to Sarasvatī at the funeral pile; again  
(85. 26), vss. 25-37 (the comm. says, 25-35) are used with 2. 24, 26,  
etc. in connection with the interment of the bone-relics. ⌊This last use  
does indeed perhaps cast light on the passage. The previous *sūtra*, 85.  
25, with Caland's emendation (l.c., p. 154), reads: *edam barhir*  
\[xviii. 4. 52\] *ity* *asthitas tanuṁ yathāparu saṁcinoti*. I think  
his emendation receives support from the AV. comm., who says, at vol.  
iv., p. 224⁶, *edam barliir ity ṛcā kule jyeṣṭho ‘sthīni yathāparu  
saṁcinuyāt*. If we take *sam-ci* in the sense of 'assemble' as used in  
the phrase 'assemble the interchangeable parts of a bicycle or a Waltham  
watch,' our *sūtra* would then mean, 'while repeating xviii. 4. 52, he  
(the dead man's eldest son) assembles a human figure (*tanum*), limb by  
limb, from the bones (*asthi-tas*), *i.e.* he makes such a figure out of  
the bones by assembling them.'—If this be right, then we probably have  
to infer from the AV. text and from the next *sūtra*, 85. 26, that the  
eldest son addresses the deities with vss. 25-29, and does so as  
spokesman of his dead father, represented by the prostrate figure of  
bones; and that, while uttering vss. 30-35, he addresses his dead  
father, but does so as speaking for himself.—-As to forming a human  
figure (*puruṣākṛti*) with the bones, cf. further Bāudhāyana's  
*Pitṛmedhasūtra*, i. 10, especially lines 5, 7, 10, 13 of p. 15, ed.  
Caland.⌋

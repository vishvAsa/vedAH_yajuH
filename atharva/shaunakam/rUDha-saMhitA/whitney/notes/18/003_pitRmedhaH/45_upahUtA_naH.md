## Translation
45. Called unto \[are\] our delectable (*somyá*) Fathers, to dear  
deposits on the *barhís;* let them come; let them listen here; let them  
bless, let them aid us.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 5, which differs only by omitting the  
meter-disturbing *nas* in **a**. Other texts (VS. xix. 57; TS. ii. 6.  
12³; MS. iv. 10. 6) agree with RV.; but TS. combines *té avantu* in  
**d**. ⌊Our **d** recurs at TB. ii. 6. 16².⌋ The use of the verse in  
Kāuś. and Vāit. is the same as that of vs. 44. The comm. glosses  
*nidhíṣu* by *nidhīyamāneṣu haviḥṣu*.

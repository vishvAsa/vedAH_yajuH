## Translation
48. The true, oblation-eating, oblation-drinking ⌊ones⌋, that \[go\] in  
alliance (*sarátham*) with the gods, with strong (*turá*) Indra—come  
hitherward, O Agni, with the beneficent, exalted (*pára*), ancient  
seers, sitting at the *gharmá*.

## Notes
The RV., in the corresponding verse (x. 15. 10 **a, b, d**, 9 **c**)  
⌊see under our vs. 47⌋, reads *dádhānās* in **b** for *turéṇa*, and  
*pitṛ́bhis* in **d** for *ṛṣibhis*—which again all our mss. save one  
(Op.), but of SPP's only one, accent *ṛṣíbhis* (as in 47 **d**) ⌊see my  
note marked with a \* under 47⌋. In **c** (see under vs. 47), MS. reads  
*arvā́k* (but its *pada*-ms. *arvā́n*), ⌊while TB. (ii. 6. 16²) reads as  
AV. RV.⌋. The verse is used in Kāuś. only with its predecessor, which  
see.

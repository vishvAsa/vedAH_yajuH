## Translation
17. They overpass defilement (*riprá*), wiping \[it\] off in the metal  
bowl (? *kasyá*), assuming further on newer life-time, filling  
themselves up with progeny and riches; then may we be of good odor in  
the houses.

## Notes
⌊Pāda **c** = RV. x. 18. 2 **c**.⌋ The translation boldly assumes that  
*kasyá* is a corruption of, or equivalent to, *kaṅsá;* the Pet. Lexx.  
pass the word without notice; the comm. says that *kasa* means *kīkasa*  
'vertebra,' the *kī* being dropped by Vedic license (!), and that  
*kasya*, as an adjective derived from it, means "the place of  
cremation"! All authorities read *kasyé* without variation, ⌊save that  
SPP's *śrotriya* K., whose memory of this book was not perfect, recited  
kásye⌋. ⌊See note\* below.⌋ The authorities are divided, however,  
between *mṛjā́nās* and *mṛ́jānās* (among those having the latter are our  
O.R.); both editions give the former, though it is an isolated  
accentuation; *mṛjāná* is regular (and occurs in RV.), while *mṛ́jāna* is  
supported (*Gram.* §619 d) by the analogy of several other such  
participles; ⌊cf. note to vs. 73⌋. Two of our three *pada*-mss. (Bp.Kp.)  
have *āyuḥ॰dádhānās* in **b** as compound, and most of our  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (all save O.R.) accent accordingly *āyur d-*; but SPP.  
acknowledges the reading in only a single ms. (*pada*), and of course  
gives in his text (as we in ours by emendation) *ā́yur d-*. The comm.  
regards *surabháyas* in **d** as figurative, for *ślāghyaguṇayuktās*. In  
Kāuś. (84. 10) the verse is directed to be used as the women go three  
times round (the relics of the funeral pile) leftwise, with disheveled  
hair and beating the right thigh.  
  
\*⌊According to Caland, WZKM. viii. 369, the passage in Kāuś. 84. 8-11  
describes the curious rite named *dhuvana* or 'fanning' of the  
bone-relics: see his *Todtengebräuche*, pages 138-9, and cf. my note to  
vs. 10, above. The *dhuvana* is part of the procedure called *nidhāna*  
or 'laying to rest' (ibidem, p. 129). According to the *sūtra* next  
preceding 84. 10, an empty pot, *rikta-kumbha*, is set down, and beaten  
with an old shoe. According to our AV. comm. (p. 143¹⁷ but see SPP's  
note 5), our verse is repeated by the one who breaks the empty jar,  
*rikta-kalaśa*, on the night of the day of cremation, that is, at a time  
a good deal earlier than the *nidhāna!*—However that may be, it does  
seem as if our *kasyé* might well mean the same thing as the *kumbha* or  
*kalaśa* of the ritual authorities.⌋

## Translation
6. Whom thou, O Agni, didst consume, him do thou extinguish again;, let  
there grow here the *kyā́mbū*, the *śāṇḍadūrvā́*, the *vyàlkaśā*.

## Notes
RV. (x. 16. 13) has the same verse, but calls two of the plants  
*kiyā́mbu* and *pākadūrvā́*. *Vyàlkaśā* (p. *ví॰alkaśā*) might well be an  
adjective, 'free from *alkaśa*' or the like, if we only knew what  
*alkaśa* meant. ⌊W's Op.R. accent *vyalkaśā́:* and so five of SPP's  
authorities, against four with *vyàl-*.⌋ TA. disagrees with both AV. and  
RV. in reading at vi. 4. 1 *kyāmbū́s* ⌊both ed's⌋, but agrees with RV. in  
having *pākadūrvā́*, ⌊and with both ed's of AV. in accenting *vyàlkaśā*⌋;  
it reads *jāyatām* for *rohatu* in **c**, and *tvám* for *tám* in  
**b**.—The comm. explains *śāṇḍadūrvā* as *dūrvā* ('millet') that  
springs up near water, having egg-shaped roots, or that has long joints,  
and adds that it is called "big millet" (*bṛhaddūrvā*); but this is  
probably without authority. With as little reason he glosses *alka* by  
*śākhā* 'branch,' and declares *vyalkośa* to mean "furnished with  
various (*vividha*) branches"; ⌊so also the comm. on RV. and on TA.⌋.  
The verse is not directly quoted by Kāuś., but (as was pointed out  
above) it is regarded by the comm. ⌊and the Paddhati⌋ as included with  
vss. 5 and 60 in 82. 26, and probably with justice.—This verse and its  
successor in RV. and TA. (strangely removed to be 3. 60 in AV.) are both  
plainly intended as remedial and expiatory for the cruel office of Agni  
in burning a corpse; the fire is not only to be extinguished, but to be  
followed by its antithesis, the growth of water-plants and the  
appearance of their attendant frogs: compare Bloomfield in AJP. xi.  
342-350 ⌊or JAOS. xv., p. xxxix⌋. ⌊This expiatory and remedial rite is  
avouched for antiquity by MBh. viii. 20. 50 = 819: *Pāṇḍyaḥ...svadhām (=  
pretaśarīrarūpaṁ haviḥ) ivā ”pya jvalanaḥ pitṛpriyas (= śmaśānāgniḥ)*  
*tataḥ praśāntaḥ salilapravāhataḥ;* and a note to the P. C. Roy version  
of this passage, p. 65, says that it persists even to this day in  
India.⌋

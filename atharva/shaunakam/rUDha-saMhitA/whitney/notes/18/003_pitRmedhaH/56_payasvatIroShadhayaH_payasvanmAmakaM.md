## Translation
56. Rich in milk are the herbs; rich in milk is my milk; what is the  
milk of the milk of the waters, therewith let one beautify (*śubh*) me.

## Notes
⌊The translation implies (instead of the *śumbhantu* of the Berlin text)  
the reading *śumbhatu*, which is read by most of SPP's authorities and  
some of W's and adopted by SPP. Two or three of SPP's, and W's Op., have  
*śumbhata* (a blend of AV. *śumbhatu* and RV. *śundhata?*). For the  
misuse of *śumbh* for *śundh*, see note to vi. 115. 3.⌋ The  
corresponding verse in RV. is x. 17. 14, which has *vácas* instead of  
*páyas* at end of **b**; for **c**, the less repetitious *apā́m páyasvad  
ít páyaḥ*, and at the end *śundhata*. TS. (in i. 5. 10²) and TB. (in  
iii. 7. 4⁷) have again a quite different version: namely, for **b**,  
*páyasvad vīrudhām páyaḥ;* for **c**, our **c**; for **d**, *téna mā́m  
indra sáṁ sṛja*. Ppp. also has the verse ⌊in xx.⌋ with *vacas* in **b**.  
Its former half appeared above, as iii. 24. 1 **a, b**, likewise with  
*vácas*. In Kāuś. (82. 9), it is used in the ceremonies of the first day  
after cremation, with strewing tufts of *kuśa*-grass; the comm.,  
however, says instead that it accompanies a bath taken immediately after  
the cremation of the dead body. The comm. supplies Varuṇa, as god of the  
waters, for subject of the concluding verb.

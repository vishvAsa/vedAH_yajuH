## Translation
46. They who, our father's fathers, who \[his\] grandfathers, followed  
after (? *anu-hā*) the soma-drinking, best ones—with them let Yama,  
sharing his gift of oblations, he eager with them eager, eat at  
pleasure.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 8 (and VS. xix. 51, which has the same text with  
RV.); this, however, reads for **a**: *yé naḥ pū́rve pitáraḥ somyā́saḥ*.  
In **b** our text gives, with RV. VS. *anūhiré* (RV. p. *anu॰ūhiré*),  
but it is by emendation, for all our mss. have *anujahiré* or  
*anūjahiré*, p. *anu॰jahīré;* ⌊the actual details seem to be as follows:  
*anujahiré* is given by Bp.P.D., while O.Op.R. have *anujahīré;* and  
*anūjahiré* is given by Bs.M.T., while K. has *anūjahīré*.⌋ ⌊SPP's  
authorities show the same four varying forms of the word:⌋ he reads  
*anūjahiré*, p. *anu॰jahiré*, although the majority ⌊five⌋ of his  
*saṁhitā*-authorities and the comm. have the preferable *anujah-* ⌊as  
against three with *anūjah-*⌋. Our translation implies the manuscript  
reading, though it is plainly a corruption of what RV. gives. ⌊Whether  
we read *anujahiré* (from *anu-hā*) or *anūhiré* (from *anu-vah:*  
Sāyaṇa, *ānupūrvyeṇa...dattavantaḥ;* Mahīdhara, *anuvahanti;* Weber,  
'welche nachgezogen sind'), in either case the sense is about the same.⌋  
The comm. treats the word as if it came from root *hṛ: anukrameṇa  
haranty ātmasāt kurvanti*. It looks a little as if the text-makers had  
in mind the root *jeh*, found in the next verse. The use of the verse  
with its two predecessors in Kāuś. was noted under vs. 44. It is very  
unsuitably reckoned by the Anukr. a jagatī, having only one real  
*jagatī* pāda; ⌊it scans perfectly as 12 + 11: 11 + 11; the corruption  
*anujahire* gives **b** 12 syllables, but no true *jagatī* character⌋.  
⌊W's version of **c** accords with Geldner's at *Ved. Stud.* i. 170  
note.⌋

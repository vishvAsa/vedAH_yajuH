## Translation
60. Let the mist be weal for thee; let the frost fall down \[as\] weal  
for thee; O cool one, possessing cool ones; O refreshing one, possessing  
refreshing ones; mayest thou be with weal a she-frog in the waters;  
kindly pacify thou this fire.

## Notes
Or, 'this Agni.'—Of the ritual use of this verse, the comm. simply says  
that with it one is to sprinkle the bones of a Brahman with the plants  
referred to, dipped in water and milk; Kāuś. (82. 26) combines it with  
3. 5 ⌊doubtless rather 3. 5 and 6: see under 3. 5⌋, in the manner  
explained under that verse. ⌊Partly because W. overlooked some TA.  
variants, it seemed necessary for me to rewrite the next paragraph; but  
I could not easily indicate my changes and additions by the usual  
ell-brackets.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The main stock of this verse (pādas **c-f**) is RV. x. 16. 14 and is the  
third verse of TA. vi. 4. 1: in both these texts it stands next after  
the verse which corresponds to our 3. 6 above, namely after RV. x. 16.  
13 = TA. vi. 4. 1²: see note to 3. 6. Considering how closely it is  
connected with our 3. 6 in sense and in position in those texts, it is  
strange that it should be so removed from 3. 6 in AV.—In **d** part of  
the mss. (including our Bp.P.M.I.: also the comm.) read *hlā́dake  
hlā́dak-*; TA. has *hlā́duke hlā́duk-*. For **e**, RV. has *maṇḍūkyà sú sáṁ  
gamaḥ* (of which our version, p. *maṇḍūkī́: ap॰sú: śám: bhuvaḥ*, is no  
better than a corruption), and TA., again differently, *maṇḍūkyàsu* (as  
an adjective, supplying *apsu*) *saṁgamáya;* and the comm., finally,  
*maṇḍūkyā ’sya śam bhava:* moreover, for the *śám* of both ed's, some of  
our mss. (O.Op.R.) and one of SPP's have *sám*. In **e**, at the end,  
RV. has *harṣaya* and TA. *śamáya:* our *śamaya* is better than  
either.—To the main stock of the AV. verse are prefixed two pādas which  
agree nearly with the second half of the next verse but one in TA. (vs.  
5: interposed as vs. 4 is matter that corresponds to our i. 6. 4 and  
xix. 2. 1, 2): but for our *bhavatu* the TA. has varṣatu; and for our  
*śáṁ te pruṣvā́*, it has *śám u pṛ́ṣṭhā* (so Calc.: the Poona ed. accepts  
*pṛ́ṣvā* but gives *pṛṣṭhā* as variant): the comm. glosses *pṛṣvā* with  
*jalabinduḥ*,—For Bloomfield's discussion, see under vs. 6. Bergaigne  
comments on the verse, *Rel. Véd.* i. 84, note, ii. 472.

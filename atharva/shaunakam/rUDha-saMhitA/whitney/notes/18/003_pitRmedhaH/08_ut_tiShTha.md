## Translation
8. Rise thou, go forth, run forth; make thee a home (*ókas*) in the sea  
\[as\] station; there do thou, in concord with the Fathers, revel with  
soma, with the *svadhā́s*.

## Notes
The first half-verse is found also in TA. (in vi. 4. 2) which has the  
easier ending *paramé vyòman;* the second half of the TA. verse is our  
vi. 63. 3 **c, d**. The majority of our *saṁhitā*-mss. combine *dravó  
’kaḥ* in **a-b**, but SPP. reports nothing of the kind from his  
authorities. The verse can be forced down to forty syllables (as a  
*pan̄kti*) by violence in **c**; ⌊its natural scansion is as 8 + 11: 11 +  
11⌋. It is one of the *utthāpanī* or 'uplifting' verses, which, with the  
*hariṇīs* or 'taking' verses, are used more than once in Kāuś., and are  
cited in Vāit. (37. 23-24) and elsewhere, in connection with lifting and  
moving the corpse etc. This one accompanies (Kāuś. 80. 31) the raising  
of the corpse to carry it to the funeral pile, and later (80. 35), with  
1. 61 and 3. 9 and others, the lifting on to the cart and removing; and  
yet later (82. 31) the gathering up and carrying away the bone-relics.

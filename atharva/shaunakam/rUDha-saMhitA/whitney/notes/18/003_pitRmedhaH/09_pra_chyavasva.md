## Translation
9. Start (*cyu*) forward, collect (*sam-bhṛ*) thy body; let not thy  
limbs (*gā́tra*) nor thy frame (*śárīra*) be left out; enter together  
after thy mind that has entered; wherever in the world thou enjoyest,  
thither go.

## Notes
The first half-verse and the last pāda are found also, as parts of  
different verses, in TA. vi. 4. 2; which, however, reads *út tiṣṭhā́ ’tas  
tanúvaṁ sám bharasva mé ’há gā́tram áva hā mā́ śárīram*, and *yátra  
bhū́myāi vṛṇáse tátra gaccha*. Some of our mss. (P.M.O.R.T.K.) accent  
*ánu* in **c**; and some (all except O.Op.R.K., also two of SPP's) have  
*bhū́me* in **d**; the comm. reads *bhū́māu*. According to Kāuś. (80. 32),  
the dead body, after being raised (*utthāpay-*) with the preceding  
verse, is made three times to set forth (? *saṁhāpay-*; *sam-hā* means  
usually simply 'get up': it is added, "as many times as it is raised")  
with this one; and this verse is used again, with the preceding verse  
(under which see) and others, in 80. 35 and 82. 31.

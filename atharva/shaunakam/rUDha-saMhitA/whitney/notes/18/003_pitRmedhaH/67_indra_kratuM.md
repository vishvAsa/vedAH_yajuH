## Translation
67. O Indra, bring us ability (*krátu*), as a father to his sons; help  
(*śikṣ*) us in this course (*yā́man*), O much-invoked one; may we,  
living, attain to light.

## Notes
The verse is RV. vii. 32. 26, found also as SV. i. 259; ii. 806, and TS.  
vii. 5. 7⁴; the only variant anywhere is that TS. has *no as-*,  
unlingualized, in **c**. The comm. glosses *yā́mani* with  
*saṁsāragamane*, and *śíkṣa* by *anuśādhi*.

## Translation
54. Go thou forth, go forth by roads that go to the stronghold  
(*pūryā́ṇa*), as (*yénā*) thy Fathers of old went forth; both kings,  
reveling with *svadhā́*, shalt thou see, Yama and god Varuṇa.

## Notes
Or *svadháyā* may be 'at their pleasure' or 'according to their wont.'  
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 14. 7) has in **a-b** *pathíbhiḥ  
pūrvyébhir yátrā naḥ pū́rve pitáraḥ pareyúḥ*, and, in **c**, *rā́jānā* and  
*mádantā;* and MS. (in iv. 14. 16) agrees with it except in reading,  
with our text, *páretās* ⌊in **b**, and in having *pūrvébhis* in **a**⌋.  
Our comm. reads *rājānā* in **c**. Prāt. iii. 83 prescribes the *ṇ* in  
*pūryā́ṇāis* (p. *pūḥ॰yā́nāiḥ*); the comm. absurdly explains the word as =  
*pumāṅso yena...yanti!* for the *pūr*, compare x. 2. 28 ff.; xix. 17 and  
19. The Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical irregularity in the  
verse. ⌊It is due to the displacement of *pūrviébhis* by *pūryā́ṇāis:*  
the secondary character of the latter (occurring elsewhere only at 4. 63  
below) is palpable in more ways than one.⌋ Kāuś. does not quote the  
verse; but our comm. declares it to accompany the laying of the dead  
body on the cart (for transportation to the funeral pile).

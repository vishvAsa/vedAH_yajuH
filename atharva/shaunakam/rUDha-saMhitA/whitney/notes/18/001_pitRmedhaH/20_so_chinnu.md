title = "२० सो चिन्नु"

## Translation
20. She now, the excellent, rich in food, full of glory—the dawn hath  
shone for man (*mánu*), full of light (*svàr-*); since they have  
generated for the council \[as\] *hótṛ* Agni, the eager one, after the  
will (*krátu*) of the eager ones.

## Notes
This is RV. x. 11. 3, without variant. The comm. renders *kṣumátī* a by  
*mantrarūpaśabdavatī*, and *vidáthāya* (of course) by *yajñāya*, and  
understands *ánu krátum* as "for each several ceremony."

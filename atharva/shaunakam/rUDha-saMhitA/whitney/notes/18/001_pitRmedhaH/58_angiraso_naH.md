## Translation
58. The An̄girases, our *návagva* Fathers, the Atharvans, the Bhṛigus,  
soma-drinkers (*somyá*)—may we be in the favor of those worshipful ones,  
likewise in their excellent well-willing.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 14. 6, also VS. xix. 50, and in TS. ii. 6. 12⁶ all  
without variant; the second half is met with further at AV. vi. 55. 3  
⌊reading as here⌋; and in other verses of RV. and AV.: ⌊namely, RV. iii.  
1. 21; vi. 47. 13; x. 131. 7; AV. vii. 92. 1: but with *tásya  
yajñíyasya* instead of our plural⌋. It is used by Kāuś. (81. 36) in the  
cremation service ⌊with vss. 59-61 and 2. 1-3: see note to vs. 49⌋.

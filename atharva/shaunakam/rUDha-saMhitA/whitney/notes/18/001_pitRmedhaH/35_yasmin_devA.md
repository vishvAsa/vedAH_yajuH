title = "३५ यस्मिन् देवा"

## Translation
35. In whom the gods revel at the council, maintain themselves in  
Vivasvant's seat—they placed light in the sun, rays in the moon: the  
two, unfailing, wait upon (*pari-car*) the brightness (*dyotaní*).

## Notes
The verse is x. 12. 7, without variant. The comm. separates *yásmin*  
from *vidáthe*, supplying *agnāu* for the former to qualify (the RV.  
comm. does the same); perhaps rather *manmani* is to be inferred from  
the following verse. ⌊W. suggests by a note to his ms. as an alternative  
for **a**, 'In what council the gods revel.'⌋ Our comm. also explains,  
in **d**, *dyotaním* by *dyotamānam agnim*, and it reads *ajasram*,  
understanding it adverbially; *aktūn* in **c** is either *raśmīn* or  
*rātrīs*. ⌊This vs. and the next are discussed by Foy, KZ. xxxiv. 228.⌋

## Translation
44. Let the lower, let the higher, let the midmost Fathers, the  
soma-drinking (? *somyá*), go up; they who went to life (*ásu*),  
unharmed (*avṛká*), right-knowing—let those Fathers aid us at our calls.

## Notes
The verse is found, without variant, as RV. x. 15. 1, VS. xix. 49, and  
in TS. ii. 6. 12³, MS. iv. 10. 6. It is used twice by Kāuś. in the  
funeral book: once (80. 43) at the piling of the funeral pile, and once  
(87. 14), in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña*, at the digging of a pit for receiving  
certain offerings. Verses 44-46 appear together (87. 29) in the latter  
ceremony with the bringing in of certain water-pots ⌊i.e. the pouring in  
(of their contents)?⌋. In Vāit. (30. 14), vss. 44 and 45, with 51, and  
3. 44, 45, are prescribed to be repeated after the pouring of *surā*  
into a perforated vessel, in the *sāutrāmaṇī* ceremony; and again, vss.  
44-46 accompany (37. 23) the binding of a victim to the sacrificial post  
in the *puruṣamedha*.

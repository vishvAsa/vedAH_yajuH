## Translation
23. Send thou up the (two) fathers, \[as\] a lover, unto enjoyment  
(*bhága*). The welcome one (*haryatá*) desires to sacrifice; he sends  
from the heart; the bearer (*váhni*) speaks out; the merry one (?  
*makhá*) does a good work; the Asura shows might (*taviṣy*); he trembles  
with purpose (? *matī́*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is RV. x. 11. 6, without variant. It is extremely obscure, and  
the general sense, as well as the meaning of several words, is in a high  
degree doubtful; the translation given is no more than mechanical. ⌊Cf.  
Weber, p. 829.⌋ The 'two fathers' (parents) are declared by the comm.,  
probably rightly, to be heaven and earth; *jāras* is explained as  
*ādityas*, and *ā* as = *iva*. Or, alternatively, *jāras* is "praiser,"  
coming from *jarā* "praise," and to **a** is to be supplied *hvayati*.  
The *iṣyati* is made = *icchati;* *vahni* is Agni; *makhas* is  
*makhasādhano maṅhanīyo vā;* *taviṣyate* is *vardhiṣyate*. All this is  
of interest only as showing that no help is to be obtained from the  
native exegetes.

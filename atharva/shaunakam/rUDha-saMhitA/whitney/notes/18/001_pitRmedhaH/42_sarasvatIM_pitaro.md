## Translation
42. On Sarasvatī do the Fathers call, arriving at the sacrifice on the  
south; sitting on this *barhís* do ye revel; assign thou to us food  
(*íṣas*) free from disease.

## Notes
Here again the RV. version (x. 17. 9 **a, b**, 8 **c, d**) makes the  
meter good by inserting ⌊or rather (cf. vs. 59), by not omitting⌋ *yā́m*  
in **a** before *pitáras* (and hence accenting *hávante*\*); it also  
accents *dakṣiṇā́* in **b**, as other texts do; two of our mss.  
(O.s.m.Op.) do the same, with the majority of SPP's, whence the latter  
adopts *dakṣiṇā́* in his edition; it is undoubtedly the correct reading  
⌊as is explicitly stated also by the comm. to xix. 13. 9, page 325²¹⌋.  
RV. also avoids the change of subject in the second line by reading  
*mādayasva* in **c**. \*⌊It is interesting to note that SPP's C^(P)  
accents *hávante*, as if the missing *yā́m* were not missing: cf. my note  
about "blend-readings" under xiv. 2. 18, and the end of my note under  
xviii. 1. 39; also note to 4. 57.⌋

## Translation
38. For thou art famed for might (*śávas*), for Vritra-slaying, a  
Vritra-slayer; thou out-bestowest the bounteous with thy bounties, O  
hero.

## Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 24. 2, and without variant, if, with SPP., we  
read *śrutás* at end of **a**. Our text has *śritás*, with a part of the  
mss.; they vary between *śrutás* (our O.Op.D.R., and half of SPP's;  
also the comm.), *śritás* (our P.M.T., and two of SPP's), and *śṛtás*  
(our Bp.Bs.E.I.K.Kp., and three or four of SPP's authorities)—which last  
is doubtless only a careless variant of *śritás*. The translation given  
above implies *śrutás*. The comm. perhaps reads in **b** *vṛtrahatye  
’va*.

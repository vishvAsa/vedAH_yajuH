title = "४६ इदं पितृभ्यो"

## Translation
46. Be this homage today to the Fathers, who went first, who went after,  
who are seated in the space (*rájas*) of earth, or who are now in  
regions (*díś*) having good abodes (*suvṛjána*).

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 15. 2, which, however, reads in **b** *úparāsas*,  
and in **d** *vikṣú;* and with it in both respects read the  
corresponding verses in TS. ii. 6. 12⁴ and MS. iv. 10. 6; also VS. xix.  
68 (but this, with our E., has *námo ‘stu* in **a**). Ppp. also gives  
the verse in book ii., reading in **b** *ye parāsaṣ pareyuḥ*, and in  
**d** *suvṛjināsu vikṣu*. Some of our mss. (P.M.I.R.T.), and one of  
SPP's, agree with RV. in reading *úparāsas;* the comm. divides *u  
parāsas;* and our E. has *vikṣú*, while P.M. give *divikṣú*, and I.  
*prikṣú*. For the use of the verse in Kāuś. and Vāit. with vss. 44-45,  
see under 44; it also (or else, more probably, 4. 51: see under that  
verse) is prescribed alone (80. 51) to accompany the scattering of  
*darbha*-grass in preparing the funeral pile.

## Translation
53. Tvashṭar makes a wedding-car for his daughter; by reason of this,  
all this creation comes together; the mother of Yama, wife of great  
Vivasvant, being drawn about, disappeared.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The corresponding RV. verse (x. 17. 1) has *íti* for *téna* at beginning  
of **b**; and the comm. also reads *iti*. With the first half-verse  
compare iii. 31. 5 **a, b**, which is a sort of travesty of it. The  
second verse of the curious and obscure and much discussed (see  
Bloomfield in JAOS. xv. 172 ff.) bit of legend is found below, as 2. 33,  
as much out of all connection with its surroundings as this one here.  
Neither of the two is used by Kāuś. or Vāit. The comm. quotes a passage  
of eight verses from the Bṛhaddevatā in explanation of the legend.

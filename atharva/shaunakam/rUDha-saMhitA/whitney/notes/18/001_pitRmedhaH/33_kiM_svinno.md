## Translation
33. Why forsooth hath the king seized (*grah*) us? what have we done in  
transgression of (*áti*) his ordinance (*vratá*)? who discerns \[it\]?  
for even Mitra, swerving the gods, like a song of praise (*ślóka*), is  
the might also of them that go.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 12. 5, without variant. The second half-verse,  
especially the last pāda, is bafflingly obscure. The accent of *ásti*,  
as well as the absence of other construction for *mitrás*, strongly  
indicates that the whole of the second half-verse forms one sentence; in  
which case *vā́jas* is perhaps most probably a corruption. The comm.  
understands *rā́jā* in **a** as Yama, and *jagṛhe* as signifying his  
"acceptance" of offerings—which is very ill guessed; doubtless it is  
Varuṇa (so Ludwig; the RV. comm. makes it Agni). He then renders  
*juhurāṇás* most absurdly by *āhvayan*, ⌊saying that "the root *hvṛ*  
'crook' is here used in the sense of root *hū* 'call'"⌋. He reads in  
**d** (as do some of the mss., including our O.Op.R.) *yātān*, as accus.  
of the pple *yāta*, qualifying *devān* understood, rendering *devān  
abhigacchato no ‘smān rakṣitum!* and so on. The version of the line  
given above is of course mechanical only.

## Translation
18. The bull yieldeth (*duh*) milks for the bull with the milking of the  
sky (*dív*), he the unharmable son (? *yahvá*) of Aditi; everything  
knoweth he, like Varuṇa, by thought (*dhī́*); he, sharing the sacrifice  
(*yajñíya*), sacrificeth to the seasons that share the sacrifice.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is RV. x. 11. 1, whose only variant is *yajatu* for *-ti* in  
**d**. The comm. explains *vṛ́ṣā* as Agni, and *vṛ́ṣṇe* as the sacrificer,  
*dóhasā* as = *dohanasādhanena yajñādinā*, *yahvás* as *mahān* and  
qualifying *vṛ́ṣā* together with *ádābhyas*, while *ádites* means  
"indivisible" and qualifies *divás*, which is ablative: the general  
sense being that the god procures rain for his worshiper. His  
understanding of **c** agrees with the translation given above. Compare  
Pischel's version of the verse and general explanation of the RV. hymn  
in *Ved. Stud.* i. 183 ff.; his exposition is excessively ingenious and  
extremely unsatisfactory.

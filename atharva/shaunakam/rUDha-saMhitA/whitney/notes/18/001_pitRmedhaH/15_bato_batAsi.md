## Translation
15. A weakling (? *batá*), alas, art thou, O Yama; we have not found  
mind and heart thine; verily, another woman shall embrace thee, as a  
girth a harnessed \[horse\], as a twining plant (*líbujā*) a tree.

## Notes
RV. x. 10. 13 varies from this only by reading (as also our Bp.) in  
**d** *ṣvajāte*. The translation given of *kakṣyè ’va yuktám* agrees  
with the comm. (also the comm. to RV.), which renders *yuktam* by  
*svasambaddham aśvam*. Pāda **b** evidently alludes to 14 **c**, where  
Yama talks of his mind and heart. If *batás* is a genuine word (the  
metrical disarray intimates corruption), it looks like being the noun of  
which the common exclamation *bata* is by origin the vocative. The RV.  
Anukr. takes no notice of the defective meter; ours requires the verse  
to be read as only 40 syllables, which is possible (10 + 9: 10 + 11 =  
40); ⌊**c** and **d** are good *triṣṭubh* pādas and **b** has a  
*triṣṭubh* cadence⌋.

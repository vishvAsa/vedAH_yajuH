## Comment
⌊Of the eight "measuring-verses," 38-45, the first (vs. 38) is a true gāyatrī; the next six (39-44) are mere repetitions of vs. 38, with an ūha in the first pāda which sometimes spoils the meter; and the last (vs. 45) agrees in its last two pādas with the rest, but has a prior half which is true prose.⌋


⌊Of this hymn, only vs. 13 a, b and vs. 17 are found in Pāipp., in books xix. and xx. respectively. The ritual uses by Vāit. are naturally very meagre: namely, we find vss. 19-20 used once, and that in the puruṣamedha. On the contrary, all but about 18 of the 60 vss. are cited by Kāuç. (see under the verses). Bloomfield's Index may be corrected on page 410 by the insertion of vss. 1-3 (see under vs. 1). Verses 1-3 and 49 constitute, with verses from hymns 1 and 3, parts of an important ritual sequence of 11 verses, as noted under 1. 49. And verses 4-18, the anuṣṭhānīs, constitute (with the exception of vs. 10) another such sequence.⌋


⌊The provenience of the material of this hymn.—Whereas nearly all of the preceding hymn (all but 4 or 5 out of 61 verses) is found also in the RV., of this hymn, on the other hand, but little more than a third part (hardly 25 vss. out of 60) is RV. material. As elsewhere noted, the hymn begins with 3 vss. which form part of a ritual sequence (of 11 vss.) continuous with the last verses of the preceding hymn.

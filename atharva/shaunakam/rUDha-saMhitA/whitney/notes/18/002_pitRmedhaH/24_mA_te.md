title = "२४ मा ते"

## Translation
24. Let nothing whatever of thy mind, nor of thy life (*ásu*), nor of  
thy members, nor of thy sap, nor of thy body, be left here.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *mánas* to *mánasas*, as called  
for by the connection and by the meter. The Anukr. scans the verse as 6  
+ 8: 10 = 24. Bs.E. have *tanvā̀ḥ* in **c**. This verse, with 26 below,  
is used by Kāuś. (82. 29) in connection with gathering up the bones  
after cremation; with the same, and further with 3. 25-37, in connection  
(85. 26) with their interment. ⌊For its general purport, see Weber,  
*Sb.* 1894, p. 775, note 2.⌋

## Translation
14. Soma purifies itself for some; some wait upon (*upa-ās*) ghee; for  
whom honey runs forward (?), unto them do thou go.

## Notes
The 'go' in these verses is *gachatāt*, imperative of remoter or after  
action. The translation implies restoration in **c** of the RV. (x. 154.  
1) reading *pradhā́vati*, of which our *pradhā́v* (p. *pra॰dhāú*) *ádhi*  
seems only a blundering and unintelligible corruption. Some of our mss.  
(and one of SPP's) accent *pradhā́vadhi*. The comm. agrees with RV., and  
SPP. is not to be blamed for adopting, though against all the  
authorities save the comm., *pradhā́vati* in his text. TA. (which has our  
vss. 14, 17, and 16 following immediately after our 11-13, little as the  
two sets appear to have to do with each other) reads (in vi. 3. 2) with  
RV.

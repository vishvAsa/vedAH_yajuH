## Translation
52. I cover thee excellently with the garment of mother earth; what is  
excellent among the living, that with me; *svadhā́* among the Fathers,  
that with thee.

## Notes
The comm. does not scruple to take *bhadráyā* as used for *bhadrāyās*,  
and qualifying *pṛthivyā́s*. ⌊He treats *tán máyi* etc. as at xi. 7. 5,  
12, 14: cf. note to xi. 7. 12. Weber thinks this vs. is spoken by the  
heir of the dead man.⌋

## Translation
55. May life-time, having all life-time, protect thee about; let Pūshan  
protect thee in front on the forward road; where sit the well-doers,  
whither they have gone, there let god Savitar set thee.

## Notes
RV., in the corresponding verse (x. 17. 4), reads *pāsati* in **a**, and  
*té yayús* at end of **c** ⌊thus rectifying the meter in both places⌋;  
and TA. (in vi. 1. 2) agrees with it both times; the comm. also has  
*pāsati*. The verse is metrically irregular (10 + 11: 12 + 11 = 44);  
⌊but perfectly good in its RV. form (11 + 11: 12 + 11)⌋.

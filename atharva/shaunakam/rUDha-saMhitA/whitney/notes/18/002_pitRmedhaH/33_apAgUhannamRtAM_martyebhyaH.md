## Translation
33. They hid away the immortal one (f.) from mortals; having made one of  
like color, they gave her to Vivasvant; what that was carried also the  
two Aśvins; and Saraṇyū deserted two twins.

## Notes
Whether 'two pairs of twins' is meant is not altogether certain; but  
that would be strictly *dvé mithuné;* ⌊but see BR. v. 777, line 3⌋. The  
verb *abharat* does not mean 'bore,' in the sense of 'gave birth to,'  
though it might mean 'carried \[in her womb\],' and so might have a  
nearly equivalent value; our comm. renders it by *samabharat* or  
*udapādayat*. The third pāda means 'that substitute, whatever it really  
was,' though the usual version "when that was" (for *yát tád ā́sīt*) is  
not altogether impossible. The verse is RV. x. 17. 2, which differs only  
by reading in **b** *kṛtvī́* and *adadus* (for which our *-dhus* is a  
common corruption). It is properly inseparable from 1. 53 above; ⌊for  
bibliographical references, see under that vs.⌋. Kāuś. and Vāit. pass it  
unused, as they did 1. 53. ⌊The comm., with one or two of SPP's mss.,  
reads *amṛtān* in **a**.⌋

## Translation
34. They that are buried, and they that are scattered (*vap*) away, they  
that are burned and they that are set up (*úddhita*)—all those Fathers,  
O Agni, bring thou to eat the oblation.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Āp. (in i. 8. 7) has a verse analogous with this; the divisions there  
are ⌊*ye garbhe mamrus,*⌋ *parāstās, uddhatās*, and *nikhātās*. The  
comm. explains *paroptās* by *dūradeśe kāṣṭhavat parityaktāḥ;* but  
*uddhitās* by *saṁskārottarakālam ūrdhamdeśe pitṛloke sthitāḥ!* it  
evidently refers to exposure on something elevated, such as is practised  
by many peoples. The *pada*-text reads *úddhitāḥ*, undivided, by Prāt.  
iv. 63. The verse (according to Kāuś. 87. 22) is used, with 3. 47, 48  
and 4. 41, in the *piṇḍapitṛyajña* ceremony, to accompany the setting up  
of one of two lighted sticks (cf. under 1. 56) and piling fuel around  
it.

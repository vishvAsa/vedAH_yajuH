## Translation
47. They that departed unmarried \[but\] assiduous, abandoning hatreds,  
having no progeny—they, going up to heaven (*div*), have found a place  
(*loká*), ⌊they,⌋ shining (? *dī́dhyāna*) upon the back of the firmament.

## Notes
The comm. commits the absurdity of glossing *agru* by *agragāmin*, and  
*śaśamāná* ('assiduous': i.e. having faithfully performed their  
religious duties) by *śaṅsamāna* or else (from root *śaś* 'leap')  
*plutagamanaśīla!* It seems hardly possible to avoid taking *dīdhyāna*  
in **d** as meant for *dīdyāna;* the comm. renders by *dīpyamāna*. The  
mss. vary between *agrávas* and *ágravas*, none of ours that were  
collated before publication having the latter, which is the true accent  
⌊correct the Berlin ed.⌋, and is adopted by SPP. on the authority of a  
majority of his authorities (with which our O.Op.R.T. agree).

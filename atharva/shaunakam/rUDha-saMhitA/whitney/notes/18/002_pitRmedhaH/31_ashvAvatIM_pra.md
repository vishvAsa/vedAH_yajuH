## Translation
31. Pass forward \[over a stream\] rich in horses, which is very  
propitious, or, further on, an *ṛkṣā́ka*, more new; he who slew thee, be  
he one to be killed; let him not find any other portion.

## Notes
The first half-verse is extremely obscure, and its translation only  
mechanical; we may conjecture that its text is corrupt. Such a  
combination as *-vā: ṛkṣ-* (so all the *pada*-texts read) into *-vā  
rkṣ-* is contrary to grammatical rule, unauthorized by the Prāt., and  
unsupported, so far as I know, by any second case. Part of our  
*saṁhitā*-mss. (P.M.E.I.) have *-vā ṛkṣ-*, but that is equally abnormal;  
SPP. makes no mention of any such reading among his authorities.  
"Stream" is supplied to *aśvāvatīm* because Kāuś. (82. 10) prescribes  
the verse to be used, in the ceremonies of the first day after  
cremation, on crossing a stream, and *prá tara* naturally suggests it.  
*Āśvāvatīm* is unquestionably the AV. text; it is quoted as an example  
of long *ā* in such a position under Prāt. iii. 17. One may conjecture  
as a plausible emendation *áśmanvatīm prá tarayā suśévām* (cf. for  
*áśmanvatī* xii. 2. 26, 27; and our comm. reads here *taraya* for *tara  
yā́*). Then *ṛkṣā́ka* might possibly be a region or road ⌊beyond the  
river⌋ 'infested by bears' (*ṛ́kṣa:* so the comm.); the word *ṛkṣā́ka* is  
ignored by both Pet. Lexx. ⌊save in so far as this vs. is cited by the  
Major Lex. under *ṛkṣī́kā*⌋. ⌊Weber takes it as 'the milky way':  
*Festgruss an Roth*, p. 138.⌋ But it is of little use to speculate in  
such a case. SPP. reads in **c** *vadhyas*, with (as he reports) all his  
authorities save two; we also have both *va-* and *ba-* among our mss.,  
but I cannot specify all that favor the one reading or the other. The  
lacking syllable in **b**, not noticed by the Anukr., helps in its  
degree to indicate corruption of text.

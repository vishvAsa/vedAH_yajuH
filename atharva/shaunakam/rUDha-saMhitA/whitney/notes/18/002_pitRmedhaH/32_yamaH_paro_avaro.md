title = "३२ यमः परोऽवरो"

## Translation
32. Yama beyond, below Vivasvant—beyond that do I see nothing whatever;  
into Yama has entered my sacrifice; Vivasvant stretched after the worlds  
(*bhū́*).

## Notes
SPP. accents *páras* in **a**, and *vívasvān* in **a** and **d**, though  
the majority of his authorities have *parás*, and, in **a**, *vivásvān;*  
of our mss., only Op. has *páras* and in **a** *vívasvān;* but  
O.Op.R.T.K. have *vívasvān* in **d**. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
metrical irregularities (10 + 12: 11 + 11 = 44).

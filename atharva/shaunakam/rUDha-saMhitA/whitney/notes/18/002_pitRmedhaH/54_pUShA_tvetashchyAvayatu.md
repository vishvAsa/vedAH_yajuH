title = "५४ पूषा त्वेतश्च्यावयतु"

## Translation
54. Let Pūshan, knowing, urge thee forth from here—he, the shepherd of  
creation (*bhúvana*) who loses no cattle; may he commit thee to those  
Fathers, \[and\] Agni to the beneficent gods.

## Notes
The RV. has a corresponding verse (x. 17. 3), without variant. TA. (in  
vi. 1. i) has in **c** *dadāt* (as has our comm.), and at the end  
*suvidátrebhyas*. The mss. are somewhat equally divided in **c-d**  
between *-bhyo ‘gnír* and *-bhyo agnír;* our text adopts the latter;  
SPP., better, the former, with RV. and TA.

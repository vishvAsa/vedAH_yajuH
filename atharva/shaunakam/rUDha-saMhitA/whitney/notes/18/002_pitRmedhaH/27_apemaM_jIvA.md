title = "२७ अपेमं जीवा"

## Translation
27. The living have excluded this man from their houses; carry ye him  
out, forth from this village; death was the kindly messenger of Yama; he  
made his life-breaths (*ásu*) go to the Fathers.

## Notes
The verse is used in Kāuś. (80. 18) with an oblation to the fires, when  
preparing the body of the deceased for cremation. ⌊Note that the  
"messengers" or "men" of death or of Yama play a rôle in the Buddhist  
literature: see An̄guttara Nikāya, iii. 4 (35: p. 138), Devadūta Vagga;  
Jātaka, i., p. 138²⁴, and scholion; Journal of the Pāli Text Society,  
1885, p. 62.⌋

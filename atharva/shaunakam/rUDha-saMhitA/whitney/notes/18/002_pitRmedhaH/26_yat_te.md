## Translation
26. What limb of thine is put over at a distance, and what expiration  
\[or\] breath has gone forth upon the wind (?), let the associated  
(*sánīḍa*) Fathers, assembling, make that enter thee again, bit  
(*ghāsá*) from bit.

## Notes
With the first half-verse is to be compared vii. 53. 3 **a, b**. All the  
saṁhitā-mss. in **b** accent *vā́te*, save one of SPP's, *sec. manu;* and  
all our *pada*-mss. divide *vā́: te*, as if, after all, they thought *vā:  
te* intended. SPP's *pada*-mss. also divide *vā́: te* (only one of them  
is accented); he adopts *vā te*, on the authority of the one altered ms.  
⌊\[and the comm.⌋. To me *vā́te* seems rather the preferable reading,  
though there is not much to choose between the two. Our O. and two or  
three of SPP's authorities give *páretāḥ* ⌊plural: but no *pada*-ms. has  
*yé* to correspond⌋. Several of our mss., and the decided majority of  
SPP's authorities (except the *pada*-authorities: which, as he fails to  
report them, presumably have *-ḍāḥ*) read *sánīḍād gh-*; but of our  
*pada*-mss., all but one ⌊Op.s.m.⌋ give *sá॰nīḍāḥ*, and this SPP. adopts  
in his text, as do we. The comm. has *sanīlās;* in **b**, he reads  
*ye...paretāḥ*. The use of the verse with vs. 24 in Kāuś. was stated  
under vs. 24.

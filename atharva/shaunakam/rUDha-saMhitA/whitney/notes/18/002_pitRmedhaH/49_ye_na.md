## Translation
49. They that are our father's fathers, that are \[his\] grandfathers,  
that entered the wide atmosphere, they that dwell upon earth and heaven  
(*dív*)—to those Fathers would we pay worship with homage.

## Notes
The first half-verse is found again below as 3. 59 **a, b**. The verse  
is used (Kāuś. 81. 37) ⌊as the last one of eleven verses (see my note to  
xviii. 1. 49) which accompany the oblations offered to Yama and poured  
upon the corpse (comm., vol. iv., p. 115¹⁷: he says *iti dvābhyām*) in  
the cremation ceremony after the fire is lighted⌋.

## Translation
50. This time, verily, not further (*áparam*), seest thou the sun in the  
heaven (*dív*); as a mother her son with her hem (*síc*), do thou cover  
him, O earth.

## Notes
The last half-verse is RV. x. 18. 11 **c, d**, without variant (TA., in  
vi. 7. 1, has at the end *bhūmi vṛṇu*), and is also found below as 3. 50  
**c, d**. Kāuś. (86. 10) applies the verse, with 3.49 and 4. 66, in  
raising a pile over the interred bones; according to the comm. ⌊vol.  
iv., p. 115⌋, the pile is of an uneven number of sticks (*śalākā*) or  
bricks, and vss. 50-52 are to be used. ⌊Over "hem" W. interlines  
"skirt." "Border of the garment" says our comm., *celāñcalena*.⌋ ⌊As to  
this beautiful verse, see Weber, *Sb.* 1895, p. 861, and cf. the  
epilogue to the Iśā Upanishad, especially vss. 15, 16.⌋

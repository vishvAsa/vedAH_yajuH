## Translation
38. This measure do we measure, so that one may not measure further; in  
a hundred autumns, not before.

## Notes
That is, that there be no more such measuring for any of us till his  
hundred years of life are full. The comm. understands *yáthā ná mā́sātāi*  
⌊*Gram.* § 893 a⌋ as *yathā mā* ⌊= *mām*⌋ *nā ”sātāi, nā ”sīta, na  
prāpnuyāt!* Kāuś. uses the verse twice (85. 3, 12—unless in the *ce  
’mām* of sūtra three is disguised the beginning of vs. 39 or 41) in  
connection with the elaborate measuring out of the place of interment of  
the bone-relics. ⌊See Caland, *Todtengebräuche*, p. 145 and note 534.⌋

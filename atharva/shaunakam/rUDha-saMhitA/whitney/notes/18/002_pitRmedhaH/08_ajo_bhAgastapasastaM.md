## Translation
8. The goat is the share of the heat (*tápas*); heat thou that; that let  
thine ardor (*śocís*) heat, that thy flame (*arcís*); what propitious  
bodies (*tanū́*) are thine, O Jātavedas, with them carry him to the world  
of the well-doing.

## Notes
The RV. version of this verse has (x. 16. 4) *tápasā* in **a**; in this  
case, as seldom, the AV. reading is better. TA. (in vi. 1 . 4) also  
gives *tápasā*, and it ends differently: *vahe ’máṁ sukṛ́tāṁ yátra  
lokā́ḥ;* ⌊and it reads *ajó ’bhāgás*, which is explained by its comm. as  
*bhāgarahitaḥ*⌋. The comm. also has *tapasā*. Kāuś. (81. 29) directs the  
verse, with 2. 22 (some mss. say, with 2. 57), to be repeated while  
"binding a goat on the south," the *anustaraṇī* (as which, nevertheless,  
the goat is here meant) having been already laid, as a cow, on the body  
to be burned. ⌊But see Weber's treatment of the vs., *Sb.* 1895, p.  
847.⌋

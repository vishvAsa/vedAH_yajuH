## Translation
5. When thou shalt make him done, O Jātavedas, then commit him to the  
Fathers; when he shall go to that other life (*ásunīti*), then shall he  
become a controller (? *vaśanī́*) of the gods.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 16. 2, but RV. makes our 5 **a** and 4 **c** change  
places: see note to vs. 4. RV. has *yadā́* ⌊for our *yadó* = *yadā́ u*⌋ at  
beginning of **c**, and *áthā* at beginning of **d**. TA. (in vi. 1. 4)  
agrees throughout with RV. save in accenting *karási* in **a**. Both, of  
course, read *áthe ”m enam* in **b**; but this time the AV. mss. are as  
good as unanimous in the corruption of *īm* to *imám*, and both the  
published texts are compelled to read it; the Anukr., too, seems to  
ratify it, by calling the verse *bhurij;* the comm. has instead *idam*,  
and one or two of SPP's authorities follow it. The comm. explains  
*asunīti* by *asūn prāṇān nayati lokāntaram*, and hence *prāṇāpahartrī  
devatā;* and *devānām* by *svakīyānām indriyāṇām;* while *vaśanīs* is  
(*cakṣurādīndriyāṇāṁ*) *sūryādidevatāprāpakaḥ!* ⌊Weber deems the idea of  
getting the gods under your control to be an indication of lateness or  
possibly of Buddhistic influence: *Sb.* 1895, p. 845, and 1897, p. 597.⌋

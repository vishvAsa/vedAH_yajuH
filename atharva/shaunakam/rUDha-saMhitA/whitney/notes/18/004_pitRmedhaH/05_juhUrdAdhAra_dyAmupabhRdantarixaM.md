## Translation
5. The sacrificial spoon (*juhū́*) sustains the sky, the offering spoon  
(*upabhṛ́t*) the atmosphere; the ladle (*dhruvā́*) sustains ⌊*dhṛ*⌋ the  
earth, the support (*pratiṣṭhā́*); unto me (?) let the worlds,  
ghee-backed, heavenly (*svargá*), yield every desire for the sacrificer.

## Notes
The reading and sense at the beginning of **c** are very doubtful; the  
*pada*-mss. all give *prati॰mā́m*, as if it were accusative of *pratimā́;*  
most of the *saṁhitā*-mss. have *pratīmā́m* (our Bs. has *pratímā́m* ⌊!⌋,  
and P.M. *pratimā́m;* T. has *pratīmám*), and it is quoted in the comment  
to the Prāt. (ii. 35: so the ms.) as the same ⌊that is, I presume, in  
the form *pratīmām*⌋. SPP. emends to *prátī ’mā́m*, since, with his usual  
disregard of the accent, the comm. so reads, explaining *imām* as  
referring to *pṛthivīm;* our edition has *pratimā́m*, with the majority  
of our earlier mss. The translation implies *práti mā́m*, simply on  
account of superior intelligibility; doubtless the true AV. reading is  
*pratīmā́m*. Simply *práti* would rectify the meter, and give a yet  
better sense. The verse (13 + 11: 12 (11?) + 11 = 47) is, of course, no  
proper *jagatī*. This and the verse next following are used, according  
to Kāuś. 81. 7, as the sacrificial utensils are laid about and upon the  
body, to be burned with it.

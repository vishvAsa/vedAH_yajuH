## Translation
56. Wear (*bhṛ*) thou this gold, which thy father wore before; of thy  
father, going to heaven (*svargá*), do thou wipe off the right hand.

## Notes
The majority of mss. read *pitur* in **c**, some *pítur*, and hardly any  
(of ours, only Op.) *pitúr*. Many of ours have *mṛḍhḍhi* in **d**: see  
Prāt. i. 94 and note. The comm. strangely gives *pipṛhi* ⌊cf. xiii. 1.  
1, note⌋ in **a** (though *abibhar* in **b**!). According to Kāuś. 80.  
46, 47, the first half-verse is used as the manager takes with the right  
hand some gold worn by the deceased, smears it with ghee, and passes it  
to the eldest son; the second half-verse, as he makes him wipe off his  
(of course, the father's) right hand; the comm. states it thus: "with  
the first half he makes the oldest son heat (*ādipayet:* as if the comm.  
read in Kāuś. *ādīpayati* instead of *ādāp-*) in the fire gold found in  
the hand of the deceased; with the other half the son should wipe the  
deceased's hand."

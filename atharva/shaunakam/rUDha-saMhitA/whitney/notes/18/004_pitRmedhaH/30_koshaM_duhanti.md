## Translation
30. They milk a receptacle (*kóśa*), a jar with four orifices, *iḍā*  
\[as\] milch-cow rich in honey, in order to well-being; reveling  
refreshment, Aditi among the people, injure thou not, O Agni, in the  
highest firmament (*vyòman*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The first half-verse is found also in TB. iii. 7. 4¹⁶ and Āp. i. 13. 1,  
both of which read *útsam* for *kóśam*, *devī́m* for *dhenúm*, and  
*suvarvídam* for *svastáye*. The second half occurs in VS. (xiii. 49  
**c, d**), TS. (in iv. 2. 10²), ⌊MS., in ii. 7. 17, page 102¹⁵⌋, and TA.  
(in vi. 6. 1); they all agree in reading for **c** *ghṛtáṁ dúhānām  
áditiṁ jánāya*, for which our text is a corruption, capable of only  
mechanical translation. The comm., in **a**, still thinks of four of the  
holes in the hundred-holed vessel; *íḍā* is either the earth or the name  
of a certain cow. In the funeral ceremony of TA. (as above), our **c,  
d**, with ⌊the correspondent of⌋ our 36 **a, b** below as first half, is  
used next after our vs. 28, and for the same purpose. The Anukr. does  
not heed that the first two pādas are *jagatī*.

## Translation
47. O Sarasvatī, that wentest in company with the songs, with the  
*svadhā́s*, O goddess, reveling with the Fathers, assign thou to the  
sacrificer here a portion of refreshment of thousand-fold value,  
abundance of wealth.

## Notes
These three verses are a repetition of i. 41-43 ⌊see notes thereon⌋,  
quoted by *íti tisráḥ* in most mss., but written out by our O.R. (both  
accenting *dakṣiṇā́* in 46 **b**).

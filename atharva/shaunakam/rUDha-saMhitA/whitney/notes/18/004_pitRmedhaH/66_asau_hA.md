title = "६६ असौ हा"

## Translation
66. Thou yonder, ho! hither thy mind! as sisters (*jāmí*) a *kákutsala*,  
do thou cover him, O earth.

## Notes
The translation implies the evidently necessary emendation to *ásāu* in  
**a**; both editions give *asāú*, because this is read by all the mss.;  
the comm. understands the word as a vocative; it also reads the  
interjection as *hā*, while the *pada*-text gives *hāí*. It further  
glosses *jāmayas* ⌊alternatively⌋ with *bhaginyas*, and reads  
*kakutsthalam*, explaining it as *pradhānāvayavapradeśam*, and  
paraphrasing with *putrādīnāṁ śiraḥprabhṛtīny an̄gāni  
śītātapavātanivāraṇāya*. The Pet. Lexx. conjecture *kakutsala* to be a  
pet word for a little child. We had the third pāda above as 2. 50 **d**,  
51 **d**, and 3. 50 **d**. Kāuś. uses the verse (86. 10) with 2. 50 and  
3. 49 in the ceremony over the bone-relics. The comm. includes with it  
vs. 67.

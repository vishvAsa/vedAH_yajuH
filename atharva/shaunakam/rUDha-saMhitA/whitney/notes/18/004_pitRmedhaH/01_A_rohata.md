## Translation
1. Ascend to \[your\] generatrix, ye Jātavedases; by \[roads\] that the  
Fathers travel I make you ascend together; the offering-carrier, sent  
out, hath carried the offerings; united (*yuktá*), set ye him who hath  
sacrificed in the world of the well-doing.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation in **a** to *jātavedasas*, though all  
the mss., and hence both editions, read *jātáv-*; all, also, accent in  
**c** *havyavā́has*, and SPP. has that in his text; our edition makes the  
obviously necessary emendation to *-vāhás* ⌊cf. the opposite error in  
vs. 10⌋. All our *saṁhita*-mss. ⌊see Prāt. i. 94, note⌋ make in **c**  
the false combination *ávāḍh ḍh-*; SPP. says nothing of his, and both  
editions have correctly *ávāḍ ḍh-*. Our O.Op.R., and one of SPP's mss.,  
read in **c** *iṣitā́;* the comm. also has it, explaining it with  
*iṣitāny iṣṭāni*. The comm. also understands *jātavedasas* as vocative  
(probably, after his manner, simply disregarding the accent); he  
explains *janitrīm* as *svotpādikām araṇim;* and the Kāuś. (80. 23)  
takes the same view: *iti pṛthaś araṇīṣv agnīn samāropayanti;* but its  
correctness as original sense of the verse may be strongly questioned.  
The comm. explains *ā rohata* by *śaktyātmanā praviśata;* and describes  
the *samāropaṇa* as taking place "because of the absence of any further  
ceremonies to be performed by him, being now dead, by help of the  
fires." In the comm's *viniyoga* he says simply *araṇidvayam agnāu  
pratāpayet*. All this is in the case of a person who has died away from  
home. But vss. 1-15 are also used nearly at the end of the cremation  
ceremony (Kāuś. 81. 45), with the direction *ity āhitāgnim* (Keś. adds  
*upatiṣṭhate*), ⌊and the comm. fills out the direction thus: *citistham  
āhitāgnim pretam upatiṣṭheta*⌋. The verse, as a *triṣṭubh*, is redundant  
by a syllable ⌊in **a**, which is thus a good *jagatī*-pāda: and also by  
one in **d**, which, however, by reason of its *triṣṭubh* cadence, is  
neither one thing nor the other⌋.

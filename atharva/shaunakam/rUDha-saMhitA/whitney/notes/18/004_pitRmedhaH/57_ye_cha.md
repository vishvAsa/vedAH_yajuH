## Translation
57. Both those who are living and those who are dead; those who are born  
and those who are worshipful—for them let there go a brook of ghee,  
honey-streamed, overflowing.

## Notes
We had the second half-verse above as 3. 72 **c, d**, only with  
*śatádhārā* instead of *mádhudhārā*. The mss. are again at variance as  
to the accent of *kulyā;* and the majority also accent *madhúdhārā*, as  
if they had *śatádh-* in mind ⌊cf. end of note to 1. 42 above⌋.  
*Yajñíya* is a queer antithesis to *jātá*, and the comm. reads instead  
*jajñiyās*, explaining it as *jajñim utpattiṁ yānti gacchanti:* that is,  
*jajñi*—root *yā!* The comm. also understands in **d** *madhudhārās*, as  
object of *vyundatī*. A corresponding verse is found in TA. (in vi. 12):  
it omits the first *ca* in **a**; has at end of **b** the almost  
acceptable reading *jántyās* (it ought to be *jántvās*); offers in **c**  
the curious corruption *dhārayitum* for *kulyāi ’tu;* ⌊and accents  
*mádhudhārā* in **d**⌋. The schol. add the verse to 56, as used by Kāuś.  
80. 46; the Kāuś. uses it twice with 3. 72: see under that verse; in TA.  
it has an utterly different application, in the ceremony of turning  
loose the cow that was led with the corpse to the funeral pile.

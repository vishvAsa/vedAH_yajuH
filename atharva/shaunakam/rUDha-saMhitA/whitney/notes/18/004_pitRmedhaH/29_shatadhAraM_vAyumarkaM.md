## Translation
29. A hundred-streamed Vāyu, a heaven-finding sun (? *arká*), wealth, do  
those men-beholders look upon; whoso bestow (*pṛ*) and present  
(*prayam*) always, they milk a sacrificial gift having seven mothers.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 107. 4, which differs by reading *havís*  
at end of **b**, ⌊and *saṁgamé* at end of **c**⌋; it also reads *duhate*  
in **d** and puts the word after *dákṣiṇām;* the RV. hymn is one in  
praise of generous givers. *Nṛcákṣasas* in **b** might of course be gen.  
sing. (so Grassmann); both translators ⌊Grassmann and Ludwig⌋ take  
*saptámātaram* as 'mother of seven,' which is against the accent; the  
comm. takes it properly as possessive, but gives three different guesses  
at its value. The comm. takes *té* in **b** as 'for thy sake,' against  
the accent. Kāuś. does not quote the verse; the comm. says that it and  
the next are used together on watering the bone-relics with water  
falling from a vessel with a hundred holes; and these hundred holes it  
regards as referred to by the first word of the verse.

## Translation
3. Look thou happily (*sādhú*) along the road of righteousness, by which  
go the An̄girases, well-doers; by those roads go thou to heaven  
(*svargá*), where the Ādityas feed on honey; spread thou out upon the  
third firmament.

## Notes
The last pāda we had above as ix. 5. 8 **d**. Our O.Op.R., and one or  
two of SPP's mss., read *tébhyas* at beginning of **c**. The comm.  
explains *víśrayasva* in **e** by *viśritaḥ pratiṣṭhito bhava*. The  
metrical description of the Anukr. fits the verse, if we ⌊decline to  
make two of the three easy resolutions (in **c** and **d**) by which the  
verse reads as five good *triṣṭubh* pādas⌋.

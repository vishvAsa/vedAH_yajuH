## Translation
72. To Soma with the Fathers \[be\] *svadhā́* \[and\] homage.

## Notes
⌊Verses 71-87 are prose, except vs. 75, with regard to which see p. 869,  
¶5.⌋ These verses ⌊71, 72⌋ are found, in reversed order, in AśS. ii. 6.  
12. In VS. ii. 29 **a, b**, are found both, but with *svā́hā* in place of  
*svadhā́ námaḥ*, and the same in śśS. iv. 4. 1 and GGS. iv. 2. 39, except  
that in the latter *svāhā* precedes the datives. VS. accents *pitṛmáte*.  
⌊See also under vs. 74.⌋ In Kāuś. 87. 8, vss. 71-74 are combined in  
alternation with vss. 78-80 to accompany in (he *piṇḍapitṛyajña* the  
scattering downward of three handfuls of offering; and ⌊are used⌋ again,  
later (88. 2, 3, 4) in the same ceremony, with oblations. ⌊Verse 71 is  
employed by Vāit. (9. 8) in the *sākamedha*, and I suspect (see p. 869,  
¶7) that the *sūtra* intends vss. 72 and 73 also to be thus used: cf.  
also ĀpśS. viii. 13. 15, 16.⌋

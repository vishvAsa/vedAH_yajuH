## Translation
36. A thousand-streamed, hundred-streamed fountain, unexhausted,  
expanded upon the back of the sea, yielding refreshment, unresisting, do  
the Fathers wait on at their will (? *svadhā́bhis*).

## Notes
The first half-verse stands in VS. ⌊xiii. 49⌋ TS. ⌊iv. 2. 10²⌋ TA. ⌊vi.  
6. 1⌋ MS. ⌊ii. 7. 17, p. 102¹⁴⌋ as the first two pādas of a verse of  
which our 30 **c, d** above is second half; in all, the first word is  
*imám* followed in VS. MS. by *sāhasrám*, in TS.TA. by *samudrám*,  
before *śatádh-*; all of course omit the evidently intruded *ákṣitam*\*,  
and end **b** with *mádhye*, VS. having before it *sarirásya*, and  
TS.TA. *bhúvanasya*. Some of the mss. (including our O.⌊?⌋Op.R.K.) have  
in **d** the false accent *upā́sate*. The verse exceeds the proper  
measure of a *triṣṭubh* by the amount of *ákṣitam* in **a**. By Kāuś.  
(86. 5), it accompanies a sprinkling with water; ⌊Keś. says that it is  
the bones that are so sprinkled; so also the comm., who adds that it is  
done with a very leaky old dish (*sahasracchidra-pātra*): cf. Caland,  
l.c., p. 173. The sprinkling is part of the *dhuvana* ceremony, l.c., p.  
137.⌋ \*⌊The rationale of the intrusion becomes clear, I think, if we  
compare with our **a, b** the first pāda of iv. 27. 2, *útsam ákṣitam  
viácanti yé sádā*.⌋

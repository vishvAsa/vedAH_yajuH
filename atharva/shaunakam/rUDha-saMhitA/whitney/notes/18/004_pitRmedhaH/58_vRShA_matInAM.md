## Translation
58. There purifies itself the conspicuous bull of the prayers, the sun  
of days, lengthener out of dawns, of the sky (*dív*); the breath of the  
rivers hath made the jars to resound loudly; entering Indra's heart with  
skill.

## Notes
This is a verse out of one of the most formidable hymns of the RV.  
soma-book (RV. ix. 86. 19), and occurring also twice in SV. (i. 559; ii.  
171). In **b**, RV. reads *sómo áhnaḥ pratarītó ’ṣáso diváḥ;* in **c**,  
*krāṇā́* and *avīvaśat;* in **d**, *hā́rdi* and *manīṣíbhis;* with this  
SV. in general agrees, but has, with AV., *áhnām* and *uṣásām* in **b**,  
and *acikradat* in **c**; it is peculiar in reading *prāṇā́* (p.  
*pra॰ānā́*) at beginning of **c**; a corruption, doubtless, which is  
carried out to greater intelligibility in our *prāṇás*. The AV.  
corruption, of both sense and meter, in **b**, *pratárītā uṣ-*,  
supported by the *pada*-reading *pra॰tárītāḥ*, is very strange; of our  
mss., only three (O.K., supported by Op. *-tā: uṣ-*) have the correct  
*-to ’ṣ-*; of SPP's, according to his account, about half support *-to  
’ṣ-*, and he accordingly admits that reading into his text; we ought to  
have done the same by emendation. For *hā́rdim āviśán* (p. *ā॰viśán*)  
*man-*, the comm. reads *hārdima...aviśat...mau-*.⌋ What right the verse  
has here (or vs. 60, coming from the same RV. hymn) does not appear;  
neither Kāuś. nor the comm. uses it in the ritual; but the latter says,  
as if by way of excuse, that, as the Fathers enjoy the fruit of the  
soma-sacrifices which they have offered, soma is praised in the  
ceremonies for the Fathers. He explains the 'rivers' in **c** as the  
*vasatīvarī* waters. ⌊He says, p. 224²³, *vṛṣā matīnām ityādīnāṁ  
tisṛṇām* (vss. 58, 59, 60) *pitṛmedha eva kāṇḍokto viniyogo  
‘nusaṁdheyaḥ*, which is not clear to me: should it be *pitṛmedhakāṇḍa  
evokto?*⌋

## Translation
11. Burn (*tap*), O Agni, happily behind, happily in front; burn him  
happily above, happily below; being one, O Jātavedas, triply disposed,  
set him collectedly (*samyák*) in the world of the well-doers.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Cf . vs. 9.⌋ The adverbs translated 'behind' etc. might with at least  
equal propriety be rendered 'on the west,' 'on the east,' 'on the  
north,' and 'on the south.' Nearly all our mss. (not Bs.I.), and half of  
SPP's ⌊have the impossible⌋ accent jātávedas in **c**; and a few  
(including our O.R.) have at the end *lokám*. ⌊Although *samyág enaṁ*  
must pass for the true AV. reading, one cannot forbear to query whether  
it has not displaced an original *samyák táṁ*.⌋

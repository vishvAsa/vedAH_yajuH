## Translation
51. This *barhís* I bring forward for the Fathers; a living, higher one  
I strew for the gods; that do thou ascend, O man, becoming sacrificial;  
let the Fathers acknowledge thee who art departed.

## Notes
A corresponding verse is found in TA. (in vi. 7. 2), which reads in  
**a** *bharema*, for **b** *devébhyo jī́vanta úttaram bharema*, for **c,  
d** *táttvam ārohā́so médhyo bháva* ⌊Poona ed. *bhávam*\*⌋ *yaména tváṁ  
yamyà saṁvidānáḥ:* its text is plainly in part corrupt. *Bhávan* in  
**c** is an emendation, all our mss. save one (Op.), and the majority of  
SPP's, reading *bhavan*, as if mixing the word up with *bhava*,  
imperative. The comm. reads in **b** *jīvan*. Neither this verse nor its  
predecessor is to be called with any reason a jagati; but 50 **c, d**  
and 51 **c** have *jagatī* cadences⌋. This has the same *pratīka*, so  
far as concerns the first two words, as 1. 46, and it is impossible to  
tell which of the two verses is quoted by Kāuś.; but the comm. declares  
the first half of this one to be used as *darbha*-grass is strewn upon  
the wood of the funeral pile, and the second half as the corpse is laid  
supine upon the grass thus strewn: that is to say, this verse is  
intended in Kāuś. 80. 51; ⌊so also Caland, WZKM. viii. 368⌋. \*⌊The mss.  
vary between *bhavaṁ* and *bhava* and the TA. comm. understands  
*bhava*.⌋

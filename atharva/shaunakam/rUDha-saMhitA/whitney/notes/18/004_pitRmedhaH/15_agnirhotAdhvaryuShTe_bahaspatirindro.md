## Translation
15. Agni thine invoker, Brihaspati thine officiating priest, be Indra on  
the right thy supervising priest (*brahmán*); this offered sacrifice,  
being completed (*sáṁsthita*), goeth where is the ancient track of those  
offered.

## Notes
Both editions read in **c**, with nearly all the mss. (all ours save  
R.s.m., and half of SPP's), *hutó ‘yám*, but both are wrong, the  
emendation to *hutò ‘yám* being a matter of simple necessity (see note  
to Prāt. iii. 55). The verse is the last of the long passage that is  
used (by Kāuś. 81. 45) at the end of the cremation ceremony (see under  
vs. 1). It is far from being a regular *triṣṭubh;* ⌊after resolving  
*hotā adh-* in **a** and restoring in **c** the elided vowel, pādas  
**a** and **b** and **c** scan with smooth cadences as 12 + 11: 11;  
there remains pāda **d**, with one syllable missing before the cesura:  
it would be a faultless *triṣṭubh* if we dared to insert *ásti*  
(*yátrā́sti*): the comm. understands the equivalent *vidyate*⌋.

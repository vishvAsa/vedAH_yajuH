## Translation
44. This \[is\] the former, the after down-track, by which thy former  
Fathers went away; they who are the forerunners, the followers (?  
*abhiṣác*) of it, they carry thee to the world of the well-doing.

## Notes
Our reading *abhiṣā́cas* is an emendation, almost every ms. giving  
*abhiśā́cas* (our Op. has *abhi॰sā́caḥ*, and also one ⌊or two⌋ of SPP's  
authorities); *-ṣā́c-* is of course intended, and the comm. gives it.  
SPP's text follows the mss. The comm. explains *niyāna* as the wagon  
(*śakaṭa*) on which the corpse is carried to the funeral pile; and the  
'forerunners' and 'followers' as the oxen that draw it, in front and on  
all sides: which is doubtless not at all the true sense; he also reads  
*vahantu* in **d**. The verse is one of the *hariṇīs* ⌊Kāuś. 80. 35; 82.  
31 note⌋: see under 1. 61. It lacks (in **a**) a syllable of being a  
full *triṣṭubh*. Its second pāda is identical with 1. 54 **b**.

## Translation
16. Rich in cakes, rich in milk (*kṣīrá-*) let the dish (*carú*) take  
seat here; to the world-makers, the road-makers, do we sacrifice,  
whoever of you are here, sharing in the oblation of the gods.

## Notes
⌊The definition of verses 16-24 as 14: 12 + 11 = 37 is right by  
mechanical count; but the metrical character of what precedes the first  
*avasāna* is wholly misprized by the Anukr.: *carúr ā́ ihá sīdatu* is  
doubtless an *anuṣṭubh* pāda; and I am strongly tempted to suspect the  
loss (by haplography again: cf. iv. 5. 5, note) of a *ca* before *caru*,  
poor as the resulting cadence may be, so that instead of 14 we should  
have 8 + 8.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
We had the same refrain above, in 3. 25-35. ⌊Cf. my introduction to hymn  
3, p. 847, ¶8.⌋ According to Kāuś. (86. 3), the verses beginning with  
*apūpavān* (16-24) are used as, in each case, what is specified in the  
verse (*mantroktam*) is deposited in the quarters and intermediate  
quarters (*dikṣv aṣṭamadeśeṣu*); this is in the ceremony of interment of  
the bone-relics, next after the use of 4. 57 and 3. 72 (see under the  
latter). ⌊At this point Whitney compares TA. vi. 8 and cites part of it.  
The TA. leaves out the depositions in the intermediate directions, SE.  
etc., and so has only 5 deposition-*mantras* instead of 9. The matter is  
treated more fully just below.⌋ According to the comm., *caru* means  
specifically the contents of the dish here: *kumbhyām pakva odanaḥ;* and  
*ihá* signifies: *asmin saṁcayanakarmaṇy asthnāṁ samīpe  
paścimadigbhāge;* the others are set in the remaining half-directions,  
and one in the middle. ⌊Observe that the AV. begins the depositions with  
the west (so the comm., at p. 197⁸, and at 201¹⁶ just cited), while the  
TA. begins, as noted below, with the east.⌋  
  
    
⌊As part of the requisites for performing the *pitṛnidhāna*, Kāuś. (83.  
2) prescribes eleven dishes (*carūn*). According to Kāuś. 86. 2, two  
dishes (*carū*\*) are to be deposited, with our 4. 57 and 3. 72, near  
the head of the human figure formed with the bones (note to 3. 25);  
next, eight more (Kāuś. 86. 3) in the eight directions, with 8 vss. of  
our present sequence, that is, 4. 16-23; and then the eleventh and last  
dish in the center with our 4. 24, according to Kāuś. 86. 4, where we  
are to read (see under vs. 24) *madhye ‘pavantam* (for *pacantam*), 'in  
the center \[a dish\] with water.'⌋ \*⌊So we must read, with three of  
Bloomfield's mss., as Caland suggests, *Todtengebräuche*, p. 152, and as  
the AV. comm. makes plain at 224¹⁹ (*carudvayam*), though not at 176²³.⌋  
  
⌊TA. vi. 8 reads thus: *apūpávān ghṛtávāṅś carúr é ‘há sīdatū  
’ttabhnuván pṛthivī́ṁ dyā́m utó ’pári: yonikṛ́taḥ pathikṛ́taḥ saparyata yé  
devā́nāṁ ghṛtábhāgā ihá sthá: eṣā́ te yamasā́dane svadhā́ ní dhīyate gṛhè  
‘sāu: dáśākṣarā* \[:\] *tā́m rakṣasva* etc. etc.—This set of mantras is  
metrical as far as *gṛhé* inclusive, 7 (8?) + 8 + 12: 12 + 11: 8 + 8;  
then prose. It accompanies the deposition of the cakes with a dish of  
ghee to the east of the bone-relics, and is followed by four other sets,  
which are not given in full in TA., but may, with the help of Sāyaṇa, be  
reconstructed as ūhas of this set. The order of deposition is  
(strangely) *pradakṣiṇa*, that is, from E. to S. to W. to N. and center.  
In the first set (used at the east) the words to be replaced are  
*ghṛtávān, ghṛtábhāgās*, and *dáśākṣarā;* and they are replaced in the  
second set (south) by *śṛtávān, śṛtábhāgās*, and *śatā́kṣarā*  
respectively; in the third set (west), by *kṣīrávān, kṣīrábhāgās*, and  
*sahásrākṣarā;* in the fourth set (north), by *dádhivān, dádhibhāgās*,  
and *ayútākṣarā;* and in the fifth set (center), by *mádhumān,  
mádhubhāgās*, and *ácyutākṣarā*. Thus the mantra of the last set would  
begin *apūpávān mádhumān* etc., for the deposition of cakes is common to  
that of all the dishes (so AV. comm., p. 202⁵: *apūpasāhityaṁ sarveṣāṁ  
carūṇāṁ sādhāraṇam*).⌋

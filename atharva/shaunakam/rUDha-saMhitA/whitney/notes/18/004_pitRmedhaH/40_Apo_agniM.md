## Translation
40. O waters, send forth (*pra-hi*) Agni unto the Fathers; this  
sacrifice of mine let the Fathers enjoy; they who attach themselves unto  
a sitting refreshment, may they confirm to us wealth having all heroes.

## Notes
A corresponding verse is found in HGS. (in ii. 10. 6), reading thus:  
*āpo devīḥ pra hiṇutā ’gnim etaṁ yajñam pitaro no juṣantām: māsī ’mām  
ūrjam uta ye bhajante te* *no rayiṁ sarvavīraṁ ni yacchantu;* and the  
comparison appears to convict our unintelligible third pāda of being a  
very gross corruption. ⌊Observe that the word preceding *āsīnam* ends in  
*m*, and cf. the cases assembled under xviii. 2. 3.⌋ The comm. has no  
difficulty in explaining 'a sitting refreshment' as "a *piṇḍa* set upon  
the *barhis*." Both editions read at the end *yachān*, but all the mss.  
save one of SPP's read *yachāt;* the comm. has *-ān*. The Anukr. does  
not heed that the first pāda is *jagatī*. For the ritual application,  
see under the preceding verse. ⌊With **a**, cf. 2. 4 **d**, above.⌋

## Translation
88. Thee, O Agni, would we kindle, full of light (*dyumánt*), O god,  
unwasting; as that very wondrous fuel of thine shall shine in the sky  
(*dív*), bring thou food for thy praisers.

## Notes
The verse is RV. v. 6. 4, and occurs also as SV. i. 419 and ii. 372, and  
in TS. iv. 4. 4⁶ and MS. ii. 13. 7. All these agree together throughout,  
reading in **a** *te agna idh-* for *tvā ’gna idh-*, and in **c** *syā́*  
for *sā́*. SPP. reads in **c**, with the comm., *yád gha*, and makes no  
note upon it, implying that his mss. have the same; ours, however, give  
*yád dha* (p. *yát: ha*), in accordance with the other texts. All the  
mss. put an an *avasāna* between **d** and **e** ⌊i.e. after *dyávi*⌋,  
and the Anukr. supports it, whence SPP. has it in his edition; we left  
it out as being uncalled for, and wanting in the parallel texts. For the  
use of the verse in Kāuś. with 3. 42, see the note to the latter: cf. p.  
871, ¶3.

## Translation
9. Let the eastern fire burn (*tap*) thee happily (*śám*) in front; let  
the householder's fire burn happily behind; let the southern fire burn  
refuge, defense for thee; from the north, from the midst, from the  
atmosphere, from each quarter, O Agni, protect him round about from what  
is terrible.

## Notes
⌊Cf. vs. 11.⌋ As to the accent of *dakṣiṇāgnis* in **c**, see under vs.  
8. The funeral pile is separately, but simultaneously, kindled from each  
of the sacrificial fires. To make the verse *bhurij*, we have to commit  
the violence of scanning *agne* instead of *‘gne* in the last pāda (so  
12 + 10: 12 + 11 + 12 = 57). ⌊The *a* of *agnís* in **a** and that of  
*agne* in **e** are of course to be elided. The insertion of another  
*tvā* in **b** after *śám paścā́t* rectifies the meter. In **c** we have  
perhaps to tolerate 5 pre-cesural syllables; but with this reservation  
and the rectification in **b**, all 5 pādas are faultless *triṣṭubhs*.⌋

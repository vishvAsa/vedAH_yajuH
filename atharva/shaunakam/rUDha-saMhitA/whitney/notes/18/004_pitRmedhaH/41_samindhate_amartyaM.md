title = "४१ समिन्धते अमर्त्यं"

## Translation
41. They kindle the immortal one, oblation-carrying, ghee-loving; he  
knoweth the deposited deposits, the Fathers that are gone away to the  
distances.

## Notes
The comm., with his usual disregard of the accent, takes *ghṛtapríyam*  
as from *ghṛtá* + *priyá* ⌊*prītikaram ājyaṁ yasya*⌋. For the ritual use  
as prescribed by Kāuś. 87. 22, see under 2. 34, one of the verses that  
accompanies it. But the verse is used also, by Kāuś. 86. 18, at the end  
of the ceremony of interment on "making the devouring (*saṁkasuka*) fire  
blaze up"; this the comm. does not report in his statement of viniyoga.  
⌊Caland appears to be right in thinking that the *pratīka samindhate*  
means *samindhate saṁkasukam*, xii. 2. 11, and not our verse here. See  
under xii. 2. 11 and note the free use of vss. from xii. 2. in the  
sūtras immediately following 86. 18.⌋

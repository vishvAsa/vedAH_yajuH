## Comment
The Anukr. has some bad readings and confusions in its account of the book, but they do not concern things of much consequence. ⌊So Whitney, in a note to vs. 5, which note I have transposed hither. He had altered (as often, for brevity) the order of his excerpts from the Anukr.: but I have restored them in this case to the order of the original. Moreover, there are several trifling items which he has omitted or misapprehended: and these I have added or tried to set right without marking them with the usual ell-brackets.⌋


⌊Notes to the Anukramaṇī-excerpts. 1⌊The text begins, viṣāsahir ṛcas triṅçat, which is taken from the Old Anukr.: see p. 812.⌋ 2⌊As to the structure and count of vss. 1-5, see page 805, ¶ 4⌋ 3⌊Text reads simply udihīti dve asati sad atyaṣṭayaḥ: read ity aṣṭayaḥ? or, perhaps, ity atyaṣṭayaḥ? but see note to verse 7.⌋ 4⌊The statements concerning the try-avasāna verses are given in two instalments and are entirely correct, although the Berlin edition makes them seem partially incorrect: vss. 1-5 are 3-av. in both ed's; 6-8 and 10-13, 16, 18-19, 24 are 3-av. in the mss. and the Bombay ed. and are 4-av. in the Berlin ed.: see page 805, ¶ 5, above.⌋ 5⌊The text says aṣṭāu [should be pañca] ṣaṭpadāḥ, çeṣāḥ saptapadāḥ: 'the rest' (çeṣāḥ) are those that remain after taking out from the verses thus far discussed those verses (1-8[5], 9-10, 14-15, 17) the number of whose pādas has been already stated: and the Anukr. therefore means (after emending aṣṭāu to pañca), 'verses 1-5 are of 6 pādas, while the rest,—namely verses [6-8,] 11-13, 16, 18-19, 24,—are of 7 pādas'; and this is quite correct⌋ 6⌊See note to vs. 22 and cf. note to xvi. 8. 1.⌋


⌊Partly prose—verses 20-23: see ¶ 1, on this page.⌋


The hymn, or anuvāka, or book, occurs (except vss. 13, 14, 24) also in Pāipp. xviii., following immediately upon what represents our xvi.

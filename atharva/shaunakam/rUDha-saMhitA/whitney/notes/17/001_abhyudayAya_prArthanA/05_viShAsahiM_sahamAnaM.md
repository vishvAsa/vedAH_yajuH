## Translation
5. Indra of mighty power etc. etc. do I call: may I be dear to my  
equals (*samāná*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads ⌊in the above 5 verses⌋ every time *viṣāsahyam;* and, for  
**c-f**, *s. s. viśvajitaṁ svarjitam abhijitaṁ vasujitaṁ gojitaṁ  
saṁjitaṁ saṁdhanājitaṁ: īḍyaṁ nāma bhūyā indram āyuṣmān priyā bhūyāsam;*  
in the repetitions, *hūya* (in place of its previous *bhūyā*), and  
*indra devānāṁ priyo bhūyāsam*. Here, and everywhere else in the hymn,  
the comm. insists that by *indra* is intended the sun, and not Indra,  
quoting in proof of it TS. i. 7. 6³: *asāú vā ādityá índraḥ*. ⌊For the  
structure and count of the vss., see above, p. 805, ¶ 4.⌋

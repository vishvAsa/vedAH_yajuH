## Translation
20. Brilliant (*śukrá*) art thou; shiny art thou; as thou art shiny by  
the shining one (*bhrā́jant*), so may I by the shining one shine.

## Notes
The Ppp. text of this verse is in confusion. Our P.M.I.T. combine  
(second time) *bhrājò ‘si*, as if we had here, as the first time, *asi*  
(instead of *ási*). The first pāda is the same with the beginning of ii.  
11. 5. MS. iv. 9. 5 has passages resembling this verse and the next.  
This prose bit is a queer *kakubh:* ⌊the *kakubh* calls for 8 + 12 + 8 =  
28; and this may be read as 8 + 11 + 9⌋.

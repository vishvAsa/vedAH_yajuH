## Translation
30. Let Agni \[as\] guardian protect me all about; let the sun, rising,  
thrust \[away\] the fetters of death; out-shining dawns, firm  
mountains—let a thousand breaths abide (*ā-yat*) in me.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *gopaṣ pari*, transposes pādas **b** and **c**  
(corrupting to *vicchantīr*, and combining *uṣasaṣ p-*), and ends **d**  
with *mayu te ramantām;* and it then adds our xviii. 4. 49. The  
connection of our **c** is obscure; the comm. understands *mṛtyupāśān  
nudantām* or else *mām anugṛhṇantu:* the former is possible. ⌊The verse  
is to be read as 12 + 11: 12 + 11.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the first and sole *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 30 verses. The  
words *prathamo ‘nuvākaḥ* are not printed here in either edition, but  
are found in several of W's mss. The quotation from the Old Anukr. is  
*ity etat samanukrāntam ṛcas triṅśad "viṣāsahiḥ."*⌋  
  
⌊Here ends also the thirty-second *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

## Translation
13. What body of thine, O Indra, is in the waters, what on the earth,  
what within the fire; what of thine, O Indra, is in the heaven-gaining  
(*svarvíd*) purifying one (*pávamāna*); with what body, O Indra, thou  
didst permeate (*vi-āp*) the atmosphere—with that body, O Indra, bestow  
thou protection upon us.—Thine, O Vishṇu etc. etc.

## Notes
In nearly all our mss. (all save D. and R.p.m.) *vyāpitha* (p.  
*vi॰āpitha*) is most strangely left unaccented, and the reading was in  
our text emended to *vyā́pitha*, in accordance with the invariable  
accentuation of such forms in RV. and AV. elsewhere. But a minority of  
SPP's authorities are reported by him as accenting *vyāpithá*, and he  
accordingly prints *vyāpithá* in his edition (our D.R.p.m. have the  
same). The 'purifying one' is doubtless here the wind (*vāyu:* so  
comm.). The verse (12 + 16: 12 + 12: 34 = 86) counts two more syllables  
than a proper *prakṛti*.

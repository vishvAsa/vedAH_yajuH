title = "२१ रुचिरसि रोचोऽसि"

## Translation
21. Brightness art thou, bright art thou; as thou by brightness art  
bright, so may I by both cattle and Brahman-splendor be bright (*ruc*).

## Notes
Our P.M.T. have again (second time) *rocò ‘si;* ⌊and one of SPP's  
*pada*-mss. has correspondingly *asi* without accent⌋. The MS. version  
is in some respects better: *rucír asi rucò* (or *rocyò*) *‘si sá yáthā  
tváṁ rucyā́ rócasa evám aháṁ rucyā́ rociṣīya*. Ppp. also gives *rociṣīya*.  
⌊For *ruciṣīya* or *roc-*, see *Gram.* § 907.⌋ The metrical definition  
of the Anukr. is absurd, the "verse" being prose, and having only three  
possible divisions; it can be made 36 syllables by reading *roco asi*  
either in **a** or in **b**. It is used in Vāit. 14. 2, in the  
*agniṣṭoma* ceremony.

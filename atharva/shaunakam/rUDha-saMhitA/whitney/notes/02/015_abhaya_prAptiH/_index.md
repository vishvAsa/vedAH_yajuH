## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. vi., but in a much fuller form, with thirteen verses, of which our six are, in their order, vss. 1, 4, 3, 7, 12, 13; the others deal with wind and atmosphere, cow and ox, Mitra and Varuṇa, Indra and Indra's might (indriya), hero and heroism, breath and expiration, and death and immortality (amṛtam); after bibher is added in vs. 1 evā me ’pāna mā riṣayā, and, at the end of the hymn, the same, but with riṣa for riṣayā. In Kāuś. (54. 11), the hymn is used, with vi. 41, at the end of the godāna ceremony, on giving food to the boy. It is also counted by the schol. (ib., note) to the āyuṣya gaṇa. The comm. makes no reference to the godāna rite, but declares the use to be simply by one desiring long life (āyuṣkāma).

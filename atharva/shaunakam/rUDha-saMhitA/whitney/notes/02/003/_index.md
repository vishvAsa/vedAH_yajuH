## Comment
This hymn in Pāipp. also follows the one that precedes it here; but in Pāipp. vss. 3 and 6 are wanting, and 4 and 5 are made to change places; and vs. 1 is defaced. Kāuç. employs it only once (25. 6), in a healing rite for various disorders and wounds (jvarātīsārātimūtranāḍīvraṇeṣu, comm.), with i. 2.

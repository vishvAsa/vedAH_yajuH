## Translation
2. From *jambá*, from *viśará*, from *víṣkandha*, from scorching  
(*abhiśócana*), let the *jan̄giḍá*, the amulet of thousand-fold valiance  
(*-vīryà*), protect us about on every side.

## Notes
*Jambhá* is perhaps 'convulsion,' or lockjaw; at Ppp. xi. 2. 10 it is  
mentioned with *hanugraha;* below, at viii. 1. 16, it is called  
*saṁhanu* 'jaw-closing'; the comm. gives two discordant and worthlessly  
indefinite explanations. *Viśará* should signify something crushing or  
tearing to pieces; Ppp. xi. 2. 3 names it with *vijṛmbha;* the comm.  
says *śarīraviśaraṇāt.* Ppp. has of this verse (see under vs. 1) only  
the second half, and combines *maṇis sahasravīryaṣ pari naṣ p-.*

## Translation
1. In order to length of life, to great joy, we, taking no harm, all the  
time capable (*dakṣ*), bear the *jan̄giḍá*, the *víṣkandha*-spoiling  
amulet.

## Notes
Ppp. has 1 **a, b** with 2 **c, d** as its first verse; very possibly  
the two half-verses between have fallen out in the ms.; it has in **b**  
*ṛṣyambho ṛkṣamāṇā* (for *rakṣ-*) *s-*. The comm. has *rakṣamāṇās* also;  
it is the better reading. The comm. gives no further identification of  
*jan̄giḍa* than that it is "a kind of tree" (adding *vārāṇasyām  
prasiddhaḥ*, 'familiarly known at Benares'!); he defines *viṣkandha* in  
the same manner as above, to i. 16. 3.

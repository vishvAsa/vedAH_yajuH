## Comment
Found (except vs. 5, and in the verse-order 2, 3, 1, 4) in Pāipp. i. The same four verses are found in TS. (iii. 2. 81-3: in the order 2, 4, 3, 1), and the first three in MS. (ii. 3. 8; in the order 1, 3, 2). The hymn is used by Kāuç. (38. 22) in a rite intended, according to the comm., to prevent faults of vision (dṛṣṭidoṣanivāraṇāya; Keçava says "to prevent rain," vṛṣṭinivāraṇāya; perhaps his text is corrupt), accompanying the eating of something in an assembly. Its employment (59. 21) with the hymn next preceding was noticed under the latter. The comm. (differing in his reading and division of the rules from the edited text of Kāuç.) declares it to be used in all the sava sacrifices, to accompany the purastād homas (59. 23-4: uttareṇa savapurastāddhomān); and vs. 5 is used (3. 16) with a purastād homa in the parvan sacrifices. In Vāit. the hymn appears (9. 7) in the cāturmāsya sacrifice, with two oblations to Mahendra and Viçvakarman respectively; and again (29. 22) in the agnicayana. In all these applications there is nothing that suits the real character of the hymn.

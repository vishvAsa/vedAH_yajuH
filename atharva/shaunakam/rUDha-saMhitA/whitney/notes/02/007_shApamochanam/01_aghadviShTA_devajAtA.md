## Translation
1. Hated by mischief, god-born, the curse-effacing plant hath washed  
away from me all curses, as waters do filth.

## Notes
Āp. (vi. 20. 2) has a verse much like this: *atharvyuṣṭā devajūtā vīḍu  
śapathajambhanīḥ: āpo malam iva prā ’ṇijann asmat su śapathāṅ adhi.* The  
comm. explains *-yopanī* in **c** ⌊discussed by Bloomfield, AJP. xii.  
421⌋ as *vimohanī nivārayitrī.* The comm. states *dūrvā* (*panicum  
dactylon*) to be the plant intended, and the Anukr. also says *dūrvām  
astāut.* In our edition read in **d** *máchap-* (an accent-sign slipped  
out of place). The Anukr. refuses this time to sanction the not  
infrequent contraction *málam ’va* in **c**.

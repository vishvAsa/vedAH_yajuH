## Translation
8. I set thy track in kindled Jātavedas; let Agni dispose of (? *viṣ*)  
the body; let speech go unto breath (? *ásu*).

## Notes
The verse is in part obscure; the comm. sets it in connection with one  
of the details of the Kāuś. ceremony: "I set or throw in the fire the  
dust from thy track combined with chopped leaves: i.e. I roast it in the  
roaster; let Agni, through this dust entering thy foot, pervade or burn  
thy whole body"; he takes *ásu* as simply equivalent to *prāṇa*, and  
explains: *sarvendriyavyavahāraśūnyo bhavatu*, become incapable of  
acting for the senses: i.e. become mere undifferentiated breath—which is  
perhaps the true meaning. ⌊Quite otherwise A. Kaegi—citation in  
Bloomfield, p. 294.⌋ The Anukr. apparently expects us to resolve *ā́* at  
the beginning into *a-ā́*. Ppp. has in **a** *ā dadāmi*, and for **d**  
*imaṁ gachatu te vasu.* The last two verses are so discordant in style  
and content, as well as in meter, with the rest of the hymn that we can  
hardly consider them as properly belonging to it. Their omission, with  
that of the borrowed RV. verse (our 6), would reduce the hymn to the  
norm of this book.

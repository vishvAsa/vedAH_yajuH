## Translation
6. Whoso, O Maruts, thinks himself above us, or whoso shall revile our  
incantation (*bráhman*) that is being performed—for him let his  
wrongdoings be burnings (*tápus*); the sky shall concentrate its heat  
(*sam-tap*) upon the *bráhman*-hater.

## Notes
The verse is RV. vi. 52. 2, with sundry variants. At the beginning, RV.  
has the better reading *áti vā;* in **b**, *hriyámāṇaṁ nínitsāt;* for  
**d**, *brahmadvíṣam abhí táṁ śocatu dyāúḥ.* Ppp. follows RV. in **d**  
(but with *śoca* for *śocatu*); in **c** it reads *vrajanāni.* The comm.  
renders *vṛjinā́ni* falsely by *varjakāni bādhakāni.*

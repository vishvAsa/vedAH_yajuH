All the pada-mss. read at the end tapyámāne íti, as if the word were a dual fem. or neut.: a most gratuitous blunder; SPP's pada-text emends to -ne. Ppp. reads in d teṣu for tá ihá (which is, as in not infrequent other cases, to be contracted to té ’há; the Anukr. at least takes no notice of the irregularity here; but it also ignores the jagatī value of b). The comm. naturally explains the "wide-goer" as Vishṇu; he does not attempt to account for the mention of "the wide atmosphere" twice in the verse, though sometimes giving himself much trouble to excuse such a repetition. The last pāda he paraphrases by "just as I am endeavoring to destroy the hateful one, so may they also be injurers of [my] enemy, by not giving him place and the like": which is doubtless the general meaning.

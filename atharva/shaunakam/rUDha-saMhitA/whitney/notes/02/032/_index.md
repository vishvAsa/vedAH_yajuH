## Comment
This hymn occurs in Pāipp. ii. (with vs. 3 put last), next before the one that here precedes it. Kāuç. applies it (27. 21 ff.) in a healing ceremony against worms in cattle.


⌊The material appears in Ppp. in the order 1, 2 ab, 4 cdab, 5 ab, 6, 3 abc 5 d. The expression of Kāuç. 27. 22, "with the words te hatāḥ (vs. 5 d) at the end of the hymn," suggests the reduction of the hymn to the norm of the book, 5 vss. (see p. 37). This is borne out by Ppp., where the material amounts to 5 vss. and ends with our 5 d. But what the intruded portions are it is not easy to say. The parts missing in Ppp. are our 2 cd, 3 d, 5 c.⌋

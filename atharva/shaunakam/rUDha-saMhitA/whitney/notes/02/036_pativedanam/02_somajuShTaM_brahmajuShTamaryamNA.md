## Translation
2. Fortune enjoyed by Soma, enjoyed by Brahman, brought together by  
Aryaman; with the truth of divine Dhātar, the husband-finder I perform  
(*kṛ*).

## Notes
Ppp. has a mutilated first half-verse: *somajuṣṭo aryamṇā saṁbhṛto  
bhaga;* and at the end *patirvedanam.* The comm. understands in **a**  
*brahma-* to mean the Gandharva, who and Soma are the first husbands of  
a bride (xiv. 2. 3, 4). He does not see in *bhaga* anything but  
*kanyārūpam bhāgadheyam;* but the meaning "favors" is not impossible.  
  
⌊Both *bhagam* ("fortune" or "favors") and *pativedanam* (the ceremony  
called "husband-finder") are objects of *kṛṇomi;* which, accordingly,  
needs to be rendered by 'make' or 'procure' for the one combination and  
by 'perform' for the other. It is hardly a case of zeugma.—Bloomfield  
notes that *saṁbhṛta* contains a conscious allusion to *sambhala*, vs.  
1.⌋

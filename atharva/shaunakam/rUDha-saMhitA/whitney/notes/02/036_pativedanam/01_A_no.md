## Translation
1. Unto our favor, O Agni, may a wooer come, to this girl, along with  
our fortune (*bhága*). Enjoyable (*juṣṭá*) \[is she\] to suitors  
(*vará*), agreeable at festivals (*sámana*); be there quickly  
good-fortune for her with a husband.

## Notes
The text is not improbably corrupt. Ppp. reads in **a, b** *sumatiṁ  
skandaloke idam āṁ kumāryāmāno bhagena;* but it combines **c** and **d**  
much better into one sentence by reading for **d** *oṣaṁ patyā bhavati*  
(*-tu?*) *subhage ’yam.* The comm. explains *sambhalas* as *sambhāṣakaḥ  
samādātā vā;* or else, he says, it means *hiṅsakaḥ pūrvam  
abhilāṣavighātī kanyām anicchan puruṣaḥ.* He quotes ĀpGS. i. 4 to show  
that *vará* also means paranymph. *Juṣṭā́* he quotes Pāṇini to prove  
accented *júṣṭā*. In **d** he reads *ūṣam*, and declares it to signify  
*sukhakaram.* ⌊Bergaigne, *Rel. véd.* i. 159, takes *sámana* as =  
'marriage.'⌋

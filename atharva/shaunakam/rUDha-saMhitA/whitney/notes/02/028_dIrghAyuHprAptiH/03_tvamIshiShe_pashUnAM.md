## Translation
3. Thou art master (*īś*) of earthly cattle, that are born, or also that  
are to be born; let not breath leave this one, nor expiration; let not  
friends slay (*vadh*) this one, nor enemies.

## Notes
All the mss., and the comm., read at end of **b** *janítrās*, which SPP.  
accordingly retains, while our text makes the necessary emendation to  
*jánitvās*, which Ppp. also has. Ppp. ⌊omits *vā* in **b**;⌋ elides the  
initial *a* of *apāno* and *amitrāḥ* after *mo;* and it puts the verse  
after our vs. 4. Pāda **b** lacks a syllable, unnoticed by the Anukr.  
⌊read *jātā́sas?*⌋.

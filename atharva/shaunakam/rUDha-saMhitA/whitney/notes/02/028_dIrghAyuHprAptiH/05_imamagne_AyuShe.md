## Translation
5. This one, O Agni, do thou lead for life-time, for splendor, to dear  
seed, O Varuṇa, Mitra, king! like a mother, O Aditi, yield (*yam*) him  
refuge; O all ye gods, that he be one reaching old age.

## Notes
All the *pada*-mss. read at end of **b** *mitra॰rājan*, as a compound;  
and SPP. so gives it; the comm. understands *rājan* correctly as an  
independent word, but perhaps only as he in general is superior to the  
restraints of the *pada*-readings. Ppp. (in xv.) has *priyo* for *-yam*  
in **b**. The verse is found also in TS. (ii. 3. 10³), TB. (ii. 7. 7⁵),  
TA. (ii. 5. 1), and MS. (ii. 3. 4). All these give *kṛdhi* for *naya* at  
end of **a**; TA. MS. have *tigmám ójas* instead of *priyáṁ rétas* in  
**b**; TS. TB. MS. read *soma rājan* at end of **b**, while TA. offers  
instead *sáṁ śiśādhi;* all accent *járadaṣṭis* in **d**, and MS. leaves  
*asat* at the end unaccented. In śGS. (i. 27), again, is a version of  
the verse, omitting *naya* in **a**, reading (with MS.) *tigmam ojas*  
and *soma* in **b**, and having *aditiḥ śarma yaṁsat* in **c**. ⌊Von  
Schroeder gives the Kaṭha version, *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 72-3.⌋

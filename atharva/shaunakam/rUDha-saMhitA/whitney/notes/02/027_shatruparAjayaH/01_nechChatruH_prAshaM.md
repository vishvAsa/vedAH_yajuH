## Translation
1. May \[my\] foe by no means win (*ji*) the dispute; overpowering,  
overcoming art thou; smite the dispute of \[my\] counter-disputant; make  
them sapless, O herb.

## Notes
"Dispute" (*prā́ś*) is literally 'questioning.' The comm. renders the  
word in **a** by *praṣṭar* 'questioner,' but in **c** gives us our  
choice between that and *praśna* 'question,' and in 7 **a** acknowledges  
only the latter meaning. *Prátiprāśas* is translated here as genitive;  
the comm. takes it secondly as such, but first as accus. pl.; the Ppp.  
reading favors the latter: *sā ’mūn pratiprāśo jaya rasā kṛ-.* With  
either understanding, the accent is anomalous; we ought to have  
*pratiprā́śas.* *Arasā́n* also is in favor of the plural. If we could  
emend *prā́śan* in **c** to *prāśí* 'in the disputation,' it would make  
things much easier. For **a** Ppp. has *yaś catrūn saṁjayāt.* *Néd* in  
**a** is simply the emphasized negative.

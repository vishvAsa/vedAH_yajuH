## Translation
4. Indra consumed (*vi-aś*) the *pāṭá*, in order to lay low the Asuras:  
smite the dispute etc. etc.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. reads in **a** *pāṭhām*, and uses that form in all his  
explanations; *pāṭām* seems to be given in all the mss., and in Ppp.,  
and both editions adopt it; but the mss. are very little to be trusted  
for the distinction of *ṭ* and *ṭh.* "The plant is the *Clypea  
hernandifolia*, whose bitter root is much used. It grows all over India,  
and is said to be applied to ulcers in the Penjab and in Sindh (W.  
Dymock, *Vegetable mat. med.*)" (R.). ⌊In his note, Roth gives *pāṭām*  
as Ppp. form; but in his collation, he gives as Ppp. reading in **a, b**  
*pāyam indro*⌋ *vyāṣṇān hantave as-.* The Anukr. apparently expects us  
to resolve *vi-ā-śn-āt* in **a.**

## Translation
7. Acting like a bull, he chose the soma; he drank of the pressed  
\[draught\] in the *tríkadrukas;* the bounteous one (*maghávan*) took  
his missile thunderbolt; he slew that first-born of dragons.

## Notes
RV. (and TB.) combines in **a** *-ṇo ‘vṛṇīta*, and some of the mss.  
(including our O.) do the same. The comm. understands the *trikadrukas*  
as the three *abhiplava* days. ⌊For **d**, rather, 'smote him, the  
first-born of dragons.' The difference is, to be sure, only a rhetorical  
one.⌋  
  
    
In the first anuvaka, ending here, are included 5 hymns, of 29 verses;  
the old Anukr. says: *pañcarcādye* (i.e. 'in the first division of the  
5-verse book') *viṅśateḥ syur navo ”rdhvam.*

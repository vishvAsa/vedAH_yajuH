## Translation
5. Now will I proclaim the heroisms of Indra, which first he of the  
thunderbolt (*vajrín*) did; he slew the dragon (*áhi*); he penetrated to  
the waters; he split ⌊forth⌋ the bellies (*vakṣáṇā*) of the mountains.

## Notes
Verses 5-7 are RV. 1. 32. 1-3; and found also in TB. (11. 5. 4¹⁻²); vss.  
5 and 6 further in MS. iv. 14. 13, and vs. 5 in SV. (i. 613): in these  
texts without any variant from the RV. reading; they all have in 5 **a**  
*prá*, and put *vīryā̀ṇi* before it. Ppp. also offers no variants from  
our text. SPP. reads *prā́* in **a**, with all the mss. ⌊except our O.⌋,  
and our text should have done the same. The comm. renders *ánu* in **c**  
by *tadanantaram*, and *tatarda* by *jihiṅsa!* also *vakṣáṇās* in **d**  
by *nadyas.*

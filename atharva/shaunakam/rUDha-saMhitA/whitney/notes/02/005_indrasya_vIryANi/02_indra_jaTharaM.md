## Translation
2. O Indra, \[thy\] belly—like one to be praised—fill thou with the  
sweet \[draught\]—like the heavens—with this soma—like the sky  
(*svàr*)—; unto thee have gone the well-voiced intoxications.

## Notes
The omission of this verse in Ppp. is perhaps only an accidental one,  
due to the scribe. The first interpolation in the other texts is *návyaṁ  
ná;* to get a sense, Weber boldly emends to *nāvyaṁ na* 'like \[the  
hold\] of a vessel'; the comm. explains by *nūtanas* (*anenā ”darātiśaya  
uktaḥ!*), taking no heed of the accent—which, however, requires to be  
changed to *návyas*, whichever sense be given it; perhaps *nadyò ná*  
'like streams,' would be most acceptable. In the third interpolation,  
SV. combines *svàr ná* and AśS. śśS. *svàr ṇá;* and the mss. vary  
between the two; our edition reads the former, with the majority of our  
mss.; SPP. has the latter, with the majority of his; one or two of ours  
corrupt to *svàr mó ’pa.* The three other texts have at the end  
*asthus.* The comm. takes *divás* as gen., supplying *amṛteṇa* to govern  
it; and he takes *svàr* as of locative value. The Anukr. scans the verse  
as 8 + 8: 8 + 10 = 34 syllables.

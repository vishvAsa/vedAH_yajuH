## Translation
1. O Indra, enjoy thou—drive on;—come, O hero—with thy two bays;—drink  
of the pressed \[soma\]—intoxicated here—loving the sweet \[draught\],  
fair one, unto intoxication.

## Notes
Ppp. omits the three interpolations (as Weber reports certain  
Sūtra-works to assert of the Atharvan texts in general), and reads  
*indra juṣasva yāhi śūra pibā sutaś śa a madhoś cakāna cārum madathaḥ.*  
The second interpolation in AśS. is *harī iha*, apparently to be read as  
*harī ’ha*, for which then SV. and śśS. give the senseless *háriha*. The  
third, in all the three other texts, is *matír ná* ('like a wise one'?);  
the translation above implies the heroic (or desperate) emendation of  
*matér ihá* to *mattá ihá* (to be read *matté ’há*); Weber conjectures  
*máder ha.* AśS. and śśS. have the older *madhvas* for *madhos*. The  
comm. has no notion of the peculiar structure of these verses: as,  
indeed, he has no phraseology in his vocabulary to suit such a case; he  
explains *mates* first as *mananīyasya*, then as *medhāvinas;* and  
*cakānas* as either *tarpayan* or *stūyamānas.* The Anukr. implies that  
the second half-verse scans as 8 + 11 syllables, instead of 9 + 10.

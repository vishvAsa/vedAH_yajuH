## Comment
Found in Pāipp. i. (only in the nāgarī copy). Called by Kāuś. (8. 24), with vi. 111 and viii. 6 (and the schol. add iv. 20: see ib., note), mātṛnāmāni 'mother-names' (perhaps from the alleged author); they are employed in a remedial rite (26. 29: "against seizure by Gandharvas, Apsarases, demons etc." comm.), and several times (94. 15; 95. 4; 96. 4; 101. 3; 114. 3; 136. 9) in charms against various portents (adbhutāni). And verse 1 is allowed by Vāit. (36. 28) to be used in the aśvamedha sacrifice as alternative for one given in its text (27). Further, the comm. quotes the mātṛnāman hymns from the śānti Kalpa (16) as accompanying an offering in the sacrifice to the planets (grahayajña); and from the Nakṣ. Kalpa (23) in the tantrabhūtā mahāśānti.

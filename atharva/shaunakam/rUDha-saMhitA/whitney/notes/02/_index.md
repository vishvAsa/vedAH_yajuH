Book II.

⌊THE second book is made up mostly of hymns of 5 verses each. It
contains 22 such hymns, but also five hymns (namely, 3, 4, 14, 15, and
32) of 6 verses each, five hymns (namely, 5, 17, 27, 29, and 33) of 7
verses each, and four hymns (namely, 10, 12, 24, and 36) of 8 verses
each. Compare page 1. The possibilities of critical reduction to the
norm are well illustrated by hymns 10, 12, 14, 27; see, for example, the
critical notes to ii. 10. 2.

The whole book has been translated by Weber in the *Monatsberichte der
Kön. Akad. der Wiss. zu Berlin*, June, 1870, pages 462-524. This
translation was reprinted, with only slight changes, in *Indische
Studien*, vol. xiii. (1873), pages 129-216. The following references to
Weber have to do with the reprint.⌋

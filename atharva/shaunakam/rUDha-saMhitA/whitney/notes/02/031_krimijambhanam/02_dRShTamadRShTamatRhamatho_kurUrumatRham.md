## Translation
2. The seen, the unseen one have I bruised, also the *kurū́ru* have I  
bruised; all the *algáṇḍus*, the *śalúnas*, the worms we grind up with  
our spell (*vácas*).

## Notes
The distinction of *-lga-* and *-lā-* in the manuscripts is very  
imperfect; I had noted only one of our mss. as apparently having  
*algáṇḍūn*, here and in the next verse; but SPP. gives this as found in  
all his authorities, including oral ones; and the comm. presents it, and  
even also Ppp.; so that it is beyond all question the true reading. The  
comm. explains it here as *etannāmnaḥ krimiviśeṣān*, but in vs. 3 as  
*śoṇitamāṅsadūṣakāñ jantūm*—which last is plainly nothing more than a  
guess. Instead of *kurū́rum* in **b**, he reads *kurīram*, with three of  
SPP's mss., and Ppp.; other mss. differ as to their distribution of *u*  
and *ū* in the syllables of the word, and two of ours (Op. Kp.) give  
*kurū́ram.* Two of SPP's authorities give *várcasā* in **d**. Ppp.  
further has *adraham* for *atṛham* both times, and *śalūlān* in **c**.  
The omission of *krímīn* in **d** would ease both sense and meter. ⌊As  
to *sarvāṅ ch-*, cf. iii. 11. 5, iv. 8. 3, and Prāt. ii. 17, note.⌋

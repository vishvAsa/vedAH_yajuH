## Translation
5. The worms that are in the mountains, in the woods, in the herbs, in  
the cattle, within the waters, that have entered our selves  
(*tanū́*)—that whole generation (*jåniman*) of worms I smite.

## Notes
Two of SPP's mss. agree with the comm. in reading *té* for *yé* at  
beginning of **c**; and the comm. has further *tanvas* for *tanvam*.  
Ppp. inserts *ye* before *vaneṣu*, and *ye* (with an *avasāna* before  
it) also before *oṣadhīṣu;* for second half-verse it gives *ye ‘smākaṁ  
tanno* (i.e. *tanvo*) *sthāma cakrir* (i.e. *cakrur* or *cakrire*)  
*indras tān hantu mahatā vadhena.* *Prāguktā* in the Anukr. apparently  
repeats this time the superfluous *ārṣī* of vs. 3.  
  
The *anuvāka* ⌊5.⌋ has 5 hymns and 29 verses, and the extract from the  
old Anukr. says *tato ‘parātāi* or *‘parānte.*

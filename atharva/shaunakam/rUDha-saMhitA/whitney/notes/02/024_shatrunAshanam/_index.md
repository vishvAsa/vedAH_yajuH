Ppp. reads: çarabhaka ṣeraçabha punar bho yānti yādavaṣ punar hatiṣ kimīdinaḥ yasya stha dam atta yo va prāhī tam uttam māsāṅsa manyatā. The comm. in the last phrase gives sā instead of svā and has much trouble to fabricate an explanation for it (as = tasya, or else for sā hetiḥ). Çerabhaka he takes as either sukhasya prāpaka or çarabhavat sarveṣām hiṅsaka, but is confident that it designates a "chief of yātudhānas." Of the refrain, the first part seems metrical, and the second prose, in three phrases; and it may be counted as 8 + 8: 6 + 7 + 5 (or 7) = 34 (or 36): the prefixed names add 7 syllables (vss. 1, 2), or 5 (vss. 3, 4), or 3 (vss. 6-8), or 2 (vs. 5). ⌊Bloomfield comments on áhāit and the like, ZDMG. xlviii. 577.⌋

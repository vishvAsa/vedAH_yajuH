## Translation
5. Thee here, of whom we take the garment to be first worn, let all the  
gods favor; thee here, growing with good growth, let many brothers be  
born after, ⌊\[after thee,\]⌋ as one well born.

## Notes
This verse makes it pretty evident that in vs. 3 also the garment is the  
first that is put on the child after birth. But the comm., ignoring the  
gerundive *-vāsyam*, thinks it a "formerly worn" garment that is "taken  
away"; and Kāuś. misuses it correspondingly. HGS. (i. 7. 17) has a  
corresponding verse, omitting *vāsas* in **a**, combining *viśve av-* in  
**b**, and reading *suhṛdas* for *suvṛdhā* in **c**. ⌊Nearly so, MP. ii.  
6. 15.⌋ In Ppp. the text is defective; but *savitā* is read instead of  
*suvṛdhā.* Some of our *saṁhitā*-mss. (P.M.W.I.H.) lengthen to *-vasyàm*  
before *hárāmas* in **a.** The verse is very irregular in the first  
three pādas, though it can by violence be brought into *triṣṭubh*  
dimensions; it has no *jagatī* quality whatever.

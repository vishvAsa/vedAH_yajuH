## Translation
2. Envelop, put ye him for us with splendor; make ye him one to die of  
old age; \[make\] long life; Brihaspati furnished (*pra-yam*) this  
garment unto king Soma for enveloping \[himself\].

## Notes
The verse is repeated below, as xix. 24. 4. It is found also in HGS. (i.  
4. 2) ⌊MP. ii. 2. 6⌋, and **a, b** in MB. (i. 1. 6). HGS. in **a** omits  
*nas*, and reads *vāsasāi ’nam* for *varcase ’mam*, and in **b** it has  
*śatāyuṣam* for *jarāmṛtyum;* MB. agrees with this, only making the  
verse apply to a girl by giving *enām* and *śatāyuṣīm.* There appears to  
be a mixture of constructions in **a**: *pári dhatta várcasā* is right,  
but *dhattá* requires rather *várcase*. Emending to *kṛṇutá* would  
enable *jarā́mṛtyum* to be construed with *imam* in **a** ⌊; but cf. ii.  
28. 2⌋. Verses 2 and 3 are apparently lost out of Ppp., not originally  
wanting.

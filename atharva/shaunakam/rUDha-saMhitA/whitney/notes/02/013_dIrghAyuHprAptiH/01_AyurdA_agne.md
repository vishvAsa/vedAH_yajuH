## Translation
1. Giving life-time, O Agni, choosing old age; ghee-fronted,  
ghee-backed, O Agni—having drunk the sweet pleasant (*cā́ru*) ghee of the  
cow, do thou afterward defend (*rakṣ*) this \[boy\] as a father his  
sons.

## Notes
The verse occurs also in various Yajur-Veda texts, as VS. (xxxv. 17),  
TS. (i. 3. 14⁴ et al.), TB. (i. 2. 1¹¹), TA. (ii. 5. 1), MS. (iv. 12.4)  
⌊MP. ii. 2. 1⌋, and in several Sūtras, as AśS. (ii. 10. 4), śGS. (i.  
25), and HGS. (i. 3. 5), with considerable variations. TS. (with which  
the texts of TB., TA., and AśS. agree throughout) has in **a** *havíṣo  
juṣāṇás*, which is decidedly preferable to *jarásaṁ vṛṇānás* ⌊, which is  
apparently a misplaced reminiscence of RV. x. 18. 6 or AV. xii.2. 24⌋;  
at end of **b**, *ghṛtáyonir edhi;* and, in **d**, *putrám* for  
*putrā́n*. VS. has for **a** *ā́yuṣmān agne havíṣā vṛdhānás*, and agrees  
with TS. etc. in **b**, and also in **d**, save that it further  
substitutes *imā́n* for *imám*. MS. reads *deva* for *agne* in **a**, and  
*píbann amṛ́tam* for *pītvā́ mádhu* of **c** ⌊thus making a good  
*triṣṭubh* pāda⌋, and ends **d** with *putráṁ jaráse ma e ’mám.* Ppp.  
agrees throughout with MS., except as it emends the latter's corrupt  
reading at the end to *jarase naye ’mam;* and HGS. corresponds with Ppp.  
save by having *gṛṇānas* in **a.** ⌊MP. follows HGS.⌋ śGS. gives in  
**a** *haviṣā vṛdhānas*, in **b** agrees with TS. etc., and has in **d**  
*pile ’va putram iha r-.* The last pāda is *jagatī.*  
  
⌊The Anukr. counts 11 + 11: 10 + 12 = 44: as if 10 + 12 were metrically  
the same as 11 + 11! or as if the "extra" syllable in **d** could offset  
the deficiency in **c**! The impossible cadence of **c** is curable by  
no less radical means than the adoption of the Ppp. reading. All this  
illustrates so well the woodenness of the methods of the Anukr. and its  
utter lack of sense of rhythm, that attention may well be called to it.⌋

## Translation
4. Come, stand on the stone; let thy body become a stone; let all the  
gods make thy life-time a hundred autumns.

## Notes
The second pāda is nearly identical with RV. vi. 75. 12 **b**; with **a,  
b** compare also AGS. i. 7. 7 and MB. i. 2. 1, similar lines used in the  
nuptial ceremonies. ⌊With **a, c, d** compare MGS. i. 22. 12 and p.  
149.⌋ Ppp. has for **a, b** *imam aśmānam ā tiṣṭhā ’śme ’va tvaḿ sthiro  
bhava: pra mṛṇīhi durasyataḥ sahasva pṛtanāyataḥ;* which differs but  
little from the AGS. verse. The Anukr. apparently expects us to resolve  
*ví-śu-e* in **c**.

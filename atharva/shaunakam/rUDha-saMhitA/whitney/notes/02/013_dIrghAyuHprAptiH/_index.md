## Comment
Verses 1, 4, 5 are found in Pāipp. xv. Though (as Weber points out) plainly having nothing to do with the godāna or tonsure ceremony, its verses are applied by Kāuś. to parts of that rite. Thus, it accompanies the preparations for it (53. 1) and the wetting of the youth's head (53. 13); vss. 2 and 3, the putting of a new garment on him (54. 7); vs. 4, making him stand on a stone (54. 8); vs. 5, taking away his old garment (54. 9). And the comm. quotes vss. 2 and 3 from Pariśiṣṭa 4. 1 as uttered by a purohita on handing to a king in the morning the garment he is to put on, and vs. 4 from ibid. 4, as the same throws four pebbles toward the four directions, and makes the king step upon a fifth.

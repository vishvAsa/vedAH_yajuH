## Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii., and parts of it in other texts, as pointed out under the several verses. ⌊Von Schroeder gives what may be called a Kaṭha-recension of nearly all of it in his Tübinger Kaṭha-hss., pp. 88, 89.⌋ Used by Kāuç. (37. 3) in addressing various articles out of whose behavior afterward signs of success or the contrary, and the like oracular responses, are to be drawn (the comm. gives them in a more expanded detail). And Vāit. (29. 14) applies vs. 3 in the upavasatha rite of the agnicayana.

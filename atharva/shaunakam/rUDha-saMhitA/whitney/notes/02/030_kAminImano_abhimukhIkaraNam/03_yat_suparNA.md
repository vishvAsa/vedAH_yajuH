## Translation
3. What the eagles \[are\] wanting to say, the free from disease \[are\]  
wanting to say—there let her come to my call, as the tip to the neck of  
the arrow (*kúlmala*).

## Notes
The first half-verse is very obscure, and very differently understood by  
the translators; the rendering above is strictly literal, avoiding the  
violences which they allow themselves; the comm. gives no aid; he  
supplies *strīviṣayaṁ vākyam* to *yat*, and explains *anamīvās* by  
*arogiņo ’dṛptāḥ* (? SPP. understands *dṛptāḥ*) *kāmijanāḥ.* Ppp. has an  
independent text: *yas suparṇā rakṣāṇa vā na vakṣaṇa vā trātānpitaṁ  
manaḥ: śalye ’va gulmalūṁ yathā*—too corrupt to make much of. The Anukr.  
declines to sanction the contraction *śalyé ’va* in **d**.

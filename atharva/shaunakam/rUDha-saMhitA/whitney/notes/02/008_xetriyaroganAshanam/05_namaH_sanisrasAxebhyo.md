## Notes
With this verse, according to Kāuś. (27. 2-4) the patient is put in an  
empty house (*śūnyaśālā*), and further in an old hole (*jaratkhāta*)  
that has housegrass (*śālātṛṇa*) in it, and is there doused and  
mouth-rinsed. In accordance with this, the comm. declares  
*sanisrasākṣā́s* to signify "empty houses," as having their round windows  
(*gavākṣa*) and other openings in a state of dilapidation. He reads in  
**b** *saṁdeśebhyas*, making it mean "old holes" (*jaradgarta*), because  
*saṁdiśyante tyajyante tadgatamṛdādānena*—which is hardly intelligible;  
and both words are of obscure meaning. In a charm against all sorts of  
hurtful beings, Ppp. (vi. 3. 4) reads as follows: *abhihastaṁ sarīsṛpaṁ  
bhrastākṣaṁ mṛdvan̄gulim*, and *dāsagranthyaṁ sānisrasam ud raṇye  
daṅśārusyaṁ tāṁ.* In this verse again, *-bhyas* in **b** is read as one  
syllable by the Anukr. ⌊SPP. divides the verse after *saṁdeśyèbhyaḥ*  
with most of his mss.; but three of them make *avasāna* after *pátaye.*  
Comm. and all five translators take *sani-* as a possessive compound  
(*sanisrasá* + *akṣán*): accent, *Gram.*² §1298. b, end.⌋

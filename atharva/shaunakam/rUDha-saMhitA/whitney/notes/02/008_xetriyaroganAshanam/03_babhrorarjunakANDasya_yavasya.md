## Translation
3. With the straw of the brown, whitish-jointed barley for thee, with  
the sesame-stalk (? *-piñjī*) of sesame, let the *kṣetriyá*-effacing  
etc. etc.

## Notes
The comm. understands *arjuna-* in **a** as a tree so named: "with a  
splinter of it"; *tilapiñjī* is to him *tilasahitamañjarī.* With this  
verse "what is mentioned in the text" is directed by Kāuś. (26. 43) to  
be bound on, and also (so the comm. understands the connection) a clod  
of earth and stuff from an ant-hill etc.

## Translation
4. Homage to thy ploughs (*lān̄gala*), homage to thy poles-and-yokes: let  
the *kṣetriyá*-effacing etc. etc.

## Notes
Comm. makes *lān̄gala* = *vṛṣabhayuktasīra:* "homage to the specified  
parts of the plough or to the divinities of them." With this verse, he  
says, the sick person is put underneath an ox-harnessed plough for his  
dousing (Kāuś. "with his head under a plough-yoke"). Some allusion to  
the name of the disease as coming from "field" is perhaps intended. The  
Anukr. strangely forbids the resolution *-bhi-as* in **a** and **b**.

## Translation
3. They who, giving attention to (*anu-dhī*) the one being bound, looked  
after \[him\] with mind and with eye—let the divine Agni at first  
(*ágre*) release them, he the all-working, in unison with (*saṁ-rā*)  
progeny.

## Notes
TS. and MS. (i. 2. 15) have *badhyámānās* for *dī́dyānās*, and TS.  
follows it with *abhyāíkṣ-;* and in **c** combines *agnís tā́ṅ;* MS. also  
has *ṭā́ṅ.* Both read in **d** *prajā́patis* for *viśvákarmā;* and TS.  
ends with *saṁvidānás.* Ppp. has in **c** *mumukta devās*, and, for  
**d**, *prajāpatiṣ prajābhis saṁvidānāṁ;* it then adds another verse:  
*yeṣāṁ prāṇo na badhnanti baddhaṁ gavāṁ paśūnām uta pāuruṣāṇām: indras  
tāṁ* (i.e. *tān agre pra* etc.). The comm. reads in **a** *vadhyamānam*,  
which is better; he explains *samrarāṇas* by *saha śabdāyamānas*, as if  
from the root *rā* 'bark'! Comparison with the next verse seems to show  
the other animals, comrades of the victim, to be aimed at in the verse.  
⌊Cf. Weber's notes, p. 209, and esp. his reference to śB. iii. 7.  
4⁵.—MS. has *ṭáṅ*, p. *tā́n:* see above, page xc.⌋

## Translation
1. The lord of cattle, who rules over (*īś*) the cattle, the  
four-footed, and who also over the two-footed—let him, bought off, go to  
\[his\] sacrificial portion; let abundances of wealth attach themselves  
to (*sac*) the sacrificer.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In the TS. version, this verse comes second (the verse-order being 5, 1,  
3, 4, 2). Both TS. and K. have at the beginning *yéṣām*, which Ppp.  
supports by reading *eṣām*, and which rectifies the meter of **a**: this  
gives quite a different application to **c**, and a different cast to  
the meaning of the verse. TS. has also *ca* for *yás* in **b**, *ayám*  
(‘*yám*) for *sá* in **c**, and it ends (better) with *yájamānasya  
santu.* K. (Weber) has for **b** *catuṣpāda uta ye dvipādaḥ*, and for  
**c** *niṣkrītās te yajñiyam bhāgaṁ yantu;* and Ppp. differs from it  
only slightly, adding *vā* after *uta* in **b**, and ending **c** with  
*yajñiyā yānti lokam.* Apparently it is the lord of cattle who is to be  
bribed to content himself with his sacrificial share, in lieu of taking  
the whole. The Anukr. does not heed the irregularities of meter in **a,  
b**. ⌊The Ppp. form of **b** seems to be *catuṣpadām uta vā ye  
dvipadaḥ!*⌋

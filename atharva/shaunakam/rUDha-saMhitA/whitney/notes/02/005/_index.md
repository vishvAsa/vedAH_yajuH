## Comment
Verses 1, 3, and 4 are found in Pāipp. ii., and 5-7 elsewhere in its text (xiii.). Verses 1-3 occur also in SV. (ii. 302-4) and ÇÇS. (ix. 5. 2); and the first four verses form part of a longer hymn in AÇS. (vi. 3. l). KB. (xvii. l) quotes by way of pratīka vs. 1 a, b (in their SV. and ÇÇS. form), and speaks of the peculiar structure of the verses, as composed of twenty-five syllables, with nine syllables interpolated (three at the end of each of the first three five-syllabled pādas): cf. Roth, Ueb. d. AV., 1856, p. 11 ff., and Weber, notes to his translation. At TB. ii. 4. 310 may be found RV. x. 96. I treated in a somewhat similar way (four syllables prefixed to each jagatī-pāda); the first five verses of RV. x. 77 itself are another example; ⌊yet others are AV. vii. 14 (15). 1, 2; v. 6. 4 a, c; RV. i. 70. 11 as it appears at AÇS. vi. 3. 1; cf. further RV. X. 21, 24, 25⌋. ⌊I suspect that these interpolations were used as antiphonal responses.⌋


## Translations
The hymn is used once in Kāuç. (59. 5), among the kāmya rites, or those intended to secure the attainment of various desires; it is addressed to Indra, by one desiring strength (balakāma). In Vāit. (16. 11), it (not vs. 1 only, according to the comm.) accompanies an oblation to Soma in the agniṣṭoma sacrifice, and again (25. 14) a ṣoḑa-çigraha. And the comm. quotes it from Nakṣ. Kalpa 17 and 18, in a mahāçānti to Indra. None of these uses has about it anything special or characteristic.

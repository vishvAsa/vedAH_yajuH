## Translation
5. O Agni! with the brilliancy (*téjas*) that is thine, make him  
unbrilliant who hates us, whom we hate.

## Notes
Ppp. has *jyotis* for *tejas,* and *prati daha* for *atejasaṁ kṛṇu;* for  
the latter, MS. and Āp. read *prati titigdhi* (also K., *tityagdhi*).  
  
The meter is alike in the four hymns 19-22; the Anukr. restores the *a*  
of *asmān,* and in vss. 1-4 scans 6 + 7 + 10 = 23, and, in vs. 5, 6 + 9  
+ 10 = 25.

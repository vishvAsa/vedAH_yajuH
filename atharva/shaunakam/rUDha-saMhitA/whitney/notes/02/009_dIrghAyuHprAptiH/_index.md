## Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order 1, 5, 4, 2, 3). Reckoned, like the next preceding and the next following hymn, to the takmanāśana gaṇa (Kāuś. 26. 1, note), and made (27. 5, 6) to accompany the binding on of an amulet composed of splinters (from ten different trees: the comm.), being muttered by ten friends who lay hands on the patient.

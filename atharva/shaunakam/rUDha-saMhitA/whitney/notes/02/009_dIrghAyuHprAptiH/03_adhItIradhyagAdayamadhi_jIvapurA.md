## Translation
3. He hath attained (*adhi-gā*) attainments; he hath attained  
(*adhi-gam*) the strongholds (*-purā*) of the living; for a hundred  
healers are his, also a thousand plants.

## Notes
The 'attainments' (*adhīti*), according to the comm., are the Vedas and  
objects formerly learned (*adhīta*), and now, by restored health,  
recovered to memory. Ppp. reads instead *adhītam* in **a**, and *purā  
’gāt* in **b**; and its **c, d** are *śataṁ te ‘sya vīrudha sahasram uta  
bheṣajaḥ.* Emendation to *bheṣajā́* in our **c** would improve both sense  
and meter. The comm. here, as in sundry other places, derives *vīrudh*  
from *vi + rudh*, on the ground that they *virundhanti vināśayanti  
rogān.*

## Translation
1. O thou of ten trees, release this man from the demon, from the  
seizure (*grā́hi*) that hath seized him in the joints; then, O forest  
tree, conduct him up to the world of the living.

## Notes
The first half-verse is quite different in Ppp.: *daśavṛkṣo saṁ ce ’mam  
ahiṅsro grāhyāś ca.* The comm. takes *parvan* in **b** as either the  
joints of the body or those of the month, new and full moon. The Anukr.  
scans the verse as 10 + 12: 8 + 8 = 38, making the first pāda-division  
after *rakṣasas* (and the *pada*-mss. so mark it); but it is rather a  
regular *pan̄kti*, with the easy resolution *muñca imam* in **a**.

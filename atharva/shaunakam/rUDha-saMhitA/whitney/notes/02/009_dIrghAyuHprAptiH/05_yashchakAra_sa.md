## Translation
5. Whoso made, he shall unmake; he verily is best of healers; he  
himself, clean, shall make for thee remedies, with the healer.

## Notes
The application of the pronouns here is more or less questionable. Ppp.  
reads *su*  for *sa* in **a**, and has a more intelligible second  
half-verse: *sa eva tubhyaṁ bheṣajaṁ cakāra bhiṣajāti ca;* our bhiṣájā  
in **d** is probably to be emended to *-jām* ⌊'the clean one of the  
healers'?⌋. The comm. understands *sa* at the beginning either as "the  
great sage Atharvan" or as the creator of the universe; and *niṣkarat*  
as *grahavikārasya śamanaṁ* or *niṣkṛtiṁ karotu.* Weber renders the  
latter "shall put it to rights."

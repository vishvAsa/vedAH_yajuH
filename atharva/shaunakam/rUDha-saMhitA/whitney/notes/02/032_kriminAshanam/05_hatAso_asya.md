## Translation
5. Slain are its neighbors (? *veśás*), slain its further neighbors (?  
*páriveśas*), also those that are petty (*kṣullaká), as it were—all  
those worms are slain.*

## Notes
The translation of **d** implies the emendation of *te* to *té;* all the  
mss. have the former, but SPP. receives the latter into his text on the  
authority of the comm., who so understands the word. Ppp. reads in **a,  
b** *‘sya veṣaso hatāsaṣ p-;* our **c** is wanting in its text; our  
**d** it puts in place of our 3 **d**. Our *kṣullaka* is a kind of  
Prākritization of *kṣudraka*, quoted from MB. under vs. 4; TA. (ib.)  
also has *átho sthūrā́ átho kṣudrā́ḥ.* The comm. explains *veśásas* as  
"principal houses," and *páriveśasas* as "neighboring houses." We might  
suspect *-veṣ-*, from root *viṣ*, and so 'attendants, servants.'

## Translation
6. I crush up (*pra-śṛ*) thy (two) horns, with which thou thrustest; I  
split thy receptacle (?), which is thy poison-holder.

## Notes
The decided majority, both of our mss. and of SPP's, give in **c**  
*kuṣúmbham*, which is accordingly accepted in both editions; other  
sporadic readings are *kuṁṣúṁbham, kuṣábham, kaśábham, kuṣúbham,  
kuṣámbham;* and two of SPP's mss. give *ṣukumbham*, nearly agreeing with  
the *ṣukambham* of the comm. Our P.M.E. have *vinud-* in **b**. Ppp's  
version is as follows: *pa te śśṛṇāmi śṛn̄ge yābhyāyattaṁ vitadāyasi:  
atho bhinadmi taṁ kumbhaṁ yasmin te nihataṁ viṣaṁ*, which in **c** is  
better than our text, and is supported by the MB. (ii. 7. 3) form of  
**c, d**: *athāi ’ṣām bhinnakaḥ kumbho ya eṣāṁ viṣadhānakaḥ.* The  
metrical definition of the verse (7 + 7: 7 + 6 = 27) given by the Anukr.  
is only mechanically correct.

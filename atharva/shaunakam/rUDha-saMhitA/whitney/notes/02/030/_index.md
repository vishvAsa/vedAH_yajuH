## Comment
Found in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order 1, 5, 2, 4, 3). Used by Kāuç. (35. 21 ff.), with vi. 8 and other hymns, in a rite concerning women, to gain control over a certain person: a mess of various substances is prepared, and her body smeared with it—which is much like the proverbial catching of a bird by putting salt on its tail.

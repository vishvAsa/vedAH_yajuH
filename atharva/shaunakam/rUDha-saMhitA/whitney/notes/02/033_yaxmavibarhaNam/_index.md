## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. Corresponds, with important variations, to most of RV. x. 163 (found also in MP., the mantra-text to ĀpGS.: see Winternitz, l.c., p. 99). ⌊Namely, our vss. 1, 2, 4 ab with 3 cd, and 5 correspond to MP. i. 17. 1, 2, 3, and 4: the MP. version follows most nearly that of RV.⌋ The hymn is called by Kāuś. (27. 27) vībarha (from vs. 7 d), and is prescribed in a healing ceremony; it is also reckoned (54. 11, note) to the āyuṣya gaṇa; but the comm. makes up an aṅholin̄ga gaṇa of it and iii. 11; iv. 13; v. 30; ix. 8, which is quite different from the one reported by Bloomfield from the gaṇamālā in note to Kāuś. 32. 27 ⌊on page 89, but agrees with the one reported in B's supplement, page 334, except that for i. 10. 4 should be put iii. 11. i⌋. It (or vs. i) is also employed by Vāit. (38. 1) in the puruṣamedha.

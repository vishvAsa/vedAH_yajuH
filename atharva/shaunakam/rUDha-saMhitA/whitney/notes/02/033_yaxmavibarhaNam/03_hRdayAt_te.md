## Translation
3. Forth from thy heart, lung (*klomán*), *hálīkṣṇa*, (two) sides, (two)  
*mátasnas*, spleen, liver, we eject for thee the *yákṣma.*

## Notes
Weber conjectures "gall" for *hálīkṣṇa* (Ppp. *hálīkṣma*), and "kidney"  
for *matasna.* The comm. defines *klomán* as "a kind of flesh-mass in  
the neighborhood of the heart," *halīkṣṇa* as *etatsaṁjñakāt  
tatsambandhān māṅsapiṇḍaviśeṣāt*, and *matasnābhyām* as  
*ubhayapārśvasambandhābhyāṁ vŗkyābhyāṁ tatsamīpasthapittādhārapātrābhyāṁ  
vā.* For **a**, Ppp. has *klomnas te hṛdayābhyo.* Of this verse, only  
the latter half has a parallel in RV., namely x. 163. 3 **c, d**, where  
**d** is varied to *yaknáḥ plāśíbhyo ví vṛhāmi te.* The Anukr. foolishly  
rejects all resolution in **b**.

title = "०१ दूष्या दूषिरसि"

## Translation
1. Spoiler's spoiler (*dū́ṣi*) art thou; missile's missile (*hetí*) art  
thou; weapon's weapon (*mení*) art thou: attain (*āp*) the better one,  
step beyond the equal (*samá*).

## Notes
The body of the verse is addressed to the amulet; the refrain more  
probably to its wearer (so, too, Weber); but the comm. assigns the  
latter also to the amulet, and quotes to show it TS. ii. 4. 1⁴, which  
rather supports the contrary opinion. He calls *mení* **a**  
*vajranāman*, deriving it from root *mī* 'damage.' ⌊See Geldner's  
discussion of *mení* ('hurt done to another in vengeful anger'),  
*Festgruss an Böhtlingk*, p. 31, 32.⌋

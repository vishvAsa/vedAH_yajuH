## Comment
⌊The hymn is not metrical.⌋ Not found in Pāipp., nor elsewhere. Reckoned as first of the kṛtyāpratiharaṇa ('counteraction of witchcraft') gaṇa (Kāuś. 39. 7 and note); used in a charm for protection against witchcraft (39. 1), with binding-on of a sraktya amulet; and again later (39. 13; the comm. says, only vs. 1), in a similar rite. The comm. quotes it further from Nakṣ. K. (17, 19), in a mahāśānti called bārhaspatī.

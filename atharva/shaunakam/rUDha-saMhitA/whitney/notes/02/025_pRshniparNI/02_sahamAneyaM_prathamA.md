## Translation
2. This spotted-leaf was first born overpowering; with it do I hew  
\[off\] the head of the ill-named ones, as of a bird (*śakúni*).

## Notes
⌊*śakú-* is misprinted *śakṛ́-*.⌋ The reading *vṛścāmi*, without accent  
(which is given in both editions, on the authority of all the mss.)  
implies that the fourth pāda begins with *śíras*, the preceding three  
words being (as is easy) resolved into eight syllables; and the  
*pada*-mss. also mark the pāda-division before *śíras.* The Anukr.,  
however, regards the verse as a simple *anuṣṭubh*, which it plainly is,  
*śíras* belonging to **c**; the accent should therefore be emended to  
*vṛścā́mi.* Ppp. reads *sadānvāghnī pr-* for **a**, and, in **c, d**,  
*tayā kaṇvasyāṁ śiraś chinadmi śak-.* The comm. explains the "ill-named"  
as *dadruvisarpakaśvitrādikuṣṭharogaviśeṣās*, or varieties of leprosy.

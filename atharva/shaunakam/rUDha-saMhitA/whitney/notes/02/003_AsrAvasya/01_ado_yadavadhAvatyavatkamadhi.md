## Translation
1. What runs down yonder, aiding (?), off the mountain, that do I make  
for thee a remedy, that thou mayest be a good remedy.

## Notes
At the end, *ásati* would be a very acceptable emendation: 'that there  
may be.' *Avatká* (p. *avat॰kám:* quoted in the comment to Prāt. i. 103;  
ii. 38; iv. 25) is obscure, but is here translated as from the present  
participle of root *av* (like *ejatká*, v. 23. 7 ⌊cf. *abhimādyatká*,  
śB., *vikṣiṇatká*, VS.⌋); this the comm. favors (*vyādhiparihāreṇa  
rakṣakam*); Ppp. has in another passage twice *avatakam* (but evidently  
meant for *avatkam: avatakaṁ mama bheṣajam avatakaṁ parivācanam*). In  
**a**, our P.M. read *-dhā́vasi.*

## Translation
4. The ants (*upajī́kā*) bring up the remedy from out the ocean; that is  
the remedy of flux; that has quieted (*śam*) the disease.

## Notes
The comm. explains *upajī́kās* as *valmīkaniṣpādikā vamryaḥ;* Ppp. has  
instead *upacīkās;* elsewhere is found *upadī́kā*(see Bloomfield in AJP.  
vii. 482 ff., where the word is ably discussed); ⌊cf. also Pāli  
*upacikā*⌋. The Ppp. form, *upacīkā*, indicates a possible etymology,  
from *upa + ci;* Ppp. says in book vi.: *yasyā bhūmyā upacīkā* (ms.  
*-kād*) *gṛham kṛṇvatā ”tmane: tasyās te viśvadhāyaso viṣadūṣaņam ud  
bhare.* The earth which ants make their high nests of, and which  
contains their moisture, has always been used as having remedial  
properties. The "ocean" here (cf. *udaka* in vi. 100. 2), if not merely  
a big name for the reservoir of water beneath the surface, is a tank or  
pool. Ppp. has an independent second half-verse: *aruspānam asy  
ātharvaṇo rogasthānam asy ātharvaṇam.*

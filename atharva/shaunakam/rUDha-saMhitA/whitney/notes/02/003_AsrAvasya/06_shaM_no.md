## Translation
6. Weal be to us the waters, propitious the herbs; let Indra's  
thunderbolt smite away the demoniacs {*rakṣás*); far away let the  
discharged arrows of the demoniacs fly.

## Notes
In **a** all the mss. read apás, which SPP. rightly retains in his text;  
other examples of the use of this accusative form as nominative occur in  
the text (see the *Index Verborum*); the comm. has *āpas*, as our  
edition by emendation. We may safely regard this unmetrical "verse" as a  
later addition to the hymn; so far as regards the number of syllables  
(12: 12 + 14 = 38), it is correctly described by the Anukr., as the name  
*mahābṛhatī* is elsewhere used in the latter, but apparently by no other  
similar treatise.

## Translation
4. Let the lord of beings drive out, also Indra, from here the  
*sadā́nvās*, sitting on the bottom of the house; let Indra subdue them  
with the thunderbolt.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The omission of this verse, as being not found with the rest in Ppp.  
ii., would reduce the hymn to the norm of the second book. Ppp. (in v.)  
rectifies the meter of **d** by omitting *indras.* The metrical  
definition of the Anukr. is mechanically correct. The comm. understands  
*bhūtapati* to designate Rudra.

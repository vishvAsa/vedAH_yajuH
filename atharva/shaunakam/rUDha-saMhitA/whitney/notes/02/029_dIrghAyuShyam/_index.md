## Comment
Found in Pāipp., but in two widely separated parts: vss. 1-3 in xix., and vss. 4-7 in i. (next following our hymn 28). Used in Kāuś. (27. 9 ff.) in a curious healing rite for one afflicted with thirst: the patient and a well person are set back to back, wrapped in one garment together, and the latter is made to drink a certain potion apparently prepared for the other; thus the disease will be transferred to the well person: a total perversion of the proper meaning of the hymn. Again, it is used (54. 18) in the godāna and cūḍā ceremonies, and, according to the schol. (58. 17, note), in that of name-giving; and the schol. (42. 15) further add it in the rite on the return home of a Vedic student. And vs. 3 accompanies in Vāit. (22. 16) the pouring of the āśīr milk into the clarified soma in the pūtabhṛt at the agniṣṭoma sacrifice ⌊cf. comm. and Hillebrandt, Ritual-litteratur, p. 129⌋.

## Translation
5. Assign refreshment to him, ye (two) that are rich in refreshment;  
assign milk to him, ye rich in milk; refreshment have heaven-and-earth  
assigned to him, \[have\] all the gods, the Maruts, refreshment \[have\]  
the waters.

## Notes
'Refreshment' is the conventional rendering selected for the ambiguous  
word *ūrj* and its varieties. Nearly all our mss. (all save P. M.), and  
all of SPP's, have the false accentuation *devās* in **d**; both  
editions emend to *devā́s*, which the comm. also understands. So also  
with *dyā́vāpṛthivī́* in **c**, for which the mss. have either  
*dyāvāpṛthivī* (so nearly all of ours and one of SPP's) or  
*dyāvāpṛthivī́* (so, according to SPP., all his save one, with our O.D.);  
only our H. has the true reading, which is given by emendation in both  
editions. The verse (10 + 10: 12 + 11 = 43) is far from being a good  
*triṣṭubh.*

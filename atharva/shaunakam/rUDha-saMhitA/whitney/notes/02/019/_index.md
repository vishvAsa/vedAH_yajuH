## Comment
⌊Not metrical.⌋ This hymn (but not its four successors and counterparts) is found in Pāipp. ii.; also in MS. (i. 5. 2: in verse-order 1, 4, 3, 2, 5) and Āp. (vi. 21. 1: in verse-order 3, 4, 1, 2, 5); further, in K. Its first pratīka (but regarded by the schol. and by the comm. as including all the five hymns) is used by Kāuç. (47. 8) to accompany the purastād homas in the witchcraft rites. The Anukr. has a common description of the five hymns, 19-23, as pañca sūktāni pañcarcāni pañcādpatyni (? or -catapāty-) tripādgāyatrāṇy ekāvasānāni. ⌊The mss. blunder; but pañcāpatyāni is probably right; see note to Kāuç. 47. 8.⌋

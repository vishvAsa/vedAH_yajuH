## Translation
2. To this cow-stall let cattle flow-together ⌊stream together⌋  
(*sam-sru*); let Brihaspati, foreknowing, lead them hither; let Sinīvālī  
lead hither the van (*ágra*) of them; make them fast when they have  
come, O Anumati.

## Notes
⌊In the prior draft of 3, Mr. Whitney has 'stream.'⌋ Ppp. has at the end  
*yacchāt;* one of SPP's mss., *yacchat.* The comm. gives *anugate* (=  
*he anugamanakāriṇi*) in **d**. The value of *pra* in the common epithet  
*prajānánt* (rendered 'foreknowing') is obscure and probably minimal.  
⌊As to the deities here named, see Zimmer, p. 352, and Hillebrandt,  
*Ved. Mythol.* i. 422.⌋

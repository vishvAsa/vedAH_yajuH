## Translation
1. Hither let the cattle come that went away, whose companionship  
(*sahacārá*) Vāyu (the wind) enjoyed, whose form-givings Tvashṭar knows;  
in this cow-stall let Savitar make them fast (*ni-yam*).

## Notes
Or, 'whose forms,' *rūpadheya* being virtually equivalent to simple  
*rūpa.* Ppp. reads in **b** *sahatāram.* The "cow-stall" does not  
probably imply anything more than an enclosure. The Anukr. passes  
without notice the *jagatī* pāda **d.**

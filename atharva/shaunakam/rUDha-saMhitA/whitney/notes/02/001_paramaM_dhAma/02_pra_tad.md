## Translation
2. May the Gandharva, knowing of the immortal, proclaim that highest  
abode that is in secret; three quarters (*padá*) of it \[are\] deposited  
in secret; whoso knoweth them, he shall be the father's father.

## Notes
Ppp. begins with *pṛthag* (for *pra tad*), and for *amṛtasya* has *-taṁ  
na*, probably intending the *amṛ́taṁ nú* of VS. (xxxii. 9) and TA. (x. 1.  
3-4: TA. reads also *voce*). In **b**, TA. gives *nā́ma* (for *dhā́ma*);  
and for *paramám* TA. has *níhitam*, and VS. *víbhṛtam*, while VS. ends  
with *gúhā sát* and TA. with *gúhāsu*. In **c**, Ppp. and TA. give  
*padā́*, and Ppp. *nihatā;* and TA., this time with the concurrence of  
Ppp., ends the pāda again with *gúhāsu*. In **d**, TA. has *tád* for  
*tā́ni*, and *savitús* for *sá pitúṣ*, while Ppp. gives *vas* for *yas*  
at the beginning. Prāt. ii. 73 prescribes the combination *pitúṣ p-* (in  
**d**), and both editions read it, though nearly all our *saṁhitā*-mss.,  
and part of SPP's, read *-túḥ p-* instead. To make a good *triṣṭubh*  
pāda, we must resolve *pṛ-d* at the beginning. ⌊Hillebrandt, *Ved.  
Mythol.* i. 433, discusses the verse.⌋

## Translation
3. He, of us the father, the generator, and he the connection  
(*bándhu*), knoweth the abodes, the beings all; who of the gods is the  
sole nomenclator, of him all beings come to inquire.

## Notes
Here, as usual elsewhere ⌊cf. BR. iv. 1088, citations from TB., TS.,  
AB.⌋, *-praśnam* is of infinitival value. Ppp. begins quite differently:  
*sa no bandhur janitā sa vidhartā dhārmaṇi veda* etc.; its **c, d** are  
our 5 **c, d**, with variants for which see under vs. 5. VS. (xxxii. 10)  
and TA. (x. 1. 4) have a verse made up like that of Ppp., differing from  
the latter in the first half only by having *vidhātā́* and *dhā́māṇi*. A  
corresponding verse in RV. (x. 82. 3) reads in **a** *yás* for *sá* and  
again for *sá utá*, accents of course *véda* in **b**, and has  
*nāmadhā́s* in **c** and *anyā́* for *sárvā* in **d**; and with it agrees  
in all points VS. xvii. 27; while TS. (iv. 6. 2) and MS. (ii. 10. 3)  
also follow it closely in **a, c, d** (MS. *vidhartā́* in **a**) but have  
a different **b**: *yó naḥ sató abhy ā́ sáj jajā́na.* Our O. has the RV.  
readings, *véda* in **b** and *nāmadhā́s* in **c**; and the latter is  
given by the comm. and by nearly half of SPP's authorities; the latter's  
text, however, agrees with ours. The verse is no *jagatī* at all, but,  
if we make the frequent (RV.) combination *só 'tá* in **c**, a perfectly  
regular *triṣṭubh.*

## Translation
4. Terrible \[are\] the seers; homage be to them! what sight \[is\]  
theirs, and the actuality (*satyá*) of their mind. For Brihaspati, O  
bull (*mahiṣá*), \[be\] bright (*dyumánt*) homage; O Viśvakarman, homage  
to thee! protect thou us.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, though this is plainly corrupted. TS.  
makes **b** less unintelligible by reading *cákṣuṣas* for *cákṣur yát*,  
and *saṁdhāú* for *satyám;* Ppp. has in the half-verse only minor  
variants: *bhīma* for *ghorās*, *‘stu* for *astu*, *saṁdṛk* for  
*satyam.* In **c**, TS. has *mahí ṣát* for the senseless *mahiṣa*, and  
the comm. presents the same; Ppp. reads *bṛhaspate mahiṣāya dive: namo  
viśv-*. TS. gives for **d** *námo viśákarmaṇe sá u pātv asmā́n*. In **d**  
all the *pada*-mss. have the strange blunder *pāhi*, for *pāhí* as  
required by the sense and by the *saṁhitā*-text.; and SPP. adopts the  
blunder, thus giving a *pada*-reading that is inconvertible into his own  
*saṁhitā.* The comm. takes *ṛṣayas* in **a** as "the breaths, sight  
etc.," and *satyam* in **b** as *yathārthadarśi;* and he founds on this  
interpretation the use in Kāuś. 38. 22, "against faults of vision."

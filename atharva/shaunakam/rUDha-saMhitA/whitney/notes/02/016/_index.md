## Comment
⌊Not metrical.⌋ Found (except vs. 5) in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order 2, 1, 3, 4). The hymn, with the one next following, is used by Kāuç. (54. 12) immediately after hymn 15; and the comm. adds, quoting for it the authority of Pāiṭhīnasi, to accompany the offering of thirteen different substances, which he details. Both appear also in Vāit. (4. 20), in the parvan sacrifices, on approaching the āhavanīya fire; and vss. 2 and 4 further (8. 7, 9) in the āgrayaṇa and cāturmāsya sacrifices.

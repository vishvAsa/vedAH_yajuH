title = "०४ परुषानमून् परुषाह्वः"

## Translation
4. Let the rough-called one make yonder men rough (*paruṣá*); let the  
slayer slay them with deadly weapons; let them be broken quickly like a  
reed (*śará*), tied together with a great net.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *śare ’va* in **c**,\* and has at the end (as in 3 **d**)  
*saṁcitās;* it puts the verse before our vs. 3. The Pet. Lexx.  
conjecture *paruṣāhvá* to be 'a kind of reed.' ⌊For the materials of the  
sorcery, and the "net," cf. introd.⌋ \*⌊As the meter requires; why then  
does not the Anukr. call the vs. a *purastādbṛhatī* and have done with  
it?⌋

## Translation
16. Here are spread the fetters of death, which stepping into thou art  
not released; let this horn (*kū́ṭa*) slay of yonder army by thousands.

## Notes
Ppp. gives for **a** *mṛtyupaśā yama* ⌊that is, *ime*?⌋ *yuktā*. Kāuś.  
(16. 16) speaks of *kūṭas* of *aśvattha*\[-wood\] and nets of hemp.'  
⌊Geldner, Ved. Stud. i. 139, renders the vs. and takes *kū́ṭa* as "trap";  
SPP., p. 659¹³, says *niṣādānām prāṇibandhanam;* Bl., p. 119 (see esp.  
p. 585), "hammer."⌋

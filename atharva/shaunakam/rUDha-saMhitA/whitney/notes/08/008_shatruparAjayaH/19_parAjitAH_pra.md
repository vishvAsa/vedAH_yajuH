## Translation
19. Flee (*tras*) forth, O enemies, being conquered; run, ⌊being⌋ thrust  
by the charm (*bráhman*); of them yonder, thrust forth by Brihaspati,  
let none soever be freed.

## Notes
The second half-verse is nearly repeated as xi. 10. 19 **c, d**, below.  
The *pada*-mss. absurdly read *nuttā́* (not *nuttā́ḥ*) in **b**. *Amitrās*  
is metrically redundant in **a**. ⌊Rather 11 + 8: 8 + 8.⌋ The  
*pada*-reading of *bṝhaspáti॰pranuttānām* ⌊cf. iii. 6. 7⌋ is by Prāt.  
iii. 76, iv. 77, the commentary quoting it under each rule.

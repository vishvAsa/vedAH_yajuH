## Translation
33. Poison is poured out after the unfriendly foe of him who knoweth  
thus.

## Notes
⌊The quotations from the Old Anukr. for the *paryāya-sūkta* are given  
piecemeal at the end of each *paryāya*. For brevity they may here be  
given together: I. *trayodaśa;* II. *daśa;* III. *aṣṭāu ca;* IV. *tataḥ  
ṣoḍśa;* V. *ṣoḍaśa;* VI. *catuṣkas*.⌋  
  
⌊SPP., "Critical Notice," vol. i., p. 19, prints them in full in their  
metrical form:  
  
    
  
*trayodaśa daśā ’ṣṭāu ca tataḥ ṣoḍaśa ṣoḍaśa:*    
*virāḍvāyāṁ catuṣkas tu; ṣaṭ paryāyās tu niścitāḥ;*  
  
    
'In the \[hymn beginning\] "*virāḍ vā*" (*vāi*), \[the last *paryāya*  
is\] one of four \[*avasāna-rcas*\]; while the *paryāyas* count six.'\]  
  
\[The summations of *gaṇas* and (*gaṇa*-)*avasāna-rcas* are as follows:  
I. *g.*, 6; *av.*, 13; II. *av.*, 10; III. *g.*, 4; *av.*, 8; IV. *g-.*,  
4; *av.*, 16; V. *av.*, 4; *av.*, 16; VI. *av.*, 4.—Total of *av.*, 67.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the fifth *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 59 verses: that is 1  
*artha-sūkta* of 26 verses and 1 *paryāya-sūkta* with 6 *paryāyas* and  
33 verses.⌋  
  
⌊Some mss. sum up the hymns and verses correctly. Thus D. reckons 30  
*sūktas* (that is 24 of the decad-divisions of our hymns 1-9, plus 6  
*paryāya-sūktas* of our h. 10) with 226 verses (i.e. in our hymns 1-9)  
plus 67 *avasāna-rcas*. Similarly ms. l. makes 30 hymns; but 259 verses  
(i.e. 226, plus the 33 of our h. 10).⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the nineteenth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

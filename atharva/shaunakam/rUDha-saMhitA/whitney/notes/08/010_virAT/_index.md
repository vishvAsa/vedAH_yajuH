## Comment
This curious piece of prose is (with the exception of paragraphs here and there) found also in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊Pāipp. has the order 22, 24, 23, 26, 25.⌋ ⌊This is the first of the paryāya-sūktas. For the paryāya-hymns in general, see introduction to book viii., pages 471-2, above.⌋


⌊Neither Kāuś. nor Vāit. makes use of the hymn; but one of the "committals" in the upanayana (Kāuś. 56. 13) is to mārtyuṁjaya mārtyava: cf. vs. 23.⌋

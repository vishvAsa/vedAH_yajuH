## Translation
18. She ascended; she came to the forest trees; the forest trees slew  
her; she in a year came into being; therefore what is cut of the forest  
trees grows over in a year; cut off (*vraśc*) is his unfriendly foe  
(*bhrā́tṛvya*) who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Only P.s.m. and R. give here the first phrase, and only R. in the three  
following paragraphs. Ppp. puts *vanaspatīnām* after *saṁvatsare*. ⌊For  
*vṛścáte*, see note to vi. 136. 3.⌋

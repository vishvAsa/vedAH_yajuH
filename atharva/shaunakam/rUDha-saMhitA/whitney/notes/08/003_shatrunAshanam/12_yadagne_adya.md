## Translation
12. What, O Agni, the pair utter in curses today, what harshness  
(*tṛṣṭá*) of speech the reciters (*rebhá*) produce: the shaft that is  
born of fury of the mind—with that pierce thou the sorcerers in the  
heart.

## Notes
'That' in **d** is fem., as if referring to the 'shaft' alone; and the  
comm. regards **a** and **b** as describing faults caused by the  
sorcerers, which Agni is to requite—which is doubtless the true  
connection. *Mithunā* is explained as = *strīpuṅsāu*, and *śapātas* as =  
*parasparam ākrośatas*. The verse is RV. vs. 13, its vs. 12 being found  
much further on, as our vs. 21. Ppp. again reads *viddhi* for *vidhya*  
in **d**.

## Translation
7. Both those that are seized do thou win (*spṛ*), O Jātavedas, and also  
the sorcerers that have seized with spears; do thou, O Agni, first,  
greatly gleaming, smite \[him\] down; let the variegated  
raw-flesh-eating *kṣvín̄kās* eat him.

## Notes
This verse differs somewhat, and inconsistently, from RV., which has  
*ā́labdham* in **a**, and, without *utá, ālebhānā́t...yātudhā́nāt* in  
**b**, giving the clear sense 'win away him that is seized from the  
sorcerer that has seized him,' and agreeing with the sing. *tám* in  
**d**. The AV. version yields no acceptable meaning; and most of the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *ārabdhāṁ* in **a** (including our P.M.W.I.: some of  
the others not noted), as if the word were after all a singular. The  
comm. reads *kṣvan̄kās* in **d**, and explains it simply as  
*pakṣiviśeṣās*. He gives a most absurd version of **a, b**: 'protect  
(us) who have begun (to praise thee) and (slay) with spears the  
sorcerers who have made a noise'! ⌊Comm. seems to read *rebhāṇān* and to  
take it from root *ribh:* cf. note to vs. 21.⌋ Ppp. has our version of  
**a, b**, except that it reads *utā ”lab-* in **a**, and omits *uta* in  
**b** ⌊i.e., if I understand R., it appears to begin **b** with  
*ārebhāṇāṅ*⌋.

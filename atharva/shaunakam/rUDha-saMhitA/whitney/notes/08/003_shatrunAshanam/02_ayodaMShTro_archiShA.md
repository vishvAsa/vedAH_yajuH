## Translation
2. Do thou, of iron tusks, O Jātavedas, kindled, touch the sorcerers  
with thy flame (*arcís*); take hold of the false-worshipers with thy  
tongue; cutting off (?) the flesh-eaters, shut them in thy mouth.

## Notes
The comm. reads *dhṛṣṭvā* in **d**, paraphrasing it only with  
*dharṣitvā*. RV. has *vṛkivī́*, which is most probably to be referred to  
root *vṛj*. Ppp. has *datsvā* (for *dhatsva*).

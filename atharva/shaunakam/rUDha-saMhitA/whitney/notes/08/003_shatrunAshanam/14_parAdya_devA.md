title = "१४ पराद्य देवा"

## Translation
14. Let the gods crush away today the wicked one (*vṛjiná*); let \[his\]  
curses sent forth go back upon him; let shafts strike (*ṛch*) in the  
vitals him who steals by \[magic\] speech; let the sorcerer come within  
every one's reach.

## Notes
RV. (vs. 15) reads *tṛṣṭā́s* (for *sṛṣṭā́s*) at end of **b**, and the  
comm. and one of SPP's authorities have the same. The comm. this time  
paraphrases *prásitim* with *prakarṣeṇa abhibhavitrīṁ hetim*, adding as  
alternative *agner jvālām*.

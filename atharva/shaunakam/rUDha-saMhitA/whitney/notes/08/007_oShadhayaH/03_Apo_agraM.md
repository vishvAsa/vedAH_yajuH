## Translation
3. Waters \[were\] the beginning, heavenly herbs; they have made  
disappear from every limb thy sinful (*enasyà*) *yákṣma*.

## Notes
The first pāda is a fragment, in meter and in construction; the omission  
of *ágram* would fairly rectify both. As in sundry other like cases,  
most of the mss. read at the end *anīnaśam* (or *-śaṁ*); only P.M.W.  
have *-śan*.

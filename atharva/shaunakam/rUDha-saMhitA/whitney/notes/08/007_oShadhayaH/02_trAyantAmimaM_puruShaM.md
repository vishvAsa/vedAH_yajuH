title = "०२ त्रायन्तामिमं पुरुषं"

## Translation
2. Let them save (*trā*) this man from the *yákṣma* sent by the  
gods—the plants of which heaven has been the father, earth the mother,  
ocean the root.

## Notes
The second half-verse was found above, as iii. 23. 6 **a, b**. This time  
it is also in Ppp. In **c**, *dyāúṣ* is read by W.I.R.T. We should  
expect *pū́ruṣam* in **a**.

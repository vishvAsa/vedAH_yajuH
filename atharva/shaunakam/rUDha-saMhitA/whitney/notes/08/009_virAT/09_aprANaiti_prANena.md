## Translation
9. Breathless, she goes by the breath of breathing ones (f.); *virā́j*  
goes unto *svarā́j* from behind; *virā́j* that touches, that is adapted  
to, everything—some see her, some see her not.

## Notes
No ms. ⌊of ours⌋ inserts *t* between *-rā́ṭ* and *sva-* in **b** ⌊but  
four of SPP's do so⌋, as required by Prāt. ii. 8 (under which this is  
one of the passages quoted). In **d** we ought properly to have emended  
to *tve...tve* (accentless); all the mss. accent the two words, against  
the uniform usage elsewhere; and the *pada*-mss. commit the further  
blunder of giving both times *tvé íti*, as if the word were the Vedic  
locative of the 2d pers. pronoun (as in v. 2. 3).

title = "१४ अग्नीषोमावदधुर्या तुरीयासीद्"

## Translation
14. She that was fourth set Agni-and-Soma; the seers arranging the (two)  
wings of the sacrifice—*gāyatrī́, triṣṭúbh, jágatī, anuṣṭúbh, bṛhadarkī́*,  
bringing heaven (*svàr*) for the sacrificer.

## Notes
The meter-names in the second half-verse are all in the accusative,  
possibly as coordinate with 'wings' in **b**; but comparison with the  
other texts indicates that the verse is very corrupt. The translation  
implies emendation of *adadhus* to *adadhāt* in **a**; it would not be  
absolutely impossible to take 'the seers' as subject in **a**, and 'her  
that was fourth' as joint object with 'Agni-and-Soma.' Of the other  
texts (as above), TS. begins with *catuṣṭomó abhavad*, and MS. with  
*catuṣṭomám adadhā;* both rectify the meter of **a** by omitting *ā́sīt;*  
in **b** both have *ṛṣayas* as vocative, and after it *bhávantī*, and  
MS. has *pakṣā́* (for -*ṣāú*) before it; in **c**, MS. has *virā́jam* for  
*anuṣṭúbham;* in **d**, TS. begins with *bṛhád arkám*, MS. with *arkám*  
alone; and both follow it with *yuñjānā́ḥ svàr* (TS., of course, *súvar*)  
*ā́ ’bharann idám*. Ppp's only variant is *bṛhadarkīr* in **d**.

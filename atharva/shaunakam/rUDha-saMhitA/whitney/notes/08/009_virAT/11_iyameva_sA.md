## Translation
11. This same is she that first shone forth; among these other ones (f.)  
she goes about having entered; great mightinesses \[are\] within her;  
the woman, the new-going generatrix, hath conquered.

⌊in **a, b**⌋ the same readings as in iii. 10. ⌊4 **a, b**⌋; ⌊and, here  
also, it inverts the order of **c** and **d**⌋.

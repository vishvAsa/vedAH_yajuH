## Translation
10. The down-going in the welkin, not to be ventured down upon, which is  
thine, O death—from that road defending this man, we make *bráhman* a  
covering (*varman*) for him.

## Notes
The comm. reads in **b** *anavadhṛṣyam;* root *dhṛṣ*+ *ava* is found  
only in these two derivatives. For *rajasám* ⌊cf. *Gram.* §1209 b⌋ Ppp.  
has *rajasas;* the comm. simply paraphrases the former by *rajomayam*.  
One or two of the *pada*-mss. (including our Bp.) leave *mṛtyo*  
unaccented in **b**; Ppp. elides *‘nav-* after it; and, in **c**,  
combines *pathāi ’maṁ* (satisfying the meter).

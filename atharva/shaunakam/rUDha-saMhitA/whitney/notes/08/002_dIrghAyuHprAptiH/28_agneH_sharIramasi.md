## Translation
28. Agni's body art thou, successful (*pārayiṣṇú*); demon-slayer art  
thou, rival-slayer, likewise expeller of disease, a remedy *pūtúdru* by  
name.

## Notes
*Pūtúdru* is (OB.) *Acacia catechu* or *Pittus deodora;* the comm. reads  
*pūtadru* and does not attempt ⌊on p. 587⌋ to identify it.\* The mss.  
vary between *-ṇú* and *-ṇús* at end of **a**; our edition reads *-ṇús*  
(with our P.M.E.s.m.); SPP. adopts *-ṇú*, with the great majority of his  
authorities; the comm. has *-ṇus;* Ppp., as noticed above, lacks this  
verse. There is little to choose in point of acceptability between the  
two readings. \*⌊As noted in the introd., the use of the hymn is  
followed in Kāuś. 58. 15 by the binding on of *pūtu-dāru* (so Bl's text,  
with the variant *pūta-;* in citing the text, at p. 568, comm. has  
*pūti-*). This is explained by Daś. Kar. as an "amulet of deodar,"  
*devadārumaṇi;* and so Dār. and Keś. to 8. 15, and comm. p. 567 end.⌋  
⌊The first *anuvāka*, 2 hymns and 49 verses, ends here. The quoted  
Anukr. (cf. end of h. 1) says *ādyasahitam*.⌋

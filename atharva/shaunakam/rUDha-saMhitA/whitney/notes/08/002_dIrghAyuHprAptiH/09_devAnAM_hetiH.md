## Translation
9. Let the missile of the gods avoid thee; I make thee pass from the  
welkin (*rájas*); I have made thee pass up out of death; removing afar  
the flesh-eating Agni, I set for thee an enclosure in order to living.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. reads in **c** *nirāuham;* SPP. follows grammatical rule and  
reads *-haṅ jīv-* this time ⌊cf. note to 1. 19. 4⌋ because all his  
*saṁhitā*-mss. happen to agree in doing so; some of ours, however, do  
not. The comm. explains *rájasas* in **b** as *mūrchālakṣaṇād āvaraṇāt*.  
⌊At 97. 6, Kāuś. gives in full, for use in case of a family quarrel (cf.  
above, introd.), a verse whose first half agrees entirely with the  
second half of this.⌋

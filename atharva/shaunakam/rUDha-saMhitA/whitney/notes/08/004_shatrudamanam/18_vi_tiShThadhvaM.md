## Translation
18. Scatter yourselves, O Maruts, among the people (*vikṣú*); seek,  
seize, crush (*sam-piṣ*) the demoniacs, who, becoming birds, fly in the  
nights, or who have put defilements (*rípas*) on the heavenly sacrifice.

## Notes
RV. has *bhūtvī́* in **c**. SPP. reads *i3cchata* in **a**, because the  
great majority of his authorities give it. This is contrary to the  
established usage of both RV. and AV. (but in accordance with that of  
SV.), although in nearly every such case a part of the mss. lengthen the  
vowel; part of ours do the same here, as elsewhere. The comm. glosses  
*ripas* with *hiṅsas;* and *dadhire* with *dhārayanti!*

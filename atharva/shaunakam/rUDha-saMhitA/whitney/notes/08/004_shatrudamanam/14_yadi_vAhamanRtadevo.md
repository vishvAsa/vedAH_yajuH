title = "१४ यदि वाहमनृतदेवो"

## Translation
14. If I am one of false gods, or if I put upon (? *api-ūh*) the gods  
what is vain, O Agni—why art thou angry with us, O Jātavedas? let them  
of hateful speech obtain (*sac*) misery of thee.

## Notes
RV. reads *ā́sa* instead of *ásmi* at end of **a**. The comm. renders  
*te* in **d** as if it were *té;* for the difficult *apy-ūhé* he gives  
simply *vahāmi* (*moghaṁ vyarthaṁ devān stotavyān yaṣṭavyāṅś ca apyūhe  
vahāmi*).

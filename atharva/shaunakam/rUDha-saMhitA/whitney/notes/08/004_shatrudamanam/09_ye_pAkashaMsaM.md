## Translation
9. They who distract (*vi-hṛ*) with \[their\] courses him of simple  
intent, or who spoil at their will (*svadhā́bhis*) what is excellent—let  
Soma either deliver them up to the serpent, or let him set them in the  
lap of perdition.

## Notes
The comm. declares *svadhā* in **b** an *annanāma*, and renders  
*svadhābhis* by *annāir nimittabhūtāiḥ*, 'for food'! An accent-mark is  
wanting in our text over the *ya* of *dūṣáyanti* in **b**.

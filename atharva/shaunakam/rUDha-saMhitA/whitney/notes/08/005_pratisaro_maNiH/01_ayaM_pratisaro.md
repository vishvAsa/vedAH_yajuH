1. This reverting amulet, a hero, is bound on a hero; heroic,  
rival-slaying, true hero, a very propitious protection.

## Notes
The comm. calls the amulet *tīlakavṛkṣanirmita*, thus ⌊cf. comm. to vss.  
4, 8⌋ identifying *tilaka* and *srāktya*. Ppp. omits our **b** and the  
first words of our **c**, reading as its **b** *sapatnahas suvīraḥ:*  
then *paripāṇaḥ* etc.

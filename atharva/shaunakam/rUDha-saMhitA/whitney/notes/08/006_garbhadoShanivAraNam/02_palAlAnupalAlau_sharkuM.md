title = "०२ पलालानुपलालौ शर्कुं"

## Translation
2. *Palāla* (straw) and *anupalāla* (after-straw), *śárku, kóka*  
(cuckoo), *malimlucá* (robber), *palī́jaka*, the entwiner (*āśréṣa*), the  
wrap-garmented, the bear-necked, the winking one.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *śulkam* for *śarkum* in **a**; in **b**, *malīmṛtaṁ  
palītakam;* in **c**, *aśleṣam*, and adds ⌊cf. vss. 5, 23⌋ at the end  
*muṣkayor apa hanmasi* 'we smite away in the *pudenda*,' which gives a  
construction to the accusatives of which our text is alone made up. The  
comm. gives in **b** *palīcakam;* he supplies *nāśayāmi* to govern the  
accusatives.

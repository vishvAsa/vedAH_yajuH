## Comment
Weber (and Zimmer after him: p. 321) conjectures that the two 'winners of a husband ' are the breasts, and that the reference is to the ceremonious washing of the young child. The numerous names of evil beings in the hymn are in good part unknown elsewhere and untranslatable; of some of them tentative versions can be added in parenthesis. The comm. reads alīças in d, and explains it as ali + īça ⌊taking ali as diseases (or deities representing them) that fly about like bees⌋.

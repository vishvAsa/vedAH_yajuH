## Translation
16. With eyes cast about, not looking forward (? *ápracan̄kaśa*),  
womenless be the eunuchs; make to fall down, O remedy, him who, not her  
husband, tries to approach this woman that has a husband.

## Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *pracan̄kaśās*, and strangely explains it  
⌊alternatively⌋ as = *prakṣīṇorupradeśās;* for *paṇḍagās* in **b** he  
has *pannagās* (*pādena na gacchantaḥ*); for *pādaya* in **c**,  
*pātaya*. Ppp. gives in **e** *svapati*.

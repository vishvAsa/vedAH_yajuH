## Translation
9. Whoever makes this woman one having a dead child (-*vastá*), or a  
miscarriage, him, O herb, do thou make disappear, lustful ⌊accusative⌋  
for her, slippery.

## Notes
The last pāda is very obscure and doubtful, and quite otherwise  
understood by the translators; the version given follows the Petersburg  
Lexicon. The comm. interprets *kamalam* by *garbhadvāram*, and *añjivam*  
by *abhivyaktimad mlakṣaṇopetaṁ vā*, and supplies to them *kuru*. Ppp.  
reads instead *kamalavaṁ dyuvam;* it also reverses the order of  
*mṛtávatsām* and *ávatokām* in **a, b**. *Añjivám* (p. *añji॰vám*) is  
quoted under Prāt. iv. 18 as an example of a word made with a  
*taddhita-*suffix beginning with *v*.

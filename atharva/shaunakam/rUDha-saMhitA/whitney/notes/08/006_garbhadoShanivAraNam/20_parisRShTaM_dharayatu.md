title = "२० परिसृष्टं धरयतु"

## Translation
20. Let \[her\] maintain what is left (?); what is set, let not that  
fall down; let the two formidable remedies, to be borne in the under  
garment, defend thine embryo.

## Notes
*Parisṛṣṭam* in a is very hard to deal with, both on account of the  
meaning and because combinations of root *sṛj* with *pari* are hardly  
met with; the Pet. Lexicon suggests emendation to *-śriṣṭam;* as both  
Ppp. and the comm. have *-śiṣṭam*, I have taken the liberty of so  
translating. The comm. paraphrases it by *homādiviniyogāvaśiṣṭaṁ  
sarṣapadvayam* ⌊see the introduction⌋ and makes it the object of  
*dhārayatu*. Ppp. also reads *yujyatam* for *yad dhitam* in **b**, and,  
at the end, *nivabhāryayāu*. ⌊Whitney queries for **a**: 'Let what is  
wreathed about (*pari-sṛj*) maintain.' This might refer to bandages  
swathed around, to support the abdomen. In **b**, *hitám* would refer to  
the embryo (cf. *dhātā dadhātu* etc.), and *áva pādi* to untimely  
delivery (cf. i. 11. 4-6).⌋

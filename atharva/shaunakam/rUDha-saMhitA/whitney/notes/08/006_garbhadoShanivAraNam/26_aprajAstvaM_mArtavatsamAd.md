## Translation
26. Childlessness, still-birth, also crying, guilt (*aghá*), barrenness  
(? *āvayá*)—that do thou attach to \[our\] enemy (*ápriya*), as if  
having made a garland from a tree.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a, b**, *mārtavatsam āmābhrogham agham ānayam*. The  
comm. has, for *agham āvayam*, *aghavāvayam*, and paraphrases it with  
*aghānām pāpānāṁ tatphalabhūtānāṁ duḥkhānāṁ vā ’sakṛd vayanam*. It is  
curious that both *ā-vayam* and *mārta-vatsam* are quoted in the  
commentary to Prāt. iv. 18, as if their second member were 'a *taddhita*  
beginning with *v*.'—⌊Cf. MB. i. 1. 14; MP. i. 4. 11.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 48 verses. It is also  
the end of the sixth *artha-sūkta*, which begins with *yāú te*. The  
quoted Anukr. says *yāu te*.⌋  
  
    
From this point on, the commentary is wanting until the beginning of  
book xi. 7.

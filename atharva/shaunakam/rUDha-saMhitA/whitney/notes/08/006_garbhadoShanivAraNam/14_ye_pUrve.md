title = "१४ ये पूर्वे"

## Translation
14. They who go before a woman, bearing horns (pl.) in the hand, stayers  
in the oven, laughing out, who make light in the tuft—them we make to  
disappear from here.

## Notes
All our mss., and nearly all those of SPP., read *badhvàs* in **a**, and  
our edition follows them. SPP. gives in his text *vadhvàs*, with the  
commentator. In **c**, he adopts *āpākeṣṭhā́s*, with a small minority of  
his mss., and directly against Prāt. ii. 94, which prescribes *-sthā́s*.  
One would like to emend to *apāk-* 'standing aloof.'

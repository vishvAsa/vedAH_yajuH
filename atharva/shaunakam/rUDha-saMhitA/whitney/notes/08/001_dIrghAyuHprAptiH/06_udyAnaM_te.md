## Translation
6. Up-going \[be\] thine, O man, not down-going; length of life  
(*jīvā́tu*), ability, I make for thee; for do thou ascend this immortal  
easy-running chariot, then shalt thou in advanced age (? *jírvi*) speak  
to the council (*vidátha*).

## Notes
Both here and at xiv. 1. 21, our mss. on the whole read decidedly  
*jírvis* (only P.M. have *jivrís*, Bp. *jívis*, here), and SPP. reports  
all his authorities without exception as giving it, so that it is  
without question the true AV. reading (as against RV. *jívri*); the  
comm. reads *ajirvis*, and glosses it with *ajīrṇas*, and Ludwig renders  
'lebenskräftig.'

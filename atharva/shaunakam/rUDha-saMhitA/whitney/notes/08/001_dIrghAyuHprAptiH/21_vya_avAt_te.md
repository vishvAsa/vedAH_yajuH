## Translation
21. It hath shone out for thee; it hath become light; darkness hath  
departed from thee; away from thee we set down death \[and\] perdition,  
away the *yákṣma*.

## Notes
The comm. also recognizes *vy avāt* as coming from root *vas* 'shine,'  
glossing it with *vyāucchat:* compare *tasmāi vyāuchat* PB. xvi. 1. 1.  
⌊For the form, cf. Gram. §890 a and §167.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
⌊The first *artha-sūkta*, so called (see above, p. 472, top), ends here.  
The quoted Anukr. says *ekaviṅśakam ihā ”dyam ucyate*. It adds, further,  
*sūktaśaś ca gaṇanā pravartate.*⌋  
  
⌊See p. cxl.⌋

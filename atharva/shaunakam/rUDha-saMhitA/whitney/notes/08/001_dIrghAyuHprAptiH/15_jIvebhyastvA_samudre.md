title = "१५ जीवेभ्यस्त्वा समुद्रे"

## Translation
15. Let Vāyu, Indra, Dhātar, the preserving Savitar, assign thee unto  
converse with the living; let not breath, strength, leave thee; we call  
after thy life.

## Notes
The *pada*-text has *sam॰úde* in **a**, and the translation follows this  
(cf. *vy॰úṣi* from root *vas*), as being on the whole probably the  
understanding of the text-makers; if they had seen in the word anything  
of the root *mud*, they would have divided *sa॰múde;* and yet it is very  
likely that it is a corruption for *sam॰múde;* the comm. glosses it with  
*sammodāya*, as if the reading were *sammúde*. No variant from Ppp. is  
noted. The comm. divides our 15-17 into two long verses, ending 15 with  
*kathā́ syāḥ*. His intention seems to be to make just twenty verses of  
the hymn.

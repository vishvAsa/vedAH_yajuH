## Translation
19. I have made thee pass up out of death; let the vigor-givers blow  
together; let not the women of disheveled locks, let not the  
evil-wailers, wail for thee.

## Notes
The 'evil-wailers,' perhaps professional lamenters of death or other  
misfortune, appear again at xi. 2. 11. The comm., in **a**, has  
*apīparan*, which SPP., without sufficient reason, is inclined to regard  
as the original reading. For the fuller use of 'blow together,' see 2. 4  
below. ⌊For *agha-rúd*, see Bloomfield, AJP. xi. 339; Caland,  
*Todtengebräuche*. Note 106. See also his note 517.⌋

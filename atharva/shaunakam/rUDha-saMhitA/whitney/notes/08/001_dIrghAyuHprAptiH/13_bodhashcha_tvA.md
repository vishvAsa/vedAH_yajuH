## Translation
13. Let both the knower and the attender defend thee; let both the  
sleepless one and the unslumbering one defend thee; let both the  
guardian and the wakeful one protect thee.

## Notes
In *bodhá* and *pratībodhá*, in **a**, the radical sense is perhaps more  
that of 'wake.' The comm. understands six rishis bearing these several  
appellations to be intended. ⌊Cf. the closely related v. 30. 10, above;  
also MGS. ii. 15. 1 a, b, c, d, and the Index to their *pratīkas*.⌋ A  
similar formula is found also in K. xxxvii. 10; compare further PGS.  
iii. 4. 17. Ppp. reads *anavadrāṇiś ca* in **b**. ⌊In **b**, the first  
ca might be dropped, without hurting the meter.⌋

## Comment
The first half-verse is nearly identical with RV. x. 129. 4 a, b ⌊TB. ii. 4. 11; 8. 94; TA. i. 23. 1⌋, which differ only by adding ádhi at end of a; the word is missed in our verse both for sense and for meter. Our text omits* at beginning of c a sá (sá kāma) that is in both these respects superfluous; it is found, however, also in Ppp. The comm. explains kā́mena bṛhatā́ to mean mahatā deśakālavastuparicchedarahitena kāmayitrā parameśvareṇa. The last pāda is xviii. 1. 43 d. *⌊And so accents kā́ma.⌋

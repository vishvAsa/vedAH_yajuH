## Translation
9. In that we have said O waters, O inviolable \[kine\], O Varuṇa, from  
that sin do thou free us, O thou of thousand-fold heroism.

## Notes
That is, if we have called these divinities to witness an untruth: cf.  
the nearly equivalent vii. 83. 2 **c-e**. The translation implies  
emendation to *ághnyās;* *váruṇa*, which can be only vocative, proves  
each of its predecessors such; the comm. understands all the three as  
vocative, and paraphrases \[*he*\] *āpo yūyaṁ jānīdhve*, he aghnyā  
*yūyam mama cittaṁ jānīdhve*, etc. Ppp. reads in **b** *varuṇena yad*.  
Our mss. read again *páryaṅh-* (p. *pári॰aṅhasaḥ*), and so apparently do  
SPP's, although he does not distinctly say so; ⌊his note to vs. 8 (note  
2, p. 455) perhaps makes such an implication⌋.

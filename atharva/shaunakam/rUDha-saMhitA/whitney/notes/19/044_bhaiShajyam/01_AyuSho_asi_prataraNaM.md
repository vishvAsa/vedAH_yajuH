## Translation
1. Thou art an extender of life-time; all-healing art thou called; so, O  
ointment, do thou \[make\] wealfulness; make, O ye waters, weal \[and\]  
fearlessness.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, which is variously emended. In **b**,  
the mss. and comm. and SPP. read *vípram bheṣajám;* the comm. explains  
*vipram* as *prīṇayitṛ* (as if it were somehow *priyam*) *vipravac  
chuddhaṁ vā*. Ppp. gives *vipre*. In **c**, all have *śaṁtāte*, glossed  
by the comm. with *śaṁrūpa* ⌊the ms. of the comm. actually has *-pam*⌋.  
In **d**, all accent *ā́pas*, and also (with one accidental exception)  
*kṛtám;* but one of our mss. (probably also by accident) gives *kṛtá*,  
which we adopted, with emendation to *kṛta;* ⌊if I understand W's  
Collation Book, his B. has *kṛta*, without accent;⌋ SPP. is satisfied  
with emending to *kṛtam*, as if *āñjana* and *āpas* could somehow be  
construed together as a dual subject. Part of the mss. have *ucyate* at  
end of **b**. The *pada*-mss. read *śaṁtāte* without division. Ppp. has  
for second half-verse *yad āñjani draṁ śaṁtāte aśināyo bhavaṁ kṛtam*,  
which is too corrupt to be of any assistance.

## Comment
⌊Partly prose: verses 4 and 5.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xv. Used, according to the comm., with an ointment amulet, by Nakṣ.K. 19, in a mahāśānti ceremony called nāirṛtī, when one is seized by nirṛti (destruction). ⌊Verse 4 is quoted in sakalapāṭha by Kāuś. at 47. 16, to accompany the taking of a staff in a witchcraft ceremony.⌋

Translated: Griffith, ii. 300.—He very pertinently notes that this hymn closely resembles in parts iv. 9. See W's notes thereon.

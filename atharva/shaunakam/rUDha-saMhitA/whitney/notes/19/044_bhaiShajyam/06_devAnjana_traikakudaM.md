## Translation
6. O divine ointment, thou from the three-peaked \[mountain\], do thou  
protect me all about; the herbs do not surpass (*tṛ*) thee—those from  
abroad and those from the mountains.

## Notes
All the mss. ⌊save one of SPP's⌋ read *dévāñjanam* (p. *déva॰āñj-*)  
*trāíkakudam;* SPP. emends the former to *-na*, but not the latter to  
*-da*, although this is as indisputably vocative as the other; the comm.  
⌊with one of SPP's mss.⌋ makes the same difference, though he regards  
*trāikakudam* as vocative (*he trāik-*). Ppp. reads *devāñjani  
trāikakuda*. ⌊As to the rarity of neuter vocatives, see my  
*Noun-Inflection*, p. 339.⌋ The great majority of mss. accent *bāhyā́s;*  
SPP. reads *bā́hyās*. The comm. understands the word as meaning "from  
other localities than the mountains." Our emendation to *bāṭyā́s*,  
supported by an article ⌊2. *vāṭyá* 'cultivated'⌋ in the major Pet. Lex.  
⌊vi. 903⌋ is withdrawn by the omission of that article in the minor Lex.  
Ppp. reads corruptly *bāhyaṁ parvatyā*.

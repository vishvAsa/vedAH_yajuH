## Translation
10. Both Mitra and Varuṇa went forth after thee, O ointment; they,  
having gone far after thee, brought thee back for enjoyment (*bhogá*).

## Notes
All the authorities ⌊save W's E. and one of SPP's reciters⌋, and Ppp.  
also, give at the end *púnar ohatu;* but the *pada*-mss. give *púnaḥ;  
rohatu*, which is a blunder, since the corresponding *saṁhitā* would be  
*púnā rohatu* ⌊which W's E. in fact has⌋. SPP. emends to *púnar ó  
”hatuḥ* (p. *púnaḥ: ā́: ūhatuḥ*), and the translation follows this,  
rather than our own nearly equivalent and equally acceptable emendation  
to *púnar ó ”hatām*. ⌊Whitney here overlooks the lack of accent on the  
*oh-*: the Berlin text, the text of W's Collation Book, and his *Index*,  
under 1 *ūh*, all give *ohatām* without accent. Root 1 *ūh* does not  
appear to be quotable with **a**, and it would seem that SPP's  
emendation (root *vah* with **a**) must of need be preferred.⌋ The  
comm., ⌊with his text, and with SPP's reciter V., who accented *púnar  
āhatuḥ*,⌋ gives *punar āhatuḥ* (= *punar āgantavyam ity ūcatuḥ!*). ⌊We  
might better render *bhogāya* by ' for our use?⌋ Half the mss. accent  
with us *ánu préy-* in **b**; SPP. gives *anu*, with the *pada*-text  
(*anu॰préyatuḥ*).

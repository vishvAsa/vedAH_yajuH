## Translation
1. Have set down apart the human deadly weapon Indra-and-Agni, Dhātar,  
Savitar, Bṛihaspati, king Soma, Varuṇa, the Aśvins, Yama; let Pūshan  
protect us round about from death.

## Notes
It is quite as likely that 'Soma' etc. in the second half-verse should  
be viewed as coördinate with Pūshan. The translation omits *yám* in  
**a**; it seems probable that **a** is deeply corrupt ⌊Caland, KZ.  
xxxiv. 456, citing Avestan usage, takes *pāúruṣeyaṁ vadháṁ yám* as  
accusative of the crystallized combination *pāúruṣeyo vadhó yáḥ* which  
we had at i. 30. 1: see note to xii. 2. 19. But W's suspicion is  
weighty.⌋ All the mss. accent *nyádhus* (the *pada*-mss. having, against  
all rule and practice, *nyádhuḥ*, instead of *ni॰ádhuḥ* or *ní: adhuḥ*),  
and SPP. follows them (in p. also); our *nyàdhus* is an emendation,  
apparently a necessary one—unless we can construe, with the comm.,  
**b-d** as together constituting the apodosis: 'what means of death for  
men \[our enemies\] have fixed in secret—from \[that\] death let  
Indra-and-Agni etc. etc. protect us.' ⌊Griffith: 'May Soma etc. guard us  
from Mṛityu—death caused by men, which Indra etc. appointed.'⌋ The verse  
is far too irregular (11 + 12: 12 + 9 = 44) to be called simply a  
*triṣṭubh*.

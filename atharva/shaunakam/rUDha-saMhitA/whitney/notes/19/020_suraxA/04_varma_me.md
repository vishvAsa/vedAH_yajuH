## Translation
4. Defense for me may heaven-and-earth, defense may day, defense may the  
sun, defense for me may all the gods make; let not the affrontress (?  
*pratīcikā́*) reach me.

## Notes
Some of the mss. leave *pratīcikā* accentless, and nearly all accent  
*krán;* both editions have *kran* and *-kā́*. The comm. seems to read  
*agnis* instead of *áhas* in **b**, and *mo* for *mā́* in **d**. The  
comm. paraphrases *pratīcikā* as *śatrusenā ’jñātapratikūlāñcanā* (*ka*  
being added to *pratīcī "ajñātārthe"*); the ⌊minor⌋ Pet. Lex.  
conjectures 'discomfort' (*Ungemach*); the translation above is of  
course only tentative. To be compared with the verse is viii. 5. 18  
above; found also in AśS. i. 2. 1, which has our **a, b** (but reading  
*agnis* with our comm.), and, for third pāda, *varma me santu  
tirścikāḥ;* and in Āp. xiv. 26. 1, with *agnis* in **b**, and, for **c,  
d**, *varma me brahmaṇaspatir mā mā prāpad ato bhayam*.  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 11 hymns and 72 verses. If we  
counted hymn 16 as of 3 verses, there would be 73. Some mss. sum up the  
verses as 72, and thus support the numeration of hymn 16 as given by  
both editions (see p. 923).⌋

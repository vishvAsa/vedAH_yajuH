## Translation
2. Burner of the heart of the hater, causing to burn the mind of foes,  
do thou, O *darbhá*, burn together like heat (*gharmá*) against all the  
evil-hearted.

## Notes
The mss., and hence SPP., read for **a** *dviṣatás tāpáyan hṛdáḥ*, as if  
*hṛdás* could be an accus. sing.; and the comm. has the same, and  
glosses *hṣdas* with *hṛdayam*. ⌊By some oversight, SPP. says on p. 384,  
note 3, that the text of the comm. reads *sarvaṅs tvaṁ;* and on p. 385,  
note 1, "Sāyaṇa's text too has *sarvaṁ.*"⌋ The comm. explains as if the  
⌊questionable⌋ word were simply *sarvam*, 'the evil-hearted one's  
everything.' In **d**, the mss. and SPP. read *ivā ’bhī́nt saṁtāpáyan*  
(one of ours *abhī́t*, another *abhāút:* mere accidental variations), the  
*pada*-text presenting *abhī́n: sam॰*; the comm. has the same, and  
explains thus: *abhīn abhayān saṁtāpayan bhinddhi* ⌊*iti sambandhaḥ:*  
connecting the phrase with the *bhinddhi* of vss. 3, 4, 5⌋. Our  
*abhisáṁtāpaya* is heroic surgery, but very plausible; *abhī́ ’t s-*  
(i.e. *abhí: ít: s-*) would save a little more of the original, and *ít*  
is elsewhere added to reinforce *abhí:* cf. viii. 4. 21; xi. 1. 6; Ppp.  
has very nearly this reading, namely, *gharme ’vā ’bhī ’t saṁtāpayaṁ*.  
The comm. glosses *gharmas* first with *ādityas*, then (on authority of  
TA. v. 1. 5) with *pravargyas*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
redundancies caused in 2 **d** and 3 **a** and **d** and 4 **c** if  
*iva* is not abbreviated to *’va;* in at least two of the cases, 2 **d**  
and 3 **d**, Ppp. combines to suit the meter, *gharme ’va, indrāi ’va*.  
⌊The first pāda is wanting in Ppp.⌋

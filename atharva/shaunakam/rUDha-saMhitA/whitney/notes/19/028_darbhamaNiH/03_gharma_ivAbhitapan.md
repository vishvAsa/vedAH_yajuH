## Translation
3. Burning against \[them\] like heat, O *darbhá*, burning down the  
haters, O amulet, split thou our rivals to the heart, like Indra  
breaking apart Vala.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation in **d** to *valám*, as made in our  
edition; SPP. follows the mss. and comm. in accepting *balám*, in spite  
of its false accent. Nearly all the mss. read *virujám* (p. *vi॰rujám*),  
but the comm. *-jan*, which, of course, is alone admissible; SPP. very  
strangely compromises by reading *virujáṁ* in *saṁhitā*, but *vi॰ruján*  
in *pada!* In **c**, SPP. gives, with ⌊five of his authorities⌋, *-dáḥ  
sapátnānām bhinddhi;* even the *pada*-mss. vary between *sa॰pátnān: ā́:  
bh-* and *sa॰pátnānām: bh-*; the comm. has *-nānām*, and so has Ppp.;  
the translation above implies *-nān ā́*,\* in spite of the separation of  
*ā́* from *hṛdás*. ⌊Ppp. gives *indrāi ’va* in **d**, as noted under vs.  
2.⌋ \*⌊This reading is given by eight of SPP's mss. and one of W's. In  
*sapátnānām* we may have a case of faulty assimilation from 4 **a**:  
SPP's Dc., which is usually carefully corrected, here carries the  
blunder half way prima manu, giving *sapátnānā́m* (accents! so perhaps  
also W's O.D.L.), and completes it secunda manu, giving *sapátnānām*.⌋

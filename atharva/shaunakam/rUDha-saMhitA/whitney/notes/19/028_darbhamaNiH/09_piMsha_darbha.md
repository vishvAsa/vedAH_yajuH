title = "०९ पिंश दर्भ"

## Translation
9. Carve (?), O *darbhá*, my rivals; carve those etc. etc.

## Notes
The Pet. Lex. (under root *piṣ*) proposes to emend in this verse *pinśá*  
to *piṅsá*. As, however, we have root *piṣ* below in 29. 6, there seems  
to be no sufficient reason for substituting it here. One of SPP's mss.  
reads here *pīṅṣá* p.m. ⌊*piṅśá* s.m.⌋.

## Translation
5. A golden-horned bull \[is\] this amulet of *śatávāra;* having  
shattered (*tṛh*) all the ill-named ones, it hath trodden down the  
demons.

## Notes
A few of the authorities ⌊some confusing the primary with the  
*vṛddhi*-derivative⌋ read in **b** *śatávāras* or *śatavārás* or  
*śātávāras*. In **c**, all the mss. ⌊save perhaps W's B.⌋ read *tṛḍhvā́*,  
which SPP. mistakenly emends to *tṛḍḍhvā́* (as if one were to emend the  
*ḍhvā* of *rūḍhvā* and *līḍhvā* to *-ḍḍhvā*). Ppp. is corrupt, giving  
*durṇās tris sarvās triḍhvā apa rakṣāṅsy apa kramīm*. The second half of  
vs. 4 and the first half of vs. 5 are wanting in Ppp.

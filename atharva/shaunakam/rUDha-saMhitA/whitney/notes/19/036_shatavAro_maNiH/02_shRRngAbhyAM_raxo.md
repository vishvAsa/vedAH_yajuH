## Translation
2. With its two horns it thrusts away the demon, with its root the  
sorceresses; with its middle it drives off (*bādh*) the *yákṣma;* no  
evil overpasses it.

## Notes
All the mss., the comm., and Ppp., read at the end *tatrati*, which we  
emended to *tarati*, as the other seems an inconceivable 3d sing.; the  
comm. glosses it with *atikrāmati*, and explains the form by *śluḥ śaś  
ce ’ti vikaraṇadvayam*. The comm. explains the 'two horns' as "the two  
parts of its apex, set on like horns." The mention of a "root" is, of  
course, an indication (though not a certain one) that a plant is  
intended.

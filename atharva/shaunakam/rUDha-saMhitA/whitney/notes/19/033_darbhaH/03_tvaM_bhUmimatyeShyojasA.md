## Translation
3. Thou goest across the earth with force; thou sittest beauteous  
(*cā́ru*) on the sacrificial hearth at the sacrifice; the seers bore thee  
\[as\] purifier; do thou purify us from difficulties.

## Notes
Literally, 'purify (remove, strain out) difficulties from us.' ⌊As to  
**a**, Griffith notes appositely that "the \[darbha\] grass spreads with  
great rapidity, re-rooting itself continually."⌋ In **c**, the  
translation follows the text of SPP., who emends *bhā́rantas* of all the  
mss. ⌊save one⌋ and of our edition to *abharanta* on the authority of  
the comm. alone. Ppp. reads *bhūmig ady eṣy oj-*. The comm. quotes TB.  
i. 3. 7¹ to prove that *darbha* is properly called a 'purifier' or  
'strainer.' There is not a bit of *pan̄kti*-character in the verse; ⌊with  
the ordinary resolutions, and that of *bhuumim* besides, it scans easily  
as 12 + 12: 11 + 11;⌋ of course it can be scanned down to 40 syllables  
by neglecting easy and natural resolutions. ⌊The verse is quoted by  
Kāuś. in full at 2. 1 and by *pratīka* at 137. 32: cf. p. 897, ¶3, and  
see Bloomfield's notes to the passages of Kāuś.⌋

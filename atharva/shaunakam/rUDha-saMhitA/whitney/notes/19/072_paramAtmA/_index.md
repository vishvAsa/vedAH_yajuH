It is given in full* in the Kāuś. text (139. 26), at the end of the ceremony of commencement of Vedic study; ⌊and the pratīka is cited at 139. 25;⌋ and the scholiasts add its use at the end of the parvan ceremonies (Keś. to section 6; p. 310, l. 5), and of the piṇḍapitṛyajña (Keś. to 89. 17; p. 371, l. 12), and to the snānavrata (note to 42. 18). *⌊As to the citation in sakalapāṭha, cf. p. 897, ¶3.⌋

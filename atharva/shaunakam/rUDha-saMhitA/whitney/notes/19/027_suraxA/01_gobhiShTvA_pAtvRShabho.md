## Translation
1. Let the bull (*ṛṣabhá*) protect thee with the kine; let the virile  
one (*vṛ́ṣan*) protect thee with the vigorous ones (*vājín*); let Vāyu  
protect thee with *bráhman;* let Indra protect thee with Indra's powers  
(? *indriyá*).

## Notes
The comm. reads in **a** *vṛṣabhas*.\* In **b**, he naturally  
understands horses as intended, and connects *vājin* with the root *vij*  
(*vājibhir vejanavadbhiḥ śīghragatibhir aśvāiḥ*). Of *bráhman* he gives  
three different and equally worthless explanations. To *indriya* he says  
*indriyāṇy atre ’ndrasṛṣṭānī ’ndrajuṣṭāni vā*, which gives us no help.  
\*⌊But the text of the comm. has *pātv ṛṣabhas*.⌋

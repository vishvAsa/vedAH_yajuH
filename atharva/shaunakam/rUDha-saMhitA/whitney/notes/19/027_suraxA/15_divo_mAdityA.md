## Translation
15. From the sky let the Ādityas defend me, from the earth let the  
fires defend; let Indra-and-Agni defend me in front; let the Aśvins  
yield refuge round about; crosswise let the inviolable \[cow\], let  
Jātavedas, defend \[me\]; let the being-makers be my defense on all  
sides.

## Notes
These two verses are a repetition of 16. 1, 2 above, and in our mss., as  
usual, are read simply thus: *asapatnám purástād íti dvé*. The Anukr.  
does not repeat its definition of their meter; inasmuch as it reckons  
the hymn as of fifteen verses, it plainly takes the addition here as of  
two verses only; the comm., however, again counts three, making of ⌊our  
15 **a, b**⌋ a separate verse\*; ⌊cf. notes to 16. 2⌋. In general, the  
comm. does not comment for the second time a repeated passage; here,  
however, he gives a full explanation, as if it were the first appearance  
of the verses; and in 14 **b** (perhaps merely by an oversight?) he  
reads *me* instead of *nas*. \*⌊The comm. in fact takes our vss. 11-13  
as one vs., his 11; our 14 as his 12; our 15 **ab** as his 13; and our  
15 **c-f** as his 14. Or, he says, we may take our 14 with 15 **ab** as  
one *mantra*. He reads *agnis* again in our **e** as in 16. 2 **e**.⌋

## Translation
10. Thirty-three deities and three heroisms guarded \[it\] within the  
waters, holding \[it\] dear; what gold there is upon this shining one (?  
*candrá*), therewith shall this man do heroisms.

## Notes
All the mss. read in **b** *priyā́yamā́ṇā* (p. *priyā́ya: mā́ṇā!*); but here  
again SPP. has the courage to follow us in emending to *priyāyámāṇās*  
(p. *priya॰yámāṇāḥ*), since the comm. so understands it; it is only a  
question whether in *pada*-text *-māṇā* should not rather be read, as  
agreeing with the nearer of the two nouns; the comm. takes it as fem.  
(*priyam ivā ”carantyaḥ*). The Anukr. is curiously confused here; after  
correctly defining the verse *devānāṁ nihitaṁ nidhim* as a *triṣṭubh*,  
it proceeds to define *āpo hiraṇyaṁ jugupuḥ* as a *jagatī*, and takes no  
note of *trayastriṅśad devatāḥ* as a *pratīka*. Probably there is a  
*quid pro quo* here, by a slip of memory; but one does not see how this  
highly irregular\* verse (13 + 11: 10 + 11 = 45) should be called simply  
a *jagatī*. ⌊With **a**, cf. 37. 1 **c**, below.⌋ \*⌊Possibly we have to  
substitute the older grammatical equivalent in **a**, *trī́ ca vīryā̀*  
(cf. 3 **b**); a *‘sti* before *ádhi* would mend **c**.⌋

## Translation
3. They call the heavens (*dív*) three, the earths three, the  
atmospheres three, the oceans four, the song of praise (*stóma*) triple,  
the waters triple: let these triple ones defend thee with the triple  
ones.

## Notes
In Ppp., **b** and **c** have apparently dropped out, and **d** is made  
to end with *trivṛtās trivṛttibhiḥ*. The mss. vary between *trivṛ́ta*  
(which both editions read), *trivṛ́tās*, and *trivṛ́tāt;* the translation  
implies *trivṛ́tas*, which the comm. has, and which is pretty evidently  
the intent of the verse; ⌊cf. vs. 9 **d**, below⌋. The mss. to a great  
extent read *tṛv-* instead of *triv-*, as in other like cases. In **a**  
in our text, emend to *tisráḥ*. We need to combine *trivṛtā ”pa ā-* in  
**c** to make a good *triṣṭubh*. ⌊I doubt if it is a *triṣṭubh*. To  
reckon *trī́ṇi* to pāda **a** is very harsh. I suspect we have to  
pronounce *pṛthvī́s* in **a**, and to read and pronounce *trī́ṇy  
antárikṣā* in **b**. Thus the verse scans as 8 + 11: 11 + 11.⌋

## Translation
1. Do thou, O night, make the snake blind, harsh-smoked, headless; smite  
out the eyes of the wolf; cast the thief into the snare.

## Notes
This verse is nearly identical with that translated as 47. 8 above (8  
**c, d** and 9 **a, b** of the printed text). As there, the mss. have at  
the beginning *ándha*, which SPP., with the comm., changes to *ádha;*  
and all, in **c, d**, have *nír jahyās téna\* táṁ* ⌊or *tváṁ*⌋ *drupadé  
jahi* in a manner analogous with the reading there. ⌊The translation  
implies the division *nír jahy ā́...jahi:* cf. my note to 47. 8.⌋ ⌊Apart  
from some less important variants.⌋ the mss. are divided, as often in  
such cases, between *akṣāú* and *akṣyāú*, and SPP. chooses the worse,  
*akṣāú;* our *akṣyāù* is alone defensible. Ppp. omits (see note to 49.  
10) the first two words, and reads, as at 47. 8, *tiṣṭadhūmam;* ⌊it  
begins the second line with *hano vṛkasya* and ends it (as above) with  
*nṛpate jahi;* what the intervening words are is not clear from Roth's  
Collation⌋. ⌊Meantime Bloomfield kindly informs me that Ppp. reads the  
line thus: *hano vṛkasya nir jahy ā tvāinaṁ nṛpate jahi:* this gives no  
support for a *jahyās* (see note to 47. 8); but the *tvāinaṁ* obviously  
stands in some relation to the *dvāinaṁ* of the Ppp. reading at 47. 8,  
which is *jambhayādvāinaṁ*.⌋ \*⌊The *pada*-reading is *níḥ: jahyāḥ:  
téna*.⌋

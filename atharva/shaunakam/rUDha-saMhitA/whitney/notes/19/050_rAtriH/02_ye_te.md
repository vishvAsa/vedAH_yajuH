## Translation
2. What draft-oxen thou hast, O night, sharp-horned, very swift, with  
them do thou today pass us always (*viśváhā*) over difficulties.

## Notes
SPP. follows the mss. in the false accent *tī́kṣṇa-* in **b**. In **c,  
d**, he reads *pārayā́ ’ti* with us and with the comm. (also with Ppp.),  
⌊but against the mss., most of which⌋ have *pārayaty áti*. In **b**,  
Ppp. gives *-śṛn̄gyāśvāsavaḥ*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
3. May we pass (  
  
  
*tṛ*  
  
  
) night after night receiving no harm with ourselves (  
  
  
*tanvā̀*  
  
  
); may the niggards fail to pass \[it\], as men without boats a deep  
\[water\].  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Or *tanvā* belongs to *tarema*. The comm., against the accent and the  
sense, takes *áriṣyantas* as a future participle (= *gamiṣyantas*)! Ppp.  
reads in **c, d** *apravāyuṣaṁ na tarehur ar-*.

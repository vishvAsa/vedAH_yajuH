## Translation
4. Let the former Ashāḍhās give me food; let the latter ones bring  
refreshment; let Abhijit give me what is auspicious; let śravaṇa \[and\]  
the śravishṭhās make good prosperity.

## Notes
Here are more bad readings: in **a**, the mss. give *pū́rvā rāsatām*, and  
SPP. accepts the reading, as if *rāsatām* could be 3d du. act., which,  
in view of all the circumstances, is absurd; our emendation to *-ntām*  
is unavoidable.\* In **b**, the mss. vary between *dehy útt-* ⌊all of  
Whitney's and most of SPP's⌋ and *devy útt-*, and SPP. adopts the  
latter, because the comm. has it; but then the comm. makes no difficulty  
of understanding it as = *devyas;* it is merely, in his opinion, a Vedic  
substitution of sing. for pl.; and it is to be hoped that no modern  
scholar would follow him in that. The emendation of our text to *yé hy  
úttare*,† considering that all our mss. (and all but two of SPP's  
authorities) have *úttare* (p. *út॰tare*), was a naturally suggested and  
easy one; but we need instead *yā́ hy úttarā ā́*, feminine words, like the  
*pū́rvās* ⌊the *pada*-mss. and the Anukr. read *pū́rvā* in **a**; SPP.  
reads *úttarās*, with the comm. and two of his reciters. The meter of  
**d** would be better if we had *śróṇas* for *śrávaṇas;* but the Anukr.  
acknowledges the redundancy of the verse.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
\*⌊SPP. seems rather to view *rāsatām* in **a** as of the plural number,  
3d person imperative middle, = *dadatu* (the ms. of the comm. has in  
fact *dadātu*, singular): and plural 3d it might be (from the *s*-aorist  
tense-stem *rās*, used as a secondary root: *Gram.* §896), thus  
conforming in number with *vahantu*. On the other hand, we cannot take  
*rāsatām* in **c** otherwise than as of the singular number, 3d person  
imperative middle of the *a*-conjugation, present-stem *rāsa:* and the  
identical form in **a** ought, one would think, to be of the same value.  
If we take it as singular, and read *aṣāḍhā́* as fem. and sing, so as to  
conform with *pū́rvā* (p. *pū́rvā*), then pāda **b** is intolerably out of  
congruity with **a** in the matters of gender and number.—I offer the  
following suggestions for what they may be worth. First, in spite of the  
(unauthoritative) *pada*-reading *út॰tare*, I would take the *úttarā ā́*  
of the living reciters K.V. as representing a correct metrical utterance  
of úttarā́ (= *út॰tarā: ā́*). Secondly, for *vahantu* I would read  
*vahātu* (cf. *svadātu, nudātu, muñcātu*): this seems to me better than  
a possible *vahāti*, and does as little violence to the tradition as the  
*rāsantām* and *yé hy úttare* suggested above. If our *vahantu* is a  
corruption, it may well be a faulty assimilation (cf. end of ¶4 of note  
on xviii. 4. 87) of *vahātu* to the ending of vs. 5 **d**.—My text then  
would be as follows: *ánnam pū́rvā* (p. *-vā*) *rāsatām* (as 3d sing.)  
*me aṣāḍhórjam* (p. *-ḍhā́: ū́r-*) *devy úttarā́ vahātu* (p. *devī́: úttarā:  
ā́: vahātu*): 'may the Former Ashāḍhā give me food; may the Latter, the  
divine one, bring refreshment.'⌋ †⌊'appears from the Collation Book that  
RW. meant in fact to print *yé hy útta-*: but the Berlin ed. has  
actually *yé hy ùtta-*, an accent-mark having perhaps slipped to the  
left, over *hyu* from over *tta*.⌋

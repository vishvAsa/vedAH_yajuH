## Translation
3. Be the former Phalgunīs and Hasta here auspicious (*púṇyam*); be  
Chitrā propitious, and Svāti easy (*sukhá*) for me; be the two Viśākhās  
bestowal (*rā́dhas*), Anurādhā easy of invocation, Jyeshṭhā a good  
asterism, Mūla uninjured.

## Notes
There are sundry difficulties in this verse, in part attempted to be  
removed by emendation in our edition. It is very strange to find in  
**a** the former Phalgunīs distinctly mentioned, and the latter  
(*uttara*) as distinctly left out; it would be easy to put the *dvayā́*  
of 5 **b** in place of *pū́rvā* here;\* or one wonders whether *uttara*  
is not somehow hidden in the awkwardly redundant *átra*. All the mss.  
(both *saṁh.* and *pada*) agree in the ungrammatical ⌊ending *-tí* of⌋  
*svātí*, and SPP. accordingly admits *svātí* into his text: ours emends  
to *svātís:* *svātī́* would have been equally acceptable, and is  
supported by two of SPP's śrotriyas ⌊V. and K.⌋ and by the comm. The  
masc. *sukhás* (p. *su॰kháḥ*) can hardly be tolerated; we ought to have  
*sukhám*, or else, with the comm., *sukhā́*. All the mss. read in **c**  
*rā́dhe*, as if there were an adjective *rā́dha;* SPP. and the comm. read  
*rā́dhe*, the latter explaining it as another name for *viśākhe* (not a  
word defining the expected blessing!): this involves an anachronism,†  
and would be in the highest degree improbable even if it did not:  
*rā́dho* is a very easy and plausible improvement. Finally, all the mss.  
have in **d** *áriṣṭa mū́lam* ⌊cf. note to xviii. 2. 3⌋, which SPP.  
adopts, in spite of its utter ungrammaticalness; the comm., with his  
usual disregard of *pada*-text and accent, appears to understand  
*ariṣṭamūlam*, a compound. \*⌊Or rather to put *dvayé?* The comm.  
renders *pū́rvā* by *pūrve*, for which *pū́rvā* is a bad reading or a  
worse solecism. But the position of ca*,* too, is very suspicious.⌋ †⌊I  
suppose Whitney's implication is that *rādhā*, as a name for the 14th  
(or 16th) asterism *viśākhā*, is a later one, based on a  
misunderstanding of the name of the 15th (or 17th) asterism, *anurādhā*,  
which word simply means 'success' (cf. *ánv eṣām arātsmé ’ti: tád  
anūrādhā́ḥ*, TB. i. 5. 2⁸), but was thought of as meaning the one 'after  
(*anu*) or following *rādhā*.'⌋

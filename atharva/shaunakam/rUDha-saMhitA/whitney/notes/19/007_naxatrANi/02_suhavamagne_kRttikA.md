## Translation
2. Easy of invocation for me \[be\] the Kṛittikās and Rohiṇī; be  
Mṛigaśiras excellent, \[and\] Ārdrā healthful (*śám*) be the two  
Punarvasus pleasantness, Pushya what is agreeable, the Āśleshās light  
(*bhānú*), the Maghās progress (*áyana*) ⌊for me⌋.

## Notes
The translation again implies in **a** the emendation *me* for *agne*,  
made in our text, for the improvement both of sense and of meter; SPP.  
reads *agne;* and the comm. points out that Agni is invoked here because  
he is the deity of Kṛttikās, and that the deities also of the other  
asterisms are to be regarded as included in their invocations—which is  
quite ingenious. The mss. in **b** are divided between *śám* and *sám;*  
in **c**, between *púṣyas* and *puṣyàs;* SPP. gives *púṣyas*, with, as  
he reports, nearly all his authorities; and this is doubtless the better  
supported reading. There seems to be no good reason for imagining that  
*áyana* in **d** contains any hidden reference to the solstice (in later  
astronomical language, *ayana*, by abbreviation for *ayanānta* 'end of a  
\[northern or southern\] progress of the sun') as occurring in Maghās.

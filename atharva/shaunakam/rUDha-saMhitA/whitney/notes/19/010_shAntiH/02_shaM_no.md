## Translation
2. Weal for us be Bhaga, and weal for us śaṅsa; weal for us Purandhi,  
and weal be wealths; weal for us the tribute (*śáṅsa*) of well-ordered  
(*suyáma*) truth; weal for us be the much-born Aryaman.

## Notes
About half the mss. read in **c** *suyámaṣ tu* (p. *su॰yámastu*). Pādas  
**b** and **c** have dropped out of Ppp. The comm. takes *śaṅsas* in  
**a** to be by abbreviation for *narāśaṅsas*.

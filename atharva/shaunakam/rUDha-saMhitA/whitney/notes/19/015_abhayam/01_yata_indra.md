## Translation
1. What we fear, O Indra, make thou fearlessness for us of it; O  
bounteous one, help (*śak*) that for us by thy aids; smite away haters,  
away scorners.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is RV. viii. 50 (61). 13, without variant; also SV. i. 274;  
ii. 671, which reads *ūtáye* in **c**. Most of the mss. give *tvám*  
instead of *tát* in **c**, but two of ours (P.M.) have *tán na ū-*, and  
on the authority of these and of RV.SV. our text gives the same; SPP.  
reads *tvám*, and so does the comm., and it is probably to be regarded  
as the true Atharvan version.

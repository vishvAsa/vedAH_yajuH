## Translation
3. Indra \[is\] rescuer and Vṛitra-slayer, our desirable far-and-wide  
protector (?); be he our defender at the extremities, he in the middle,  
he behind, he in front.

## Notes
In **b** the translation follows the comm., who explains *paraspā*  
(*-pāḥ*) *no v-*; all the mss. (save one or two s.m.)\* have *parasphā́no  
v-* (p. *parasphā́naḥ*, without division), and this is doubtless the true  
Atharvan text, though an unintelligible corruption, of which our  
*gayasphāna* is an only partially successful emendation. \*⌊In fact, W's  
O. and three of SPP's mss. have *-sphā-*, p.m., and *-spā-*, s.m.; and  
SPP's reciter K. gave *-sphā-*, while his reciter V. gave *-spā-*.⌋ Ppp-  
reads *parampāno* (*paraspā no?*). The *pada*-mss. unintelligently  
divide *ca: ramatáḥ* in **c**; some of our mss. have *-matá sá*. The  
verse (8 + 8: 12 + 10 = 38) is poorly described by the Anukr.

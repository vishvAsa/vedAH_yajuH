## Translation
6. Fearlessness from friend, fearlessness from enemy, fearlessness from  
one known, fearlessness \[from one\] that is away; fearlessness for us  
by night, fearlessness by day; be all places my friend.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
At the beginning of **b**, all the mss. read *ábhaye*, but even SPP.  
emends to *-yam*, having the comm. with him. At the end of the same  
pāda, all ⌊so also Ppp.⌋ give *puró yaḥ* (p. *puráḥ: yáḥ*), which SPP.  
retains; the comm. reads *paro yaḥ*, but understands it as if *páro  
yáḥ*, explaining as *jñātād anyaḥ* or *aparijñātaḥ*. Our emendation to  
*parókṣāt* is defensible; but the translation implies *paró yáḥ*, as a  
less alteration. ⌊In **d**, Ppp. combines *sarvā ”śā* and omits *máma*.⌋  
⌊"Save me from my friends:" cf. ii. 28. 1 **d** and note; also RV. iv.  
55. 5, where the antithesis between *jányam áṅhas* and *mitríyam áṅhas*  
is most instructive.⌋

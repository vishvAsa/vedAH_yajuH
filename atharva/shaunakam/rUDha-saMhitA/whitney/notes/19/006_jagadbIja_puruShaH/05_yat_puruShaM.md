5. When they separated (*vi-dhā*) Purusha, in how many parts did they

are called his (two) thighs \[and\] feet?

## Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 11; VS. xxxi. 10; TA. iii. 12. 5.⌋ The mss. vary between  
*vyádadhus* and *vy àdadhus;* the *pada*-mss., between *ví: ad-* and  
*ví: ád-*: the latter is (without any good reason: cf. my *Skt. Gr.*²  
§1084 a) ⌊and note to xviii. 1. 39⌋ the reading of the RV *pada*-text.  
⌊In **b**, KaṭhaB. has *enam* for our *ví*.⌋ In **c, d**, VS. agrees  
with our text, save that it wantonly defaces the meter by intruding an  
unnecessary *āsīt* after *asya;* RV.TA. have for *kím* (except the  
first time) *kāú;* and RV. combines *kā́ ū-* and *pā́dā uc-* ⌊AV. and RV.  
*pada*-texts, *pā́dāu*⌋, while TA. has *kā́v* and *pā́dāv;* Ppp. has *pādāv  
ucyate:* cf. Prāt. ii. 22 and note; ⌊also my *Noun-Inflection*, p. 341⌋.  
⌊KaṭhaB. agrees with VS. in showing the intrusive *āsīt*, and with Ppp.  
in reading the ungrammatical *ucyate*.⌋

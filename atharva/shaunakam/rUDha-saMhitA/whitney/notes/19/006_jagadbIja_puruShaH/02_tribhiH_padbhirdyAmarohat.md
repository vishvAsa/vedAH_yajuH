## Translation
2. With three feet he ascended the sky; a foot of him, again, was here;  
so he strode out asunder, after eating and non-eating.

## Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 4; VS. xxxi. 4; SV. i. 619; TA. iii. 12. 2.⌋ RV. has a quite  
different text: *tripā́d ūrdhvá úd āit púruṣaḥ pā́do ‘sye ’hā́ ’bhavat  
púnaḥ: táto víṣvan̄ vy* *àkrāmat sāśanānaśané abhí;* VS. agrees with  
this throughout; ⌊and so does KaṭhaB., except that it has *bhū́mim* for  
*víṣvan̄*⌋; TA. differs only by reading in **b** *’hā́ ”bhavāt* ⌊i.e.  
*’há: ā́: bhavāt?*⌋ (doubtless, however, a misprint); ⌊but *ā́bhavāt* is  
read by both Calc. and Poona ed's in the text; while both ed's have  
*ābhavat* in the comm.⌋; SV. differs (and agrees with AV.) by *táthā* in  
**c** and *aśan-* in **d**. The comm. has in **a** *ā ’rohat*, and in  
**b** (with RV. etc.) *pā́do ‘sya;* two or three of SPP's authorities  
agree with the comm. in both points. The *pada*-mss. give in **b**  
*pā́dasya;* ⌊but SPP. accepts *pā́t: asya* in his *pada*-text⌋. No  
*saṁhitā*-ms. has *víṣvan̄n̄ a-*, and accordingly SPP., against all rule  
and usage, admits *víṣvan̄ a-* in his text; but he accents *aśanānaśané*  
with us, though almost all the mss. have *aśanā́naśané*. The comm. gives  
an absurd array of discordant explanations of this compound: *aśanā* is  
"men, animals, etc.," and *anaśanā* "gods, trees, etc."; then  
(*adhyātmapakṣe*), the two are "the immovable and movable creation," or  
else "the intelligent (*cetana*) and unintelligent creation."

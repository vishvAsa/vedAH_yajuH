## Translation
15. Seven were made its enclosing sticks (*paridhí*), thrice seven its  
pieces of fuel, when the gods, extending the sacrifice, bound Purusha as  
victim.

## Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 15; VS. xxxi. 15; TA. iii. 12. 3.⌋ The other three texts  
offer no variant. In connection with the 'seven,' the comm. of course  
thinks of the meters; of the 'twenty-one' he gives more than one  
explanation, sufficient to show that he is merely guessing.

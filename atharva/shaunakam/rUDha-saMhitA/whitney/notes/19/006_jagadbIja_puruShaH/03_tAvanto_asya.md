## Translation
3. So many are his greatnesses; and Purusha is superior (*jyā́jān*) to  
that; a foot of him is all beings (*bhūtá*); three feet of him are what  
is immortal in the sky.

## Notes
⌊RV. x. 90. 3; VS. xxxi. 3; SV. i. 621; TA. iii. 12. 1; ChU. iii. 12.  
6.⌋ RV. reads in **a, b**: *etā́vān asya mahimā́ ’to jy-*; VS.TA. agree  
with RV. (but TA. ⌊in the Calc. ed. only⌋ shortens the *ū* of *pū́ruṣaḥ*  
in **b**). ⌊SV. makes up its vss. 620 and 621 thus: 620 = RV. 2 **a, b**  
(our 4 **a, b**) + RV. 3 **c, d** (our 3 **c, d**); 621 = RV. 3 **a, b**  
(our 3 **a, b**) + RV. 2 **c, d** (our 4 **c, d**); that is, between the  
two halves of our vs. 4, it interjects the two halves of our vs. 3 in  
inverted order.⌋ SV. has for our **a, b**, *tā́vān asya mahimā́ táto jy-*  
etc.; and, for the *víśvā* of our **c**, it has *sárvā;* ⌊and so has  
KaṭhaB.⌋. Ppp. omits *asya* in **a** and has *pād asya* in **c**.  
'Foot,' of course, in this and in the next verse, = 'quarter.' ⌊ChU.  
agrees with SV., except that it does not dislocate the two halves of our  
vs. As to the vs. in ChU., cf. Böhtlingk, *Berichte der säcks. Gesell.*,  
July 10, 1897, p. 82; in his edition, he emends the vs. to conformity  
with the RV. readings.⌋

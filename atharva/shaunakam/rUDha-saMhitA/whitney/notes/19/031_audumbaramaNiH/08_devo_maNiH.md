## Translation
8. The heavenly amulet, rival-slaying, riches-winning, in order to the  
winning of riches: let it confirm \[to me\] abundance of cattle, of  
food, \[and\] fatness of kine.

## Notes
Nearly all the mss. read in **d** *sphā́tir ní;* ⌊disregarding the  
accent, five of SPP's authorities show *sphātim*⌋; SPP's text agrees  
with ours ⌊*sphātím*⌋, the comm. having the same. Ppp. again has  
*bhāumānaṁ* in **c**.

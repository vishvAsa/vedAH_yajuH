title = "०४ यद् द्विपाच्च"

## Translation
4. Both what \[is\] two-footed and what four-footed, what foods \[there  
are\], what savors (*rása*)—I seize (*grah*) the abundance of them,  
wearing the amulet of *udumbára*.

## Notes
Some of the mss. read *rásā* at end of **b**. In **c**, our *téṣām* is  
an obviously called-for emendation; most mss. read *tvéṣām* or *tveṣām*  
(p. *tú: éṣām* or *tú: eṣām*); SPP. strangely gives *tvéṣām* in  
*saṁhitā* and *tú: eṣām* in *pada*, the two not agreeing together; the  
comm. either reads *eṣām* simply or overlooks the *tu* in his  
exposition. Ppp. gives *gṛhṇīyāṁ teṣāṁ bhāumānaṁ*.

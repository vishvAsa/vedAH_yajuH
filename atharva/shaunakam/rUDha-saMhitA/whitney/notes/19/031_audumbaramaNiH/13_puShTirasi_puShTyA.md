## Translation
13. Prosperity art thou, with prosperity anoint (*añj*) thou me  
completely; being house-sacrificer, make thou me householder; O  
\[amulet\] of *udumbára*, do thou here put in us and confirm to us  
wealth having all heroes; I fasten thee on in order to abundance of  
wealth.

## Notes
The comm., against the Anukr. and the natural division, adds **e** to  
verse 14. Part of the mss. again accent *púṣṭi* in **a**. Some,  
including all the *pada*-mss., have *indhi* for *an̄dhi;* Ppp. *agdhi*.  
SPP. again fails to follow us, the comm., Ppp., and one of our mss., in  
reading *āúdumbara* (instead of *-ras*) in **c**; some of his mss. leave  
*tvam* without accent. ⌊The non-elision of **a** in *ahám* justifies  
the count as *śakvarī*, but hurts the meter, which is none too good if  
we scan the vs. as 5 × 11.⌋

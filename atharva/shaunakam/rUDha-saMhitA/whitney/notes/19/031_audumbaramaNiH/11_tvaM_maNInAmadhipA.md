## Translation
11. Thou art the virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) over-ruler of amulets; in thee the  
lord of prosperity generated prosperity; in thee \[are\] these powers  
(*vā́ja*), \[are\] all possessions; do thou here, O \[amulet\] of  
*udumbára*, force (*sah*) far away from us the niggard, misery, and  
hunger.

## Notes
In **a** the comm. reads *adhipas*. In **b** Ppp. gives *puṣṭipatis*. At  
beginning of **c**, the comm. has *tvayā me*, which is not bad. In  
**c**, the *pada*-mss. have *vājā*. At beginning of **d**, all the mss.  
present *āúdumbaras*, and SPP. does not emend to *-ra* with us, although  
the comm. has it and the sense demands it. But in **e**, where all the  
mss. read *amṛ́tam*, he ventures to follow the comm. in substituting  
*ámatim*, which is better than our conjecture *ávartim* (misprinted  
*avártim*). ⌊Ppp. has, for **e**, *ārād arātim abhitikṣayaṁ ca.*⌋ The  
verse scans naturally as 5 × 11 = 55: it is easy, but needless, to make  
up the full count of a *śakvarī*, 56, by resolution.

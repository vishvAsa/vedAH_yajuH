## Translation
1. With the first five *anuvākás* of the Ān̄girasas, hail!

## Notes
It is very strange that the instrumental case is used here, instead of  
the dative, which is used everywhere else through this hymn and the  
next. ⌊Conversely, note the use of the abl.-dat. form *mādbhyás*, below,  
27. 2 **c**, where we expect the instrumental, as in the other pādas.⌋

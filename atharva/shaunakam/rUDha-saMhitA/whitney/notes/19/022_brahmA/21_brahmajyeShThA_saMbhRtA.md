## Translation
21. Heroisms \[were\] gathered with the *bráhman* as chief; the  
*bráhman* as chief in the beginning stretched the sky; the Brahman was  
born as first of creatures; therefore (*téna*) who is fit to contend  
with the Brahman?

## Notes
Or (in **d**) 'with that (*téna*) Brahmán' SPP's text of the verse  
agrees with ours save that he accents in **d** *bráhmaṇā* with the mss.,  
and has in **c** *prathamó ’tá* (p. *-máḥ: utá*, though the *pada*-mss.  
read *-mā́: utá*); the text of the comm. has *-mo ’ta* here, but *-mo  
‘tha* in the verse repeated as 23. 30; the emendation in our text to  
*-mó ha* is plainly the easiest way out of the difficulty. The  
*pada*-mss. divide at the beginning, with remarkable absence of  
intelligence, *bráhma:* *jyeṣṭhā*, or *jyeṣṭhā́;* half the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
also accent *jyeṣṭhā́;* finally, the *pada*-mss., with incredible folly,  
divide at the end *spárddhi: tuṁkáḥ!* SPP. holds that the verse must  
have originally had *brahmán* throughout (four times), and gives in his  
note a text of it in that form (but with *prathamó ‘tha* in **c**); but  
it is far from improbable that *bráhman* was used in the first verse  
and *brahmán* in the second, as in our text. Indeed, in a corresponding  
verse in TB. (ii. 4. 7¹⁰), *bráhman* ⌊more appropriately, it would seem,  
if I am right in supposing that vss. 29 and 30 of hymn 23 refer to the  
Brahmaveda: cf. p. 932, l. 3⌋ is used every time: *bráhmajyeṣṭhā* (its  
commentary takes this as vocative) *vīryà sámbhṛtāni bráhmā ’gre  
jyéṣṭham dívam ā́ tatāna: ṛtásya bráhma prathamó ’tá* (! its comment  
paraphrases by simply *prathamám*) *jajñe ténā ’rhati bráhmaṇā  
spárdhituṁ káḥ*. Our comm. gives a second explanation of *brahmajyeṣṭhā*  
as = *brahmaṇā jyeṣṭhena*, the case-ending of the former word being  
omitted, as well as the *in* part of that of the second!

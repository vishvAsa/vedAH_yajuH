## Translation
2. What evil-dreaming \[is\] in us, what in \[our\] kine, and what in  
our house, also the...of one hostile, let him that is unfriendly take  
upon himself (*prati-muc*).

## Notes
Both sense and meter require the emendation in **d** of *priyás* to  
*ápriyas*, and the comm. has the latter, but all the authorities,\* and  
Ppp. (*durhārdaṣ priya pra-*), and SPP. give the former. In **c**, the  
general reading of the mss. is *ánāmagas tvám* (p. *ánāmagaḥ: tvám*);  
for *tváṁ ca* is found *tvā́ṁ ca*, *táṁ ca*, *táṁta*, ⌊*tvác ca*, *tá  
ca*, *tac ca*⌋. SPP. accepts *ánāmagas tám*, but what sense he can  
possibly attach to the words does not appear. Ppp. gives *māmagatasya  
dur-*. The comm. reads *anāmakas tac ca*, which is equally impossible;  
and he makes a senseless explanation of *anāmakas: īdṛn̄nāmā tādṛn̄nāme  
’ty evaṁ nāmarahitaḥ;* and he falsely regards *durhārdas* as a nom.  
sing. qualified by *anāmakas*. Our conjecture, *anāmayatváṁ ca d-*, is  
very unsatisfactory, in regard both to meter and to sense; *anāgastvám*  
'guiltlessness' would make a good *anuṣṭubh* pāda, and be very near to  
the reading of the mss.; but it would be, equally with *anāmayatvam*,  
discordant with *duṣvápnyam*, and would require *priyás* in **d**. ⌊Ppp.  
reads *muñcatā* at the end.⌋  
  
\*⌊The reciter V., curiously, has as an alternative, *durhā́rdo ‘priyás*,  
which (the accent being wrong) is neither one thing nor the other, but  
may well be taken as supporting the comm's reading *ápriyas*, as against  
*priyás;* the true *saṁhitā*-reading would then be *durhā́rdó ‘priyaḥ*.⌋  
  
⌊The solution of this desperate passage seems to me to be suggested by  
57. 5 below, of which the first part is identical with our **a, b**  
here, and of which the second part begins with *anāsmākás tád* and ends  
(nearly like v. 14. 3 **d**) with *niṣkám iva* (pronounce *niṣkéva*)  
*práti muñcatām*. In our **c, d** I would read *anāsmākás tád durhā́rdó  
‘priyaḥ práti muñcatām* (*pada*-reading *duḥ॰hā́rdaḥ: ápriyaḥ*), and  
render 'that let him who is not of us, the evil-hearted, the  
unfriendly, put upon himself.' The *tád* is supported by the comm., and  
in a measure by SPP's D.V. and C³.; the *ápriyas*, by the comm. and V.  
(as above) and the meter; and *anāsmākás* comes near to the  
ms.-readings, and, indeed, considering the *ánāmakas* of the living  
reciter V. and of the comm., is not ill supported.⌋  
  
⌊It remains to note that no valid objection can be taken against making  
a nom. sing, of *durhā́rda-s:* its use as such is a natural way of  
avoiding the form from the consonantal stem (which was as much of a  
stumbling-block to the ancient Hindu as it is to the modern tyro in  
Sanskrit), and is entirely analogous to the use of *hṛ́dayam* rather than  
*hṛ́d* (cf. my *Noun-Inflection*, p. 471). The comm. is accordingly right  
in saying here *durhārdo duṣṭacittaḥ*, as he was also in glossing the  
*suhā́rt* of ii. 7. 5 by *śobhanahārdaḥ sumanaskaḥ*. The nom.  
*durhā́rda-s* is a form of transition to the *a*-declension, with  
*durhā́rd-am* (so viii. 3. 25) as its point of departure (cf. *durhā́rdān*  
of the mss. at xix. 28. 8); just so the later *pā́da-s* (from *pā́d-am*)  
replaces the older *pā́t* (*Noun-Inflection*, p. 471).⌋  
  
⌊Of the older nom. sing. masc. or fern., however, the true form is  
*suhā́r*, p. *su॰hā́ḥ*, of which traces, albeit scanty, are found in the  
Veda: one is at MS. iv. 2. 5, p. 26¹⁶, *priyā́ naḥ suhā́r ṇaḥ;* and  
another is at AV. ii. 7. 5, where both ed's read *yáḥ suhā́rt téna naḥ  
sahá*. Here the *saṁhitā*-authorities taken together are divided between  
*suhā́rt téna* (so 11) and *suhā́t téna* (so 6); but the  
*pada*-authorities (7 out of 8) give *su॰hā́t*, the notable exception  
being the *śrotriya* K., who recited the true form *su॰hā́ḥ*. The  
*saṁhitā*-form for this ought to be *suhā́s* (*téna*), and possibly this  
form is concealed in the reading *suhā́tténa* of S^(m). etc. If not, then  
(since *rtt* = *rt:* *Gram.* §232) we may regard the combination *suhā́rt  
t-* as representing *suhā́r t-*, nom. *suhā́r*, with breach of the rule of  
sandhi requiring the change of *suhā́r* to *suhā́s* before *t-*. The  
motive for this breach was perhaps to avoid disguising still further the  
form *suhā́r*, itself extremely rare and none too easily recognized; and  
the motive is perhaps as clear as it is in the case of *aves avet, ajāis  
ajāit*, etc., cited by W., *Gram.* §555 a.—The nom. *suhā́rt* seems to be  
grammatical and not intolerable in the texts, and to be unparalleled  
(cf. *Noun-Inflection*, p. 472).⌋

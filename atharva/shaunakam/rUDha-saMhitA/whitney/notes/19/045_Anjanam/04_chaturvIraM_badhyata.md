## Translation
4. The four-heroed ointment is bound to thee; be all the quarters free  
from fear for thee; firm shalt thou stand, like Savitar desirable; let  
these people (*víśas*) render thee tribute.

## Notes
In **a, b** Ppp. combines *badhyatā ”ñj-, diśo ‘bhayās*. In **c**, the  
mss. ⌊with one or two exceptions⌋ read *cāryà i-* (p. *ca: āryàḥ*); SPP.  
alters the accent to *cā́rya* (p. *ca: ā́ryaḥ*); our emendation to  
*vā́ryas* ⌊W's B. has *vāryà i-*⌋ is not absolutely necessary, yet  
certainly a plausible improvement; and it is in a certain measure  
supported by Ppp., which gives *vāri imā;* the translation above implies  
it. The comm. understands *arya*, vocative, rendering it by *svāmin*. In  
**d** all the mss. have *víśas* ⌊but Ws E. seems to have *díśas*⌋, and  
our substitution of *díśas* was hardly called for; but Ppp. favors it,  
reading *diśo bhriyante*. The comm. gives two explanations for the  
strange epithet *caturvīra*, showing that he is merely guessing what its  
sense might possibly be. We have in **d** again an extra syllable of  
which the Anukr. takes no notice.

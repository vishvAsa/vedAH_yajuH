title = "०१ यानि नक्षत्राणि"

## Translation
1. What asterisms are in the sky, in the atmosphere, in the waters, on  
the earth, what ones in the mountains, in the quarters, what ones the  
moon goes on preparing (*pra-kḷp*), let all those be propitious to me.

## Notes
The mss., and so SPP., have the incorrect accent *prákalpayan* in **c**;  
it is emended in our text. It is possible, but not natural, to count in  
the verse 46 syllables, with the Anukr.

## Translation
4. Detraction, evil gossip, reproach, sneezing about (?)—them, O  
Savitar, drive (*suva*) away for me empty-handed (?), with all.

## Notes
The translation implies the text of the mss., which is also read by  
SPP., in the second half-verse: *sárvāir me riktakuinbhā́n párā* ⌊most  
mss. *parā* or *yarā*⌋ *tā́nt savitaḥ suva;* we might alter *sárvāis* to  
*sarvátas*, so as to fill out the meter and give a much better sense;  
the comm. understands it to mean "allied with all the deities of the  
asterisms"; *riktakumbha* he simply glosses with *śūnyakalaśa*, adding  
no further explanation; the Pet. Lexx. conjecture "perhaps idle talk  
(lit. emptypottedness)"; the translation implies their going away 'with  
empty vessels'—that is, carrying off no result or advantage. The comm.  
explains *anuhavá* as a calling out ⌊inauspiciously⌋ to a person from  
behind, and *parihavá* as the same from both sides; *parivādá* is "harsh  
talk" (*paruṣabhāṣaṇa*); *parikṣavá* is ⌊alternatively⌋ *sarvataḥ  
kṣutam*. Some of the mss. read *parichavám* in **b** ⌊cf. note\* and vs.  
5⌋. Ppp. has for **b** *parīvādaṁ parikṣayam;* and for **c, d**,  
*savyāimaviriktakumbhyāṁ parā tāṁ savitus savaḥ*. The comm. appears to  
read *suvaḥ* at the end, but glosses it with *parākuru*, as if *suva*.  
  
⌊The AV. comm. begins his remarks on this vs. virtually as follows: If a  
man sets out on business under a lucky asterism, and some one from  
behind him calls his name or does something of that sort \[probably  
scolding, sneezing, and coughing are meant\], those things are of  
ill-omen as tending to thwart the business in hand; and this verse  
contains a prayer for warding off the ill effects of those omens. (In  
this connection, we may note the cries and slaps by which the woodpecker  
deters the hunter just as he sets out, Jātaka, ii. 153²², 154³.)—It  
almost seems as if our comm. were acquainted with ĀpGS. 9. 2, which  
prescribes an expiation in case some one sneezes or coughs near one who  
is setting out on business: *arthaprādhvasya parikṣave parikāsane cāpa  
upaspṛśyo ’ttare yathālin̄gaṁ japet* (cf. ed. of Wintemitz, p. 12 and p.  
61). Wintemitz, *Hochzeitsrituell,* p. 95 (cf. p. 26), gives the verses  
that are to be repeated: I give them as he has printed them at MP. i.  
13. 5-6: *anuhavám parihavám parīvadám parikṣapám: dúsvapnaṁ* (should be  
*-niaṁ*) *dúruditaṁ tád dviṣádbhyo diśāmy ahám: ánuhūtam párihūtaṁ  
śakunāir yád aśākunám: mṛgásya sṛtám akṣṇáyā tád* etc. This passage and  
AV. x. 3. 6 stand in close rapport with our vss. 3-4 here.⌋  
  
\*⌊As for the readings *parichavam* and *chavam* as against *parikṣavam*  
and *kṣavam* (4 **b**, 5 **a, b**), the former are avouched by a large  
minority of SPP's authorities and they prevail also in the mss. first  
collated by Whitney: and so Ppp. has *paricchava* for *parikṣava* of our  
x. 3. 6. The forms with *ch* appear to be allowable Prākritisms, like  
*uchantu* = *ukṣantu* at iii. 12. 4: cf. rchara = rtsara at x. 9. 23 and  
my note; and uccase = ucyase at xii. 4. 4.—For sneezing as an omen, see  
Henry C. Warren, On superstitious customs connected with sneezing, JAOS.  
xiii. = PAOS. May, 1885, p. xvii-xx. He quotes Jātaka, ii., p. 15 ff.  
etc., and Whitney adds JB. ii. 155.⌋

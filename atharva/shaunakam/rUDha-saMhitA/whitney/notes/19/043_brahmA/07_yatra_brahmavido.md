## Translation
7. Whither the etc. etc.—thither let the waters conduct me; let  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*) approach (*upa-sthā*) me: to the waters hail!

## Notes
Our *nayantu* in **c** is the obviously necessary emendation of *nayatu*  
of all the mss., which SPP., after his manner, retains. The comm. does  
not have occasion to quote the word; but his text also, according to  
SPP., reads *nayatu*. ⌊The faulty assimilation of the original *nayantu*  
to the *nayatu* which obtains throughout all the other verses of the  
sequence, is precisely paralleled by the *gachati* (so all authorities)  
after *ā́pas* at xv. 7. 3.⌋

## Translation
5. What \[witchcraft-\]workers are made by the gods, and also what from  
mortals—all those may the all-healing *jan̄giḍá* make sapless.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, which deviates widely from that of the  
mss. in **a, b**. All these have, without exception, *yáḥ kṛṣṇávo;* all  
further *devakṛtā* (p. *deva॰kṛtāḥ*), but with differences of accent;  
⌊of SPP's authorities, 6 give correctly *-vá-*, and 8 give give *-tā́ḥ;*⌋  
then they vary in **b** between *yá* and *ya* (all that *pada*-mss.  
*yáḥ*); all have *utó* (p. *utó íti*); ⌊but W's B. seems to read  
*yátó;*⌋ finally, they vary between *vabhṛtenyàḥ* (the majority),  
*-tenyáḥ*, *-thenyàḥ*, *-tyenyàḥ* (the *pada*-mss., *vabhṛtenyàḥ*, or  
*-tényaḥ*). SPP's text has *yá* (p. *yé*) *ṛṣṇávo devákṛtā* (p. *-tāḥ*)  
*yá* (p. *yáḥ*) *utó vavṛté ‘nyáḥ* (p. *vavṛté: anyáḥ:* but this would  
give for *saṁhitā*-text *vavṛtè ‘nyáḥ*), which, apart from the added  
accents, is the text of the comm., as SPP. reports; the comm., however,  
assumes in his explanation *ye...anye* in **b** instead of  
*yáḥ...anyáḥ*, and declares *vavṛte* = *vavṛtire*. Ppp., finally, gives  
*ye ṛṣṇavo devakṛtā yo co bibhṛthebhyā*. The case is evidently a rather  
desperate one. The word *ṛṣṇavas*, found in both Ppp. and comm., occurs  
nowhere else; the comm. gives for it one of his usual artificial and  
wholly worthless explanations, *gantāro hiṅsakāḥ puruṣāḥ;* **b** he  
makes to mean "also what other oppressors (*bādhakās*) go about."

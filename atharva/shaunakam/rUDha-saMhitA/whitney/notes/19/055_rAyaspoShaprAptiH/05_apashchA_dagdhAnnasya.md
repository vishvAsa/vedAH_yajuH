## Translation
5. May I be one not falling short of food; to the food-eating lord of  
food, to Agni \[as\] Rudra be homage.

## Notes
Here also there is discordance as to the verse-division; the Anukr. ⌊and  
comm.⌋ further add to vs. 5 what in our edition is 6 **a, b,** and then  
make one verse of what remains of the hymn; and SPP. follows them. The  
translation adheres to our text (which represents all the mss. till that  
time known to us), especially because its division seems better suited  
to the sense. At the beginning, all the authorities, and SPP., have  
*ápaścādagdhā́nnasya*, divided by the *pada*-text into *ápaścā:*  
*dagdhá॰annasya* (or *-gdha॰án-*); ⌊but Whitney's W. has *daghānt-*; his  
M. has *dagdhvānn-*; and his P. has *dagghvānt-* or possibly  
*dagdhvānt-*, it is not clear which: at any rate, in P. and M. there is  
a *pada* before the ā;⌋ the comm. understands *apaścādagdhā ’nnasya*,  
and solemnly explains it as meaning: *annasyā ’paśca\[dagdhā\]  
paścādbhāge ‘dagdhā sthālīpṛṣṭhabhāge dagdhānnarahitaḥ!* The correctness  
of our conjectural emendation to *ápaścādaghvā́ ’nnasya* is put beyond  
question by the occurrence of a corresponding phrase, *ápaścāddaghvā́  
’nnam bhūyāsam*, in MS. iii. 9. 4, p. 120¹⁷, and also in Āp. vii. 28.  
2.\* Part of the mss. accent *bhūyāsam*. In **b**, all SPP's authorities  
⌊save one⌋, and most of ours, give *annādāyo ‘nn* (variously accented:  
p. *anna॰adáyaḥ*), apparently a case of misunderstanding of *āyā* as  
*yo* after the Bengāli method of writing *o;*† but two of our mss.,  
P.M., have *annādā́yā́ ’nn-*, which is the reading of our text; the comm.  
likewise understands *-dāya*, and SPP. also accepts it in his text.  
\*⌊The phrase *á-paścād-daghvane náre* occurs at RV. vi. 42. 1; TB. iii.  
7. 10⁶; Āp. xiv. 29. 2; compare *apaścā-daghvane naraḥ* at SV. i. 352,  
ii. 790. It may be worth noting that the comm. to TB. brings the epithet  
into connection with food, explaining the phrase as 'a man devoid of  
brightness (i.e. dull) after his meal, unable to digest what he has  
eaten,' *paścād bhakṣottarakālaṁ dīptirahitāya, bhakṣitaṁ jarayitum  
asamarthāya*. He seems to connect *a-..-daghvan* (= *dīptirahita*) with  
*dah;* but BR. and W., with Sāyaṇa on RV., derive it from *dagh:* cf.  
RV. i. 123. 5 **c**; vii. 56. 21 **b**.⌋ †⌊Cf. SPP's notes to xviii. 4.  
48; xix. 32. 10; 48. 1; 56. 3.⌋

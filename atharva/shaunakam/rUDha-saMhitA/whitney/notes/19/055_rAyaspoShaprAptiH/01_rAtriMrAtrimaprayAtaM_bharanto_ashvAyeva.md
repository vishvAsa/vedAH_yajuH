## Translation
1. Night after night bringing to him without mixture, as fodder to a  
horse that stands, let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors, receive harm,  
reveling with abundance of wealth, with food (*íṣ*).

## Notes
The verse corresponds nearly with VS. xi. 75, also with a verse in TS.  
iv. i. 10¹ and MS. ii. 7. 7. VS. begins **a** with *áhar-ahar* (but śB.  
vi. 6. 4¹ ⌊like KśS. xvi. 6. 2⌋ gives a *pratīka* with *rā́trīṁ-rātrīm*  
instead), TS. reads with us, and MS. has *rā́trīṁ-rātrīm* ⌊and repeats  
the *pratīka* at iii. 1. 9, p. 12¹²⌋. At end of **b**, all have *asmāi*  
unaccented. In **d**, all put *ágne* at the beginning, *‘gne mā́ te  
práti-*. In **a**, all the authorities have *áprayātam* ⌊an isolated  
*-tum* counts for nothing⌋, and so has the text of the comm., according  
to SPP., who prints *áprayātam*. But the comm. in his explanation has  
*aprayāvam*, which he glosses by *apracchidya* or *sāṁtatyena* ⌊which  
harmonizes well with the *sádam ít* of iii. 15. 8 **a**⌋; ⌊the six Yajus  
texts just cited (both verses and *pratīkas*) all read *áprayāvam*, on  
which the Berlin emendation\* rests⌋. ⌊Weber, *Ind. Stud.* xvii. 251,  
cites K. xvi. 7 as reading *rātrīṁ-rātrīm*, with the rest as in VS.; and  
Knauer, Index to MGS., p. 155, adds K. xix. 10 and Kap. S. xxx. 8.⌋ The  
second half of our iii. 15.8 above agrees precisely with our **c, d**  
here; the first half differs a good deal, ⌊having for **a** *viśvā́hā te  
sádam íd bharema*, and ending **b** with *jātavedaḥ* instead of *ghāsám  
asmā́i*. Ppp. has in **a** *aprayāmaṁ*, at end of **b** *agne* for  
*asmāi* (as in our vs. 7), and in **d** *‘gnāi mā te pr-* (intending the  
same as the Yajus texts).  
  
\*⌊Griffith's version of *áprayāvam* is 'with care unceasing' (AV.VS.);  
and Eggeling's is 'unremittingly' (śB.); so also W. at iii. 5. 1 (see  
the note); and in his *Roots* he connects *-yāvam* only with root *yu*  
'separate'; one does not see why he departs from that here:  
nevertheless, the sense 'mix' is well avouched for the root *yu* 'unite'  
with *pra* by JUB. i. 8, *yathā madhunā lājān prayuyād evam* (see JAOS.  
xvi. 88 and 228).—I may add in the proof that even the Anukr. reads  
*aprayātam*, but that the Yajus readings, and the *sádam* it (W.  
'constantly') of iii. 15. 8, seem to place the Berlin emendation beyond  
doubt: and that the Ppp. reading *aprayucchan* at iii. 5. 1 helps to  
establish for the Vulgate not only the form *áprayāvam* as gerund, but  
also the meaning 'without being careless' or 'unremittingly' as against  
'without mixing.'⌋  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2. Of thee that art good what arrow \[is\] in the wind, this is that of  
thine; therewith be gracious to us. Let not us, O Agni, thy neighbors,  
receive harm, reveling with abundance of wealth, with food.  
  
  
  
  
The translation follows the text of the mss. rather than our  
emendations, as the latter afford no more satisfactory sense than does  
the former. Several authorities, however, read *yā́ta* instead of *vā́ta*  
(one has *vā́ca;* one *ī́ṣuḥ*, two *éṣuḥ;* ⌊and so on⌋): the *pada*-mss.  
divide *vā́taḥ: íṣuḥ: sā́*. The comm's text has *iṣa;* but how his  
explanation is related to the text is hard to see: *he agne vāsakasya  
tava yā ’nugrahabuddhir annapradasya yā cā ’nugrahabuddhis tayā ‘smān  
sukhaya;* that is all.

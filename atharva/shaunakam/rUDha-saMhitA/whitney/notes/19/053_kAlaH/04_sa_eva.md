## Translation
4. He indeed together brought beings; he indeed together went about  
(*pari-i*) beings; being father, he became son of them; than him verily  
there is no other brilliancy that is higher (*pára*).

## Notes
The position of *sám* in **a** and in **b** is so strange that we are  
tempted to emend both times to *sán* 'being';\* one *pada*-ms. reads  
*sán* in **a**, but this can count for nothing. The comm's exposition  
omits *sám* in **a** ⌊there seems to be a gap in the ms.⌋, but duly  
treats it (*samyak parigacchati*) in **b**. Ppp. reads in **b** *sa yava  
saṁ parīyāiḥ*. ⌊With **c** (*pitā́...putrás*), cf. the note to 54. 3  
**a**.⌋ The Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical irregularities. \*⌊In  
that case, perhaps we might render *sá evá* by 'the same.'⌋

## Translation
2. Seven wheels doth this time drive; seven \[are\] his naves,  
immortality (*amṛ́ta*) forsooth \[his\] axle; he, time, including (?) all  
these beings, goes on as first god.

## Notes
The principal difficulty is here in the third pāda, where our *arvā́n̄*  
(though accepted by all the translators without any heed to the  
ms.-readings given at the foot of the page) is a very bold and  
questionable emendation, most of the mss. (with the comm. ⌊the ms. has  
*añjan*\*⌋ and SPP.) giving instead *añjat*, a few *añját*, and some of  
ours *anyat* or *ayat* (evidently accidental and unimportant  
variations); Ppp. has *aṅjaṅ* ⌊i.e. *bhuvanānyaṅjaṅ*⌋; *arvā́ṅ̄* is not to  
be accepted as at all satisfactory, much less authoritative; it is no  
proper antithesis to *pratyán̄*† in 3 **c**, nor construable with the  
accusative. The translation, for a venture, implies *bhúvanā nyañján*,  
evolving a sense for *nyañján* out of *nyàkta* 'inherent'; it may pass  
for what it is worth. All the mss., and SPP., read in **a** *cakrā́n*  
⌊and so does Ppp.⌋; the comm. has *cakrā ’nu vahati*. The redundancy of  
syllables in **d** could be easily remedied either by omitting the  
superfluous *sá* (left out in the translation) or by reading *īrte* for  
*īyate* ⌊or by reading *sé ”yate* with double *saṁdhi* as Ppp.  
suggests⌋. Ppp. reads *kāle sāiyyate*. The comm. has in **b** *amṛtaṁ  
tanv akṣaḥ*. ⌊For the *nú* of **d**, the ms. of the comm. has in fact  
*u*.⌋ \*⌊The comm. has in one place *añjat*, explained as *añjan;* and,  
in another, the ms. of the comm. has (as noted) *añjan*, which SPP.  
prints as *añjat* = *prerayan!*⌋ †⌊It is a curious fact that Whitney  
here anticipates and parries the very argument in favor of the  
Roth-Whitney emendation *arvā́n̄* which Bloomfield later adduces, SBE.  
xlii. 684. W. may have written this in 1893 or thereabouts. Bl's  
translation appeared in 1897.⌋

## Translation
8. In time is fervor, in time is what is chief, in time is the *bráhman*  
collected; time is the lord (*īśvará*) of all, who was father of  
Prajāpati.

## Notes
All the *pada*-mss. except one, resolve *pitā́sīt* in **d** into *pitā́:  
āsīt;* SPP. reads *ā́sīt*. In spite of the repetition of *kālé* between,  
*jyéṣṭam* and *bráhma* may be conjectured to belong together: cf. x. 7.  
24, 32-34; xi. 5. 5, 23. ⌊Note that the usual RV. accent is *jyéṣṭha*,  
and that the usual AV. accent is *jyeṣṭhá;* and that AV. has the RV.  
accent only in books xix. and xx. and in a RV. passage, at v. 2. 1.⌋

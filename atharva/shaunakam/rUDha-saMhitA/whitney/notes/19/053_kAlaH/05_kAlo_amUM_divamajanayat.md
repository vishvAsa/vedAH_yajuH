## Translation
5. Time generated yonder sky, time also these earths; what is and what  
is to be stands out sent forth by time.

## Notes
SPP. reads in **a** *amū́m* with a small minority of the authorities, and  
with the comm.; Ppp. also has it, ⌊combining *‘mūm*⌋. For **b**, Ppp.  
gives *kālāi ’māṁ pṛthivīm uta*. In **c**, our *kāléna* was an  
emendation, for the *kālé ha*\* of the mss. (which SPP. follows); we  
find the former now supported by Ppp. In **d**, the mss. have *havís*  
(p. *havíḥ*) for *ha ví;* the text of SPP. follows us in emending to the  
latter, which the comm. also gives; Ppp. reads (*ca*) *eṣataṁ ha vi  
ti-*. The metrical definition of the Anukr. is not to be approved.  
\*⌊Probably a faulty assimilation to the reading of vs. 6 **c**.⌋

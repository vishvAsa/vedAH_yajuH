## Comment
This hymn and the following, which (as even the Anukr. ⌊cf. introd. to h. 56⌋ points out) are only two divided parts of one hymn, occur also in Pāipp. xiv. and xii. (53. 1-6 in xiv.; 53. 7 to 54. 6 in xii.). They are translated together by Muir, Ludwig, Scherman, and Bloomfield. As kālasūkta, they are used by Pariś. 10. 1 in connection with the preceding hymn (kāmasūkta): see under that hymn.

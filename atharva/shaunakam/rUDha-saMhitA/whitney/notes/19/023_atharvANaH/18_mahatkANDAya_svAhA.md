## Translation
18. To the great book (*mahat-kāṇḍá*), hail!

## Notes
⌊All of W's and of SPP's mss., and the reciters as well, give *mahat-*,  
not *mahā-*; but the comm. appears to read *mahā-*, and to say that it  
means the 'entire Veda of twenty books': *mahākāṇḍāye ’ti śabdena  
viṅśatikāṇḍātmakakṛtsnavedavācinā;* and this seems to support my  
suggestion that a Hindu might use *kāṇḍa* of a group of *kāṇḍas:* cf. ¶5  
of introduction, above. Weber suggested at *Ind. Stud.* iv. 433 that  
*mahatkāṇḍa* might mean book xx.; but in a later volume (xviii. 154),  
that book v. might be intended.⌋ ⌊See pages clvii-viii.⌋

## Translation
4. Make ye a pen (*vrajá*), for that is men-protecting for you; sew ye  
coats-of-mail (*várman*), abundant, broad; make ye strongholds of metal,  
unattackable (*ádhṛṣṭā*); let not your bowl leak (*sru*); make it  
strong.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 101. 8, with slight variation: RV. has *várma* in  
*saṁhitā* as well as in *pada* in **b**; the mss., too, leave *dṛ́ṅhatā*  
in **d** without accent, and SPP. does not correct their error. ⌊Roth  
notes that Ppp. reads *varmā:* cf. Noun*-Inflection*, p. 540 top, 539  
end.⌋ But the *pada*-text exhibits its skill in blundering: in **b** it  
reads *várma: asi: vi॰adhvám* (and nearly all the *saṁhitā*-mss. accent  
*sīvyadhám*), and in **c** *kṛṇudhvam: mā́: ā́yasīḥ* (or *ayasīḥ*):  
*ádhṛṣṭā* (and the *saṁhitā*-mss. accordingly read *-dhvaṁmāy-*). The  
comm. gives three distinct interpretations of the verse: as concerned  
respectively with the senses, with officiating priests, and with  
soldiers (*indriyaparatvena rtvikparatvena yoddhṛparatvena*). ⌊As to  
-*dhvam mā-*, cf. note to xviii. 2. 3.⌋

## Comment
The first four verses occur also in Pāipp. i.; ⌊Roth's Collation, strictly interpreted, means that the whole hymn is found there⌋. The comm. quotes vs. 5 as used in Kāuç. 3. 16; but the verse there intended is evidently ii. 35. 5, of which vs. 5 here is a repetition. At the beginning of his exposition of vs. 1 he says: asmin sūkte manasā nirvartyo yajñaḥ stūyate.

## Translation
3. Heaven-and-earth have become joint-seizers of splendor; seizing  
splendor may we go about upon the earth; with glory the kine, coming,  
wait upon (*upa-sthā*) the lord of kine; seizing glory may we go about  
upon the earth.

## Notes
⌊The verse is by no means one of 4 pādas, but rather one of 6 (**a-f**:  
so designated below): in fact, it is a regular *anuṣṭubh*, to each half  
of which is added in prose an *ūha*-refrain (*varco* etc., *yaśo* etc.)  
of 14 syllables.⌋ The mss. read in **b** *babhūváthus*, accenting also  
*dyā́vāpṛthivī́;* the translation implies the simpler and more probable  
emendation to *-vatus;* ⌊and of course the retention of the  
ms.-accentuation of *dyā́vāpṛthivī́:* correct the Berlin ed. accordingly;⌋  
SPP. leaves both words unchanged, without heeding their irreconcilable  
character; that the comm. takes *dyā́vāpṛthivī́* as vocative is simply in  
accord with his usual disregard of the accent. In **c** and **f**, the  
mss. vary between *ánu-sam* ⌊so most⌋, *anu-sám*, and *ánu sám* (the  
*pada*-mss. have *anu॰sáṁcarema:* but one has *ánu॰saṁcarema!*); SPP.  
adopts *ánu sám* ⌊cf. note to Prāt. iv. 3⌋, against our *anu-sám;* there  
is little choice between the two. In **d**, the mss. in general begin  
with *yaśásām* ⌊some with *yáśasām*⌋, two or three having *yáśasam* or  
*yaśásam;* SPP. adopts the last, we *yáśasā;* here, again, there is  
little to choose; the comm. explains *yaśasā*, though his text (SPP.)  
gives *yaśasām*. The comm. foolishly takes *āyatī́s* in **e** as, jointly  
with *yáśas*, object of *gṛhītvā́* in **f**, supplying *dhenūs* for it to  
qualify. The verse counts (16 + 14: 16 + 14 = 60) as a full  
*atiśakvarī;* ⌊but see beginning of this paragraph⌋.

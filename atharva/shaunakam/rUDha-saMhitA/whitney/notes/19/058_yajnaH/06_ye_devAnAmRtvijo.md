## Translation
6. They that are priests (*ṛtvíj*) of the gods, and that are worshipful,  
for whom the oblation (*havyá*) is made the portion—coming to this  
sacrifice together with their spouses, let the gods, as many as they are  
(*yā́vant*), revel on the oblation.

## Notes
In **b**, the mss. have also *kriyate, kṛyate*, ⌊*kṛyáte*,⌋ and  
*kṛṇute*. In **c**, the *pada*-mss. read *sahá॰patnībhiḥ*, and nearly  
all the *saṁhitā*-mss. agree with them; SPP. also emends to *pát-*. In  
**d**, all the mss. have *tavíṣā* or *táviṣā* (p. *-ṣā*) SPP. reads,  
with the comm., *taviṣā́s* (= *mahāntaḥ*, comm.); the translation implies  
*havíṣā*, instead of our emendation *sám iṣā́*. The verse ⌊12 + 11: 11 +  
12⌋ has two more syllables than a regular *triṣṭubh;* ⌊the cadences of  
**a, b, c** accord with the number of syllables: but **d**, with 12, has  
a *triṣṭubh* cadence; this casts still further suspicion on *taviṣā*, in  
place of which we should expect only two syllables⌋.

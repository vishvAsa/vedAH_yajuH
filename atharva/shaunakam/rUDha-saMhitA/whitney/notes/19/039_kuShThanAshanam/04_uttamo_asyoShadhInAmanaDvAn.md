## Translation
4. Thou art the highest (*uttamá*) of herbs, as the draft-ox of moving  
creatures (*jágat*), as the tiger of beasts of prey:—by no means may  
etc. etc.

## Notes
⌊Pādas **a-c** are repeated from viii. 5. 11: see note.⌋ Ppp. combines  
*uttamo ‘sy oṣ-*. It repeats in the refrain its readings *asmāi* and  
*divaḥ* (see note to vs. 2).

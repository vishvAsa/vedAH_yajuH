## Translation
6. The *aśvatthá*, seat of the gods, in the third heaven from here:  
there \[is\] the sight (*cákṣaṇa*) of immortality; thence was born the  
*kúṣṭha*.

## Notes
This verse and the next correspond nearly with v. 4. 3, 4 (repeated as  
vi. 95. 1, 2). Most of the mss. accent in **d** *kuṣṭhás*. SPP. adds to  
this verse and the next the last four pādas of vs. 5, as a refrain  
continued from that verse; and this is evidently the understanding of  
the Anukr., and the comm. ratifies it. Whether SPP. makes the addition  
on the authority of these two alone, or whether some of his mss. also  
intimate it, he does not state; not one of our mss. gives any sign of  
it. ⌊Ppp. has *jayatāt saḥ:* presumably answering to the end of pāda  
**d** of the Berlin ed.; but Roth's Collation is not quite clear.⌋

## Translation
6. Our song of praise, O shining (*vibhā́van*) night, like a king thou  
enjoyest; may we be having all heroes, may we become having all  
possessions, through (*ánu*) the out-shining dawns.

## Notes
The mss. read at the end *anūṣásaḥ* (p. *anu॰uṣásaḥ*); SPP. emends as we  
had done. Ppp., in **b, c, d**, has, *joṣasī yathā nas sarvavīrā bh-*.  
The verse is very ill described by the Anukr.; it is a good *pan̄kti*  
with one syllable wanting in **c**.

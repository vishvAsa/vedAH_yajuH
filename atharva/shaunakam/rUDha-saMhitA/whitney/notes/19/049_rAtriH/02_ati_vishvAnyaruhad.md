## Translation
2. The profound one hath surmounted all things; the most mighty one hath  
ascended to the loftiest sky; the eager night spreads toward me like a  
friend with excellent *svadhā́s*.

## Notes
The translation follows our text of the verse, which, however, is full  
of emendations, and by no means satisfactory. Nearly every ms. reads at  
the beginning *ávi* (one *áviṁ*, and one authority ⌊SPP's reciter V.,  
with impossible accent⌋ *ábhi*), while Ppp. has *abhi*, which is also,  
except for the accent, an easier emendation for *ávi*. The comm. has  
*ati*. Nearly all authorities, again, have for verb in **a** *áruhat*  
(the accent is perfectly defensible as an antithetical one, and might  
well have been left in our text); but the reciter V. gives (*ábhi*)  
*árhat*, thus agreeing in part with the (*ati*) *arhat* of the text of  
the comm.; ⌊and one of W's mss. has *ásahat*⌋. The explanation of the  
comm. reads *atyarhati*, which he glosses by *atikramya vyāpya vartate*,  
which is wholly without authority, since even the Dhātūpaṭha gives only  
*pūjāyām* as the sense of *arh*. Ppp. has *aruhat*. SPP. goes half way  
with the comm., adopting *áti...aruhat* (unnecessarily abandoning the  
"ancient accent" of the verb). All authorities have *víśvāni* (but Ppp.  
only *viśvā ar-*); and all ⌊save Ppp. again⌋ have *gambhīró*, p. *-ráḥ*,  
⌊but one of W's pada-mss. gives *-rā*, p.m.⌋, although the comm.,  
again.st his own text (according to SPP.), explains *gambhīrā*. Here  
perhaps Ppp. brings help, reading *gabhīro ’d varṣ-;* this is better  
than our *-rā́ = rā́: ā́*. ⌊The *gabhīrā́* of the Berlin ed. seems to be a  
misprint for *gambhīrā́*, if we judge by the Collation Book and the Index  
Verborum: but it may be intended as an emendation, as it certainly is a  
metrical improvement.⌋ SPP. reads *gambhīró vá-*, although *gambhīrás*  
is simply unusable, and the change to *-rā́* as easy as possible. Nearly  
all, including Ppp., read *várṣiṣṭham*, ⌊save three of SPP's authorities  
and one of W's, which have *-ṣiṣṭam*⌋. Then follows in nearly all  
*aruhántas*, p. *aruhántaḥ;* but *-háta* is found in one, *-hánta* in  
two, and *arháti* is given by a reciter, with the comm.; the comm. has  
*arhati*, and explains it precisely as he did his *ati...arhati* above;  
SPP. emends to *aruhanta;* our ⌊ā́...⌋ *dyā́m aruhat* is very bold, but  
the case was a desperate one. Ppp. reads *aruhad aśraviṣṭhā*, and this,  
with emendation to *áśramiṣṭhā* (cf. RV. iv. 4. 12), makes acceptable  
sense. One of SPP's mss. has *śramiṣṭhā́*, but doubtless only by  
accident; all the other authorities, including the comm., have ⌊apart  
from some unimportant details⌋ *śraviṣṭhā́*, which SPP. emends to  
*śráviṣṭhāḥ*. There was probably no sufficient reason for our changing  
*śrav-* to *śav-* in our text. The fairly acceptable and least altered  
version of the line would be this: *abhí víśvāny áruhad gambhīró ’d  
várṣiṣṭham aruhad áśramiṣṭhā*. The third pāda is in equally bad  
condition. All the authorities ⌊with unimportant variants⌋, including  
Ppp., have at the beginning *uśatī́ rā́try* (*a-*), but the *pada*-mss.  
give *rā́tri* instead of *rā́trī*, as they should give, and as SPP's  
*pada*-text reads by emendation. What follows it the *pada*-mss. offer  
as *ánu॰sāma: drā́him* (or *drāhím*); in the *saṁhitā*-mss. the first  
word appears as *ánusāma* (once *ánusama*) or (accentless, and so making  
one word with *-drā́him* or *-drā́hi*) *anusāma-* or *aṁnusāma-*; and the  
second appears as *-drā́him*, *-drā́hi*, *drā́him*, *drā́hím*, *drāhí*,  
*drā́vi*, *prā́him*. The rest of the half-verse, *tiṣṭhate mitrá iva  
svadhā́bhiḥ*, is the same in all, including the comm. and Ppp. SPP.  
emends to *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhí ti-*, which appears to be modeled on our  
*ánu mā bhadrā́bhir ví ti-*, but is defective both in sense and in meter.  
The comm. gives *anukṣaṇaṁ vi ti-*, cutting loose entirely from the  
ms.-reading; his own text, according to SPP., has *anusāmadrā vi ti-*.  
Ppp., finally, has *avasāna bhadrād vi ti-*, which suggests the  
emendation *uśatī́ rā́try ávasā no bhadrā́ ví tiṣṭhate* etc. Our *ví  
tiṣṭhate*, at any rate, is by the support of Ppp. and the comm. put  
nearly beyond question. ⌊I have made some modifications in the above  
paragraph which I could not well indicate by the ell-brackets.—For those  
who do not have the Bombay ed., it may be well to give SPP's  
reconstructions of the verse: first, the text of the comm.: *ati viśvāny  
arhad gambhīro varṣiṣṭham arhati śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anusāmadrā vi  
tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhih;* second, the text which the comm.  
actually explains: *ati viśvāny arhati gambhīrā varṣiṣṭham arhati  
śraviṣṭhā: uśatī rātry anukṣaṇaṁ vi tiṣṭhate mitra iva svadhābhiḥ;*  
third, SPP's reading: *áti viśvāny aruhad gambhīró várṣiṣṭham aruhanta  
śráviṣṭhāḥ: uśatī́ rā́try* (p. *rā́trī*) *ánu sā́ bhadrā́ ’bhi tiṣṭhate mitrá  
iva svadhā́bhiḥ*.⌋

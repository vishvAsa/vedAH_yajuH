## Translation
8. Excellent art thou, O night, like a decorated bowl; thou bearest  
\[as\] maiden the whole form of kine; full of eyes, eager, \[thou  
showest\] me wondrous forms; thou hast put on (*prati-muc*) the stars of  
heaven (*divyá*).

## Notes
Of this verse also the translation is a make-shift, following in part  
the mss. and in part our conjectural emendations. In **a** the only  
point of question is the last word, which the mss. read as *ṣiṣṭás* (so  
the majority) or *śiṣṭas* or *viṣṭás* ⌊etc.⌋: the comm. has *viṣṭas* (=  
*bhojanārtham pariviṣṭas*). Ppp. gives the whole pāda as *bhadrā ’si  
rātris tapaso nu viṣṭo*. In **b**, nearly all the mss. give *víśvaṁ  
górūpaṁ yuvatir* ⌊several have *-tím*⌋ *bibharṣi* (one has *bíbh-*), and  
this the translation follows, alterations not seeming to supply a better  
sense. SPP., however, follows the comm. in offering *víṣvan̄* for  
*víśvam* (in *saṁhitā* he prints it incorrectly *víṣvaṁ gó-*, as if  
there were an assimilated final in the case); ⌊but in his Corrections at  
the end of vol. iv. he duly notes the error;⌋ he would hardly accept the  
comm's interpretation, = *viṣūcī* (one gender for another); but how he  
would render it, it is hard to see. Ppp. reads *viśvaṁ gorūpaṁ yuvatid  
vibharṣi*, but another hand has written above *-tir bibha-*. In **c**,  
nearly all the mss. (including the comm's text, as stated by SPP.) leave  
*me* unchanged before *uśatī́* and SPP. accepts it in his text, though  
against all rule and practice; two of our mss. have *ma*. ⌊All the  
authorities give *cákṣuṣmatī*, and this is followed by the comm. and  
SPP., and also by W. in the translation, therein departing from the  
emendation ('to me having eyes') of the Berlin ed.⌋ Ppp. has for the  
pāda *cakṣuṣmatī ve yuvatī ’va rūpaḥ*. The translation supplies a verb,  
as seems necessary unless the text be still further altered. For **d**  
the general ms.-reading is *práti tyā́ṁ divyā́ tákmā amukthāḥ* (also  
*tvám* and *tvā́* for *tyā́m*, and *takmā́;* p. *takmā̀ḥ* or *-mā́ḥ*); but  
the comm. offers *práti tváṁ divyā́ ná kṣā́m amukthāḥ*, and this SPP.  
accepts ⌊accenting thus⌋ and prints. Ppp. has *pratyāṁ dityāṁ divyām  
arukṣam amugdhaḥ*. The comm's version of the text is senseless, and his  
attempt to put meaning into it very absurd; it might suggest *práti tváṁ  
divyā́ nákṣatrāṇy amukthāḥ*. Our text ought to accent *tā́rakā am-*, if  
the reading is admitted.

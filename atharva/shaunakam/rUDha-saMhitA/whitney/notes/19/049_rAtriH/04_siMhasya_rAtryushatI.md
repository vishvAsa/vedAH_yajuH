## Translation
4. The eager night has taken to herself the splendor of the lion, of the  
stag, of the tiger, of the leopard, the horse's bottom, man's (*púruṣa*)  
roar (? *māyú*); many forms thou makest for thyself, shining out.

## Notes
The saṁhitā-mss. accent *rātry uśatī́* (p. *rātri: uśatī́*); SPP. emends,  
with us, to *rā́try uśatī́;* the comm. also understands *rā́trī*. The mss.  
all ⌊with trifling variations⌋ read *pīṣásya* or *pīṅsásya* (or  
*ṣīṣásya*); SPP. accepts *pīṅsásya;* the comm. gives *piṣasya*, which is  
doubtless only a bad spelling of our *piśásya;* ⌊lion and stag are  
mentioned by these names together at RV. i. 64. 8;⌋ Ppp. has *nipasya;*  
and, at end of **b**, *varcādhe*. In **c**, all the authorities,  
including Ppp. ⌊but not the comm.⌋, offer *bradhnám;* the translation  
implies correction to *budhnám*,\* which is the reading of the  
commentator (he explains it as = *mūlam*) ⌊and adds, *aśvavīryasya vego  
hi mūlam;* in vi. 38. 4 we had the horse's *vā́ja* and man's *māyú*  
combined; and TB. (ii. 7. 7¹) in the corresponding passage reads  
*krándye* for *vā́je*. The comm. explains *māyúm* as *śabdam  
āhvānādilakṣaṇam*. Ppp. has *kṛṇuṣī* for *-ṣe*. ⌊The majority of the  
authorities read *vibhātī́ḥ* at the end.⌋ \*⌊Cf. *áśvabudhna*, RV. x. 8.  
3; and Aufrecht on *áśvabudhya*, ZDMG. xxiv. 206.⌋

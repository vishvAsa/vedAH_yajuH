## Translation
10. ⌊Away⌋ his feet, that he may not go; ⌊away⌋ his hands, that he may  
not harm.

## Notes
What marauder shall approach, may he go away all crushed; may he go  
away, may he go well away; may he go away in a dry place (?).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
At the end of **b**, the majority of mss. read *yáthā́śiṣaḥ*, which all  
the *pada*-mss. resolve into *yáthā: áśiṣaḥ;* ⌊most of⌋ the rest, and  
SPP., give *yáthā́ ’śiṣat;* the comm. *yathā ”śliṣat* (= *saṁśleṣayet*).  
Ppp. offers *pra pādāu na yat āhataṣ pra hastāu na yanāśiṣat*. In **e**,  
the *pada*-mss. compound *su॰ápāyati*, doubtless wrongly; ⌊read as  
*pada*-text *sú: ápa: ayati*⌋. All the mss., the comm., and SPP., give  
in **f** *sthāṇāú*, and the comm. explains it as =  
*śākhopaśākhārahitavṛkṣamūla āśraye*. After it, the mss. have *apā́yataḥ*  
(p. *apa॰áyataḥ*), but the comm. agrees with us in *ápā ’yati*, and SPP.  
accordingly also adopts it. The translation follows throughout the  
emendations of our text; perhaps, in **f**, *sthā́ne* would be better  
than *sthalé*, as more closely resembling the ms.-reading. We are  
deprived of the help of Ppp. upon the point, as it skips from *apāyati*  
in **e** to *tṛṣṭadhūnam* in 50. 1 **a**; for **c, d**, it had *yo  
mulalaṁ sulapāyati sa saṁpiṣṭyo upāyati*. We had **d** above as iv. 3. 5  
**b**; ⌊cf. the end of the note to vs. 9⌋.

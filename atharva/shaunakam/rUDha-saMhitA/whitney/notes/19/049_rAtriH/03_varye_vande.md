## Translation
3. O desirable, welcome, well-portioned, well-born one! thou didst come,  
O night; mayest thou be well-willing here; save thou for us the things  
that are produced (*jātá*) for men, likewise what \[are\] for cattle, by  
prosperity ⌊*puṣṭyā́*⌋.

## Notes
⌊Or, '\[and\] prosperous,' if we read *puṣṭā́*.⌋ The mss. all read in  
**a** *várye*, which we need not have altered to *vā́rye*, as *várya* is  
found elsewhere as early as TB.; Ppp. has *niryāi*. Three of SPP's  
authorities and one of ours have *vándye*, ⌊one has *véde*⌋, the rest  
with Ppp., *vánde;* the comm. *vade* (= *sarvāir abhiṣṭūyamāne*). Ppp.  
has *svajātā*. In **b**, most of the mss. begin with *ā́jā́gan* (one  
*ájā́gan;* p. *ā́: jā́: agan*), and the true reading is in all probability  
*ā́ ’jāgan*, impf. intensive of *gam;* or, if left as "pluperfect," as in  
our edition, it should at any rate be *ā́ ’jagan*, as SPP., with the  
comm., reads. *Rātri* is our (evidently called-for) emendation for  
*rā́tri* of the mss., which SPP. follows. *Syās*, at the end of **b**, is  
also for *syām* of the mss., the comm., and SPP.; it is an obvious  
improvement, though not quite necessary ⌊and receiving no support from  
Ppp.: see below⌋. Ppp. has a peculiar (and corrupt) version: *ā* (if  
*svajātā*, as quoted above, is for *svajāta ā*) *cāgni rātri sumanā hy  
asyām*. In **c**, the translation implies emendation of *asmā́ṅs* to  
*asmé*, against all the authorities, including Ppp. and the comm. The  
*pada*-mss. read *jātā́ḥ*, their natural inference from the rare and  
anomalous combination *jātā́ átho;* SPP. emends to *jātā́*. In **d**, Ppp.  
reads *śriyā* instead of *atho*, and at the end *puṣṭyā*, with all the  
mss. (they vary only as to its accent), and with SPP.; our conjectural  
emendation *puṣṭā́* is supported only by the comm. ⌊text and  
explanation⌋.

## Comment
⌊Prose.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xix. The four verses of this hymn are called in Kāuś. and Vāit. jivās, and are prescribed to accompany the rinsing of the mouth with water in the parvan ceremony (Kāuś. 3. 4; Vāit. 1. 19, misunderstood by the editor), in a rite for long life at the reception of a Vedic student (Kāuś. 58. 7), and in the madhuparka ceremony (Kāuś. 90. 22); of these the comm. takes notice only of Kāuś. 58. 7. With this use is doubtless connected the attribution of the hymn in the Anukr. to the waters as divinity. ⌊As to the citation by technical designation, and especially as to the ritual uses, see p. 897, ¶2.⌋

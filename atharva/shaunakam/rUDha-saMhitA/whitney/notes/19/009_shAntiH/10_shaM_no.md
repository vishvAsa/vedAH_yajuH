## Translation
10. Weal for us be the planets belonging to the moon, and weal the sun  
(*ādityá*) with Rāhu; weal for us smoke-bannered death, weal the Rudras  
of keen brightness.

## Notes
The translation follows in **b** the text of the comm. *ādityaś ca  
rāhuṇā*, as is read also by SPP., who follows the comm. and three or  
four authorities. Most of the mss. have *-tyaḥ śarāhuṇā* (p. also  
*śarāhuṇā*), but two or three *śaṁ rāhuṇā*. Those that accent *-rāhuṇā*  
or *rāhuṇā* at all accent it on the final, *-huṇā́*, and this accent SPP.  
has not dared to change, although it is against all rule and practice.  
In connection with *dhūmaketu* the comm. quotes Kāuś. 127. 1, where the  
word is used; it seems to me extremely unlikely that it signifies a  
comet; ⌊does it not refer rather to the smoke that rises from the  
pyre?⌋.

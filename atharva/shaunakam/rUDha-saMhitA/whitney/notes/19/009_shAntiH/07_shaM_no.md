## Translation
7. Weal for us be Mitra, weal Varuṇa, weal Vivasvant, weal the destroyer  
(*ántaka*), \[weal\] the portents from earth and from atmosphere, weal  
for us the planets (?) moving in the sky.

## Notes
The mss. vary between *utpā́tās* and *utpātā́s*, the great majority  
favoring the former. SPP. reads *pā́rthivā ”ntárikṣās*, giving in  
*pada*-text *-vā: ānt-*, while the *pada*-mss. read *-vā: ant-*; but his  
reading is palpably wrong and impossible, while a very slight emendation  
would have given *pārthivāntarikṣā́s* (implying the *pada*-text  
*pārthiva॰āntarikṣāḥ*), which is implied in the translation above. The  
comm. explains as if he had *pārthivās* and *āntarikṣās* as two separate  
words; but, according to SPP., his text reads *pārthivāntarikṣāḥ*. Half  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. or more combine *-ikṣācháṁ no*, as if the word had  
ended in *-kṣāt;* and, as these included all known to us down to the  
time of printing, our text reflects them. The comm. of course makes no  
question of explaining *grahās* at the end as "Mars and the rest"; and  
perhaps there is no sufficient reason for questioning that  
interpretation. The Anukr. does not remark the redundancy of a syllable  
in 7 **c**.

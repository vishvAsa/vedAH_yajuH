## Translation
9. Be the meteor-smitten asterism weal for us; weal for us the  
enchantments and weal be the witchcrafts; weal for us the buried spells  
(*valagá*), weal the meteors; and weal be for us the land-plagues.

## Notes
Literally, 'the afflictions (*upasarga*) of a region.' All the mss. read  
in **a** *ulkā́bhíh* (p. *ulkā́: abhí॰h-*), which SPP. accordingly adopts;  
the comm. again (as in 8 **b**) regards it as a compound, which it is  
unquestionably meant to be, and which our text gives by emendation; the  
prefix *abhi* suits the situation, as *nir* (8 **b**) did not. In **c**,  
SPP. has the better accent *nikhātās*, with a large minority of his  
mss.; none of ours give it, and we accepted *nikhātā́s*, since it is not  
without support elsewhere. Our *valagā́s* was an emendation for *valgā́s;*  
but our two *pada*-mss. ⌊D.s.m.L.⌋ compared later, have *valagā́ḥ*, as  
does one of SPP's; the latter, however, adopts *valgā́s*, against meter  
and sense, and against the comm. The *pada*-mss. all have *ulkā́* in  
**c**, an evident blunder for -*kā́ḥ*, which SPP. this time ventures to  
read by emendation: it is extremely difficult to understand his  
selection of the cases where he is willing to emend. The metrical  
definition of the verse (really 12 + 11: 11 + 11 = 45) by the Anukr. is  
as bad as possible.

## Translation
2. Kings have gathered (*sam-gā*), debts have gathered, *kuṣṭhás* have  
gathered, sixteenths have gathered; all evil-dreaming that is in us—let  
us impel away evil-dreaming to him that hates us.

## Notes
The *pada*-mss. read *sáḥ: mṛṇā́ni* for *sám: ṛṇā́ni*, and *sáḥ: kalā́ḥ*  
(the *saṁhitā*-mss. also *sá kalā́ ag-*) for *sám: kalā́ḥ;* SPP. follows  
us in emending in both places to *sám*, which the comm. also has. At the  
beginning of the second division, we have emended *sám* of the mss. and  
comm. (which SPP. follows) to *sárvam*. For *yát* (after *asmā́su*) the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *yáta*, and the *pada*-mss. *yátaḥ;* out *yát* is  
supported by the comm., and SPP. adopts it The comm. says that *kuṣṭha*  
is a skin-disease, symptomatic of various maladies; and, when one of  
these remains unhealed, boils and sores etc. (? *piṭakavraṇādīni*) show  
themselves. Also, that *kalās* are *anupādeyāvayavopalakṣaṇa*, and  
worthless parts of cattle etc. are collected in old pits. And in like  
manner collected ill-dreaming is made over to an enemy. That is his  
idea, and a wholly unacceptable one, of the general meaning of the  
verse. ⌊The verse is prose, no *triṣṭubh;* but may be stretched so as to  
count as 43 syllables.⌋

## Translation
1. A body together with my body. ⌊...⌋ May I attain all my life-time.  
Sit thou on what is pleasant; fill thyself full, cleansing thyself in  
heaven (*svargá*).

## Notes
The verse is utterly obscure and disconnected, and we might long for the  
comm., if we had found that he ever gave any help in such a case. The  
first clause is translated as corresponding with that in TS. etc. (see  
under 60. 1); what is inserted between it and the following clause is  
omitted as unintelligible. The mss. read *sahe* (with varying accent),  
and *dántāḥ* (so all the *pada*-mss. and some others) or *datáḥ*, or  
*rádátāḥ* ⌊or *radántāḥ*⌋; SPP. adopts *sahe datáḥ*, to which he might  
be puzzled to give any meaning. In the second division, SPP. reads with  
the mss. *syonáṁ me s-*, and *purúḥ pṛ-*.

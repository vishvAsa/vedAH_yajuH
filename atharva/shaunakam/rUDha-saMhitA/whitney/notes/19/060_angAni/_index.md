## Comment
⌊Prose.⌋ As was noticed above, the hymn is wanting in Pāipp. Hymns 60-63, both text and explication, are lacking in the comm. The comm., at p. 5175, assigns only fourteen hymns to this the final anuvāka; ⌊but at p. 5529 he numbers the last hymn as the thirteenth, having combined hymns 69 and 70 of the Berlin ed. into one of 5 vss. (pañcamantrātmakaṁ sūktam, p. 5481): both numbers are at variance with the⌋ eighteen of the mss. ⌊in general: but see under h. 65⌋ and of the Anukr. The hymn is quoted in Kāuś 66. 1 in the savayajña chapter ⌊see table on p. 896⌋; the mss. of Kāuś. read āsyan ⌊like the AV. mss.⌋.

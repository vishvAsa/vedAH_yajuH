## Translation
1. The trickish Asuras that go about, having metal nets, hooking with  
fetters of metal, them I make subject to thee with flame, O Jātavedas;  
go thou, a thousand-barbed thunderbolt, slaughtering our rivals.

## Notes
Ppp. combines in **a** *-jālā ’surā*, and reads in **b** *ayasmāi p-*;  
in **c** it seems to give *harase*, which would be an acceptable  
emendation. Our *sahásrabhṛṣṭis* in **d** is for the *-hṛṣṭis* (the  
majority) or *-dṛṣṭis* ⌊two⌋ or *-hraṣṭis* ⌊two or three⌋ or ⌊*-haṣṭis*  
or *-hraṣṭi* or⌋ *-hruṣṭis* or *-riṣṭis* or *-bhṛṣṭis* (all these, one  
each) of the authorities; SPP. reads, with the comm., *-ṛṣṭis*. SPP.  
also follows the comm. in adopting *pāhi*, against the majority of his  
authorities (though in such a case their reading, whether *pā-* or  
*yā-*, is extremely doubtful); ⌊here the testimony of his oral reciters  
is of especial weight, and they (his K. and V.) gave *yāhi*⌋.

## Translation
1. Indra's two arms \[are\] stout, virile (*vṛ́ṣan*), these two wondrous  
successful bulls; them will I first yoke when the conjuncture (*yóga*)  
arrives—they by which was conquered the heaven (*svàr*) that is the  
Asuras'.

## Notes
The SV. text (ii. 121 9) is considerably different: in **a, b**,  
*yúvānāv anādhṛsyāú supratīkā́v asahyāú;* in **c**, *tāú yuñjīta  
prathamāú;* at the end, *sáho mahát*. *Vṛ́ṣāṇāu* (instead of the regular  
*vṛ́ṣaṇāu*) is read also by Ppp., and the meter demands it ⌊cf.  
*Noun-Inflection*, p. 537, 523⌋. The combination *citrā́ imā́ vṛṣ-*, if  
representing, as the sense clearly requires, *citrāú: imāú: vṛṣ-*, is  
anomalous in AV., though regular for some of the other Vedic texts (cf.  
Prāt. ii. 22 note); and the *pada*-text shows a sense of this, by  
reading *citrā́ḥ: imā́: vṛṣ-*. SPP. gives as his *pada*-text *citrā́: imā́*,  
which leaves the saṁhitā reading unaccounted for; the comm. assumes  
*citrāu* and *imā*. In **c**, all the mss. (whence also SPP.) read  
*yokṣe*, for which our *yokṣye* is an emendation, plainly demanded by  
both sense and meter; it is one of the common cases of a *y* lost after  
*ṣ;* Ppp., too, has *yokṣye* (before it, *ta* for *tāu*); the comm. has  
the senseless *yakṣe*. All the mss., again, read *prathamás* (*-mó  
yó-*), and the comm. likewise, with, of course, SPP.; our emendation to  
*-māú* (with SV.) is an improvement, but not a necessity. The comm.  
foolishly declares *āgate* = *kṣeme*, in order to bring about the  
ordinary combination of *yoga* and *kṣema*, here quite out of place. He  
also takes *svàr yát*, against accent and *pada*-text, as one word ⌊cf.  
15. 4, note⌋, and explains *-yat* as a participle, = *gacchat!* Ppp.  
reads and combines in **c** *prathamayogā ”gate*.

## Translation
5. To be known by his strength, stout, foremost hero, powerful, vigorous  
(*vājín*), overpowering, formidable, excelling heroes, excelling  
warriors, conquering with power—mount, O Indra, the victorious  
kine-winning chariot.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The fourth verse of the RV. hymn is transposed ⌊in the AV. text so as⌋  
to follow our vs. 7, and vs. 5 AV. is vs. 5 RV. The other texts ⌊RV.  
etc.⌋ all read at the end *govít;* and all except MS. have in **c**  
*sahojā́s*. SPP. retains in **a** the *visarga* before *stháv-*, with the  
majority of the mss.; he also accepts in **c** *abhíṣatvā*, with half  
the mss., but against all the parallel texts, apparently because the  
comm. has *ṣ*. Ppp. reads for **d** *jāitrāyāi ā ratham ā tiṣṭha  
kovidam*. ⌊The *govídam* of the Berlin text seems to be an emendation.  
Nearly all the authorities of W. and of SPP., and SPP's text as well,  
and the comm., have *govídan;* but one or two have *govít*, with RV.  
etc.⌋

## Translation
7. Plunging with power into the cow-stalls, Indra, pitiless, formidable,  
of hundred-fold fury, immovable, overpowering fighters, invincible—let  
him favor our armies in the fights.

## Notes
The stalls, namely, in which the kine are shut up by the Asuras. All the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *‘dāyá ugráḥ* at beginning of **b**, but all the  
*pada*-mss. (except one of SPP's) give *adayáḥ*, and one of ours puts  
after it the sign that is wont to be used when a word shows an anomalous  
change in *saṁhitā*. RV. ⌊vs. 7⌋ SV.VS. (also K.Kap.: see Schröder's  
note to MS.) read *adayás*, and our text follows their authority; but  
TS. has *adāyás* (of which the Pet. Lexx. take no notice), and MS. has  
*ādāyás;* the comm. reads *adāyas*, but explains it by *nirdayas*, as if  
it were *adayás*. *Adāyás* is doubtless the established AV. reading. All  
the other texts have after it *vīrás* instead of *ugrás*. In **c**, all  
the others except MS. have *ayudhyás*. Most of the *pada*-mss. accent  
*ayodhyàḥ*, ⌊and so the *pada*-reading of MS.⌋. The first pāda is  
*bhurij* ⌊read *gotrā́*?⌋.

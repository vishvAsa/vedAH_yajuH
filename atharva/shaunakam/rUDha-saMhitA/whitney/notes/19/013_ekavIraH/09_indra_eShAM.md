## Translation
9. Indra \[be\] their leader; let Bṛihaspati, the sacrificial gift, the  
sacrifice, soma, go in front; in the midst of the smashing conquering  
armies of the gods let the Maruts go.

## Notes
⌊RV. vs. 8⌋ The text of MS. agrees throughout with ours; the others read  
*āsām* in **a**, and *ágram* (for *mádhye*) in **d** ⌊but TS. *ágre*⌋.  
The comm. does here a thing which is hardly paralleled elsewhere in his  
work: he points out that some explain *dakṣiṇā* in **b** as meaning "on  
the south," but that, as the word would in that case have to be accented  
*dakṣiṇā́*, as shown by xviii. 1.42, it must signify here rather  
'sacrificial gift' (*yajñe dīyamānā gorūpā dakṣiṇā*). A like attention  
to the element of accent elsewhere would notably improve the character  
of his lucubrations. ⌊Cf. note to vs. 4.⌋

## Translation
6. Be ye excited after this formidable hero; take hold, O companions,  
after Indra, the troop-conqueror, kine-conqueror, thunderbolt-armed,  
conquering in the race, slaughtering with force.

## Notes
We had this verse ⌊which is RV. vs. 6⌋ above, as vi. 97. 3; the reversal  
in the other texts of the order of the two lines, and the other  
variants, were there noticed. TS. and MS. alter a little the order of  
verses: RV. 4 is followed in TS. by RV. 6, 5, 7, and in MS. by RV. 7, 5,  
6. The Anukr. reckons vss. 3-6 alike as *bhurij*, although 3 is  
redundant by two syllables. ⌊Ppp. reads *satvānas* for *sakhāyas* in  
**b**.⌋

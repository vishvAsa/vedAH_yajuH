## Translation
2. Standing upright, defend thou this man unremittingly, O unsubdued  
one; let not the Paṇis, the sorcerers, damage thee; as Indra the  
barbarians, \[so\] do thou shake down them that fight \[us\]; overpower  
and scatter (*ví*) all our rivals: let the unsubdued one defend thee.

## Notes
All the mss. ⌊with unimportant variants⌋ read in **a** *tiṣṭhanta;* SPP.  
emends to *tiṣṭhatu*, because the comm. reads the latter; our *tíṣṭhan*  
suits the connection decidedly better. ⌊The vocative *astṛta* and the  
*tvā* are⌋ perhaps sufficient reasons for our altering the *rákṣann* of  
the mss. (also of the comm. and Ppp.) into *rakṣa*, and the translation  
follows ⌊the printed text of Berlin⌋. To humor his *tiṣṭhatu*, SPP.  
changes the following *ástṛta* (mss. *ástṛte ’mám;* p. *ástṛta: imám*)  
to *ástṛtas* ⌊but only in the *pada*-text, so that his saṁhitā does not  
agree therewith⌋; our text simply emends to astṛta ⌊accentless⌋; the  
comm. also regards the word as vocative. Ppp. has instead saṁbhṛta,  
⌊and, if I understand Roth's Collation, combines it with a following  
corrupt *imanu*, so as to read *saṁbhṛte ’manu*⌋; and, in **c**, Ppp.  
has *indrī ’va*. The majority of mss. accent *pṛtanyátas*. The Anukr.  
apparently means us to scan thus: 11 + 4 + 11: 15 + 8 + 8 = 57.

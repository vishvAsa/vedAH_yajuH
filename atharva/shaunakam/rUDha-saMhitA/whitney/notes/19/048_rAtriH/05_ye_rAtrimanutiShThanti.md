## Translation
5. They who follow (*anu-sthā*) the night, and who watch over beings,  
who defend all cattle—they watch over our selves (*ātmán*), they watch  
over our cattle.

## Notes
The mss. accent *jā́grati*\* in **d** and **e**, and in **d** the accent  
might well enough be retained, on the principle of antithesis; SPP.  
gives *jāgrati*, like us. Emendation to *jāgratu* would be decidedly  
welcome in both pādas. Ppp. has considerable variations: for **b**,  
*yeṣu bhūteṣu jāgrabhi*,† and, for **d, e**, *tenā tvam asi jāgratu te  
naṣ paśubhir jāgratu:* corrupt, but supporting our proposed *jāgratu*.  
\*⌊It is very reasonable to suppose that in *jā́grati* at end of **d**  
and **e** we have two cases of assimilation of an original *jāgratu* to  
the *jā́grati* which stands correctly at the end of **b** (cf. note to  
xix. 43. 7), each case being doubly faulty, in respect, namely, of  
accent and of ending.⌋ †⌊In Roth's Collation there is a note which  
perhaps means that Ppp. reads *jāgrati* for *rákṣanti* at end of **c**;  
but I am not at all sure.⌋

## Translation
6. Verily I know thy name, O night; thou art "ghee-dripping" (*ghṛtā́cī*)  
by name; as such Bharadvāja knows thee; do thou watch over our property.

## Notes
In **b**, Ppp. combines *vā ’si;* in **c** and **d** it reads, with our  
edition, tvā and *jāgṛhi*, while SPP. gives *tvā́m* and *jāgrati*, the  
latter for *jā́grati*, as all the mss. ⌊save one⌋ read; our emendation  
was a perfectly obvious one, and should have been followed by SPP. The  
comm., to be sure, reads *-rati*, but, by the simple application of his  
general rule, that any verb-form can be used for any other, he is able  
to declare it = *jāgartu*—which SPP. has too much knowledge and  
conscience to do. The *pada*-mss. have *tvā́m*, *tvām*, and *tvám;* our  
*tvā* was an emendation, called for after *tā́m*. More than half of the  
mss. accent *bharadvājás*. In our text, the accent-sign printed over  
*jā* in **d** should be shifted to over *dhi:* it is a misprint.

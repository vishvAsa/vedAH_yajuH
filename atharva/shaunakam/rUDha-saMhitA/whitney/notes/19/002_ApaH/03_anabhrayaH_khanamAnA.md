## Translation
3. Digging for themselves without shovels, keen (*vípra*), working in  
the deep (*gambhīrá*), more healing than the healers (*bhiṣáj*), the  
waters we address.

## Notes
The mss. and SPP. with them, read in **b** *gambhīré apásaḥ*, which is  
good enough to be exempt from emendation; the comm. seems to make a  
compound, *gambhīreapasaḥ*. The mss. and SPP. also have in **d** *áchā  
vad-* (p. *ácha: vad-*); it was altered in our text to *achā́vad-* (=  
*acha॰ā́vad-*) because the Atharvan everywhere else ⌊except iii. 20. 2⌋  
reads the latter and not the former. Ppp. reads and combines  
*gambhīrepsā bhiṣagbhyo bhiṣaktarā ”po a-*.

## Translation
5. Weal \[be\] to thee the waters, propitious the waters, effecting  
freedom from *yákṣma* the waters; just as joy to one who thirsts, \[be\]  
they for thee healers of dislocation.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, which has numerous emendations. At the  
beginning, the mss. and SPP. read *tā́s* for *śáṁ te* (*śāntā́s* might be  
better); the latter was intended to fill up both sense and meter (the  
Anukr. says nothing of a defective *pāda;* but this is of very little  
account). Then they have thrice *apás* in **a, b**, instead of *ā́pas;*  
but the comm. has *āpas* both times in **a**. In **c** they all give  
*tṛpyate;* Ppp. has *athāi ’va drśyate mayas*. For **d**, SPP. reads  
*tā́s ta ā́ datta bheṣajī́ḥ*, with the comm. ⌊who understands the second  
word as *té* or also as *te*⌋; the mss. mostly have *ād uta* (p. *āt:  
uta*), but they vary to *ādutta, ādata*, ⌊*ādatta, ādruta*,⌋ *āhuta*,  
with various accentuation. The verse is so corrupt throughout that it  
offers a free field for conjectural emendation. SPP. combines in **b**  
*apó ‘yakṣmaṁkár-*, which is inadmissible, though found in the mss.; we  
must change to *apò ‘y-*, if not to *ā́po ‘y-*. Ppp. makes in **a** its  
usual combinations, *tā ”paś śivā ”po ‘y-*, and reads for **d**  
*tvābhyatva bheṣajīḥ*.

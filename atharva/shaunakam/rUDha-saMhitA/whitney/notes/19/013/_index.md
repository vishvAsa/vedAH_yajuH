## Comment
The hymn is, with slight variations, identical for the most part with the familiar Apratiratha hymn of the Rig-Veda (x. 103), found also in other texts: VS. xvii. 33 ff.; SV. ii. 1199 ff.; TS. iv. 6. 4; MS. ii. 10. 4. ⌊The readings of VS. and SV. agree with those of RV., as noted under vs. 2.⌋ Our first verse is peculiar, being found elsewhere only in SV. (ii. 1219); and vss. 10, 12, 13 of the RV. hymn-are here wanting. ⌊The RV. vss. here occur in the order 1-3, 5-7, 4, 8-9, 11.⌋ The hymn occurs also in Pāipp. vii. In Vāit. 1. 18, the selected brahman-priest is directed to recite the Apratiratha hymn; this probably means our hymn; GB. (ii. 1. 18) quotes the pratīka of our vs. 1 as the apratiratha. ⌊Varāhamihira's Yogayātrā (8. 6) prescribes the hymn for use by a king just about to march forth to war: Ind. Stud. xv. 170.⌋

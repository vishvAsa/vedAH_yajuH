## Translation
1. O night, the earthly space (*rájas*) hath been filled with the  
father's orderings (*dhā́man*); great, thou spreadest thyself (*vi-sthā*)  
to the seats of the sky; bright darkness comes on (*ā-vṛt*).

## Notes
The verse is VS. xxxiv. 32, and is also found as first verse of a  
*khila* (Aufr., p. 682) to RV. x. 127, in both places without variant.  
⌊It is quoted in Nirukta, Dāivatakāṇḍa iii. 29.⌋ Ppp. reads in **b**  
*pitaraṣ prāyu dh-*, and in **c** *sudhāṅsi*. The comm. holds 'the  
father' in **b** to designate the "skyey world" (*dyuloka*), quoting the  
commonplace *dyāuḥ pitā pṛthivī mātā* in support of it; *dhāmabhis* he  
glosses with *sthānāiḥ saha*, and *tveṣam* with *dīpyamānam*. ⌊For  
*dhā́mabhis* we might perhaps better say 'by or in accordance with the  
orderings'; but Griffith understands it as 'wondrous works.'⌋

## Translation
5. And two of thine and twenty of thine, O night; eleven the least  
(*avamá*)—with those protectors today do thou protect us, O daughter of  
the sky.

## Notes
At beginning of **d** all the authorities ⌊with one unimportant variant⌋  
read *ná*, which seems impossible. We emended it to *ní* (cf. *ní pāti*  
in ix. 10. 23); SPP., following that blind guide the comm., reads *nú;*  
this is entirely unacceptable, both on account of the sense, and because  
*nú* cannot stand at the beginning of a pāda: cf. note to v. 6. 5. The  
authorities are much at odds as to the accent of *duhitar divas*, the  
majority having *duhitár divás*. Ppp. reads in **b** *rātrī ek-*.

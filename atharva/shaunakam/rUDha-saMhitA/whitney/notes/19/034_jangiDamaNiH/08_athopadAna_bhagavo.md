## Translation
8. So then when thou didst come into being, O *jan̄giḍá*, ⌊O thou⌋ of  
unmeasured heroism, Indra of old, O formidable one, ⌊in the beginning  
(*agratás*)⌋, gave unto thee heroism.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, which, however, is more thoroughly  
altered from that of the mss. than in any instance thus far; and, of  
course, in a manner open to question. At the beginning, all the  
*saṁhita*-mss. give *áthopadā́nábhagavo* ⌊one, *bhá-*⌋, which the  
*pada*-mss. divide thus: *átho íti: padā́: ná: bhagavaḥ* ⌊one, *-váḥ*⌋;  
but the comm. understands it as *átho ’padāna bh-*, and SPP. follows him  
(p. *átha: upadāna: bh-*); the comm. explains *upadāna* by upādīyate  
svīkriyate *kṛtyānirharaṇādivyāpāreṣu*—which is utterly implausible.  
Ppp. gives no help, giving *aśvayopadāni bh-*. For **c**, the mss. read  
*purā́ ta ugrā́ grasata* (*úp-*), p. *purā́: te: ugrā́: grasate: úpa:* etc.;  
and SPP. emends only by changing *ugrā́* to *ugrā́ḥ* ⌊in p.⌋, as the comm.  
understands. The latter explains it to mean: "Indra, perceiving that  
formidable creatures will devour (*purā grasate* = *bhakṣayiṣyanti!*)  
thee, O *jan̄giḍa*, gave" etc. Ppp. has a text for **c-d** that would  
make good sense: *purā ta ugrāya sato ’pendro* (i.e., by the usual  
double combination, *sate: upá*) 'to thee, being before formidable,  
Indra added further heroic quality.'

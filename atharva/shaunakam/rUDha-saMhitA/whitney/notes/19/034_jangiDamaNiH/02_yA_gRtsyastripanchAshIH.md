## Translation
2. The witchcrafts that are thrice fifty, and the witchcraft-makers that  
are a hundred—may the *jan̄giḍá* make them all of vanished brilliancy  
(*-téjas*) \[and\] sapless.

## Notes
The first pāda is corrupt in the mss., and very doubtful; the  
translation implies *yā́ḥ kṛtyā́ḥ*, which is most naturally suggested by  
the connection, and takes *tripañcāśís* as an indefinite large number  
(like *tisráḥ pañcāśátaḥ*, RV. i. 133. 4), and as formed like  
*triṣaptá*, *triṇavá*, etc., in spite of the important objection that  
none of these make a fem. in *ī*, and that the word most naturally means  
'fifty-three, composed of fifty-three,' or the like. ⌊W's conjecture,  
*yā́ḥ kṛtyā́ḥ*, nearly coincides with that of Geldner (KZ. xxvii. 218),  
*yā́ś ca kṛtyā́ḥ*. Geldner's is metrically better; and he takes *trip-* as  
an indefinitely large number (cardinal), as does W.⌋ It was this word  
*tripañcāśá*, applied to the set of dice in RV. ⌊x. 34. 8⌋ (but perhaps  
meaning 'thrice fifty'), that suggested the not very happy emendation in  
our edition to *akṣa-kṛtyā́s*. The mss. read mostly *jāgṛtsyas tr-* (with  
various accent, most often on *-syás:* p. *jāgṛtsyáḥ: tripañca॰ aśī́ḥ!*),  
also *jyā-*, *yyā-*, and (two of SPP's) *yāgṛtsyás;* this last the comm.  
also has, and understands it as *yā(ḥ) gṛtsyas*, explaining the latter  
as = gardhanaśīlās ⌊SPP's *pada*-text accordingly, *yā́ḥ: gṛ́tsyaḥ*⌋, and  
*tripañcāśīs* as *tryadhikapañcaśatsaṁkhyākās*, both as epithets of  
*kṛtyās* (understood). ⌊With this reading, we can take *gṛ́tsyas* as nom.  
pl. fem. to *gṛ́tsa* and render 'what fifty-three clever *or* sly  
\[witchcrafts there are\]'; but *gṛ́tsa*, in such an application and with  
such sinister meaning, has rather slender support, to wit, VS. xvi. 25,  
as cited by BR. ii. 778.⌋ Ppp. gives *yā kṛcchrā tripañcāśīś ch-*,  
which, while it is itself (emended to *yāḥ kṛcchrās*) not wholly  
unacceptable, also favors our *yā́ḥ kṛtyā́s;* there is insufficient reason  
for the feminine words if *kṛtyās* be not expressed. ⌊I cannot here  
attach much value to the evidence of Ppp.: on the one hand, it confuses  
surd and sonant very often (*kovidam* for *govidam*, xix. 13. 5: cf. xi.  
5. 4, note); and, on the other, the relation of its *cch* to *ts* may be  
somewhat like that discussed under x. 9. 23 (*ṛchára*, *ṛtsára*, etc.).  
The mss. are decidedly in favor of *gṛtsyas* as against *kṛtyās;* but  
Whitney's objection as to the omission of *kṛtyās* seems to me a weighty  
argument in favor of his conjecture.⌋ Our *vínaṣṭatejasas* in **c** was  
an emendation, which, now that the comm. also reads it, may be regarded  
as sufficiently established; the mss. mostly *vinaktatéjasas* (also  
*vinaktu t-*, *viniṣṭat-*, *bhanakti t-*, *minaktu t-* ⌊etc.⌋:  
*pada*-readings, *vinaktu* \[as independent word or as compounded with  
*téjasaḥ*\] or also *vinakta॰t-*). SPP. strangely contents himself with  
*vinaktu téjasas*, which certainly he would be unable to translate into  
anything even simulating sense. Ppp. is corrupt, and brings no help; it  
has *sarva vyunaktu tej-*. ⌊Did not SPP. understand his reading thus:  
'Let the amulet separate them all from their *téjas* (ablative)'? The  
instrum. *téjasā*, which good authorities give, would also be a proper  
construction with root *vic:* 'Let the amulet part them all with their  
efficiency (*téjas*),' i.e. rob the wizards of their power to make their  
witchcrafts efficacious against us. Whitney's reading and rendering are  
wholly satisfactory in themselves: but *vinaktu téjasas* or *-sā* seems  
to me no less so; and it has much stronger support (directly or  
indirectly) from the mss., and even from Ppp., than has RW's  
*vínaṣṭatejasas*.—After writing the above, I notice that Bloomfield, p.  
672, interprets SPP's reading quite differently: the way in which he  
construes *vic* does not seem to me admissible.⌋

## Translation
10. The crusher, the burster, the *balā́sa*, the side-ache, the *takmán*  
of every autumn, may the *jan̄giḍá* make sapless.

## Notes
The two names in **a** are found nowhere else; the comm. regards them as  
names of specific diseases, the one meaning 'wholly injurious,' the  
other 'especially injurious.' The root *śṛ* has not been found with *ā*  
as prefix ⌊except, as noted by OB. vi. 209, at GB. i. 2. 18⌋. The words  
might of course also be epithets. The only variants concern the accent  
of *pṛṣṭyāmayam;* the majority of mss. agree with the editions; some  
have *pṛṣṭyā̀mayam*. Ppp. reads at the beginning *āśarīraṁ*, and in **d**  
*arasaṁ*.

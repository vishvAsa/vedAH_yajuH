## Translation
2. If we, O gods, detract from (*pra-mī*) your \[ordained\] courses—we  
that are very unknowing, of you that are knowing—let Agni the  
all-devouring fill that up, knowing, and the soma that has entered the  
Brahmans.

## Notes
The first three pādas are RV. x. 2. 4 **a-c**, found also in TS. i. 1.  
14⁴ and MS. iv. 10. 2. All these read in **c** *víśvam ā́ pṛṇāti;* our  
*viśvā́d* (p. *viśva॰át*) can only be regarded as a corruption; the  
translation, however, follows it, as being the real Atharvan reading;  
SPP. adopts it in his text, against the comm., who reads and explains  
*viśvam*. The comm. agrees with RV. etc. further in giving *pṛṇāti*. As  
for the last pāda, we had it above as **d** of xviii. 3. 55; it is also  
a RV. phrase, and found elsewhere: see under that verse.

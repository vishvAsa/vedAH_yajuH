## Comment
Hymns 59-64 are not found in Pāipp. For the practical use of 59 with 52, see under the latter. ⌊Other uses under vs. 3.⌋ Verses 1 and 2, it will be noticed, are put together also in TS., and vs. 3 is not far off ⌊preceding 1 and 2⌋. In MS., on the other hand, vss. 2 and 3 have the same sequence as here; ⌊but in RV. their sequence is inverted⌋. ⌊As for the ritual use, cf. p. 896 and the table.⌋

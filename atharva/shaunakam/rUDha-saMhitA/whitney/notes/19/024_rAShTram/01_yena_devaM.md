title = "०१ येन देवं"

## Translation
1. With what \[garment\] the gods caused to wrap god Savitar, with that,  
O Brahmaṇaspati, do ye wrap this man in order to royalty.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation in **b** of *ádhārayan* to  
*ádhāpayan;* this, obviously suggested by the whole sense of the hymn  
(and proposed in the Pet. Lex.), is supported by the Ppp. text, which  
reads *devā ’diyāpayan*. The comm. reads *-dhār-*, but explains it as if  
it were *-dhāp-: paritaḥ sarvata ācchādayan*. Many of the mss. have  
*adhārayan*, unaccented. The comm. quotes TS. vi. 1. 1⁴, to the effect  
that "this same garment belongs to all the gods," to explain why the  
verb in the second half-verse is plural.

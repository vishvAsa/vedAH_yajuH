## Translation
1. I harness (*yuj*) thee with the mind of one that is unwearied and  
that is first; be thou an up-carrier uphill; having carried up, then run  
thou back.

## Notes
The real sense of the hymn is very obscure; neither the *viniyoga* nor  
the comm. casts any light upon it. ⌊SPP. regards the comm. as taking  
*utkūlamudvaho* as one word;⌋ the comm. reads *bhavas* for *bhava:* and  
he explains the phrase simply by *atidṛpto bhava*. Instead of *uduhya*,  
the comm. has *duhīya* (= *śatrujayalakṣaṇāni phalāni labheya*). SPP.  
accents *útkūlam*, with all the mss.; our alteration to *utkū́lam* is not  
sufficiently motived; the minor Pet. Lex. has *utkūlám*, which is more  
in accordance with general analogies. Fully half the mss. accent  
*úduhya*. In our text, *bháva* (in **c**) is a misprint for *bhava* (an  
accent-mark fallen out).

## Translation
1. Gāyatrī, uṣṇih, anuṣṭubh, bṛhatī, pan̄kti, triṣṭubh-and-jagatī.

## Notes
The mss. are at variance as to the use of any *kampa*-sign between the  
first two words. ⌊The metrical definition (18 syllables) calls for the  
resolution *gāyatrī uṣ-*.⌋ SPP's authorities appear all (except one  
*pada*-ms. *-tī*) to read at the end *jágatyāi;* ours vary between  
*-tī*, *-tye*, *-tyāi*, and *-tyāu*. The text of the comm. reads  
*pan̄kti* (instead of *-tis*), and, either with reason or on account of  
his usual disregard of accent, he takes the whole verse as a single  
compound word in the dative case, explaining it to mean *gāyatryāi  
svāhā, uṣṇihe svāhā*, etc., and declaring it thus to contain seven  
*mantras;* and SPP. thinks this to be "doubtless" the original character  
of the line; it would be safer to say "perhaps," or "possibly," since  
the separate accentuation, the nominative form *pan̄ktís*, and the  
division by the Anukr. into two pādas (in the *pada*-mss., after  
*anuṣṭúp*) all speak against it. The mss. accent *triṣṭúb jágatyāi*.

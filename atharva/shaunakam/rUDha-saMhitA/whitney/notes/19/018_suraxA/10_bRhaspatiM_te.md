## Translation
10. Let those malignants who shall attack me from the upward quarter  
come upon Bṛihaspati with all the gods.

## Notes
Verse 8 is properly *bhurij* (23 syllables). Verses 9 and 10 are each  
properly of 27 syllables; but by restoring elided initial *a* here and  
there (with regard to which the Anukr. appears to acknowledge no rule)  
the meters as defined can be made out.

title = "०१ अग्निं ते"

## Translation
1. Let those malignants (*aghāyú*) who shall attack (*abhi-dās*) me from  
the eastern quarter come upon (*ṛch*) Agni with (*-vant*) the Vasus.

## Notes
The comm. has the more regular *vasumantam*. All the mss., and the  
comm., have at the end of all the verses *‘bhidā́sāt*, which SPP.  
accordingly retains; our edition makes the absolutely necessary  
emendation to *-sān*. ⌊Is *-dā́sāt* a faulty reminiscence of AV. v. 10?⌋  
Most of the saṁhitā-mss. also accent *diśó ‘bhi-*. Some of the mss.  
leave *té* unaccented. 'With' is represented throughout the hymn by  
*-vant* or *-mant*, not by the instrumental case. As usual, *ṛch*  
signifies a coming into hostile or detrimental contact or collision. ⌊W.  
interlines "run against" as alternative for "come upon."⌋

## Translation
7. With the *darbhá*, god-born, constantly sky-propping—with it I have  
constantly won and shall win men (*jána*).

## Notes
In a most of the mss. read *devajāténa;* SPP. with us. In **b**, SPP.  
follows the mss. in giving *diví ṣṭambhéna* (p. *diví: stambhéna*) our  
emendation to *diviṣṭambhéna* is obviously required, and is assumed by  
the comm. In **c**, our *jánāṅ* was an emendation for the *jánās* of the  
mss.; but two of SPP's mss. read *jánāṅ*, and it is accepted also in  
SPP's text. The comm. supports it by giving *janān;* ⌊and his text has  
*janān asanam*⌋. ⌊Ppp. also has *janān*, as noted below.⌋ In **d**,  
nearly all the authorities read *ásanām* (three of them have *ásanānt  
s-*), but SPP. finds among his, two that agree with the ⌊text of the⌋  
comm. in presenting *ásanam*, which he adopts, and which is undoubtedly  
the true text; the aorist is the tense that best suits the connection.  
⌊This remark seems to involve the implication that *asanām* might be an  
imperfect of the *nā*-class; but that can hardly have been Whitney's  
intention.⌋ Ppp. reads *janān asanāṁ*, ⌊and, in **b**, *divaṣṭambhena*.⌋

## Translation
2. His hair they scatter not forth, they smite not blows on their breast  
\[for him\], to whom one yields refuge by the *darbhá* of uncut leaves.

## Notes
The expression in **a** is a good example for the real identity of roots  
*vap* 'strew' and *vap* 'shear.' Many of the mss. accent *urási* in  
**b**. All the mss. leave *yachati* in **d** unaccented, and both  
editions commit the error of refraining from emendation to *yáchati*,  
which is of course necessary. Ppp. has at end of **b** *ghnatī*, and  
combines in **c** *yasmā ’cch-*. Bloomfield translates and comments on  
the verse in AJP. xi. 339 ⌊or JAOS. xv., p. xlv⌋. The comm. supplies in  
the first line as subject *mṛtyudūtā rakṣaḥpiśācādyā vā*, renders *pra  
vapanti* by *ākarṣanti*, and combines *urasitāḍam* into a compound—all  
very bad.

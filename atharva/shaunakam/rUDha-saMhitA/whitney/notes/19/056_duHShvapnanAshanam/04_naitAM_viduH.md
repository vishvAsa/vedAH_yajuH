## Translation
4. Not the Fathers, and not the gods, know it, whose (pl.) murmur goes  
about within here; in Trita Āptya did the men (*nṛ́*), the Ādityas,  
taught by Varuṇa, set sleep.

## Notes
The mss. read at the beginning *nāí ’tā́m* ⌊and so SPP.⌋, the *etā́m* 'it'  
apparently being viewed as relating to *jálpis;* the comm. makes the  
relation plainer by giving in **b** *yāi ’ṣām;* but this latter SPP.  
rejects. At end of **b**, the mss. vary between *antarétám* and *antaré  
’dám* (p. *antarā́: idám*); the comm. gives the latter, and SPP. accepts  
it; Ppp. also has it; ⌊and it is implied in the translation⌋. The mss.,  
as always, vary between *tṛté* and *trité;* the great majority here give  
the former. *Váruṇena* in **d** was our emendation for *ár-*; it is read  
also by the comm., and by one of SPP's mss., and is found in Ppp.; SPP.  
also adopts it in his text. The mss. all accent *ā́dityāsas*, and SPP.  
does not emend, as we do, to *ādityā́sas*. Ppp. reads in **b** *jalpyaś  
c-*, and has for **c** *trite svapnam arididṛhā prate narā* (*ādit-*).  
With **c**, compare RV. viii. 47. 13-17 and especially 15 **c, d**. The  
comm. tells a tale of how *duḥsvapna*, having received overlordship from  
the gods, waxed topping, and seized on the Ādityas; the latter applied  
for relief to Varuṇa, and, duly instructed by him, put off the  
*duḥsvapna* upon the great seer (*maharṣi*) Trita, son of the waters:  
this is pretty plainly no tradition, but an account devised by the comm.  
to fit the immediate case.

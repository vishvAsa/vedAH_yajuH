## Comment
The hymn occurs also in Pāipp. xx., but only in fragments, not intelligible beyond the first half-verse. The comm. notices that the hymn has the same pratīka as ix. 1, and labors to point out that it ⌊xix. 3⌋ and its successor have features adapting them to the same use as the two parts of ix. 1; and that hence they may also be regarded as quoted (Kāuç. 10. 24; 12. 15; etc.) by that pratīka: this is, of course, a worthless bit of special pleading. Vāit. (16. 12), wishing to quote ix. 1 only, adds the specification madhusūktena.

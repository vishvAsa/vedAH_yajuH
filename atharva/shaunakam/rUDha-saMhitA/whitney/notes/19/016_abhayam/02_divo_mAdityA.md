## Translation
2. From the sky let the Ādityas defend me; from the earth let the fires  
defend; let Indra-and-Agni defend me in front; let the Aśvins yield  
(*yam*) refuge round about; crosswise let the inviolable \[cow\], let  
Jātavedas, defend \[me\]; let the being-makers be my defense (*várman*)  
on all sides.

## Notes
In **e** the mss. all read *tiraścī́naghnyā́*, which the *pada*-text  
resolves into *tiraścī́n: aghnyā́*, and this SPP. retains, though  
*tiraścī́n* is not a possible word. Our emendation to *-cī́nā ’ghnyā́* is a  
very simple one (implying *-cī́nā: aghnyā́*); the translation is founded  
on it; but a more radical alteration of the pāda would be acceptable:  
something like, for instance, *tiryák cā ’gnī́ rakṣatu jātávedāḥ;* the  
*jātávedās* leads naturally to the suspicion that *agnís* is somehow  
hidden in the *’ghnyā́;* the comm. indeed reads *tiraścīn agnī r-*; but  
he is able to regard *tiraścīn* as a masc. accus., implying *asmān;* or  
else as by Vedic license for *-cīs*, and this for *-cībhyas*, implying  
*digbhyas* (!); and such assumptions are forbidden us. The *pada*-mss.  
all read *rakṣantu* in **e**.  
  
The Anukr. in its metrical definition treats this all as one verse, and  
the same treatment is implied by the summation at the end of the  
*amivāka* (see p. 928); but the comm. and one of our mss. make what  
follows the second *avasāna* into a separate or third verse; ⌊a like  
contradiction obtains as between the Anukr. and the comm. in the  
repeated passage, below, 27. 14, 15 (see the note); here, moreover, as  
noted above, the mss. of the Anukr. are at variance as to whether the  
hymn is to be reckoned as of 2 vss. or of 3⌋. The addition of  
*bṛhatīgarbhā* to the metrical definition is quite uncalled-for;  
⌊doubtless because pāda **b** scans better as 8 syllables than as 9: no  
less uncalled-for is the addition of *saptapadā*, unless, dividing what  
follows the second *avasāna* into 3 pādas, we begin the seventh with an  
enclitic⌋.  
  
⌊I suspect that our text consists of 6 pādas (8 + 8: ll + 11: 11 + 11 =  
60, "*atiśakvarī*"), call them 1 vs. or 2, as you will. Pādas **c** and  
**e** and **f** have good *triṣṭubh* cadences; **c** is good *triṣṭubh*  
if we resolve *indraagnī;* so is **e**, with W's *tiryák cā ’gnī́ r-*;  
the presence of *me* in **f** is all that spoils **f**; and the absence  
of *me* after *yachatām* is all that spoils the cadence of **d**, if,  
substituting the grammatical equivalent, we pronounce *aśvínā ’bhítaḥ*  
at the beginning.⌋

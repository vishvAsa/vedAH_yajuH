## Translation
1. Freedom from rivals in front, behind us \[is\] fearlessness made;  
Savitar \[protect\] me on the south, the lord of śachī me on the north.

## Notes
The comm. takes *kṛtám* in **b** as 2d du. impv., = *kurutam*, in spite  
of the accent, trying to find a dual subject in the two gods mentioned  
in **c, d**; and SPP., in obedience to this, even reads *kṛtam*,  
although twelve of his thirteen authorities (with all of ours) have  
*kṛtám*, the thirteenth evidently disagreeing with the rest purely by  
the accidental omission of an accent-mark.\* It would not be impossible  
to take *mā* in **c** and **d** as object of *dakṣiṇatás* and *uttarā́t*.  
\*⌊For the use of *kṛtám* (the participle), cf. *tāír me kṛtáṁ  
svastyáyanam*, above, 9. 12 **c**.—In his Collation Book, W. refers to  
RV. *khila*, 3. 4, which reads *asapatnám purástān naḥ śiváṁ dakṣíṇataḥ  
kṛdhi: abháyaṁ sátatam paścā́d bhadrám uttarató gṛhé*.

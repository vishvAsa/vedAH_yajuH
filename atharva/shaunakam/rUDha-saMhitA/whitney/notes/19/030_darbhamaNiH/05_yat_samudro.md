## Translation
5. What the ocean roared (*krand*) against, \[and\] Parjanya with the  
lightning, therefrom was born the golden drop (*bindú*), therefrom the  
*darbhá*.

## Notes
Our edition emends in **a** to *samudré*, which is doubtless an  
improvement, but not necessary. ⌊The translation follows the mss., SPP.,  
and comm., which have *samudró:* Ppp. *samudro ‘bhya-*.⌋ The comm.  
derives the word (as many times elsewhere) from *sam-ud-dravanti*, and  
makes it an epithet of *parjanyas*, which he explains as meaning  
*meghas*. Most of the mss. accent *bíndus*. The comm. makes the second  
*tatas* refer to *bindu*, but gives no opinion as to the meaning of the  
latter. ⌊Ppp. reads *vindus* in **c**.⌋ ⌊Cf. Pischel, ZDMG. xxxvi. 135,  
who thinks the "drop" refers to pearl: cf. introduction to iv. 10.⌋

## Translation
4. A destroyer of our rivals, O *darbhá*, burner of the heart of our  
hater—an amulet, increaser of dominion, protector of thy body, I make  
for thee.

## Notes
Emendation to *darbhám* in a would relieve the anacoluthon of the verse.  
The comm., to get rid of it, first explains *te* as = *tvā;* but then  
secondly connects the whole verse into one sentence leaving *darbha*  
out. ⌊I am not quite clear as to whether he means to leave it out. He  
says: *atha vā rakṣākāmaḥ puruṣaḥ sambodhyate: he rājan darbhamaṇiṁ  
sapatnakṣayaṇādisāmarthyopetaṁ te tubhyaṁ kṣatrasya vardhanaṁ tanūpānaṁ  
ca kṛṇomī ’ti sambandhanīyam.*⌋

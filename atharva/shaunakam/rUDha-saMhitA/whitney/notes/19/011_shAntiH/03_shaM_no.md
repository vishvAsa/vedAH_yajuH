## Translation
3. Weal for us be the divine (*devá*) one-footed goat (*ajá ékapad*),  
weal the bottom snake (*áhi budhnyà*), weal the ocean; weal for us be  
Peru, grandson of the waters (*apā́ṁ nápāt*); weal for us be the spotted  
one (*pṛ́śni*), guarded by the gods.

## Notes
The RV. version reads in **b** *śáṁ nó ‘hir b-*, and at the end *-gopāḥ*  
⌊Müller's 2d quarto ed. and Aufrecht's 2d ed. have *-gopā:* as for the  
form, see my Noun-Inflection, p. 445⌋; Ppp. agrees with RV. in **b**,  
and has *-gopāḥ* at the end. The comm. explains *perús* as *pārayitā  
duḥkhebhyaḥ*, and *pṛśni* as mother of the Maruts. The omission of *nas*  
in our **b** makes the meter defective, but the Anukr. takes no notice  
of it.

## Translation
1. The gold that, born out of the fire, immortal, maintains itself over  
mortals—whoso knows it, he verily merits (*arh*) it; one that dies of  
old age becomes he who wears (*bhṛ*) it.

## Notes
SPP. accents at the end *bibhárti*, with the great majority of the mss.  
(the same also in 2 **d**); our preference for *bíbharti* was because  
only this accent is found elsewhere in AV. Most of the mss. accent  
*énad* in **c**. The masculine *enam* in **c** is surprising, as no hint  
of anything masculine is met with elsewhere in the hymn; the comm.  
explains it as *anvādiṣṭaṁ hiraṇyarūpam padārtham*. In a corresponding  
verse (6) found in a *khila* of the RV. (to x. 128) is read instead  
*enad* (one ms. *vedam*), which is more likely to be the true text. The  
same has in **b** *jajñe* for *dadhre*. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the redundant syllable in **c**.

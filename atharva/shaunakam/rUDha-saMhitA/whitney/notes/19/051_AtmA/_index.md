## Comment
⌊Prose.⌋ Both the "verses" of this hymn are quoted in Kāuś. 91. 3, in the madhuparka ceremony, accompanying acceptance (prati-grah) of the offering. The second verse contains a formula very often used in the liturgical literature,* and this formula, as far as hastābhyām, occurs several times in Kāuś., given in full, and not to be regarded as having anything to do with the verse here; the same is the case with the use of the formula in Vāit. 3.9. There is nothing to correspond to the hymn in Pāipp. *⌊An idea of its frequency may be gained from the array of citations (fourscore or more) given by Knauer in his Index to MGS., p. 151 a. See the table on p. 896, and cf. p. 896, end.⌋

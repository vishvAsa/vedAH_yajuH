## Translation
3. Do not ye injure our wisdom, nor our consecration, nor what ardor  
(*tápas*) is ours; be they propitious to us in order to \[prolonged\]  
life-time; let them become \[our\] propitious mothers.

## Notes
The mss. have in **b** *hiṅsiṣṭam*, and SPP. does not follow our  
obviously acceptable emendation to *-ṣṭa*. The comm., too, has *-ṣṭam*,  
and explains it by calling ⌊into service⌋ that everlasting pair  
*dyāvāpṛthivī;* but, as alternative, he apparently goes on to anticipate  
the pair of Aśvins from vs. 4; there is, however, a lacuna in the sole  
manuscript, cutting off this explanation almost at the beginning. In  
**c**, the mss. all have *sáṁsvanta ā́y-* (p. *sám॰svantaḥ!*), but the  
comm. *śaṅsantu*, explaining it as = *stuvantu;* ⌊SPP. reports that the  
text of the comm. is *śaṁsantu* and that the sole ms. of the commentary  
has actually *santu;*⌋ SPP. takes this, and alters it to *śáṁ santu;*  
our emendation to simple *santu*, suiting both sense and meter, is  
obviously to be accepted. The *pada*-mss. in general give *śivā́* in  
**c**; ⌊but one of W's and one of SPP's, each s.m., have *śivā́ḥ*;⌋ they  
all ⌊except perhaps W's L.⌋ have *śivā́ḥ* in **d**. There is no good  
reason why the Anukr. should call the verse *bṛhatīgarbhā*, since **c**  
can be read as eight syllables in either form.

## Translation
4. That food (? *íṣ*) O Aśvins, which, full of light, shall make us  
pass through the darkness, may ye give (*rā*) to us.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. i. 46. 6, and is translated from the RV.  
text, the AV. version being utterly corrupt, and offering a very  
noteworthy measure of what this nineteenth book can do in the way of  
corruption even of a text that is intelligibly handed down elsewhere.  
The ms. reading is *mā́ naḥ píparid aśvinā jyótiṣmatī támas tiráḥ: tā́m  
asmāí rāsatām íṣum*. Our text differs from that of RV. only by reading  
*pī́parid* (which is an oversight for the *pī́parad* ⌊*Grammar* §869 c⌋ of  
the RV.) and *rāsathām* (which is bad); ⌊RV. has *rāsāthām*, to be taken  
as augmentless *s*-aorist, 2d person dual middle⌋. The comm. differs  
from RV. by giving *mā́* at the beginning; ⌊his text, furthermore, has  
*rāsātām;* but his comment has *rāsāthām*, like RV.⌋; he understands  
*aśvinā* correctly as vocative. SPP. clings to *rāsatām*, and thinks to  
make it answer by accenting *aśvínā* (on the authority, ⌊probably⌋  
accidental, of a single ms.). ⌊I suppose Whitney means to imply that, if  
SPP. intends to make *rāsatām* a 3d person dual imperative middle of the  
*s*-aorist, but from an *a*-stem, as explained at *Grammar* §896, the  
form ought to be *rāsetām*, corresponding to the 3d singular *rāsatām*  
there noticed.⌋ There is really no way but to adopt the RV. text  
throughout; any attempt at compromise simply spoils the verse. The comm.  
takes *mā pīparat* as *pāram mā gamayatu*, and **b** as its antithesis,  
supplying *karotu* to *tiras;* and he refers at the end to *yā* as read  
*śākhāntare* (i.e., in RV.).

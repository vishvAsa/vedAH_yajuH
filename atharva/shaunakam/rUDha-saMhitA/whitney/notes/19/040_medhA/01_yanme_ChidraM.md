## Translation
1. What that is defective (*chidrá*) of my mind, and what of my voice  
hath found (? *jagā́ma*) Sarasvatī enraged, let Bṛihaspati, in concord  
with all the gods, mend (*sam-dhā*) that.

## Notes
The meaning of **b** is extremely doubtful. SPP. reads *sárasvatī*  
against the large majority of his authorities and all of ours, which  
have *-tīm*. Our *hárasvantam* was a conjecture, and perhaps not a  
particularly successful one. The translation given (tentatively) above  
implies *-tīm manyumatī́m*, while all the mss., the comm., and SPP., have  
*-mántam*. Ppp. reads *sarasvatī: manvavittaṁ jagāma*. Hardly a ms.  
gives an accent to *jagāma* (one of SPP's, probably by accident, and  
another, p.m.). Ppp. reads in **d** *sandadātu*. There are corresponding  
verses in VS. (xxxvi. 2) and Āp. (xiv. 16. 1), but they cast no light on  
**b**: VS. reads *yán me chidráṁ cákṣuṣo hṛ́dayasya mánaso vā́ ’titṛṇṇam  
bṛ́haspátir me tád dadhātu;* and Āp., *yan me manasaś chidraṁ yad vāco  
yac ca me hṛdaḥ: ayaṁ devo bṛhaspatiḥ saṁ tat siñcatu rādhasā*.

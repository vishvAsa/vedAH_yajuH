1. So then, to whosesoever houses a thus-knowing Vrātya may come as  
guest,—

## Notes
All that the mss. give for this verse is the two words *vrātyó ‘tithiḥ*.  
But this is obviously in virtue of their usual abbreviation in case of  
repeated matter; the verse is the same with 10. 1 except for the  
omission of *rā́jñas* between *vrā́tyas* and *átithis*. The abbreviation  
is continued in 12. 1 and in 13. 1-4, and then 13. 5 reads in full *tád  
yásyāi ’váṁ vidvā́n vrā́tyaḥ*, because it is the last case of occurrence  
of the phrase. All this admits of no real question, and the verses are  
all thus filled up by Aufrecht in his translation, although he leaves  
the Sanskrit text in its abbreviated form; it is worth so many words  
here only because the Anukr. commits the blunder of regarding *vrā́tyó  
‘tithiḥ* as the whole verse, and defines it as one of five syllables  
(restoring the elided *a*). He has never committed the same blunder in  
the numerous, but less striking, cases of the same kind that we have had  
hitherto.

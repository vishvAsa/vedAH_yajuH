## Translation
1. Of that Vrātya—

## Notes
Bp. combines this verse and the following into one, reckoning only eight  
verses in the hymn. And one ms. (R.) regards every verse\* in hymns 15,  
16, 17 as beginning with *tásya vrā́tyasya* ⌊followed by an  
*avasāna*-mark, as, in fact, SPP. prints them: see my statement at page  
771, end⌋; this, which is opposed to the Anukr., seems also quite  
uncalled for and wrong. ⌊But, for our vss. 3 and 4 at least, SPP. notes  
that his procedure is in accord with all his authorities.⌋ \*⌊Except 15.  
2, which, however, ought properly to form one verse with 15. 1, as it  
does in fact in Bp.⌋

title = "१० आ देवेषु"

## Translation
10. He offends against the gods; his oblation is not \[duly\] made.

## Notes
The majority of mss. (except Bs.E.) read *vṛścate ah-*, which is  
therefore probably the true text; ⌊and so SPP. reads with all but two of  
his authorities⌋. The accent *ahutám* (for *áhutam*) is probably an  
error.

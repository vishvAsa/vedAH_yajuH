## Translation
2. **a.** ⌊9.⌋ He arose; he moved out toward the southern quarter;  
**b.** ⌊10.⌋ after him moved out both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the  
*vāmadevyá* and the sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle; **c.**  
⌊11.⌋ against both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the *vāmadevyá* and the  
sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle doth he offend who revileth  
a thus-knowing Vrātya; **d.** ⌊12.⌋ of both the *yajñāyajñíya* and the  
*vāmadevyá* and the sacrifice and the sacrificer and the cattle doth he  
become the dear abode \[who knoweth thus\]. Of him in the southern  
quarter **e.** ⌊13.⌋ dawn is the harlot, the *mántra* the *māgadhá*,  
discernment the garment, day the turban, night the hair, yellow the two  
*pravartás*, *kalmalí* the jewel, **f.** ⌊14.⌋ both new moon and full  
moon the two footmen, mind the etc. etc.

## Notes
All the mss. have in **e** *mántro;* ⌊so also SPP.: correct the Berlin  
ed.⌋; in our text it and the *mitró* of 1 **e** have been made to change  
places, for the sake of better adaptation to the surroundings. Why 2  
**d** (44 syllables) should be called by the Anukr. an *ārṣī  
parānuṣṭubh* is obscure; perhaps *triṣṭubh* is to be added (or implied  
from the next preceding definition). ⌊For *paśavas*, perhaps 'victims'  
would suit the connection better than 'cattle,' here and below.⌋

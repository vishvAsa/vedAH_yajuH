## Translation
3. **a.** ⌊15.⌋ He arose; he moved out toward the western quarter;  
**b.** ⌊16.⌋ after him moved out both the *vāirūpá* and the *vāirājá*  
and the waters and king Varuṇa; **c.** ⌊17.⌋ against both the *vāirūpá*  
and the *vāirājá* and the waters and king Varuṇa doth he offend who  
revileth a thus-knowing Vrātya; **d.** ⌊18.⌋ of both the *vāirūpá* and  
the *vāirājá* and the waters and king Varuṇa doth he become the dear  
abode \[who knoweth thus\]. Of him in the western quarter **e.** ⌊19.⌋  
cheer is the harlot, laughter the *māgadhá*, discernment the garment,  
day the turban, night the hair, yellow the two *pravartás*, *kalmalí*  
the jewel, **f.** ⌊20.⌋ both day and night the two footmen, mind the  
etc. etc.

## Notes
All our earlier mss. accent *irā́* in **e**, and our edition followed  
them, but some of the later ones (O.D.R.s.m.K.) have correctly *írā*,  
and the text should be emended accordingly. ⌊SPP., p. 322, maintains  
that the mss. showing *írā* are influenced by the RV. accentuation of  
the word, and holds that *irā́* is the true AV. reading.⌋ Some mss.  
(Bs.R.s.m.D.) accent *hasás*.

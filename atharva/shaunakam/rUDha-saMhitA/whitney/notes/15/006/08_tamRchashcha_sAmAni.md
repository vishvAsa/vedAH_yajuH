## Translation
8. ⌊22.⌋ He moved out toward the quarters; ⌊no *avasāna!*⌋ after him  
moved out the *virā́j* and all the gods and all the deities. ⌊23.⌋ Verily  
both of *virā́j* and of all the gods and of all the deities doth he  
become the dear abode who knoweth thus.

## Notes
There seems to be no good reason why this verse should not be divided,  
like all the rest, into three parts; but the Anukr. does not so  
prescribe, nor do the mss. set an *avasāna*-mark after the first *vy  
àcalat:* ⌊compare above, p. 772, ¶ 2⌋. The mss. all agree in accenting  
the second *ánu*.

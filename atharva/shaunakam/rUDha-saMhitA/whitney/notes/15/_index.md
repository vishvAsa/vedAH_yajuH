Book XV.

⌊**The Vrātya.**⌋

⌊This fifteenth book is the third book of the third grand division
(books xiii.-xviii.) of the Atharvan collection; and (like books xiii.
and xiv.) it clearly shows that unity of subject which is the
distinguishing characteristic of the books of the division. Books xv.
and xvi. are unlike all the others in that they consist exclusively of
*paryāya-sūktas*, the former of 18, and the latter of 9. The book has, I
believe, the distinction of being the first book of the Atharva-veda
ever translated into an Occidental language: not only a translation of
it, but also the original text, was published by Theodor Aufrecht, in
the very first part of the first volume of the *Indische Studien*, pages
121-140, in August, 1849 (title-page, 1850: but see ZDMG. iii., pages
484, 482), some five or six years before the first part of the Berlin
edition, the provisional preface of which is dated February, 1855. The
*bhāṣya* is again lacking.⌋

⌊The word *vrā́tya* is defined by BR. as 'belonging to a roving band
(*vrā́ta*), vagrant; member of a fellowship that stood without the
Brahmanical pale.' It is further applied to the son of an uninitiated
man (Bāudhāyana, i. \[8.\] 16¹⁶: cf. Manu, x. 20), or also to one who
has let the proper time for the sacrament of initiation slip by (Manu,
ii. 39). And the MBh., at v. 35. 46 = 1227, classes the *vrātya* with
the offscourings of society, such as incendiaries, poisoners, pimps,
adulterers, abortionists, drunkards, and so on.—In the St. Petersburg
Lexicon, vi. 1503, BR. express the opinion that the praise of the
*vrātya* in this book is an idealization of the pious vagrant or
wandering religious mendicant. In this connection, Weber's *History of
Indian Lit.*, p. 112, may be consulted; also Bloomfield's more recent
paragraph in his contribution to Bühler-Kielhorn's *Grundriss*, entitled
The *Atharvaveda*, p. 94.⌋

⌊The Anukr., in its statements as to the "deity" of the book, says
*adhyātmakam* (see p. 773); and the Cūlikā Upanishad (see Deussen's
*Upanishads*, pages 637, 640) reckons the *vrātya* as one among the many
forms in which Brahman is celebrated in the AV., mentioning in the same
verse with *vrātya* (celebrated in AV. xv.) also the *brahmacārin* and
the *skambha* and the *palita* (celebrated respectively at AV. xi. 5 and
x. 7, 8 and ix. 9), etc.—And this view accords well with the penultimate
verse of the fifth *prapāṭhaka* ​of the Chāndogya Upanishad (v. 24. 4),
where it is said of the sacrificial remnant that, if it be offered even
to an outcaste, it is as good as if offered to the omnipresent All-soul,
provided only it be done with the right knowledge. And a similar idea is
perhaps meant to be expressed by our text here, AV. xv. 13. 8, 9.⌋

⌊In spite of its puerility and surface-obscurity, the book is not
unworthy of a searching investigation. That investigation should be one
of much wider scope than I can now make; but I presume that the
principal passages of the literature which would here come into
consideration are those that treat of the *vrātya-stomas* (ceremonies by
which *vrātyas* gain admission to the Brahmanical order), namely the
seventeenth *adhyāya* of the PB. (parts 1-4) and the eighth *prapāṭhaka*
of LśS. (part 6).—Excerpts from these passages were given by Weber
(1849), *Ind. Stud.* i. 33, 52; and, more recently, the main points were
reported by Hillebrandt, *Ritual-litteratur*, p. 139. And the whole
matter has been made the subject of an article by Rājārām Rāmkrishṇa
Bhāgavat, in the *Journal of the Bombay Branch of the RAS.*, vol. xix.,
pages 357-364. He regards the *vrātyas* as non-Aryans. It is noteworthy
that a number of the articles of the outfit of a *vrātya* as rehearsed
by these two texts are found also in our AV. text: so, for example, the
turban, the goad, the *vipatha*.

⌊**The divisions of the book.**—To begin with, the division into two
*anuvākas* or 'lessons,' the first of 7 and the second of 11 *paryāyas*,
is clearly avouched by the Old Anukr. (see next ¶ but one); and it is
also proved by AV. xix. 23. 25, where the *vrā́tya*-book is mentioned as
a dual, the text reading *vrātyā́bhyāṁ* \[accent!: sc. *anuvākā́bhyām?*\]
*svā́hā*, 'to the anuvakas about the *vrā́tya* hail!'—The decad-division
is wanting.⌋

⌊In the foregoing books, the Berlin edition has grouped together for the
purposes of numeration the combinable *paryāyas* (see pages 471-2) so as
to form the groups which it numbers as viii. 10 (with 6 *paryāyas*); ix.
6 (with 6); \[ix. 7 has but 1;\] xi. 3 (with 3); xii. 5 (with 7); and
xiii. 4 (with 6). For theoretical consistency, the same procedure should
have been followed in this book and the next: but the practical
difference would have amounted to little (we should have had to cite,
for example, xv. 1. 18¹ instead of xv. 18. 1, or xvi. 1. 9¹ instead of
xvi. 9. 1); moreover, the procedure of the Berlin edition is
questionable and has not been followed by the Bombay edition. For an
account of the discrepancies thus arising, see pages 610-611; and for
SPP's detailed defense of his procedure, see the Critical Notice in his
first volume, pages 21-22, where he prints the pertinent text of the Old
Anukr. in full and that of the Major Anukr. in large part.—A comparison
of the two texts shows that the later work has quoted the precise words
of its predecessor throughout.⌋

⌊The quotations from the Old Anukr. are given piecemeal at the end of
the *anuvāka* or *paryāya* or group of *paryāyas* to which they
severally refer. They may here be given in metrical form. Of the first
line, the prior half refers to the first *anuvāka* as a whole, and the
latter half to the second. Lines 2-4 refer to the *paryāyas* of the
first *anuvāka;* and lines 5-10 refer to those of the second. The
numbers in parentheses refer to the *paryāyas* as counted from the
beginning of the *anuvāka;* and those in brackets refer to the
*paryāyas* as counted from the beginning of the book.

⌊A conspectus of the divisions in tabular form follows. In each of the
two tables, the first line gives the number of the *anuvāka*, and that
of the *paryāya* as counted from the beginning of the *anuvāka;* the
second line gives the number of the *paryāya* as counted from the
beginning of the book; the third gives the number of such divisions
(*gaṇas:* p. 472) of a *paryāya* as show minor subdivisions; and these
subdivisions are shown in the fourth line of the first table and in the
fourth and fifth lines of the second table (the subdivisions of the
fourteenth *paryāya* being called *vacanāni:* p. 472). In each table,
the last line gives the number of divisions of 71. *paryāya* which are
not further subdivided.—Observe that the statements of the two tables
are all contained in the text of the Old Anukr., excepting those
concerning the number of *gaṇas* (the third line in each table), which
statements are taken from the summations noted by some mss. at the end
of the *gaṇa-paryāyas*, and excepting the "sums" in the last column, and
excepting the distribution of the *avasānarcas* of *paryāyas* 13 and 11
into 2 categories (as explained in the fourth paragraph of the next
page).

Note that the "fourteen" and "eleven" assigned respectively to
*paryāyas* ii. 6 (or 13) and ii. 4 (or 11) represent non-coördinate
divisions, as explained below, p. 772.—Some mss. sum up the
*avasānarcas* of the first *anuvāka* as 112. This agrees with the Old
Anukr. (and the table). At the end of the second, we find the summation:
*gaṇas*, 20; *gaṇa-avasānarcas*, 16; *vacana-avasānarcas*, 24;
*paryāya-avasānarcas*, 71; in all, 16 + 24 + 71 = 111. This agrees with
the table except in the last item, 71, which exceeds the 68 of the table
by 3; and the sum for the whole book, (112 + 111 =) 223, shows the same
excess.⌋ ⌊See pp. clxi, cxxx end, cxxxvii top, clx.⌋

⌊**Differences between the two editions in the divisions of the
paryāyas.** There are no differences between them in the *paryāyas*
proper (as distinguished from the *gaṇa-paryāyas*), i.e. in those eleven
*paryāyas* which have no subdivided divisions, to wit, *paryāyas* 1, 3,
7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18. But for 15 and 16 and 17, this
statement needs to be modified by rehearsal of the fact that SPP.
prefixes to *yò ‘sya* of each of the *avasānarcas* of the Berlin ed.
from 15. 3 to 17. 7, and also to the 3 remaining ​*avasānarcas* of 17,
the words *tásya vrā́tyasya* with an *avasāna*-mark, but nevertheless
makes his numbering as does the Berlin ed.⌋

⌊The differences accordingly are confined to the remaining seven
*paryāyas* (those which have subdivided divisions), that is, to the
*gaṇa-paryāyas* 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14.—In *paryāya* 14, each of the 12
numbered divisions of the Berlin ed. is really a *gaṇa* and is
subdivided (alike in both editions, by a mark just after *kṛtvā́*) into 2
*vacanas:* but the *vacanas* are numbered as 24 only by SPP.—A similar
statement applies to *paryāya* 4, save that here the subdivision is each
time into 3: thus the 6 divisions of the Berlin ed. become 18 with
SPP.—We should expect the case of *paryāya* 6 to be just like that of 4:
namely that the 9 *gaṇas* of the Berlin ed. would become (9 × 3 =) 27
*gaṇa-avasānarcas* in the Bombay ed.; but in fact the mss. divide one
*gaṇa* (the eighth: see note thereon) into only 2 subdivisions; so that
the sum is only 26. Note here especially that the anomalous division is
supported by the Old Anukr. and that the two editions do not differ in
the marking of the subdivisions, but only in the numbering.⌋

⌊With *paryāyas* 5 and 2, the case is as explained on pages 628-629: in
a sequence of refrains or *anuṣan̄gas*, the refrain is given in full and
counted as a separate *avasāna* only for its first and last occurrence
in that sequence.—In *paryāya* 5 (see note), there are 7 *gaṇas*, each
with 3 subdivisions (the first ending with *akurvan* and the second with
*ī́śānaḥ*): therefore we have 2 *gaṇas* (the first and last), each with 3
subdivisions, making 6; and the remaining 5, each with 2 (**a** and
**b-c**), making 10; and so, in all, 16.—In *paryāya* 2 (for minor
differences, see notes), we have the first and last, each with 8
subdivisions, making 16; and the remaining 2, each with 6 (**a, b, c, d,
e**, and **f-h**), making 12; and so, in all, 28.⌋

⌊Finally, in the case of *paryāyas* 13 and 11, we have divisions which
are not coördinate. In 13, each of the first 5 divisions as numbered in
the Berlin ed. is really a *gaṇa* with 2 subdivisions (the prior one
ending with *vásati*); and each of the remaining 4 is undivided: SPP.
therefore numbers them as (5 × 2 =) 10 *gaṇa-avasānarcas* and 4
*paryāya-avasānarcas*, thus making "14 *avasānarcas* of both kinds," as
required by the Old Anukr.—In the case of *paryāya* 11, the Old Anukr.
requires the division into 11 *avasānarcas*, and this is the division of
both editions. The requirement of the non-coördinate subdivisions,
namely into 5 + (3 × 2 =) 6 = 11, is made only by the summations of the
mss., and only by some of them, not all. This division, if made at all,
is doubtless to be made by taking the first 5 as *paryāya-avasānarcas*
and the last 6 as *gaṇa-avasānarcas* (3 *gaṇas* of 2 each).⌋

  
⌊Of this book we find in Pāipp. (in xviii.) only the first *paryāya* and
a phrase from the second.\* Moreover, neither Kāuś. nor Vāit. make any
citations from the book; but it may be noted that xv. 5. 1 is reckoned
to the *rāudra gaṇa* by the schol. to Kāuś. 50. 13. In respect of
contents and style, the book is quite like the Brāhmaṇas, and it is all
in prose. Occasional sequences of words are rhythmical (so the first
phrase of 17. 8 and the relative clauses of 15 and 16 and 17); but these
are doubtless mere casual lapses into meter (cf. p. 869).⌋ \*⌊See p.
1016.⌋

⌊Whitney's ms. appears to indicate that he intended to give to each
*paryāya-sūkta* a heading (in **Clarendon type**, as before); and I have
thought it well, for the sake of convenience and typographical
clearness, to carry out his apparent intent—Moreover, ​to facilitate
reference to the Bombay edition, I have added, in ell-brackets (⌊ ⌋),
the numbers of SPP's minor divisions, wherever the latter differ from
those of the Berlin edition.⌋

⌊The excerpts from the Major Anukr. which concern the *kāṇḍa* as a whole
may first be given.⌋

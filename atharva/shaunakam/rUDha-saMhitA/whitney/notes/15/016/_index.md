## Comment
⌊The metrical definitions of the Anukr. imply in every verse the inclusion of the words yo ‘sya (pronounced as yo asya), and the reading of apānaḥ as 3 syllables.—As noted at p. 771, end, SPP. puts each time before yo ‘sya the words tásya vrā́tyasya with an avasāna-mark.⌋


In this hymn, the mss. in general omit at the beginning both yó and asya, while in 15 and 17 they omit only yó. Some, however, have asya here also (so K.; R. yó asya throughout).

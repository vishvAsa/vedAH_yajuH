## Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ For him, from the eastern quarter, ⌊2.⌋ they made the two spring  
months guardians, and *bṛhát* and *rathaṁtará* attendants. ⌊3.⌋ The two  
spring months guard from the eastern quarter, and *bṛhát* and  
*rathaṁtará* attend (*anu-sthā*), him who knoweth thus.

## Notes
The subdivisions of verses ⌊see page 772, ¶ 2 above⌋ acknowledged by the  
Anukr. in this hymn are those marked by the mss. and edition; 1 **a**  
has one syllable less than belongs to it by the definition (and so also  
1 **b**, but there is no name\* for a division containing 23 syllables).  
In **b** is to be read in all the verses *ákurvan*, with the mss. The  
Pet Lexx. render *anuṣṭhātṛ́* by 'accomplisher,' which does not suit well  
with *anu-sthā* in **c**. \*⌊That is, no express name: *gāyatrī nicṛt*  
is a description by reference to another metrical unity.⌋

## Translation
4. ⌊10.⌋ For him, from the northern quarter, ⌊11.⌋ they made the two  
autumn months guardians, and *śyāitá* and *nāudhasá* attendants. ⌊12.⌋  
The two autumn months guard from the northern quarter, and *śyāitá* and  
*nāudhasá* attend, him who knoweth thus.

## Notes
Here again (as in 2. 4), the mss. vary between *śyāitá* and *śāitá* in  
**b** and **c**, but Bp. this time has *śyāi-*.

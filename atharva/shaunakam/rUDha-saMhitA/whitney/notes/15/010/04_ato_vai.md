## Translation
4. Let sanctity enter Brihaspati \[and\] dominion Indra; thus verily: it  
was said (*íti*).

## Notes
Or the *iti* means 'he (the Vrātya) said'; Aufrecht so understands it.  
The mss. make very bad work over the verb in this verse: Bp. reads  
*pra॰viśatu*, Bs.P.M.O.T.K. *prāviśatu*, all without accent; E. has *prā́  
viśatu*, R. *prāviśátu*, D. *pra॰viśátu*. The true reading is doubtless  
*praviśátu*, and our text should be emended to this; the situation is  
one in which an accent on the verb-form is called for. There is no  
reason for understanding *pra-ā*, and the prolongation of simple *pra*  
to *prā* is wholly unsuited to this book. ⌊SPP's authorities show a  
fairly bewildering variety of differences, in respect to *bráhma  
praviśátu:* see his note, p. 334.⌋ The metrical definition of the Anukr.  
⌊6 + 7 + 8: *Ind. Stud.* viii. 129⌋ does not fit at all.

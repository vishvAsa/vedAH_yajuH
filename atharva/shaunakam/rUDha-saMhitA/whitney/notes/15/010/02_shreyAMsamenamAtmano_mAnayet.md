## Translation
2. He should esteem him better than himself; so does he not offend  
(*ā-vraśc*) against dominion; so does he not offend against royalty.

## Notes
⌊That is, 'he \[the king\] should esteem him \[the Vrātya\] better,'  
etc.⌋ The Berlin mss. read, as the sense requires, *mānayet táthā*, nor  
was any deviation from this noted in the mss. collated before  
publication; those compared later, however, all give *mānaye táthā;*  
⌊and so do all of SPP's authorities, including his then living reciters,  
but excepting his ms. C^(P), which has *mānayet táthā*, secunda manu,  
and *mānaye t-*, prima manu.—Compare the case of *yame dīrgham*, *yamed  
dīrgham*, at xviii. 2. 3.⌋

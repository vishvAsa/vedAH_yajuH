## Translation
5. Both *bṛhát* and *rathaṁtará* were the two length-wise \[pieces\],  
both *yajñāyajñíya* and *vāmadevyá* the two cross\[-pieces\].

## Notes
Nearly all our mss. (not Bp., which has *-cye íti*) give *anūcyè;* ⌊and  
SPP. so reads without note of variant⌋. At the end, the majority have  
*tiraścé* or else *-ścè* (E.O.K. have *-ścè*: but Bp. has *-śce íti*);  
and this accent ⌊the *svarita*⌋ points distinctly toward *tiraścyè*,  
which is doubtless the true reading; it is given by R.T., and I. has  
*-ścyé*, with wrong accent; our text is to be emended accordingly to  
*tiraścyè* (cf. *adharācyà, anūcyà, apīcyà, udīcyà, pratīcyà, prācyà*).  
⌊SPP. reads *tiraścyè* with no less than six of his authorities; and  
these are supported, *pro tanto*, by nine others that read *-ścè*.⌋

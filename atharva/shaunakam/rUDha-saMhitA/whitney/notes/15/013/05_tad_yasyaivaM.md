## Translation
5. ⌊9.⌋ Now in whosesoever house a thus-knowing Vrātya abides unlimited  
nights as guest, ⌊10.⌋ he thereby gains possession of those pure worlds  
that are unlimited.

## Notes
In **a**, read again *vidvā́n* (same error). ⌊Instead of the *tripadā* of  
our mss. of the Anukr. in the description of 5 **a**, SPP. prints  
*dvipadā*. Critical Notice, p. 22¹⁷.⌋

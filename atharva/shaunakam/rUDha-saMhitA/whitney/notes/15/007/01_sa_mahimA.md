## Translation
1. That greatness, becoming sessile (? *sádru*), went to the end of the  
earth; it became ocean.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
⌊Or, 'He, becoming a sessile greatness, went' etc.: so W. suggests in a  
pencilled note.⌋ Aufrecht and the Pet. Lexx. suspect a play of words  
between *sádru* and *samudrá*, but the likeness is too slight to make  
the matter certain. Aufrecht renders *sádrur bhūtvā́* by "setting itself  
in motion," as if *sa* + *dru*, and the Pet. Lexx. seem to favor the  
same etymology as had in view by the writer, but it is hardly to be  
credited. Aufrecht reads in the third pāda *sa samudro;* I have noted  
*sá* only as inserted *sec. manu* in one ms. (O.); if read, it would  
make the verse answer better the metrical description. ⌊SPP. does in  
fact read *sá samudró*, with the support of all his  
authorities.⌋^([\[1\]](#cite_note-1))

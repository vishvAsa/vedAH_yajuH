## Translation
5. O Kirātan, O spotted one, O grass-haunter (?), O brown one! listen  
ye to me, O black serpents, offensive ones! stand ye not upon the track  
(? *stāmán*) of my comrade; calling out (*ā-śrāvay*), rest quiet in  
poison.

## Notes
It is hardly possible to avoid emending *stāmā́nam* in **c** to  
*sthā́mānam* ⌊'station'⌋ or *srāmāṇam* ⌊'course,' from *sṛ* 'run'—but not  
quotable⌋; Ppp. is very corrupt in **c, d**, but seems to intend no  
variants. It reads *upatarṇi babhrav* in **a**; our *babhra* is by Prāt.  
i. 81, and this passage is quoted in the comment on that rule. It  
further mutilates to *asitalīkā* in **b**. The accents in our text ⌊and  
SPP's⌋ on *ásitās* and *álikās* are against all rule, and doubtless to  
be regarded as misreadings; the translation implies their absence. In  
**c** correct to *sákhyuḥ* (accent-sign lost over *u*). A number of  
⌊our⌋ mss. (P.M.H.I.O.) ⌊and five of SPP's⌋ read *miṣé* for *viṣé* in  
**d** (and *nimiṣe* 'at a wink' would be an acceptable emendation); M.W.  
end with *rabhadhvam*. ⌊Griffith identifies *kāirāta* with *karait*, the  
Hindūstānī name (now well known in the Occident) of an awfully venomous  
little serpent. This would be most interesting, if certain; but friend  
Grierson writes me that it is improbable on phonetic grounds. We should  
expect in Hind. *kērā*.⌋

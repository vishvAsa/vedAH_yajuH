## Translation
8. Let Tvashtar now join variously the forms at this sacrifice, the  
well-joined ones: hail!

## Notes
All the *saṁhitā* mss. read *rūpā́ asmín*, as in our text, the  
*pada*-text having *rūpā́ḥ!* Ppp., on the other hand, gives *bahudhā  
virūpā ’smin*. Probably it is a case of anomalous *saṁdhi* (with  
hiatus), which should have been included in Prāt. iii. 34 (see the note  
to that rule); but one may also conjecture that the true reading is  
*bahudhā́ ’nurūpāḥ*.

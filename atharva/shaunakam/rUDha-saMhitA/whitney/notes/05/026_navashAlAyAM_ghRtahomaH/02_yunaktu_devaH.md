title = "०२ युनक्तु देवः"

## Translation
2. Let the heavenly impeller (*savitár*), the bull (*mahiṣá*),  
foreknowing, join \[them\] at this sacrifice: hail!

## Notes
Ppp. reads, after *prajānan*, *yajñe sayujas svāhā*. The Anukr., in this  
and many of the following verses, simply counts 20 syllables (*prāj.  
bṛhatī*), without heeding the fact that each contains a *triṣṭubh* pāda.

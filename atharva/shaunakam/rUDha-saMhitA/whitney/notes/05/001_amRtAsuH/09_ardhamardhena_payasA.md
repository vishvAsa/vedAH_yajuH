## Translation
9. Half with half milk thou mixest (? *pṛś*); with half, O Asura (?),  
thou increasest \[thy\] vehemence (?). We have increased the helpful  
(*śagmíya*) companion, Varuṇa, lively (*iṣirá*) son of Aditi;  
poet-praised wondrous forms have we spoken for him—the (two) firmaments  
(*ródasī*) of true speech.

## Notes
This translation implies several emendations (or, at least,  
alterations): in **b**, *śúṣmam*, which Ppp. has, instead of the  
vocative *śuṣma*, and *asura*, again with Ppp. (perhaps better *amūra*\*  
'not foolish'? cf. 11. 5, below); in **c**, *ávīvṛdhāma*, which also  
Ppp. gives, while one or two of our mss. offer *ávi॰vṛdhāma* (D.) and  
*avivṛdhāma* (Kp.). In **f** ought to be accented *ávocāma;* the  
*pada*-mss., as elsewhere in such cases, mark the pāda-division after  
the word, thus reckoning it to **e**, which is obviously wrong. Some of  
our mss. (O.D.K.) accent in **a** *pṛṇákṣi*, which is the better  
reading, the case being one of antithetical accent. Ppp. further has  
*śavasā* for *payasā* in **a**, *vardhayase ‘sura* in **b**, *aditer* in  
**d**, and *-vācāu* at the end. The verse (11 + 11: 11 + 11: 10 (9?) +  
11 = 65 \[64?\]) is more nearly an *aṣṭi* than an *atyaṣṭi*. \*⌊This is  
given by some of SPP's authorities.⌋

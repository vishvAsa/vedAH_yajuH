## Translation
7. Also, of immortal spirit, vowed (? *vráta*), I go performing; spirit,  
soul, of the body then (? *tát*) with kine (? *sumádgu*); and either the  
mighty one (*śakrá*) assigns treasure, or as the oblation-giver pursues  
(? *sac*) with refreshment.

## Notes
This verse and vs. 5 ⌊4?⌋ are the most utterly hopeless of the hymn;  
even the conjectures of the comm. respecting them would be welcome.  
Ludwig renders *sumádgu* by "erfreut gegangen." For **b**, Ppp. reads  
*asurāṣ pūtas svadhayā samadgu;* in **c**, *vā jyeṣṭho ratnā*. *Vā́* in  
**c** in our text is a misprint for *vā*. The verse lacks only one  
syllable of being a full *triṣṭubh*, and that deficiency might be made  
up by reading either *śakrás* or *rátnam* as trisyllabic. ⌊A barytone  
*vráta* is unknown elsewhere.⌋

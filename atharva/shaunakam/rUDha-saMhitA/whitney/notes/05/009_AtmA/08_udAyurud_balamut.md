## Translation
8. Up life-time, up strength, up act (*kṛtá*), up action (*kṛtyā́*), up  
skill (*manīṣā́*), up sense (*indriyá*); O life- (*ā́yus-*) maker, O ye  
(two) mistresses of life, rich in *svadhā́*⌊*m*.⌋, be ye my guardians,  
guard me; be my soulsitters; do not harm me.

## Notes
The nouns with 'up' are accusatives, but what verb should be supplied  
for the construction it is not easy to see. Perhaps *ā́yuṣkṛt* (p.  
*ā́yuḥ-kṛt*) should be *-kṛtā*, as dual; at any rate, all that follows it  
is dual. Apparently the Anukr. would divide vs. 7 as 9 + 12: 10 + 7 + 10  
= 48; and vs. 8 as 9 + 11: 20: 11 = 51; but the descriptions are blind  
and inaccurate. ⌊Weber discusses the peculiarities of gender.⌋  
  
A passage corresponding to this hymn is found in K. xxxvii. 15.

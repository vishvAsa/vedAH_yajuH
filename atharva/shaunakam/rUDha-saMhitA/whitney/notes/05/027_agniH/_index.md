## Comment
This peculiar and half-metrical āprī-hymn occurs also in several Yajur-Veda texts: hamely, in VS. (xxvii. 11-22), in TS. (iv. 1. 8), and in MS. (ii. 12. 6); further, in K. (xviii. 17), and (acc. to Schroeder's note) in Kap.S. The versions in VS. and TS. agree very closely throughout, in readings and in division; there is in all the verses a more or less imperfect metrical structure, of three triṣṭubh-like pādas to a verse. MS. also in general agrees with these, but has an inserted passage in its vs. 5 which dislocates the division of vss. 2-4. Ppp. has the same hymn in ix., and follows pretty closely the Yajus-version. In our text the proper division is thrown into great confusion, and there are many readings which are obviously mere corruptions. The Anukr. supports our mss. at all points. The division of VS. and TS., as being necessary to any understanding of the hymn, is noted in brackets in the translation below.


The hymn is not used as an āprī-hymn in the liturgical literature, but is quoted in Kāuś. (23. 7) in the ceremony of consecration of a new house, and again (45. 8), in the vaśāśamana rite, to accompany (with the kindred hymn v. 12) an offering of the omentum of a cow; while (19. 1, note) the paddhati reckons it among the puṣṭika mantras. Vss. 1 and 2 (with the division as in our text) are used by Vāit. (10. 13, 12) in the paśubandha ceremony.


## Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 434; Griffith, i. 232.—Weber, xviii. 269, gives a general introductory comment to the hymn, but leaves it, on account of "the numerous misdivisions and corruptions of this, its Atharvan version," untranslated. Cf. hymn 12 of this book.

## Translation
4. Here he cometh with might (*śávas*) unto the various ghees, praising,  
he the carrier, with homage,—

## Notes
It needs the first part of the next verse to end off this, and the other  
texts so divide. They have also the much easier reading *ghṛténa* for  
*ghṛtā́ cit;* Ppp. gives *ghṛtena īḍe vahniṁ námasā ’gniṁ sruco* etc.  
(adding 5 **a**). VS.TS. have a single interpunction after *námasā;* MS.  
makes its verse out of our 4 **b** and 5 **a, b**, with interpunction  
after 5 **a**. ⌊VS.TS.MS. accent *īḍānó*.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
5 \[4 **c**\]. Agni, unto the spoons, at the sacrifices (*adhvará*), the  
profferings (*prayáj*). \[5.\] May he sacrifice his greatness, Agni's,—  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The Yajus-texts have at the beginning *agním* (also Ppp.: see under vs.  
4), and later *prayátsu* (which the TS. *pada*-text divides *prayát॰su;*  
ours gives *pra॰yákṣu*). MS's verse is made of ours with our 4 **b**  
prefixed.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
6 \[5 **b**\]. \[He\] crossing (?) among pleasant profferings; both the  
Vasus stood and the greater bestower of good (*vásu*).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
This whole verse in our text is corrupt, and the translation, of course,  
only a mechanical one. The Yajus-texts have *sá īm* (TS. *ī*) *mandrā́  
suprayásaḥ* (TS. *mandrā́su prayásaḥ:* this variation shows how uncertain  
the tradition was as to the sense of the passage); and MS. makes here  
the insertion spoken of above, reading *suprayásā stárīman: barhíṣo  
mitrámahāḥ;* all then finish the verse with *vásuś cétiṣṭho vasudhā́tamaś  
ca*. Ppp. is spoiled, but appears to read at the beginning  
*svenamindrasu*. The makers of our texts perhaps understood *-dhā́taras*  
as plural of *-dhātṛ;* the *pada*-division *vasu॰dhā́taras* is specially  
prescribed by Prāt. iv. 45. The metrical definition concerns only the  
number of syllables: 8 + 12 = 20. ⌊Ppp. ends with *-dhātamaś ca*.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
7 \[6\]. The heavenly doors all defend always after his course  
(*vratá*)—  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
This verse is doubtless corrupt in its second half; the Yajus-texts, and  
also Ppp., read instead *vratā́ dadante agnéḥ* (Ppp. *‘gneḥ*); and MS.  
has before it *víśvā*, and Ppp. *viśved*. The Anukr. ignores the evident  
*triṣṭubh* character of **a**.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
8 \[6 **c**\]. Lording it with Agni's domain of wide expansion, \[7.\]  
dripping, worshipful, close, let dawn and night favor this our  
inviolable (? *adhvará*) sacrifice.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The other texts (including Ppp.) read *-vyacasas*, omit *agnés* and read  
*pátyamānās* in **a**; and they have an entirely different **b**, namely  
*té asya yóṣaṇe divyé ná yónāu;* what our text substitutes was found as  
v. 12. 6 **a** above. The Anukr. name for the meter, *saṁstārapan̄kti*,  
is wholly misapplied, since it has to be read as 12 + 11: 8 + 7.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
9 \[8\]. O heavenly invokers, sing ye unto our uplifted sacrifice  
(*adhvará*) with Agni's tongue; sing in order to our successful  
offering. \[9.\] Let the three goddesses sit upon this *barhís*, Iḍā,  
Sarasvatī, Bhāratī, the great, besung.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
We have here two complete verses combined into one; but the division  
goes on after this correspondingly in all the texts. The three  
Yajus-texts, and Ppp., begin with *dāívyā hotārā* (the accent *hótāras*  
in our version is against all rule), and MS. inserts *imám* after  
*ūrdhvám* in **a**; for **b, c** they read *‘gnér jihvā́m abhí* (but MS.  
*jihvā́ ’bhí*) *gṛṇītam: kṛṇutáṁ naḥ svìṣṭim* (MS. *-ṭam*); further on  
they have *sadantu* for *-tām* (but MS. instead *syonám*); near the end,  
VS.TS. put *mahī́* after *bhā́ratī;* M.S. has a sign of interpunction  
after *mahī́;* Ppp. reads *mahābhāratī*. The pāda *tisró devī́r* etc. is  
the same with RV. iii. 4. 8 **d** (which reads *sadantu*). The  
definition of the Anukr. fits the meter very badly; the *pada*-text  
notes only 5 pādas, nor is a division into 6 well possible; they would  
count 11 + 9 + 8: 11 + 14 = 53, mechanically a *bhurig atijagatī*.

## Translation
4. Wholly conquering the fighters, shrill-crying, do thou, seizing those  
that are to be seized, look abroad on many sides; respond (? *ā-gur*), O  
drum, devout, to the voice of the gods; bring the possession of our  
foes.

## Notes
*Vedhā́s* is as superfluous to the sense in **c** as it is redundant in  
meter. The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregularity, nor of the  
deficiency in **a** (*ūrdhua-* being very harsh, and not found in RV.).  
The *pada*-text reads *gṛ́hyāḥ* in **b**; *pṛ́tanās* is apparently to be  
understood with it. The voice of the gods (or of heaven, *dāívī*) is  
apparently the thunder.

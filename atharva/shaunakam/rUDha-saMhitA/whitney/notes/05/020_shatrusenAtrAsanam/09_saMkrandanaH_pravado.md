## Translation
9. A vociferating herald (? *pravadá*), with bold army, making proclaim  
in many places, sounding through the villages, winning advantage,  
knowing the ways, do thou distribute (*vi-hṛ*) fame to many in the  
\[battle\] of two kings.

## Notes
The verse seems to relate to the proclamation of victory and of the  
desert of those to whom it is due: see Roth, *Festgruss an Böhtlingk*,  
p. 99. Ppp. reads *prasraveṇo* for *pravadó* in **a**, and *bhaja* for  
*hara* in **d**. ⌊For *vayúna*, Pischel, *Ved. Stud.* i. 297.⌋

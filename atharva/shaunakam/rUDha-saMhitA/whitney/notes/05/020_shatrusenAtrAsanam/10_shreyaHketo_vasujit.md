## Translation
10. Aiming at advantage, conquering good things, very powerful,  
conquering a host, thou art sharpened by *bráhman;* as the  
pressing-stone on the \[soma-\] stalks in the press, do thou, O drum,  
dance on \[their\] possession, seeking booty (*gavyán*).

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *gavyám* (read by all our mss.) in  
**d** to *gavyán* as made in our edited text; but *gavyám védas* might  
perhaps mean 'their possession in kine.' Prāt. ii. 62 prescribes  
*śreyaḥketas* (not *-yask-*). Bp. alone reads *ádhriḥ* in **c**, which  
Pet. Lexx. prefer; *adris* is, to be sure, superfluous beside *grā́vā*,  
and can hardly be translated. Ppp. has, for **b**, *mitraṁ dadhānas  
tviṣito vipaścit;* and it reads *adhi* (not *‘dhi*) in **d**. The first  
pāda is defective, unless we make the violent resolution *śr-e-* at the  
beginning; in the third we have to read *’va* ⌊or *‘driḥ*⌋.

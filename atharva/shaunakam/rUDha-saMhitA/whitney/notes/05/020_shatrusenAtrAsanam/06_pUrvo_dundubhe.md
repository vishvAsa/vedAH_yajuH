## Translation
6. Mayest thou first (*pū́rva*), O drum, speak forth thy voice; on the  
back of earth speak thou, shining (*ruc*); opening wide the jaws  
(*jabh*) on the army of our enemies, speak thou clearly, O drum,  
pleasantly (*sūnṛ́tāvat*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is, 'what is pleasant to us,' apparently. *Pūrva* in **a** might  
also mean 'in front, in our van.' Ppp. reads in **a, b** *viṣahasva  
śatrūn: vada bahu rocamānah;* and it makes the second half-verse  
exchange places with 8 **c, d**.

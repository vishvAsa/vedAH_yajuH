## Translation
11. Overpowering foes, overpowering and putting down, overpowering  
hostile plotters, seeking kine, overpowering, up-shooting, bring forth  
thy voice as a speaker (*vāgvín*) his discourse (*mántra*); speak up  
force (? *íṣ*) here in order to the conquering of the host.

## Notes
*Sā́ṁgram-* in our text is a misprint for *sā́ṁgrām-*. Ppp. offers no  
variants. The words *śatrūṣā́ṭ* and *nīṣā́ṭ* (both unchanged in  
*pada*-text) fall under Prāt. ii. 82; iii. 1; iv. 70. *Gavéṣaṇa* (p.  
*go॰éṣaṇaḥ*) is by Prāt. ii. 23. The second pāda is defective by one  
syllable.

## Translation
1. Thy nearnesses \[are\] nearnesses, thy distances nearnesses; be just  
here; go not now; go not after the former Fathers; thy life (*ásu*) I  
bind fast.

## Notes
The first two pādas are obscure; the two nouns in each can also be both  
or either ablatives (so Muir) or genitives sing. Ppp. reads *parāvatas*  
instead of the second *āvatas*, thus rectifying the meter of **a**; as  
it stands, we need to resolve *a-āvátas* ⌊or read *táva* for *te*.⌋ Ppp.  
also has *gatān* for *pitṝn* in **d**.

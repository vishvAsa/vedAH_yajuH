## Translation
10. O Āditya, take \[away their\] sight; ye beams, run after; let them  
that have foot-fastenings fasten on, the arm-power (*-vīryà*) being gone  
away.

## Notes
We should expect a passive verb in **c**, if *patsan̄gínīs*, as seems  
necessary, refers back to *sénās* in 9 **c**. It is apparently the enemy  
who are to be hampered in going, after losing their power of arm.

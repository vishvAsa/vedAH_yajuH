## Translation
1. They grew excessively; they did not quite (*iva*) touch up to the  
sky; having injured Bhrigu, the Sriñjayas, Vāitahavyas, perished.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **c, d**, *mṛga hīṅsitvā brahmīm asaṁbhavyaṁ par-*: cf.  
18. 12 **c, d**. The verse is found also in JB. i. 152, with *vad* for  
*ud* in **b**, and *māhenā asaṁheyam* (for *sṛñ- vāit-*) in **c, d**: a  
much corrupted text. The *pada*-text strangely divides *sṛ́ñ॰jayāḥ* (the  
word is left undivided in the TS. *pada*, vi. 6. 2). ⌊Griffith cites  
MBh. xiii. 30. 1 (= 1940) ff. for the story of the Vāitahavyas. See  
Weber's notes.⌋

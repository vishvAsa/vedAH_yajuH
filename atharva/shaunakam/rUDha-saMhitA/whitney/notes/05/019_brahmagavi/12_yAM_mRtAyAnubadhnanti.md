## Translation
12. The *kūdī́* which they tie on after a dead man, as effacer (?) of the  
track, that verily, O Brahman-scather, did the gods call thy couch  
(*upastáraṇa*).

## Notes
*Kūdī́*, which occurs several times in the Kāuś. (see Bloomfield's  
edition, p. xliv \[where read Kāuś. 21.2,13\], and AJP. xi. 355), is  
identified by the scholiasts with *badarī* 'jujube.' For the habit of  
tying a bunch of twigs to a corpse, see Roth in the *Festgruss an  
Böhtlingk*, p. 98 ⌊and Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 416⌋.

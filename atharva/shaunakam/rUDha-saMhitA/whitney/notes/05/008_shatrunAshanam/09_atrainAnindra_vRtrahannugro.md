## Translation
9. Here, O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, do thou, formidable, pierce them in the  
vitals; just here do thou trample upon them; O Indra, thine ally am I;  
we take hold on thee, O Indra; may we be in thy favor.

## Notes
Some of the mss. (H.I.O.K.) read *atrāi ’ṇān* in **a**; and some  
(P.M.W.O.) reckon the last two pādas as a tenth ⌊or separate⌋ verse.  
*Mármāṇi* in **b** in our text is a misprint for *mármaṇi*. The Anukr.  
appears to count, without good reason, only 7 syllables in **d** as well  
as in **b**.

## Translation
9. The Creator (*dhātár*), the disposer (*vidhātár*), he who is lord of  
being, god Savitar, overpowerer of hostile plotters, the Ādityas, the  
Rudras, both the Aśvins—let the gods protect the sacrificer from  
perdition (*nirṛthá*).

## Notes
RV. and TS. read *dhātṝṇā́m* for *vidhātā́* in **a**, and *nyarthā́t* at  
the end, and have for **c** *imáṁ yajñám aśvíno ’bhā́ bṛ́haspátir;* in  
**b**, RV. has *deváṁ trātā́ram*, and TS. *d. savitā́ram*, followed by  
*abhimātiṣā́ham* ⌊RV. *-hám*. Ppp. has *vidhartā* in **a**, *savitā devo  
‘bhim-* in **b**, and *bṛhaspatir indrāgnī aśvinobhā* for **c**. The  
combination *yás pátir* in **a** is by Prāt. ii. 70. The *pada*-text  
reads *abhimāti-saháḥ* in **b**. The verse (12 + 11: 9 + 11 = 43) is  
much too irregular to be passed simply as a *triṣṭubh*.

Found also in Pāipp. v. (in the verse-order 1-6, 8, 9, 11, 7, 10). It is a RV. hymn, x. 128 (which has the verse-order 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 9, 8, 10), with its nine verses changed to eleven by the expansion of vs. 5 into two, and by the addition at the end of a verse which is found also in the RV. mss., but not as an acknowledged part of the text. The RV. verses, including this last, are found in their RV. order, and with unimportant variants, in TS. iv. 7. 141-4.

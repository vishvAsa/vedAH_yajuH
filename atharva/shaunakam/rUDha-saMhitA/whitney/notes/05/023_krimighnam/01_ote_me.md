title = "०१ ओते मे"

## Translation
1. Worked in (*óta*) for me \[are\] heaven-and-earth; worked in \[is\]  
divine Sarasvatī; worked in for me \[are\] both Indra and Agni: to the  
effect "let them (dual) grind up the worm."

## Notes
Here, as everywhere else, the mss. vary with the utmost diversity  
between *krimi* and *kṛmi;* no attempt will be made to report their  
variations. The first three pādas of the verse are repeated below as vi.  
94. 3 **a, b, c**. The pple. *óta* (p. *ā́॰uta*) ⌊'woven on, worked in'  
(*ā* + *vā*)⌋ seems to mean 'brought in for my aid'; a root *u* is  
insufficiently supported ⌊see Whitney, *Roots* etc.⌋. For its forms Ppp.  
reads in **a** *oṣate*, in **b** *okatā*, in **c** *okato;* Ppp. also  
has at the end *imam* for *iti*.

## Comment
Found also (except vss. 10, 11) in Pāipp. xiii. No notice is taken in Vāit. of any part of the hymn; but in Kāuś. 8. 25 it is reckoned among the cātana hymns, or as belonging in the cātana gaṇa, and two or three of its verses (2-4) are separately quoted, as will be pointed out below.


## Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 526; Griffith, i. 236; Weber, xviii. 277.

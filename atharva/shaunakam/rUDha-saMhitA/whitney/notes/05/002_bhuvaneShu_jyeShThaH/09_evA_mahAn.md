## Translation
9. So hath the great Brihaddiva Atharvan spoken of his own self (*tanū́*)  
\[as of\] Indra; the two blameless, mother-growing sisters—\[men\] both  
impel them with might (*śávas*) and increase them.

## Notes
The second half-verse seems again a corruption of the RV. version, which  
has plurals instead of duals in **c**, and omits the meter-disturbing  
*ene* (p. *ene íti*) in **d**. Ppp. again agrees with RV.; but in **b**  
it has *tanum* for *tanvam*. Our text should give, with the others,  
*mātaríbhvar-* in **c**; all the mss. have it. ⌊The vs. is *svarāj*  
rather than *bhurij*.⌋

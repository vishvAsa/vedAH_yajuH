## Notes
This item is number 19 in Ppp.; but in śśS. it is wanting; and in TS.  
Yama is set over the earth. Here, again, the reading *pitreṇā́m* is found  
in one ms. (Bp.). Additional items in TS. are *bṛ́haspátir bráhmaṇaḥ,  
mitráḥ satyā́nām* (śśS. the same), *samudráḥ srotyā́nām, ánnaṁ  
sā́ṁrājyānām, tváṣṭā rūpā́ṇām* (śśS. *tv. samidhāṁ rūpāṇām*); śśS. has  
only those already given.

## Comment
⌊Not metrical.⌋ In Pāipp. xv. is found a corresponding piece, but one differing considerably in detail; it contains counterparts to our vss. 1, 2, 4, 7-12, 14, 15, 17, but not at all in the same order, and interspersed with nine other verses of similar tenor (1. mitraḥ pṛthivyāḥ; 6. vasus saṁvatsarasya; 7. saṁvatsara ṛtūnām; 11. viṣṇuḥ parvatānām; 12. tvaṣṭā rūpāṇām; 15. samudro nadīnām; 16. parjanya oṣadhīnām; 17. bṛhaspatir devānām; 18. prajāpatiḥ prajānām). Similar passages occur also in other texts: thus, in TS. iii. 4. 5 (and the part corresponding to our 15-17 is repeated again, with slight variations, at iv. 3. 32; and the same part, with variations, is found five times as a refrain in MS. ii. 7. 20), in PGS. i. 5. 10 (which closely follows TS. iii. 4. 5), and in ÇÇS. iv. 10. 1, 3 (with nothing corresponding to vss. 15-17). The hymn is used by Kāuç. in a royal coronation (17. 30), in the nuptial ceremonies (78. 11), and in the ājyatantra (137. 42). And many of the verses appear also in Vāit., with oblations to the various divinities mentioned, in different ceremonies: thus, in the āgrayaṇa, vs. 7 (8. 7); in the cāturmāsyāni, vss. 1-3, 6, 7 (8. 13), 4 (8. 22), 9 (9. 27); in the agniṣṭoma, vss. 8 (19. 2), 5 (19. 3), 11 (19. 11).

## Comment
All the verses except 4 are found also in Pāipp., but in two books: vss. 1-3, 5-7 in xix. (and not all together); vss. 8-10 in ii. It is not expressly quoted by Kāuś., but the schol. (26. 1, note) regard it as included in the takmanāśana gaṇa, and (28. 13, note) also in the kuṣṭhalin̄gās, and so employed in a healing rite against rājayakṣma; vs. 10 is separately added (26. 1, note) at the end of the gaṇa.

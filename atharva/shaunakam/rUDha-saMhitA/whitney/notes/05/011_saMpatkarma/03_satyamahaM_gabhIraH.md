## Translation
3. I verily am profound by poesy; verily by what is produced I am  
*jātávedas;* not barbarian (*dāsá*), not Aryan, by his might, damageth  
(*mī*) the course which I shall maintain.

## Notes
Muir ascribes the verse to Atharvan; Roth, better, to Varuṇa; the god  
asserts that it is he himself to whom wisdom and possession belong; his  
worshiper is comparatively nothing. Ppp. begins with *satvasaṁ* and  
reads *mahitvaṁ* in **c**, and *haniṣya* at the end. The Prāt. (iv. 96)  
establishes the long *ī* of *mīmāya* as a *pada*-reading. The Anukr.  
absurdly calls the verse a *pan̄kti*, although it is an evident  
*triṣṭubh*, not less regular than a great proportion of the verses so  
called. ⌊The *me* in **c** is easier rendered in German than in  
English.⌋

## Translation
5. Since thou verily, O self-ruling Varuṇa, knowest all births, O  
well-conducting one—is there anything else beyond the welkin (*rájas*)?  
is there anything below what is beyond, O unerring one (? *amura*)?

## Notes
The version given implies that *kím* is interrog. particle in **c, d**,  
as best suits the answer in the next verse: else, 'what other is beyond'  
etc. *Amura* in **b** is understood as *amūra*, as required by the  
meter: cf. v. 1. 9. Ppp. again reads *svadhāvas* in **a**; and, in **b**  
and further, *janmā śraddhadanī te kiṁ menā rajasaṣ paro ‘sit kim  
avareṇa avaram asūra*. The majority of mss. (B.P.M.H.s.m.O. etc.; only  
E.I.H.p.m.K. have *asti*) accent *ásti* at end of **c**. ⌊For the  
combination *enā́ parás* = 'beyond,' in 3d pāda, see BR. iv. 494. I  
suggest for **d**, 'Is there (*kím*) (anything behind, *ávaram*, i.e.)  
anything beyond that (*enā́*, substantive pronoun) which is beyond  
(*páreṇa*)?'⌋

## Translation
1. How unto the great Asura didst thou speak here? how, with shining  
manliness, unto the yellow (*hári*) father? having given, O Varuṇa, a  
spotted \[cow\] as sacrificial fee, thou hast with the mind intended (?  
*cikits*) re-bestowal (?).

## Notes
The second half-verse is probably meant as what was "spoken." The  
translation of **d** implies Aufrecht's acute emendation (in Muir) of  
the reading to *punarmaghatvám*. The sense of *punarmagha* is very  
doubtful: Roth "greedy"; Muir (Aufrecht) "to take her back," and  
"revoking "; neither seems to belong properly to the word, which ought  
to mean something like 'bountiful in return': i.e. Varuṇa is expected to  
give back to Atharvan the cow the latter has presented to him (or  
another and better one). One might conjecture in **c** *váruṇe* 'to  
Varuna,' and understand *cikits* as 'impute' or 'expect.' Roth regards  
the verse as spoken by Varuṇa; Muir, by Atharvan; the former is more  
acceptable. Ppp. begins *kathā diva asurāya bravāmaḥ kathā*, and reads  
*pṛśniḥ* in **c**. ⌊R. takes *hári* as 'wrathful.'⌋

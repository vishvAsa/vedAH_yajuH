## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. viii. It is used by Kāuś. only once, and in a connection which casts no light upon it, namely at 12. 1, in a rite for general welfare (one eats a dish of milk-rice cooked on a fire of mādānaka-sticks). It is not quoted at all by Vāit. The interpretation in detail is difficult and far from certain.

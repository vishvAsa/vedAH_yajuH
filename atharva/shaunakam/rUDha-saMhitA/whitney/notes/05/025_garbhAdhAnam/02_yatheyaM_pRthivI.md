## Translation
2. As this great earth receives the embryo of existences, so do I set  
thine embryo; I call thee to its aid.

## Notes
The first half-verse occurs again below as vi. 17. 1 **a, b**, and also  
in the second verse of the addition to RV. x. 184, but with the reading  
*uttānā́* for *bhūtā́nām* (the RV. verse is also found in an addition to  
AGS. i. 14. 3: see Stenzler's translation, p. 36), and in MP. (⌊i. 12.  
4⌋ Winternitz, p. 93) with *tíṣṭhantī* for the same. ⌊Cf. also MGS. ii.  
18. 4 **b** and p. 154.⌋

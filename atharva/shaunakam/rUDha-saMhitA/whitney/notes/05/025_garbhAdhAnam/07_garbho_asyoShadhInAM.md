## Translation
7. Embryo art thou of herbs, embryo of forest-trees, embryo of every  
existence; mayest thou, O Agni, set an embryo here.

## Notes
Compare vi. 95. 3, with which the verse is in considerable part  
identical. It is found also as VS. xii. 37, and in TS. iv. 2. 3³, MS.  
ii. 7. 10, in all with a different **d**: *ágne gárbho apā́m asi;* MS.  
further combines in **a** *gárbho ‘sy;* and in this last point Ppp.  
agrees with it.

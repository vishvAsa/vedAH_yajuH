## Translation
3. Place the embryo, O Sinīvālī; place the embryo, O Sarasvatī; let both  
the Aśvins, garlanded with blue lotus, set thine embryo.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 184. 2 and MB. i. 4. 7 and MP. ⌊i. 12. 2⌋, where  
however is read in **c** *aśvínāu devā́v*. Ppp. reads both times (in  
**a** and **b**) *dehi*. śB. (xiv. 9. 4¹⁰) follows RV. (but with  
*pṛthuṣṭuke* at end of **b**, and *puṣkarasrájāu* in **d**). HGS. (i.  
25. 1) differs from our text only by having *aśvināv ubhāv ā*. Cf. also  
HGS. i. 6. 4; MB. i. 5. 9. ⌊Cf. MGS. ii. 18. 2 k and p. 150.⌋

## Comment
Found (except vs. 2, and some end-repetitions) also in Pāipp. xiii. (in the verse-order 1, 5, 3, 4, 7. 10, 8, 6, 9). The hymn is quoted in Kāuç. (35. 5) in the ceremony for male conception (puṁsavana); and vs. 7 (unless it be rather vi. 95. 3, which the comm. to vi. 95 holds) in Vāit. 28. 20.

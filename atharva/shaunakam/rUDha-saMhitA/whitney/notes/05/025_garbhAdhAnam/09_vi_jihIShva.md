## Translation
9. Go apart, O Bārhatsāmā; let an embryo lie unto thy womb (*yóni*);  
the gods, soma-drinkers, have given thee a son partaking of both.

## Notes
Ludwig understands the last epithet as meaning 'belonging to us both,'  
which is not impossible; Weber, 'der doppelt schafft'; it is literally  
'possessing what is of both.' Ppp. has for **c** *dadan te putraṁ devā*.  
*Bārhatsāme* (p. *-hat॰sā-*) is an anomalous formation: a stem *-mā* is  
against all analogy as fem. of a vṛddhi-derivative, while *-mi* (which  
Ludwig assumes) is equally wrong as a feminine; Ppp. has the same form;  
it doubtless means 'daughter of Bŗhatsāman.' To make **c** of full meter  
is impossible without harshness.

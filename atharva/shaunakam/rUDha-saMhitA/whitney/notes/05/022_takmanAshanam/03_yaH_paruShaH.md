## Translation
3. The fever that is spotted, speckled, ruddy like a sprinkling, do  
thou, O thou of power (*-vīryà*) in every direction, impel away  
downward.

## Notes
The last half-verse occurs again as xix. 39. 10 **c, d**. 'Rough,  
rugged' would be more etymological renderings of *paruṣá* and  
*pāruṣeyá:* cf. *vājī́ vājineyás*, RV. vi. 26. 2. Pāda **b**, virtually  
'as if sprinkled with red.' The address is probably to some remedy.  
*Suvā* at the end is a misprint for *suva*. In place of this verse, Ppp.  
has *takmaṁ sāktinam ichasva vaśī san mṛḍayāsi naḥ* (our 9 **b**):  
*yathe ’hy atra te gṛhān yat pūrteu damyatu*. ⌊Then, as its vs. 4, Ppp.  
has our vs. 3.⌋

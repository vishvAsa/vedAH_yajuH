## Translation
1. Let Agni drive (*bādh*) the fever away from here; \[let\] Soma, the  
pressing-stone, Varuṇa of purified dexterity, the sacrificial hearth,  
the *barhís*, the brightly gleaming (*śuc*) fuel; be hatreds away  
yonder.

## Notes
*Amuyā́* 'yonder' has always an implication of disgust or contempt. In  
our text *apa* and *bādhatām* should have been separated in **a**. Ppp.  
reads in **b** *marutaṣ pūtadakṣāt*, in **c** *saṁśiśāno*, and in **d**  
*rakṣāṅsi*. *śóśucānās* may mean 'causing great pain,' and it may  
qualify all the persons and things mentioned.

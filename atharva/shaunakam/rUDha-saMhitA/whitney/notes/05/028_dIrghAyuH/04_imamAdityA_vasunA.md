## Translation
4. O Ādityas, sprinkle this man well with good (*vásu*); O Agni, do  
thou, thyself increasing, increase him; unite him, O Indra, with  
heroism; let the prospering triple one resort to him.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **c, d**, *yasmin trivṛc chetāṁ pūṣayiṣṇur imam* etc. (our  
**c**). Our mss. vary at the end between *poṣayiṣṇú* and *-ṇúḥ*, the  
majority having *-ṇúḥ* (only B.O.I, *-ṇú*); our text should be emended  
to *-ṇúḥ*. ⌊But SPP. reads *-ṇú* and notes no variants.⌋ The Anukr., as  
usual, does not note that **a** is a *jagatī* pāda.

## Translation
7. Triple life-time of Jamadagni, Kaśyapa's triple life-time, sight of  
the immortal (*amṛ́ta*) triply, three life-times have I made for thee.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *triyāyuṣam;* and, at the end, *nas kṛdhi* for *te ‘karam*.  
JUB. iv. 3. 1 has this version: *triyāyuṣaṁ kaśyapasya jamadagnes  
triyāyuṣam: trīṇy amṛtasya puṣpāṇi trīṇ āyūṅṣi me ‘kṛṇoḥ;* and several  
of the Gṛhya-Sūtras (śGS. i. 28; HGS. i. 9. 6; ⌊MP. ii. 7. 2; MGS. i. 1.  
24 (cf. p. 150)⌋; MB. i. 6. 8) give the first half-verse, with a  
different ending; ⌊also VS. iii. 62. GGS. ii. 9. 21 gives the  
*pratīka*.⌋ There is no reason for calling the meter *kakummatī*.

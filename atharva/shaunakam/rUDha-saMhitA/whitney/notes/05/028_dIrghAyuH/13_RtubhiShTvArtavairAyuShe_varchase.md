## Translation
13. Thee with the seasons, with them of the seasons; thee unto lifetime,  
unto splendor; with the brilliancy of the year—with that we make  
\[thee\] of closed jaw (? *sáṁhanu*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is repeated as xix. 37.4 ⌊in our ed.; but SPP's repeats iii.  
10. 10 instead⌋. It is found also in HGS. i. 11. 2, with *tvā* omitted  
at the end of **b**, and, for **c, d**, *saṁvatsarasya dhāyasā tena sann  
anu gṛhṇāsi!* this gives us no help toward understanding the obscure  
last pāda; the translation implies emendation to *sáṁhanum*, and  
understands the verse as directed against involuntary opening of the  
jaws (*divaricatio maxillae inferioris*): cf. viii. 1. 16. The Anukr.  
foolishly calls the verse a *purauṣṇih*.

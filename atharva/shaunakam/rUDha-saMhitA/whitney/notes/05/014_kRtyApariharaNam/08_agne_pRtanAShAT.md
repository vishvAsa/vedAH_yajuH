## Translation
8. O Agni, overpowerer of fighters, overpower the fighters; we take the  
witchcraft back to the witchcraft-maker by a returner.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *prati* instead of *punar*, thus making a better  
correspondence with *pratiharaṇa* in **c**. The Anukr's definition of  
the "verse" is purely artificial; the first pāda is distinctly  
unmetrical, and the third hardly metrical.

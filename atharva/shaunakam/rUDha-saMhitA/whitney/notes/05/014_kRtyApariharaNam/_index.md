⌊Part of verse 8 is prose.⌋ Found also (except vss. 3, 5, which are wanting, and 9, 13, which occur in ii.) in Pāipp. vii. (in the order 1, 2, 8, 12, 4, 10, 11, 7, 6). Quoted in Kāuç. (39. 7) with ii. 11 and several other hymns, in a ceremony against witchcraft; vs. 9 also separately in 39. 11. Not noticed in Vāit.

## Translation
8. His tongue becomes a bow-string, his voice an \[arrow-\] neck, his  
teeth \[become\] shafts (*nāḍīkā́*) smeared with penance; with these the  
Brahman (*brahmán*) pierces the insulters of the gods, with bows having  
force from the heart \[and\] speeded by the gods.

## Notes
Pāda **d** lacks a syllable, though the Anukr. takes no notice of it.  
*Hṛdbalāís* is a questionable formation; Ppp. has instead *nirjalāis*,  
which may contain hidden a better reading ⌊R. *nirjyāis* 'without  
bow-string'?⌋.

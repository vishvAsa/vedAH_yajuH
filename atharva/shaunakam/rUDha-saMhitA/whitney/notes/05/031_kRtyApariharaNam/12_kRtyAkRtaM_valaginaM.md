## Translation
12. The witchcraft-maker, spell-hider, root-possessor, worthy of  
cursing—let Indra smite him with his great deadly weapon; let Agni  
pierce him with a hurled \[arrow\].

## Notes
This verse is found in Ppp. i., where, for **c, d**, is read: *indras tu  
sarvāṅs tāṅ hantu sattvaghnena bhavām iva*.  
  
The last or sixth *anuvāka* contains 5 hymns and 70 verses; the old  
Anukr. says: *ṣaṣṭhe tu navāi ’kā ca parā tu ṣaṣṭhe*. One or two of the  
mss. sum up the Book correctly as 31 hymns, and 376 verses.  
  
With the Book ends also the twelfth *prapāṭhaka*.

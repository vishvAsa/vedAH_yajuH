## Translation
7. What \[witchcraft\] they have made for thee in the army (*sénā*),  
what they have made in arrow-and-weapon; in the drum what witchcraft  
they have made—I take that back again.

## Notes
To make the meter complete in the two preceding verses, we need to make  
the unusual resolution *-ya-am* at end of **a**.

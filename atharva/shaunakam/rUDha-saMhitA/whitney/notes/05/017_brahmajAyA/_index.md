Found in part (vss. 1-7, 9-11 in ix., also 18, in another part of ix.) in Pāipp. The hymn contains (in vss. 1-3, 6, 5, 10, 11) the seven verses of RV. x. 109, none of which occur elsewhere than in these two texts. Vāit. takes no notice of it, but it is used in Kāuç. (48. 11), next after hymn 13, in a witchcraft ceremony; while vs. 4 is quoted also in 126. 9, on occasion of the fall of a meteor.

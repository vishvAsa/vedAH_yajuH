Book V.

⌊The fifth book is made up of thirty-one hymns, divided into six
*anuvāka*-groups, with five hymns in each group save the fourth, which
has six hymns. The Old Anukramaṇī appears to take 60 verses as the norm
of an *anuvāka*. The number of verses in each hymn ranges from 8 to 18.
The Major Anukramaṇī assumes 8 verses as the normal length of a hymn of
this book (see p. 142); but there are only two such hymns ("hymns" 9 and
10, both prose!). In fact,

The entire book has been translated by Weber, *Indische Studien*, vol.
xviii. (1898), pages 154-288. This is the first book to which the native
commentary is missing.⌋

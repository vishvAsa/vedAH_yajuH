## Translation
51. She to whom two-footed winged-ones fly together, swans, eagles,  
hawks, birds; on whom the wind, Mātariśvan, goes about, making clouds of  
dust (? *rájas*) and setting in motion the trees—flame (*arcís*) blows  
after the forth-blowing, the toward-blowing, of the wind.

## Notes
The second pāda is identical with xi. 2. 24 **b**. *Upavā́m* is  
metrically an intrusion into **e**: with the pāda is to be compared RV.  
i. 148. 4 **c** (which, however, casts little light upon it). Ppp. reads  
in **c-d** *vātayate mātariśvā raj-;* and, in **e**, it omits *upavām*,  
and has at the end *arciṣe*. The Anukr. appears to divide the last  
redundant pāda into two, an *anuṣṭubh* (8) and a *kakubh* (6); the whole  
makes two syllables more than a proper *śakvarī* (11 + 11: 11 + 11: 8 +  
6 = 58). ⌊Hopkins, JAOS. xx.² 217, thinks that fire caused by the  
friction of branches is here alluded to, and cites parallels. We may add  
*Indische Sprüche*, 3759, which is very clear.⌋

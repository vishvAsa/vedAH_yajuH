## Translation
3. On whom \[are\] the ocean and the river (*síndhu*), the waters; on  
whom food, plowings, came into being; on whom quickens this that  
breathes, that stirs—let that earth (*bhū́mi*) set us in first drinking.

## Notes
That is, doubtless, give us precedence over others (but MS. reads  
*pūrvapéyam:* see note to vs. 5). Ppp. reads for **b** *yasyāṁ devā  
’mṛtam anvavindan;* and for second half-verse it has our 4 **c, d**,  
giving our 3 **c, d** as second half of vs. 5, with the easier reading  
*jīvati*, ⌊followed by⌋ *viśvam ejāt* in **c**. We should expect  
*kṛṣáyas* in **b**.

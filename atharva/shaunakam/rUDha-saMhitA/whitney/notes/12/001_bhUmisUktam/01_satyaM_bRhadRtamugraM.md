## Translation
1. Great (*bṛhánt*) truth, formidable right, consecration, penance,  
*bráhman*, sacrifice sustain the earth; let her for us, mistress of what  
is and what is to be—let the earth make for us wide room (*loká*);—

## Notes
Found also in MS. (iv. 14. 11), which reads *yajnā́s* in **b**, and  
*bhúvanasya* (for *bhávyasya*) in **c**. The Anukr. does not heed that  
pāda **a** is *jagatī*. The verse (unless more of the hymn is meant to  
be included with it) is, according to Vāit. 12. 6, to be repeated by one  
who relieves on the ground the needs of nature. It is quoted by Kāuś.  
24. 24 in the *āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony; also in the comm. to 24.35 (cf.  
above); and it, with vs. 38, is reckoned (see note to Kāuś. 19. 1) among  
the *puṣṭika mantras*.

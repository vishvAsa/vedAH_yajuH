## Translation
53. Both heaven and earth and atmosphere \[have given\] me this expanse;  
fire, sun, waters, and all the gods have together given me wisdom  
(*medhā́*).

## Notes
The translation of **a, b** is doubtful; *vyácas* may be in apposition  
with *antárikṣam*, and the gift as in the second line. The Anukr. takes  
no notice of the irregular combination *me ’dam* in **a**, which is  
needed to make the verse a simple *anuṣṭubh*. Ppp. combines *māi ’daṁ*,  
and it has at the end *saṁ dadhāu*. Not this verse, but vi. 53. 1  
(according to the comm. on the latter), is quoted in Kāuś. 10. 20, in a  
ceremony for wisdom; ⌊but Dārila understands our verse as the one  
intended⌋.

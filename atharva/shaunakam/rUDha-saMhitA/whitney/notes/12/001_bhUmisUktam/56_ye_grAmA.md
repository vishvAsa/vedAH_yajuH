## Translation
56. What villages, what forest, what assemblies, \[are\] upon the earth  
(*bhū́mi*), what hosts, gatherings—in them may we speak what is pleasant  
(*cā́ru*) to thee.

## Notes
With the first half-verse may be compared VS. iii. 45 **a, b**. Ppp.  
reads for a *ye grāmyā yāny araṇyāni*, and for **c, d** *teṣv ahaṁ devi  
pṛthvi vibhyāsaṁ mayu satva ca*.

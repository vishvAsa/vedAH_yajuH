## Translation
10. Whom the Aśvins measured; on whom Vishṇu strode out; whom Indra,  
lord of might (*śacī-*), made free from enemies for himself—let that  
earth (*bhū́mi*) to us, a mother to a son, release (*vi-sṛj*) milk ⌊to  
me⌋.

## Notes
Some of the mss. read in **d** *-trā́ṅ chácī-*, and Bp. has accordingly  
*-trā́n*. Ppp. also has *cakrā ”tmane ‘namitrāṅ cchacī-;* and, at the  
end, *naṣ payaḥ*. ⌊Ppp's repetition of *nas* is more tolerable than the  
harsh change from pl. to sing, which W. seems to have overlooked.⌋

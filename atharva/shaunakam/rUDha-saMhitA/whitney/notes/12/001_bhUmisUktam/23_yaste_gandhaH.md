## Translation
23. What odor of thine, O earth, came into being, which the herbs,  
which the waters bear, which the Gandharvas and Apsarases shared—with  
that do thou make me odorous; let no one soever hate us.

## Notes
Ppp. adds, after *bhejire*, *yas te gām aśvam arhati;* and it reads for  
our **d** *tenā ’smān surabhīṣ kṛṇu*, and, in our **e**, *dvakṣata*. The  
verse (11 + 11: 12: 8 + 8 = 50) is as well described by the Anukr. as  
the latter's system admits. Verses 23-25 ⌊so the schol.⌋ are called in  
Kāuś. 13. 12 and 54. 5 *gandhapravādās* (likewise in the comm. to 24.  
24); they are also reckoned as belonging to the second *varcasya gaṇa*  
(see note to Kāuś. 12. 10).

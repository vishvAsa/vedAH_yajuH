## Translation
11. Let thy hills (*girí*) \[and\] snowy mountains (*párvata*), let thy  
forest-land (*áraṇya*), O earth, be pleasant (*syoná*); upon the brown,  
black, red, all-formed, fixed (*dhruvá*) earth (*bhū́mi*), the earth  
guarded by Indra—I, unharassed, unsmitten, unwounded, have stood upon  
the earth.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *āraṇyaṁ* corrected to *ar-*, and *naḥ* after  
*astu;* also in **c** *lohinīṁ*, and in **f** *adhi ṣṭhāṁ*, which is  
better. ⌊Roth's Collation has in fact *addhi*.⌋ The verse (11 + 11: 11 +  
11: 8 + 8 = 60) should be called *atiśakvarī* rather than *virāḍ aṣṭi*.  
Verses 11 and 12 are reckoned to the *svastyayana gaṇa* (see note to  
Kāuś. 25. 36).

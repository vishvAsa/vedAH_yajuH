title = "३५ यत् ते"

## Translation
35. What of thee, O earth (*bhū́mi*), I dig out, let that quickly grow  
over; let me not hit (*arpay-*) thy vitals nor thy heart, O cleansing  
one.

## Notes
'Grow over,' i.e. heal up, like a wound. Ppp. has again *bhāume* in  
**a**; also *oṣaṁ* for *kṣipram* in **b**, and *arpitam* in **d**; this  
time (cf. vs. 29) it agrees with our text in the peculiar epithet  
*vimṛgvari*, lit. 'wiping off.' Kāuś. (46. 51) quotes the verse to  
accompany an act of digging in a *prāyaścitta* ceremony; and again  
similarly at 137. 12.

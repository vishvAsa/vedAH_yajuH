## Translation
14. Whoso shall hate us, O earth; whoso shall fight \[us\]; whoso shall  
vex \[us\] with mind, who with deadly weapon—him, O prior-acting earth  
(*bhū́mi*), do thou put in our power.

## Notes
'Prior-acting,' i.e., apparently, 'getting the start of him'; we should  
expect a nom. rather than a vocative case. Ppp. reads instead  
*pūrvakṛtvane;* also, in **b**, *‘bhimanyā tāindanamā dhanena*. Read in  
our text *pṛtanyā́d yò* (an accent-sign omitted); one of our mss. ⌊and  
five of SPP's authorities, and his text!⌋, however, read *yó*. According  
to the usual nomenclature of the Anukr., the verse is a *virāḍ gāyatrī*  
(11 + 11: 12 = 34, hence *bhurij*). ⌊Dr. Ryder suggests that the  
*mahābṛhatī* here intended is one of 3 *jāgata* pādas (see *Ind. Stud.*  
viii. 243-4). Both this vs. and 17 may be scanned as 12 + 12: 12—cf.  
under vs. 17.⌋

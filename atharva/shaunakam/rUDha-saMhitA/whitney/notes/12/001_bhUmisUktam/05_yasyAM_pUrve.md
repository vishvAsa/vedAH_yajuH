## Translation
5. On whom the people of eld (*pūrvajaná*) formerly spread themselves (?  
*vi-kṛ*); on whom the gods overcame the Asuras; the station (? *viṣṭhā́*)  
of kine, of horses, of birds (*váyas*)—let the earth assign us fortune  
(*bhága*), splendor.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *nicakrire*, and in **b** *atyavartayan;* also in  
**c** (found as ⌊its⌋ 4 **c**) *vayasayya* ⌊?⌋. MS. has a verse made up  
of our 5 **a, b** (without variant), 4 **c** (accenting *bibhárti*), and  
3 **d** (with *pūrvapéyam*). The verse is mixed *triṣṭubh* and jagatī.  
⌊In Ppp. this verse precedes our 4.—The sequence of the half-verses of  
the Vulgate as they stand in Ppp. seems therefore to be as follows: 3  
**a, b**, 4 **c, d**, 5 **a, b**, 3 **c, d**, 4 **a, b**, 5 **c, d**.⌋

## Translation
52. On whom the black and the ruddy, combined, \[namely\] day-and-night,  
\[are\] disposed upon the earth (*bhū́mi*); the broad (*pṛthivī́*) earth  
(*bhū́mi*), wrapped \[and\] covered with rain—let her kindly (*bhadráyā*)  
set us in each loved abode.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *gṛṣṭam* for *kṛṣṇam* in **a**, reads and combines *saṁbhṛte  
‘horātre* in **a-b**, and reads *vṛtāvṛdhā* in **c**, and *dhāmnidhāmni*  
in **e**. In **c** is to be understood, with the *pada*-text, *vṛtā́:  
ā́॰vṛtā*. An accent-mark under the final *tā* is needed in order to  
indicate the acute of *sā́* in the next line. The verse (11 + 12: 12 + 8  
+ 8 = 51)is not well described by the Anukr. ⌊A *ca* with syllabic  
value, inserted after *kṛṣṇám*, would be an effective, albeit cheap,  
means of improving the meter of **a**.⌋ The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 24.  
41 (next after various of the preceding verses), as accompanying a  
mouth-rinsing and head-splashing with rainwater; and pāda **c**, again,  
in 137. 23, with a sprinkling with water.

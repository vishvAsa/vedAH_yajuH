## Translation
63. O mother earth (*bhū́mi*), do thou kindly set me down well  
established; in concord with the heaven, O sage (*kávi*), do thou set me  
in fortune, in prosperity (*bhū́ti*).

## Notes
The verse is used by Kāuś. (24. 27) in connection with vss. 1-7; also by  
the comm. to 58. 19 in the *annaprāśana* ceremony. Vāit. 27. 8  
prescribes it on descending from the sacrificial post (cf. note to vs.  
33). ⌊For *śriyā́m*, the only form of its kind in the AV., see JAOS. x.  
389.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, of 1 hymn and 63 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *bhāumas tryadhikā ṣaṣṭiḥ*.

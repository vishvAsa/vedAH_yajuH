title = "५८ यद् वदामि"

## Translation
58. What I speak, rich in honey I speak it; what I view, that they win  
(? van) me; brilliant am I, possessed of swiftness; I smite down others  
that are violent (? *dódhat*).

## Notes
The sense of **b** is obscure. Ppp. reads *vadantu* (for *vananti*); Bp.  
has *vadanti*, and O.s.m. (p.m.?) *vahanti*. Ppp. has at the end  
*dodhata*. Kāuś. quotes the verse at 24. 14 and 38. 29, each time adding  
*mantroktam* 'as expressed in the verse.' ⌊Ppp. puts this verse before  
our 57.⌋

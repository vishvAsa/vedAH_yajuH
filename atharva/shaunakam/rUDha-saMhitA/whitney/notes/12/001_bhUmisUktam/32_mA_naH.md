## Translation
32. Do not push (*nud*) us behind, nor in front, nor above and below;  
become thou welfare for us, O earth (*bhū́mi*); let not the waylayers  
find \[us\]; keep very far off the deadly weapon.

## Notes
The directions 'forward' etc., in this and the preceding verse, are also  
equivalent, as elsewhere, to 'eastern' etc. Pāda **d** occurs below as  
xiv. 2. 11 **a**; **e** was found above as i. 20. 3 **d** etc. Ppp.  
reads *mā* for *nas* in **a**, omits **b**, reads in **c** *bhāume me  
kṛṇu*, and makes **d** and **e** change places, reading also *vāyas* for  
*varīyas* ⌊and *vidhan* for *vidan*⌋. The verse (11 + 8: 8 + 8 + 8 = 43)  
is curiously defined by the Anukr.

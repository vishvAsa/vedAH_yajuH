## Translation
54. I am overpowering, superior by name on the earth (*bhū́mi*); I am  
subduing, all-overpowering, vanquishing in every region.

## Notes
The treatment of the compounds of *sah* (p. also *abhīṣā́ṭ*, *viśvāṣā́ṭ*)  
is the subject of several rules in the Prāt. (ii. 82; iii. 1; iv. 70).  
⌊Cf. above, iii. 18. 5.⌋ The verse is by Kāuś. 38. 30 prescribed to be  
repeated as one goes to an assembly (*pariṣad*).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
55. When yonder, O divine one, spreading thyself forward, told by the  
gods, thou didst expand (  
  
  
*vi-sṛp*  
  
  
) to greatness, then entered into thee well-being; thou didst make fit  
the four directions.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. at the beginning puts *yat* before *adas;* it has in **b** *sṛṣṭā*  
instead of *uktā*, and *mahitvā* (which is better); and in **c** *ā  
vāmabhūtam av-*. The Anukr. does not heed the redundant syllable in  
**a**.

title = "४५ जनं बिभ्रती"

## Translation
45. Let the earth, bearing in many places people of different speech, of  
diverse customs (*-dhárman*), according to their homes, yield (*duh*) me  
a thousand streams of property, like a steady (*dhruvá*) unresisting  
milch-cow.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *janaṁ yaṁ bibhratī bahuvācasaṁ*, and in **c** *nas*  
for *me*. The Anukr. does not heed that the last pāda in this verse, and  
the last two in vs. 44, are triṣṭubh. ⌊Keś., p. 322³¹, couples this vs.  
with the preceding: cf. note to vs. 44.⌋

## Translation
61. Thou art the scatterer (? *āvápana*) of people, \[art\] a  
wish-fulfilling (*kāmadúgha*) Aditi, spreading out; what of thee is  
deficient, may Prajāpati, first-born of righteousness, fill that up for  
thee.

## Notes
The word *āvápana* seems to mean sometimes, and perhaps here, a (wide,  
shallow?) receptacle onto which things are strewn or scattered. Ppp. has  
at the beginning *vim* for *tvam*, and in **b** *viśvarūpā* for  
*paprathānā;* for **c, d** it reads *yat tāu ”naṁ tat tāpūrayāti  
prajāpatiḥ prajābhis saṁvidānām;* and it ends the hymn here. The Anukr.  
refuses to admit two familiar resolutions in **a**, and gratuitously  
calls the pāda a *bārhata* (9 syll.). The second half-verse is twice  
quoted in Kāuś. (46. 52; 137. 13) in connection with filling up a hole  
that has been dug (*iti saṁvapati*) and the verse, in 137. 14, with  
removing elsewhither the dirt taken out.

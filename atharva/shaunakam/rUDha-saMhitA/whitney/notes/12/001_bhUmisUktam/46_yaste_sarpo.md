## Translation
46. What stinging (*vṛ́ścika*) harsh-biting serpent of thine lies in  
secret, winter-harmed, torpid (? *bhṛmalá*); whatever worm, O earth,  
becoming lively, stirs in the early rainy season—let that, crawling, not  
crawl upon us; be thou gracious to us with that which is propitious.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *vṛścakas*, and for **b** ff. *hemantalabdho  
bhramalo (!) kṛmir lisaṁ pṛthivyāi prāvṛṣī yad ejati*. The treatment of  
*krímis* in **c** as neuter is very strange. ⌊Is it a collective neuter  
like *Gewürm?* cf. *Noun-Inflection*, JAOS. x. 570.⌋ In the description  
of the verse (11 + 12: 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 54) by the Anukr. there is  
perhaps something omitted (or we are to read *virāṭ śakvarī* for  
*parāś-*). The verse is used according to Kāuś. 50. 17 (with ⌊iii. 26  
(see introduction thereto) and 27 and⌋ vi. 56. 1) in the removal of  
vermin; also, according to 139. 8, with a number of other verses about  
serpents and the like; and it is reckoned to the *rāudra gaṇa* (note to  
Kāuś. 50. 13). In Vāit. 29. 10 it accompanies a libation to Rudra.

## Translation
7. Take ye (du.) hold upon each forward direction; to this world they  
that have faith attach themselves (*sac*); what of you that is cooked is  
served up in the fire, combine ye, O husband-and-wife, in order to its  
guarding.

## Notes
The verse is nearly accordant with vi. 122. 3. 'Forward' (*prañc*) is  
also 'eastern.' ⌊Note here again the sequence of the cardinal points  
(*pradakṣiṇa*), and cf. end of introd. to iii. 26.⌋ The Anukr. passes  
the irregularity of the second half-verse (11 + 11: 10 + 12 = 44)  
without notice. Kāuś. 61. 1 quotes this verse alone; and 61. 2 quotes  
7-10 as used while they follow around the vessel of water. Ppp. reads,  
for **c, d**, as follows: *mimāthāṁ pātṛ tad vāṁ pūrṇam astu śivāṁ  
pakvaṣ pitryāyaṇ ‘ty* (*‘bhy?*) *āmayat*.

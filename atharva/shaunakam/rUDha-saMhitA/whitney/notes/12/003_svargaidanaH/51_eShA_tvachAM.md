## Translation
51. This one of skins (*tvác*) hath come into being on man; not naked  
are all the animals (*paśú*) that are other; ye (du.) cause to wrap  
(*paridhā*) yourselves (*ātmán*) with authority (*kṣatrá*), a home-woven  
garment, the mouth of the rice-dish.

## Notes
The translation is as literal as possible; but other constructions may  
be made in the second half-verse. Ppp. leaves the hiatus between **a**  
and **b**, *babhūva an-*; it combines *-gnās sarve* in **b**; and it  
reads in **c** *dhāpayeta*, with a division-line after it. Kāuś. 62. 23  
makes the verse accompany the depositing of such a garment, with gold.  
⌊Has the vs. anything to do with the legend, cited under ii. 13. 3,  
about the cow and her skin, which the gods took from man and gave to the  
cow?⌋

title = "२६ आ यन्ति"

## Translation
26. They come from the sky, they fasten on (*sac*) the earth; from the  
earth they fasten upon the atmosphere; being cleansed, they just cleanse  
themselves; let them conduct us to the heavenly world.

## Notes
The accent of *śúmbhante* in **c** is unmotived. Ppp. reads ⌊cf. vss. 13  
and 21 and note to vi. 115. 3⌋ *śundhanti*, which (or *śumbhanti*) is  
decidedly preferable. That the reading in **a** is *diváḥ p-* is noted  
in the comm. to Prāt. ii. 68.

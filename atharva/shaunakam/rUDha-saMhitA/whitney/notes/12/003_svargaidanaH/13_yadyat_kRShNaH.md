## Translation
13. Whenever the black bird, coming hither, hath sat upon the orifice,  
surprising (*tsar*) what is resolved (*vi-sañj*), or when the barbarian  
woman (*dāsī́*) with wet hands smears over—cleanse, ye waters, the mortar  
\[and\] pestle.

## Notes
Ppp. combines in **a** *śakune ’ha*, and reads in **c** *dāsī vā yad*,  
and in **d** ⌊cf. vss. 21 and 26 and note to vi. 115. 3⌋ *śundhatā  
”paḥ*. Kāuś. quotes the verse in 8. 14, and the coram, also under 2. 6,  
but they cast no light on the obscure first half-verse. The verse is a  
good *triṣṭubh*, yet the Anukr. attempts to give it some special  
description, of which the text is corrupt and unintelligible (*yad-yat  
kṛṣṇa ity āthā*).

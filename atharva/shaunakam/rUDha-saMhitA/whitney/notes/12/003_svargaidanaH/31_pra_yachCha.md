## Translation
31. Reach thou forth the sickle (*párśu*), hasten, take \[it\] quickly;  
let them, not harming, cut (*dā*) the herbs at the joint; they of whom  
Soma compassed the kingship—let the plants be without wrath toward us.

## Notes
One or two of our mss. read in **a** *páraśum* (M.W.; O. *párárśum*);  
and, as usual, some (O.D.R.) accent *rā́jyam* in **c**. Ppp. has  
*harantu* for *harāu ’ṣam* in **a**; and, in **c**, *soma yāsām*.  
*Amanyutāḥ* is undivided in the *pada*-text. In Kāuś. 61. 38 the first  
pāda is used with handing over the sickle for gathering the  
*darbha*-grass; the second pāda,\* in 61. 39, with cutting it above the  
joints; and in 1. 24, 25 both for a similar purpose; so also the first  
pāda (or the verse) in 8. 11; and yet again both in the comm. to 137. 4.  
\*⌊Quoted as *oṣadhīr dāntu parvan* at i. 25 and 61. 39. According to  
Daś. Kar. (note to 137. 4), the quotation *pra yacha parśum* covers a  
pāda and a half, that is, it includes the *ahiṅsantas* which is omitted  
in the quotation of **b**.⌋

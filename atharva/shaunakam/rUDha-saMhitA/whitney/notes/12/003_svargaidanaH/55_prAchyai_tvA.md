## Translation
55. To the eastern quarter, to Agni as overlord, to the black  
\[serpent\] as defender, to Āditya having arrows, we commit thee here;  
guard ye him for us until our coming; may he lead on our appointed  
\[life-time\] here unto old age; let old age commit us unto death; then  
may we be united with the cooked \[offering\].

## Notes
⌊Vss. 55-60 are partly unmetrical.⌋ We are surprised to find the pause  
before instead of after the phrase *etám pári dadmaḥ*. With the items in  
the first division of these verses are to be compared the corresponding  
ones in iii. 27. 1-6. The concluding pāda of the metrical refrain is  
identical with vi. 119. 2 **d**. The *pada*-reading at the end of the  
prose is *ā́: asmā́kam: ā́॰etoḥ*. In every verse, Ppp. omits *tvā* before  
*diśé* (an improvement) and reads *dadhmas* for *dadmas*. In the refrain  
⌊of every verse, apparently⌋, it has *dadhātv adhā* for *dadātv atha*.  
In this verse it combines *diśe agnaye*. The metrical description of the  
Anukr. is very puzzling; the part common to all the verses is 6 + 10: 11  
+ 11 + 11 = 49 syllables; then the varying parts range ⌊with some  
resolutions⌋ from 25 to 31 syllables: all together, from 74 to 8o  
syllables; and *atidhṛti* is regularly 76, and *kṛti* 80; but the  
Anukr., after calling all *atidhṛti*, appears to call all but one  
*kṛti*. The verses are quoted in Kāuś. 63. 22, in connection with the  
rest of the hymn.

## Translation
24. Let Agni, cooking, defend thee on the east; let Indra, with the  
Maruts, defend on the south; may Varuṇa fix thee in the maintenance  
(*dharúṇa*) of the western \[quarter\]; on the north may Soma give thee  
together.

## Notes
Ppp. corrects the meter of **b** by reading *rakṣāt;* and that of **d**  
by having *varuṇas* instead of *somas*. The verse is irregular, but by  
no means a *jagatī*. ⌊If we make *varuṇas* and *somas* exchange places,  
as suggested by Ppp., and read *rakṣāt* with Ppp., the vs. becomes a  
good triṣṭubh.⌋ In Kāuś. 61. 32 it is used when arranging the fire about  
the kettle.

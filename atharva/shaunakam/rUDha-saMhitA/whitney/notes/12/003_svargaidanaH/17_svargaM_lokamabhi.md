## Translation
17. Unto the heavenly world shalt thou conduct us (pl.); may we be  
united with wife, with sons; I grasp \[her (?)\] hand; let her (?) come  
here after me; let not destruction pass us, nor the niggard.

## Notes
The last pāda is nearly the same with vi. 124. 3 **d**; cf. also ii. 7.  
4 **c, d**. Ppp. ends **d** with *no ‘rātiḥ*. The verse is a good  
*triṣṭubh*, and its description by the Anukr. is absurd. Kāuś. 61. 14  
uses the latter half-verse, not in a way to cast light on its meaning.

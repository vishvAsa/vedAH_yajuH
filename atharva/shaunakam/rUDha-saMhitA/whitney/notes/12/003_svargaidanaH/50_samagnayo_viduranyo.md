## Translation
50. The fires ire in concord, one with another—he that fastens on the  
herbs, and he that \[fastens on\] the rivers; as many gods as send heat  
(*ā-tap*) in the sky—gold hath become the light of him that cooks.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sindhum* in **b**, and *dadhatu*\* (for *pacatas*) in **d**.  
In Kāuś. 62. 22, the verse (with xi. 1. 28) is made to accompany the  
laying on of a piece of gold; it is also quoted in 68. 27, with vss.  
46-48, etc.: see note to vs. 46. The Anukr. does not notice the lack of  
a syllable in **a**. \*⌊Intending *dadhato?*⌋

## Translation
36. Thou hast come together unto all the worlds, having conquered;  
however many \[be\] the desires, thou hast made them wholly satisfied;  
plunge ye (du.) in—both the stirring-stick \[and\] the spoon; take thou  
him up upon one vessel.

## Notes
This obscure verse wins no light from Kāuś. (62. 1), which says simply  
*iti mantroktam*, connecting it with xi. 1. 24. Some of our mss.  
(P.M.W.T.) read *abhí* for *ádhi* in **d**. We should expect in **c**  
*gāhetām*, as the nouns are not vocative. Ppp. reads in **a** *samāgān  
abhicikya*, and in **b** *kāmān samitāu purastāt*.  
  
⌊See p. lxxxviii.⌋

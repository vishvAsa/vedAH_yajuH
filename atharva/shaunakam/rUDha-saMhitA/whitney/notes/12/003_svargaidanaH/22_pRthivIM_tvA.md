## Translation
22. Thee that art earth I make enter into earth; this like body of thee  
\[is\] separated; whatever of thee is burnt (? *dyuttá*), \[or\]  
scratched by driving (*árpaṇa*); with that do not leak; I cover that  
over by a spell (*bráhman*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. reads, for **a**, *bhūmyāṁ bhūmim adhi dhārayāmi;* in **c**,  
*arpaṇaṁ ca;* in **d**, *śuśror apa tad*, thus restoring the meter. The  
verse (12 + 11: 11 + 13 = 47) is very ill defined simply as a *jagatī*.  
In Kāuś. 61. 30, the verse accompanies the smearing of a vessel  
(*kumbhī*); in Vāit. 28. 12, the fashioning of a kettle.

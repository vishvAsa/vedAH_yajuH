## Translation
2. So much \[be\] your sight, so many your powers (*vīryà*), so great  
your brilliancy (*téjas*), so many-fold your energies (*vā́jina*); Agni  
fastens on (*sac*) the body when \[it is his\] fuel (?); then, O paired  
ones (*mithuná*), shall ye come into being from what is cooked  
(*pakvá*).

## Notes
The *pada*-text has *yadā́: édhaḥ* in **c**, as translated. Ppp. reads  
before it *agniṁ śarīraṁ sajate*, and after it *atha;* and in **a, b**  
it makes *cakṣus* and *tejas* change places. ⌊In OB. V. 258, *pakvá* is  
defined as 'the charred remains and ashes of a corpse.' Pāda **d**  
recurs in vs. 9.⌋ ⌊W. makes a query on the margin: "the husband and wife  
burnt together?? and born anew and alike out of the cremation?"⌋

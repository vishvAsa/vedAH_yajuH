## Translation
29. The cow, going about variously, the deposited deposit of the gods,  
manifests her forms, when she desires to go (?) to her station  
(*sthā́man*).

## Notes
That is, her rightful and appointed place. The translation implies in  
**b** the reading *kṛnute* instead of *kṛṇuṣva*, although the former is  
found only in O.p.m.D.T. (*-uti*). ⌊Three of SPP's *pada*-mss. have  
*kṛṇute*.⌋ The comm. to Prāt. ii. 63 quotes *āviṣ kṛṇute rūpāṇi*, which  
is not found in the text unless here. The translation also implies at  
the end *jigāṅsati*. The Prāt. (i. 86) seems to imply the occurrence in  
the text of such forms, and the sense obviously calls for them here and  
in the next verse; see the note to Prāt. i. 86. Ppp. reads in **d**  
*yathā* for *yadā*.

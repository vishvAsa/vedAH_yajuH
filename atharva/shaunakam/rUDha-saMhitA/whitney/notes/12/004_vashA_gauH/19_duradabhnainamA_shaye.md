## Translation
19. Door-damaging (?) lies she on him, if he is not willing to give her  
when asked for; he does not succeed in the desires which, without having  
given her, he would fain accomplish (*cikīrṣa-*).

## Notes
The translation implies the obviously necessary emendation of *yā́m* to  
*yā́n* in **d** ⌊so Ludwig⌋. As to *duradabhnā́* at the beginning, see the  
note to vs. 4. That the conjectural rendering is extremely  
unsatisfactory is plain. Ppp. has instead, for **a**,  
*duritavīnapāśaye;* and, in **c, d**, apparently *kāmas sam ṛdhyate yam  
ad-*, thus supporting our emendation. ⌊In Ppp. this verse precedes our  
18.⌋

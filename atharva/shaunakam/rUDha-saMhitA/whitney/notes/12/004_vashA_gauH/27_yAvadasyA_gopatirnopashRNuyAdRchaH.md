## Translation
27. So long as the master of her should not himself overhear the verses  
(*ṛ́ś*), so long may she go about among his kine (*gó*); she may not  
abide in his house after he has heard.

## Notes
The translation implies the evidently necessary emendation of *vaśet* at  
the end to *vaset;* R., indeed, has the latter; ⌊and so have 8 of SPP's  
authorities, against 7 with vaśet;⌋ Ppp. is corrupt: *nā ’sya śrutā gṛhe  
sya*. The Anukr. takes no notice of any redundancy in **b**; but it can  
hardly expect us to make a *pada*-division between *no* and  
*’paśṛṇuyāt*. The 'verses' are doubtless those with which the Brahmans  
come to claim their rightful property.

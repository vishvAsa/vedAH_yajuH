## Translation
42. The gods questioned (*mīmāṅs-*) about her: is this a cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋,  
or not a cow.' Of her Nārada said: she is of cows the most truly cow  
(*vaśátama*).

## Notes
The more proper reading in **b** would seem to be *ávaśā́3íti;* but all  
the *saṁhitā*-mss. read *ávaśé ’ti*, as in our text, although the pāda  
gives the sign of protraction (*3*) also after *avaśā*, as it should be.  
But the Prāt. (i. 97) requires *-śé ’ti* simply: see the rules i. 97 and  
105, and the notes to them. The verse (8 + 8: 7 + 10) is very ill  
described by the Anukr. Ppp. reads in **a** *devā ’mīm-;* for **b**,  
*vaśe ’yāṁ ntavaśe ’ti* and it omits *iti* at the end. ⌊For the use of  
the superlative in **d**, cf. the punning lampoon on the name of Gotama,  
*Indische Sprüche*², 4875.⌋

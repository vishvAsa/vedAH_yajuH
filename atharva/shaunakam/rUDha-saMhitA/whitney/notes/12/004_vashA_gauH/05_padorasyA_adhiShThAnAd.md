## Translation
5. From the station of the two feet of her, soaking (? *viklíndu*)  
namely visits \[him\]; unexpectedly (?) are they crushed who snuff at  
her with the mouth.

## Notes
Here, too, much is obscure and doubtful. The first part might be: 'From  
the station of her ⌊or 'from standing on her,' as W. queries⌋, soaking  
of the feet visits ⌊him⌋,' as it is hard to see what two feet have to do  
with a cow. And in **d** *yā́s* can be either subject or object, and  
*jíghrati* either sing, or pl. I take *anāmanā́t* from root *man;* Ludwig  
renders it 'without becoming ill'; the Pet. Lexx. explain the word as  
meaning a kind of disease. Ppp. reads, in **a, b**, *asyā ’dhiṣṭhānād  
vikulaṁ dvin nāma*.

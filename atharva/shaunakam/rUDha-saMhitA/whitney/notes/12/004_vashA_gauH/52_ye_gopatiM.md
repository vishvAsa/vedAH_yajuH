## Translation
52. They who, leading away her master, then say: do not give—they,  
through ignorance, go to meet the hurled missile of Rudra.

## Notes
*Pari yanti* is rendered as if *prati y-*, for which it is perhaps a  
misreading. Ppp. reads *cetasas* for *acittyā*. Part of our mss.  
(Bp.R.K.) leave *āhus* unaccented, and all have *te* instead of *té* in  
**c**.

## Translation
30. She manifests herself when she desires to go to her station; then  
the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋ makes up her mind for the asking of the priests  
(*brahmán*).

## Notes
That is, prepares herself to be asked for by them; *brahmábhyas*, dat.  
by attraction. ⌊Read again *jígāṅsati*: see note to vs. 29.⌋ Read in  
**d** *yācñyā́ya*, though the mss. mostly have *-ñcy-*, as they often  
blunder over such an unusual consonant-group. Ppp. reads *uto* for  
*atho* in **c**.

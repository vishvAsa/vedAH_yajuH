## Translation
44. The *viliptī́*, O Brihaspati, and the cow ⌊*vaśā́*⌋ that has given  
birth to \[such\] a cow—of that one a non-Brahman who should hope for  
prosperity (*bhū́ti*) may not partake.

## Notes
The translation implies at the beginning emendation to *viliptī́ yā́* (as  
in vs. 46); the proper reading might also be *viliptyàs*, nom. pl.;  
*-tyā́s* seems inadmissible; Ppp. reads *vilaptyā* (for *-ās?*). Ppp. has  
further *tāsāṁ* for *tasyās* in **c**. *Sūtávaśā* is rendered according  
to the requirement of the accent; the Pet. Lexx. define as 'a cow  
remaining barren after the birth of one calf'; and the legends told in  
explanation of the name in TS. vi. 1. 3⁶ and MS. ii. 5. 4 support that  
understanding. ⌊Cf. Henry's translation, p. 208, and note, p. 256.⌋ Pāda  
**c** is redundant in this verse, as are also 46 **c** and 43 **d**; the  
Anukr. heeds none of these cases.

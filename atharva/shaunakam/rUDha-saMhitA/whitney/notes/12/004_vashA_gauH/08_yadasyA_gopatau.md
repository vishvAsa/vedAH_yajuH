## Translation
8. If of her, while being with her master, a crow hath vexed (*hīḍ*) the  
hair, then his boys die, \[and\] the *yákṣma* visits him unexpectedly  
(?).

## Notes
As to *anāmanā́t*, see note to vs. 5. The first pāda apparendy means 'in  
presence of her master,' and so, 'without his interference for her  
protection.' ⌊Ppp. combines *tataṣ k-* in **c**.⌋

## Translation
24. The gods asked the cow \[of him\] in whose possession she was first  
(*ágre*) born; that same one may Nārada know; together with the gods he  
drove her away.

## Notes
The connection of **c, d** is obscure, and tempts to conjectural  
emendations; Ludwig suggests *vidvā́n* for *vidyāt:* 'knowing her to be  
such, Nārada together with the gods drove her away (as theirs)'; this is  
quite acceptable. Ppp. reads at the end *udājitā*. One or two of our  
mss. (D.R.p.m.) accent *nāradáḥ*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the lack  
of a syllable in **a**. ⌊Read *devā́so* as in 20?⌋

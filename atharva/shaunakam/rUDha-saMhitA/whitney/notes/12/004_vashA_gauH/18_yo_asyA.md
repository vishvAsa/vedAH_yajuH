title = "१८ यो अस्या"

## Translation
18. Whoever knows not the udder of her, and likewise the teats of her,  
to him she yields milk with both, if he has been able to give the cow.

## Notes
That is, probably, if her owner has sought no profit from her (cf.  
Ludwig). The first pāda is quoted under Prāt. ii. 52, as an example of  
*ūdho* (not *ūdhar*) before a sonant. A number of our mss. read *veda*,  
without accent.

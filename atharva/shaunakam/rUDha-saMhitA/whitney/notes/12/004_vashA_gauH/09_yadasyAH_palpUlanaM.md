title = "०९ यदस्याः पल्पूलनं"

## Translation
9. If the lye, the dung of her a barbarian woman flings together, then  
is born what is deformed, what will not escape from that sin.

## Notes
All our mss. appear to read distinctly *palpūl-* in **a**, yet they are  
never to be trusted to make the distinction between *lp* and *ly*.  
Apparently the word is used here for 'urine,' and the meaning is 'if  
such precious stuff is carelessly treated by a slave-woman (*dāsī*).'  
Ppp. reads *‘pirūpaṁ* in **c**. We have to resolve *as-i-āḥ* to fill out  
the meter of **a**.

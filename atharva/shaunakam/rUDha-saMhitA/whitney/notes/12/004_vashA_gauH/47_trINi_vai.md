## Translation
47. Three verily are the kinds of cow: the vilipti, she that has given  
birth to \[such\] a cow, the \[simple\] cow yagd; these one should  
present to the priests (brahman), \[then\] he falls not under the wrath  
of Prajapati.

## Notes
Ppp. once more reads *vilitptīs sū-* in **b**; it is easier to  
conjecture a meaning for *viluptī* than for *viliptī*. Most of our  
*saṁhitā*-mss. accent *só ‘nāv-* in **d**; our text makes the necessary  
correction to *sò*. The irregularities of **b** and **c** are unnoticed  
in the Anukr.; ⌊or rather, it lets them balance each the other⌋.

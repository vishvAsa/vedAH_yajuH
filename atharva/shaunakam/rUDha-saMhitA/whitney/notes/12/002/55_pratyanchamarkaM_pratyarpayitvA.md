## Translation
55. Having sent in opposition an opposing (*pratyáñc*) song (*arká*), I,  
foreknowing, have entered abroad on the road; I have directed away the  
lifebreaths of them yonder; these here I unite with long life-time.

## Notes
The first half-verse is difficult and doubtful. The use made of the  
verse by Kāuś. gives no help; it is quoted in 71. 5 as noted above,  
under vs. 54; and in 72. 13 with several other verses, as noted under  
vs. 24. Ppp. reads *ācakāra* at end of **b**. ⌊W. has overlooked the  
*hí* and the accent of the two perfects: perhaps, 'since I have entered  
\[and\] have directed..., \[accordingly\] I unite' etc. Henry, p. 238,  
inserts another hí after *amī́ṣām*.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn and 55 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *"naḍas" tu pañconā*.⌋

## Translation
26. The stony one flows (*rī*); take ye hold together; play the hero,  
pass over, O friends; quit here them that are of evil courses; may we  
pass up unto powers (? *vā́ja*) that are free from disease.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 53. 8, and found also in VS. (xxxv. 10) and TA. (vi.  
3. 2). RV. has *út tiṣṭhata* for *vīráyadhvam* in **b**, *jahāma* and  
(for *durévās*) *áśevās* in **c**, and *śivā́n vayám* (for *anamīvā́m*) in  
**d**. ⌊VS. agrees with RV. save that it accents *sákhāyaḥ* in **b** and  
reads, for **c**, *átra jahīmó ‘śivā yé ásan*.⌋ TA. agrees in general  
with RV., but has *revatīs* ⌊unaccented⌋ for *rīyate* in **a**, and in  
**d** puts *út tarema* after *abhí vā́jān*. Vss. 26 and 27 are quoted in  
Kāuś. 71. 24 and 86. 27 to accompany the symbolical act of crossing over  
northward; and in Vāit. 12. 11 to accompany (at any time) the crossing  
of streams.

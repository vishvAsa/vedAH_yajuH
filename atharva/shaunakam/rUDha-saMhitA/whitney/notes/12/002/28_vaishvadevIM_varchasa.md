## Translation
28. Take ye hold on that of all the gods in order to splendor, becoming  
cleansed, clear, purifying; stepping over difficult tracks, may we revel  
a hundred winters with all our heroes.

## Notes
The first half-verse is identical with vi. 62. 3 **a, b**, save that the  
latter begins with *vāiśvānarī́m*. We have doubtless to supply *nā́vam*  
'boat.' But Ppp. has *sūnṛtām* for *varcase* in **a**; and the comm. to  
Nirukta vi. 12 quotes the *pratīka* in this form, explaining *sūnṛtām*  
by *vācam* (Roth). According to Kāuś. 72. 6, it is a young heifer  
(*vatsatarī*) that is caused to be laid hold on.

## Translation
48. Lay ye hold after the draft-ox \[as\] float (*plavá*); he shall  
carry you out of difficulty \[and\] reproach; mount this boat of  
Savitar; may we cross over misery by the six wide \[directions\].

## Notes
This and the remaining verses of the hymn are given by Ppp. in the order  
49-51, 54, 53, 55, 48 (52 being wanting). ⌊Cf. MGS. ii. i. 14 and p.  
146.⌋ In Kāuś. 72.8, this verse and the next are used (next after vss.  
28, 47) in laying hold on a couch (*talpa*); the third pāda in 71. 23  
and 86. 26, in causing some one to embark on a (symbolical) boat  
containing gold and barley. There is no good reason for calling the  
verse *bhurij*.

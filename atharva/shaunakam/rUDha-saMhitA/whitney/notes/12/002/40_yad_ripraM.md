title = "४० यद् रिप्रं"

## Translation
40. What evil (*riprá*), pollution we have committed, and what  
ill-doing, from that let the waters cleanse me, and from the crushing  
Agni what.

## Notes
The last clause seems a false construction, the true one being something  
like the version of Ppp.: *agnis saṁkusikaś ca yaḥ;* but Ludwig fills it  
out to "and \[from that\] which \[arises\] from Agni Saṁkasuka." ⌊As to  
the construction, see Caland as cited under vs. 19.⌋ ⌊As to *saṁkasuka*,  
cf. note to vs. 11.⌋ Ppp. further reads *duritaṁ* (for *śamalam*) in  
**a**; and it has *śundhantu* in **c** ⌊cf. note to vi. 115. 3 and the  
VS. variant there⌋. The Anukr. understands the verse as 6 + 8: 8 + 8 =  
30 syllables; but the *pada*-mss., less acceptably, mark the pāda  
division as occurring after *cakṛmá*. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 71.  
16 and 86. 19 in company with others, as noted under vs. 13.

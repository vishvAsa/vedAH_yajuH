title = "१९ सीसे मृड्ढ्वं"

## Translation
19. Wipe ye off on the lead; wipe ye off on the reeds; and what on the  
consuming fire; likewise on the dark (*rāmá*) ewe; headache on the  
pillow.

## Notes
The rendering is very literal, and does not disguise the obscurity of  
the connection. Ppp. reads for **b** *agnis saṁkusikaś ca yaḥ*, which is  
more manageable: 'and on \[that\] which \[is\] the consuming fire': i.e.  
'on the fire.' ⌊Caland, KZ. xxxiv. 457, comparing Avestan locutions,  
says that *agnāu saṁkasuke ca yat* is locative to *agniḥ saṁkasukaś ca  
yaḥ:* cf. vs. 40 and i. 30. 1.⌋ The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 71. 16; 86.  
19, with vss. 13 and 40: see above, under vs. 13. The mss. in general,  
according to their wont, read in **a** *mṛḍhvam* (but Bs. *mṛḍhḍham*).  
⌊For *śīrṣakti*, see ref's under i. 12. 3.⌋

## Translation
3. Out from here do we drive death, perdition, out the niggard; whoso  
hates us, him, O non-flesh-eating Agni, do thou eat; whomso we hate, him  
do we impel to thee.

## Notes
The *pada*-text has in **c**, *ádhi;* and most of the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
*ádhy agne*, in accordance with it, though one or two (Bs.E.) have  
*áddhy agne*, which is no various reading, but only an allowed  
equivalent. The case is like those in i. 22. 1 and v. 20. 12 above; the  
abbreviated reading *adhy* has been mistaken for *adhi* instead of  
*addhi*, and then accented accordingly. Bp. accents also *akravya॰át*.  
Our text emends to *addhy àgne akravyāt*, but should read instead  
*agne*, since there is no reason whatever for the accentuation *addhí*.  
A better reading would seem also to be *kravyāt*. Ppp. has *adhy agne  
kravyād;* but that, of course, might mean *‘kravyāt*. Ppp. also has  
simply *aṁ* for *yam u* in **d**, omits the second *u*, and ends with  
*suvāmaḥ*. ⌊Ppp. reads *yakṣmas* for *dviṣmas* in **d**. So the Ppp.  
reading is *adhy agne kravyād aṁ yakṣmas taṁ te pra suvāmaḥ*.⌋

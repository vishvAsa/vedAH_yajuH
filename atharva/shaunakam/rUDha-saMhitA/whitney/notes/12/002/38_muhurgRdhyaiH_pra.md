## Translation
38. A mortal, going down to mishap, speaks forth repeatedly with greedy  
ones (? *gṛ́dhya*); whom (pl.) the flesh-eating Agni, from near by,  
after-knowing, follows (? *vi-tāv*).

## Notes
The translation is purely mechanical, the sense being wholly obscure.  
Nothing corresponding to *vitā́vati* is found anywhere else; the Pet.  
Lex. suggests emendation to *vidhāvati;* Ludwig, alternatively, to  
*vitāmyati* or *vitāmati*. Yet **c, d** are repeated below as 52 **c,  
d** (that verse is wanting in Ppp., which, however, has these two pādas  
in vs. 50). The much corrupted version of Ppp. gives no help as to the  
verse in general: bahu *krudhīṣ pra vadanty anti tarmato ‘nveti ca:  
kravyādam agnir* ⌊intending *kravyād yam ag-*?⌋ *anuvidvān vibhāvati*  
(*vitāvati?*).

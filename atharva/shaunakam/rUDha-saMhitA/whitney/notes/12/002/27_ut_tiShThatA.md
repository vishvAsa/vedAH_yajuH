## Translation
27. Stand up, pass over, O friends; the stony river here runs (*syand*);  
quit ye here them that are unpropitious; may we pass up unto propitious  
pleasant powers.

## Notes
This variation of vs. 26 gives part of the RV. variants to that vs. ⌊For  
a discussion of the RV. verse, see notes to my *Skt. Reader*, p. 388.⌋  
Ppp. makes **b** identical with 26 **a**. The use by Kāuś. was stated in  
the preceding note.

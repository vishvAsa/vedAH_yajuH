## Translation
4. If the flesh-eating Agni, or if the tiger-like, hath entered this  
stall (*goṣṭhá*), being not at home (?), him, having made him to have  
beans for sacrificial butter, I send far forth; let him go unto the  
Agnis that have seat in the waters.

## Notes
Part of the mss. (E.I.O.R.T.K.) have *vyāghrás* in **a**, and that is  
perhaps the true reading, since *-ghrya* seems to be found nowhere else.  
Ppp. reads in **b** *anyokā viveśa*, and in **c** *tan mā-*. The Anukr.  
takes no notice of the redundant (*tám* intruded?) syllable in **c**. In  
Kāuś. 71. 6 the verse is used (with vss. 7 and 53) in making a libation  
of crushed beans with mother-of-pearl (? *śukti*) to the flesh-eating  
fire which is to be banished. ⌊The verse contains reminiscences of 7 and  
8 below.⌋

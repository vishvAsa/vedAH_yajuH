title = "१६ अन्येभ्यस्त्वा पुरुषेभ्यो"

## Translation
16. Thee from inexhaustible (? *ánya*) men, kine, horses, thee the  
flesh-eating one do we thrust out—the fire that obstructs life.

## Notes
Ludwig gets rid of the difficulty of *ánya* by taking it as *anyá* and  
the nouns in **a, b** as datives. Ppp. reads *ajñānā* for *anyebhyas  
tvā;* in **c** it puts *nis* after *kravyādam*. Some of our mss. (Bs.I.)  
combine *niṣ kr-* (*níḥ* and *kr-* should be separated in our edition).  
The Anukr. very unnecessarily scans the verse as 8 + 6: 8 + 9, while it  
is easily read into a regular *anuṣṭubh*.

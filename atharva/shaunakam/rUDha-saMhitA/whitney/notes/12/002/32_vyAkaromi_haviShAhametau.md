title = "३२ व्याकरोमि हविषाहमेतौ"

## Translation
32. I separate (*vy-ā-kṛ*) these two by oblation; I shape them apart  
with a spell (*bráhman*); I make for the Fathers unwasting *svadhā́;* I  
unite these with a long life-time.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **c** *sudhāṁ pitṛbhyo amṛtam duhānā*. From Vāit. 6. 2  
the separation would appear to be that of the other two fires when taken  
from the householder's fire; but Kāuś. 70. 10 has it repeated while one  
looks upon the householder's and the flesh-eating fires; the latter is  
most likely to be its true application. It is also quoted in Kāuś. 72.  
13 with several other verses, from this hymn and elsewhere, as noted  
under vs. 24.

## Translation
45. Lengthen thou out, O Agni, the life-time of the living; let them who  
are dead go unto the world of the Fathers; do thou, a good householder's  
fire, burning away the niggard, assign to this man an ever better dawn.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **a**, *jīvānām agneṣ pratar dīrgham āyuṣ*, and, in **c,  
d**, *arātīr uṣām-uṣāṁ śrayaṁ śrayasi dadhat*. Kāuś. and Vāit. quote as  
*pratīka* only the beginning of **c**; this looks rather as if they  
made one verse of our 45 **c, d** and 46. In Kāuś. (71. 2) it  
accompanies setting down fuel on the householder's fire; in Vāit. (4. 8)  
it is used with one of the offerings of the sacrificer's wife. It (11 +  
13: 11 + 11 = 46) is very ill defined as simply a *jagatī*.

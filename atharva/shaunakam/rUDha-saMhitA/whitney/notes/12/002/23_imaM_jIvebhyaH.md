## Translation
23. I set this enclosure for the living; let not another of them now go  
to that goal; living a hundred numerous autumns, let them set an  
obstacle to death with a mountain.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 18. 4, and found also in VS. (xxxv. 15), TB. (iii.  
7. ll³), TA. (vi. 10. 2), and Āp. (ix. 12. 4; xiv. 22. 3). RV. differs  
from our text only by reading *jīvantu* in **c**, and *antár* (for  
*tirás*) in **d**. VS. agrees throughout with RV.; TB. differs only by  
having (like AV.) *tirás* in **d** (*eṣā́n nu* in b is doubtless a  
misprint, as *mátyám* in **d** is a misprint for *mṛtyúm:* see the comm.  
⌊the Poona ed., p. 1137, corrects them both⌋), and *árdham* in **b**.  
TA. reads *mā́ nó ‘nu gād* and *árdham* in **b**, and *tirás* and  
*dadmahe* in **d**. Āp. agrees exactly with TB. the first time; but the  
second time it has *no nu* (or *‘nu*) in **b**, and *dadhmahe* in **d**.  
⌊Cf. MP. ii. 22. 24.⌋ Ppp. gives, in **c**, *jyok* for *śatam*, and  
combines *śaradaṣ pu-*. In Kāuś. 72. 17 the verse accompanies the  
setting down (of a stone) in the door; in 72. 2 the last pāda is recited  
while stepping over the stone.

title = "२४ आ रोहतायुर्जरसं"

## Translation
24. Mount, choosing old age for life-time, pressing on, one after  
another, as many as ye be; you here let Tvashṭar, him of good births, in  
accord \[with you\], lead on to living your whole life-time.

## Notes
The verse is (once more with exception of the last pāda) RV. x. 18. 6,  
and found also in TA. (vi. 10. 1). RV. reads *ṣṭha* after *yáti* in  
**b**, and *ihá* for *tā́n vas* in **c**, and its **d** is *dirghám ā́yuḥ  
karati jīváse vaḥ*. TA. differs from RV. by having *gṛṇānā́s* in **a**,  
*surátnas* (for *sajóṣās*) in **c**, and *karatu* in **d**. Ppp. puts  
the verse after our 25, and combines in **a-b** *vṛṇānā ’nu*. The verse  
is used in Kāuś. 72. 13 with vss. 21, 32, 44, 55, and others from  
elsewhere.

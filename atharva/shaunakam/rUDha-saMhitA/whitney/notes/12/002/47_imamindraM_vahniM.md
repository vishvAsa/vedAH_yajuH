## Translation
47. Take ye hold after this saving (*pápri*) carrier (*váhni*) Indra; he  
shall carry you out of difficulty \[and\] reproach; by him smite away  
the on-flying shaft; by him ward off (*pari-pā*) Rudra's hurled  
\[missile\].

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b**, *sa yo vidvān vijahāti mṛtyum;* ⌊and its **d** is  
like ours⌋. The verse (13 + 11: 11 + 11 = 46) is unintelligibly ill  
described by the Anukr. One of the four dissyllabic words in **a** is  
apparently an intrusion—perhaps most probably *índram*, since one does  
not see why Indra should make his appearance in this Agni hymn (but see  
vs. 54), and the epithet *vahni* belongs especially to Agni. In Kāuś.  
72. 7 the verse is used (next after vs. 28) to accompany laying hold on  
a bull ⌊cf. introd. to iv. 22⌋.

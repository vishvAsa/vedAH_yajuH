## Comment
⌊Partly prose—vss. 42, 44.⌋ Found also (except vss. 36, 52) in Pāipp. xvii., with slight differences of order, pointed out under the verses. The whole hymn (which is also an anuvāka) is quoted in Kāuç. 69. 7 (with vii. 62 and the mahā́çānti hymns), in the ceremony of preparing the house-fire; and a large proportion of the verses in this and other ceremonies; a few also are used in the Vāit.; ⌊and the hymn is cited by Dārila on Kāuç. 43. 5⌋.


## Translations
Translated: Ludwig, p. 479 (omitting here vss. 21-26, 30-31); Henry, 188, 227; Griffith, ii. 102.—The RV. correspondents of a number of the verses (7, 8, 21-25, 26, 30, 31) are discussed in my Skt. Reader, pages 380 ff., 388.

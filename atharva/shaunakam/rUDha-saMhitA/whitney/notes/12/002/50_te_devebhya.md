## Translation
50. They fall under the wrath of the gods, they live always evilly,  
after whom the flesh-eating fire, from near by, like a horse, scatters  
reeds.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *deveṣu*, and this is the usual and regular  
construction with *ā-vraśc*. Further, for **d** it has our 38 **d** and  
52 **d**. The Anukr. gives *iva* two syllables in **d**. Our Bp. reads  
*antikā́n* (instead of *-kā́t* here and in 38 **c** and 52 **c**. ⌊One  
could easily scan **d** as an *anuṣṭubh* pāda, *áśvevānvápate naḍám*  
(*Gram.* §233 a), if it were worth scanning.⌋

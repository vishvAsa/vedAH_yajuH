title = "४४ अन्तर्धिर्देवानां परिधिर्मनुष्याऽणामग्निर्गार्हपत्य"

## Translation
44. Concealment of the gods, defense (*paridhí*) of men (*manuṣyà*), the  
householder's fire is set (*śritá*) between both classes.

## Notes
In accordance with the Anukr., the mss. interpose no stroke of  
interpunction in this verse, which plainly is not metrical, though the  
last 8 syllables read like an *anuṣṭubh* pāda. It is quoted, with others  
(see note to vs. 24), in Kāuś. 72. 13. Ppp. reads *ubhayād* in **c**.  
⌊The medial *avasāna* is lacking in SPP. and should be deleted from the  
Berlin ed.⌋

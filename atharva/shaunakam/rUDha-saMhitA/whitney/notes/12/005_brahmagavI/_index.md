## Comment
⌊Partly metrical: vss. 15-17, 47-53, 55-70 are so reckoned by W. in the Index, p. 6.⌋ Found also in the main in Pāipp. xvi., but in the central parts with omissions and disorder of which the details are not given; ⌊vss. 58, 60, 64-73 are wanting⌋. Not quoted at all by Vāit., nor probably by Kāuç., since 'the two Brahman-cow hymns' mentioned in Kāuç. 48. 13 are doubtless v. 18, 19; although the comm. ⌊Dārila: cf. Keçava, p. 35120⌋ declares these ⌊v. 18, 19⌋ to constitute one of the 'two,' and xii. 5 the other. *⌊The Berlin ms. reads prāguktarṣibrahmagavīdevatāḥ: so also SPP's citation, Critical Notice, p. 21. This seems to mean that Kaçyapa is the ṛṣi; h. 4 clearly has the same "deity" as this.⌋

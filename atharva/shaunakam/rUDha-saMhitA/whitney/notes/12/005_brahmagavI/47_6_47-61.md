## Translation
47. Quickly, indeed, at his killing the vultures make a din (*āilabá*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *kurvatāi ’lavaṁ*. The text of the Anukr. seems  
defective here. All that is said about the nine verses of 16 syllables  
is as follows: *ādyā skandhogrīvīs tvayā pramūrṇam* ⌊vs. 61⌋  
*prājāpatyānuṣṭubhaḥ*. All the verses not of this measure are regularly  
described. Ludwig translates this whole section ⌊and the next⌋, p. 529.

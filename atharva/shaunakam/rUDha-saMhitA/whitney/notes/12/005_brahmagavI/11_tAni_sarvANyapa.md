## Translation
11. All these depart from the Kshatriya who takes to himself the  
Brahman-cow, who scathes the Brahman.

## Notes
Lit. 'all these of the K.,' 'that belong to him.' Ppp. omits vs. 10, and  
abbreviates vs. 9 to *āyuś ca śrotraṁ ca*, and vs. 11 to *tāni sarvāṇy  
apa krāmanti kṣatriyasya*. All our *saṁhitā*-mss. read in vs. 10 *ca  
rtám*. The Anukr. says of vss. 7-10, *etāś catasraḥ punaḥ punaḥ  
padāntareṇa padābhyāsād ekapadāḥ:* ⌊that is, they are *1-p*. because  
repeatedly or in each case the groups ending with *ca* have to be  
recited with a pāda-interval, i.e. (as Dr. Ryder suggests) because there  
is in each verse no main cesura⌋.

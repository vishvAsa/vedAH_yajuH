title = "५५ क्षुरपविर्मृत्युर्भूत्वा वि"

## Translation
55. Having become a keen-edged death, run thou out.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vibhāvasuḥ* instead of *vi dhāva tvam;* the latter reading  
probably carries on the figure implied in *kṣurapavi*, which applies  
especially to the armed wheels of a battle-chariot.

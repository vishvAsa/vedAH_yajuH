## Translation
2. Covered with truth, enclosed with fortune, enveloped with glory.

## Notes
Why the verse is called *sāmnī* rather than *prājāpatyā*, like its  
predecessor, cannot be told. The *pada*-text does not divide *prā́vṛtā*,  
although, in the apparently parallel case, it divides *pári॰vṛtā*.

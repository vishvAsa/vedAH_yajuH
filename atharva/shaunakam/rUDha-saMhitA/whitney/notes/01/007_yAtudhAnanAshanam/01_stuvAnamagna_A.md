## Translation
1. Bring hither, O Agni, the sorcerer (*yātudhā́па*), the *kimīdín*,  
speaking out (*stu*); for thou, O god, being revered, hast become slayer  
of the barbarian (*dásyu*).

## Notes
*Stu* is shown by its use also in 8. 1, 2 to have here the virtual  
meaning 'confess' ⌊'naming, í.e. confessing himself'; cf. *laudare*,  
'praise,' but also 'name,' 'mention'⌋. The comm. does not see this, but  
stolidly renders it 'praise,' making the first line mean "bring the god  
who praises my oblation or else who is praised by us, and make the  
*yātudhā́na* etc. go away"! He is never weary, when *kimīdin* occurs, of  
repeating Yāska's (6. 11) silly etymology from *kim idānīm* 'what now?'  
Ppp. reads for **a** *stuvānaṣṭānaya*, and, for **c, d**, *tvaḿ hi devāṁ  
stuto hantā tasyo 'ta bahūvyathā*.

## Translation
2. O most exalted one (*parameṣṭhín*), Jātavedas, self-controller, Agni,  
partake of (*prа-аś*) the sacrificial butter, of the sesame oil (?);  
make the sorcerers cry out.

## Notes
The translation 'sesame oil' follows our text, *tāilásya;* but the  
reading of all the mss., which SPP. follows, is *tāulásya*, and Ppp. has  
*tūlasya*. The comm. explains the word as meaning "situated in the  
sacrificial ladle," from *tulā* 'balance,' used for 'spoon,' because by  
the latter the butter is measured out—or, he adds, it signifies simply  
*avadīyamāna* 'cut off' (in the technical sense), since the root *tul*  
means *unmāne* ⌊'mete out'⌋. Ppp. further reads in **c, d** *prāśānaṁ  
yātudhānād vilāpayaḥ*. The comm. first takes *vi lāpaya* from root *lī*,  
and makes it equal *vināśaya!* but he adds further a derivation from *vi  
lap* ⌊'make 'em squeal,' as we should say⌋. At end of **a**, the  
*saṁhitā*-mss., as usual, are divided between *-ṣṭhin* and *-ṣṭhiṅ;*  
SPP. chooses the former ⌊cf. Prāt. íí. 11⌋. Ppp. has *vaśim* in **b.**

## Translation
1. Of golden color, clean (*śúci*), purifying, in whom \[was\] born  
Savitar, in whom Agni; who, of beauteous color, assumed Agni as  
embryo—let those waters be weal, pleasant to us.

## Notes
⌊in c, for *dadhiré,* better, 'conceived'?⌋ TS. and MS. read in **b**  
*jātáḥ kaśyápo yā́sv índraḥ;* and Ppp. agrees with them; MP. has *agníḥ*  
instead of *índraḥ*. In **c** TS. MS. give *vírūpās* for *suvarṇās;* and  
TS. omits *yā́s*, and hence has *dadhire* (unaccented); MS. puts *yā́s*  
after *agním.* MP. offers *te* for *nas* in **d**. ⌊As to *savitṛ* =  
*kaśyapa,* cf. Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 403.⌋

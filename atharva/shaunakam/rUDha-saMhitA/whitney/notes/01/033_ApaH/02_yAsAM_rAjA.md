## Translation
2. In the midst of whom goes king Varuṇa, looking down at the  
truth-and-falsehood of men; who, of beauteous color, etc. etc.

## Notes
The first half-verse is found also in RV. (vii. 49. 3 **a, b**), without  
difference of reading; MP. agrees through the whole verse ⌊except in  
**d**, *te* for *nas*⌋; TS. MS. have a wholly different *c*. The comment  
to Prāt. ii. 11 gives *avapaśyañ janānām* as example of the general  
requirement that final *n* be assimilated to a following initial  
palatal, and half or more of our mss. so read; but SPP., as elsewhere,  
gives *-an j-* ⌊cf. note to i. 19.4⌋.

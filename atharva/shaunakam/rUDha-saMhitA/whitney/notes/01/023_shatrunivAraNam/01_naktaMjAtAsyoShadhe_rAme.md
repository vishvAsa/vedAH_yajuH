## Translation
1. Night-born art thou, O herb, O dark, black, \[and\] dusky one; O  
colorer (*rajanī*), do thou color this leprous spot and what is pale  
(*palitá*).

## Notes
According to the comm., the herb addressed is the *haridrā* (*Curcuma  
longa*). R. writes: "The *rajanī* is known to the lexicographers, and  
has later as principal name *parpaṭī* \[an Oldenlandia dyeing red,  
OB.\], Madana 46. 47, Dhanvantari (ms.) i. 27. In Bhāvapr. i. 194  
(where, according to my old and good ms., *rañjanī* is to be read  
instead of *-nā*), it is noted that this remedy is fragrant, and comes  
out of the north. It has a dark aspect. The species not to be  
determined, because the later identifications are entirely  
untrustworthy." ⌊See Dhanvantari, Ānanda-āśrama ed., p. 17.⌋ The  
causative stem *rajaya* (the meter calls for *rāj-*) is found only here.

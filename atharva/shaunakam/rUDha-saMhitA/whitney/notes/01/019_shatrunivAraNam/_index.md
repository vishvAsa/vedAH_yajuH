## Comment
The hymn is found also in Pāipp. i. With the two that follow it (and others), it is reckoned by Kāuç. (14. 7) among the sāṃgrāmikāṇi or battle-hymns, or likewise (ib., note) to the aparājita ('unconquered') gaṇa; without them, but with vi. 13, it is used in several of the charms to ward off the effects of portents (104. 3; 105. 1; 113. 3). In Vāit. (9. 21), vs. 3 appears alone in the cāturmāsya or seasonal sacrifice, accompanying the release of the two puroḍāça baskets.

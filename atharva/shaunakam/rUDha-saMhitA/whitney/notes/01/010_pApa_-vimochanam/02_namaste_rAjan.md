## Translation
2. Homage be to thy fury, O king Varuṇa; for, O formidable one, thou  
dost note (*ni-ci*) every malice (*drugdhá*). A thousand others I impel  
(*pra-sū*) together; a hundred autumns of thee shall this man live.

## Notes
The obscure third pāda is understood by the comm., perhaps correctly, to  
mean "I buy off this man by furnishing Varuṇa a thousand others as  
substitutes." Two of our mss. (O. Op.) read *ugrám* (or *ugram*) in  
**b**; Ppp. is defaced in **a, b**; as second half-verse it reads:  
*śataṁ sahaṣraṁ pra suvāmy anyān ayaṁ no jīvāṁ śarado vyapāye*. Here,  
too, pāda **a** is an unacknowledged *jagatī*. ⌊Comm. cites, for **c**,  
AB. vii. 15.⌋

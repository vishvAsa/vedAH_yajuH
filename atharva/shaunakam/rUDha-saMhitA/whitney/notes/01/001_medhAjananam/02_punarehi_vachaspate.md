## Translation
2. Come again, lord of speech, together with divine mind; lord of good,  
make \[it\] stay (*ni-ram*); in me, in myself be what is heard.

## Notes
Two of our mss. (H. O.) have *rāmaya* in **c.** Ppp. begins with *upa  
neha*, and has *asoṣpate* in **c,** which R. prefers. But MS. rather  
favors our text, reading, for **c, d,** *vásupate ví ramaya máyy evá  
tanvàm máma*; and it begins **a** with *upapréhi*. The comm. explains  
*śrutam* as *upādhyāyād vidhito 'dhītaṁ vedaśāstrādikam*; and adds  
"because, though well learned, it is often forgotten."

## Comment
The hymn is found also near the beginning of Pāipp. i. MS. (iv. 12. 1 end) has the first two verses. It is called in Kāuç. (7. 8; 139. 10) triṣaptīya, from its second word; but it is further styled (as prescribed in 7. 8) briefly pūrva 'first,' and generally quoted by that name. It is used in the ceremony for "production of wisdom" (medhājanana: 10. 1), and in those for the welfare of a Vedic student (11. 1); further, with various other passages, in that of entrance upon Vedic study (139. 10); and it is also referred to, in an obscure way (probably as representing the whole Veda of which it is the beginning), in a number of other rites with which it has no apparent connection (12. 10; 14. 1; 18. 19; 25. 4; 32. 28); finally (13. 1, note), it is reckoned as belonging to the varcasya gaṇa. And the comm. ⌊p. 5, end⌋ quotes it as used by a pariçiṣṭa (5. 3) in the puṣpabhiṣeka of a king. The Vāit. takes no notice of it.

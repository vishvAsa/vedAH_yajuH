## Translation
3. Honeyed (*mádhumant*) \[is\] my in-stepping, honeyed my forth-going;  
with my voice I speak what is honeyed; may I be of honey-aspect.

## Notes
*Vadāni* might be a better reading in **c**. The first half-verse  
resembles RV. x. 24. 6 **a, b** (*m. m. parā́yaṇam mádhumat púnar  
ā́yanam*). Ppp. has for second half-verse *vācā madhumad ubhyāma akṣo me  
madhusaṁdṛśī.* The comm. takes *madhu* and *saṁdṛśas* in **d** as two  
independent words.

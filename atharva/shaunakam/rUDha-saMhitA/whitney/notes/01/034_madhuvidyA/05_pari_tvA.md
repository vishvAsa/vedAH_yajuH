## Translation
5. About thee with an encompassing (*paritatnú*) sugar-cane have I gone,  
in order to absence of mutual hatred; that thou mayest be one loving me,  
that thou mayest be one not going away from me.

## Notes
The second half-verse is found repeatedly later, as ii. 30. 1 **d, e**  
and vi. 8. 1-3 **d, e.** The *pada*-reading in **d** is *ápa॰gā*, and  
the word is quoted under Prāt. iii. 34 as one of the cases of irregular  
hiatus to which the rule refers. Disregarding this, SPP. alters the  
*pada*-text to *ápa॰gāḥ*, against all our *pada*-mss. and most of his,  
for no better reason than that the comm. seems to read so. Our Bp. (both  
copies) accents here *apa॰gā́*, as also at vi. 8. 1, 3, but not at ii.  
30. 1. The comm. allows this time that the address is to a woman. ⌊Ppp.  
has for **b-d** *yakṣaṇākām avidviṣe yathā na vidvāvadvi na vibhāva kadā  
cana.* As for the rite, cf. Pāraskara's Gṛhya-sūtra, iii. 7¹, and  
Stenzler's note.⌋

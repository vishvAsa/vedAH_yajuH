## Translation
2. Rolling over our rivals, over them that are niggards to us, do thou  
trample on him who fights—on whoever abuses (*durasy-*) us.

## Notes
RV. (x. 174. 2) has in **d** *irasyáti;* Ppp., by a not infrequent  
blunder, reads *durasyatu.* Pāda **a** lacks a syllable, unless we  
resolve *-patnān* into three syllables.

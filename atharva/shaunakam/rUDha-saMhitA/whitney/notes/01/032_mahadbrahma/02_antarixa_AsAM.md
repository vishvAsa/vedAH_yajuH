title = "०२ अन्तरिक्ष आसां"

## Translation
2. In the atmosphere is the station of them, as of those sitting  
wearied; the station of this that exists (*bhūtá*): that the pious  
know—or they do not.

## Notes
'Of them' (*āsām*, fem.) in **a** the comm. explains to mean "of the  
plants," and then, alternatively, "of the waters"; doubtless the latter  
is correct, the waters being that "whereby the plants live" (1 **d**).  
Ppp. reads in **a**. *antarikṣam*, which means virtually the same as our  
text: the reservoir of the waters is the atmosphere or is in it (not in  
heaven nor earth, 1 **c**). The analogy of vii. 95. 2 suggests *gávām*  
as wanting at the beginning of **b**: the waters are ordinarily as quiet  
as cows that lie resting: a comparison from the usual Vedic source.  
Weber suggested that *sthā́ma* be read twice; and this R. favors. The  
Anukr. ignores the deficiency in the pāda. For **d**, Ppp. has *viduṣṣ  
kṛd bheṣatodanaḥ*.

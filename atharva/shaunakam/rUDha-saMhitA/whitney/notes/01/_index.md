Book I.

THE first book is made up mostly of hymns of 4 verses each, and no other
ground of its existence as a book needs to be sought. It contains 30
such hymns, but also one (34) of 5 verses, two (11 and 29) of 6 verses,
one (7) of 7, and one (3) of 9. There are conjectural reasons to be
given in more than one of these cases for the exceptional length. Hymns
of 4 verses are also found in books vi. and vii. (12 in vi., and 11 in
vii.), also 9 in xix. The whole book has been translated by Weber,
*Indische Studien*, vol. iv. (1858), pages 393-430.

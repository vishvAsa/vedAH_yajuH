## Translation
4. Within the waters is ambrosia (*amṛ́ta*), in the waters is remedy; and  
by the praises (*práśasti*) of the waters ye become vigorous (*vājín*)  
horses, ye become vigorous kine.

## Notes
The second half-verse is here rendered strictly according to the accent,  
which for­bids taking the nouns as vocatives; SPP. reads in **c**, with  
all his mss. and the great majority of ours *bhávatha* (our two Bp. give  
*bhav-*); the accent is to be regarded as antithetical. RV. gives  
*práśastaye* at end of **b**, and ends the verse with **c**, reading  
*dévā bhávata vājínaḥ*. Other texts have the verse: VS. (ix. 6 a), TS.  
(i. 7. 7¹), and MS. (i. 11. 1); all lack a fourth pāda, and have at end  
of **b** *práśastiṣu;* for **c**, VS. has áśvā bhávata vājínaḥ*, TS.*  
áśvā bhavatha vājínaḥ*, and MS.* áśvā bhavata vājínah*.*

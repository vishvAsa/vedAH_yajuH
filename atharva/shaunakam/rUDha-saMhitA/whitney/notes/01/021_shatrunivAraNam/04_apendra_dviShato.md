title = "०४ अपेन्द्र द्विषतो"

## Translation
4. Off, O Indra, the mind of the hater, off the deadly weapon of him  
that would scathe; extend great protection; keep very far off the deadly  
weapon.

## Notes
RV. reads *manyós* for *mahát* in **c**, *yavayā* for *yāv-* in **d**.  
TS. (iii. 5. 8, only **a, b**) supplies in the first half-verse the  
missing verb, *jahi*, putting it in place of *vadhám*. Unless we resolve  
*śárma* into three syllables, the *anuṣṭubh* is defective by a syllable.  
⌊Add *naḥ* after *yacha?*⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The 5 hymns of this *anuvāka* ⌊4.⌋ again have 20 verses, the norm: see  
at the conclusion of the preceding *anuvāka* (after hymn 16).

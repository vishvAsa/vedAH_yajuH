## Comment
As just pointed out (under 20. 4), this hymn and the last verse of the preceding make one hymn in RV. (x. 152) and in Pāipp. (ii.); the latter has a different verse-order (3, 2, 1, 4), but no various readings. For other correspondences, see under the several verses. For the ritual use of the hymn with the two preceding, see under 19; it is further reckoned (Kāuś. 16. 8, note) to the abhaya ('free from fear or danger') gaṇa. It is the first hymn applied (with vii. 55) in the svastyayana or 'for well-being' ceremonies (50. 1), and is, according to the comm., referred to as such in 25. 36. Verse 2 is also used, with others, by Vāit. (29. 5), in the agnicayana or building of the fire-altar.

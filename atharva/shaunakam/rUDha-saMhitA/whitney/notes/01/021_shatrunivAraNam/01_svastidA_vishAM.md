## Translation
1. Giver of well-being, lord of the people (*víś*), Vṛtra-slayer,  
remover of scorners, controlling, let the bull Indra go before us,  
soma-drinker, producing fearlessness.

## Notes
The comm. renders *vimṛdhás* by *viśeṣeṇa mardhayitā śatrūṇām*, although  
he explains *mṛ́dhas* in vss. 2, 3 by *saṁgrāmān;* the word is plainly a  
possessive compound ⌊accent! no genitive⌋, expressing in form of epithet  
the action of 2 **a** and 3 **a**. RV. reads in a *viśás pátis*. The  
verse occurs further in TB. (iii. 7. 11⁴) and TA. (x. 1. 9); both have  
*viśás*, and, in **d**, *svastidā́s* for *somapā́s*.

## Translation
3. She is thy housekeeper, O king; we commit her to thee; she shall sit  
long with the Fathers, until the covering in of her head.

## Notes
The translation of **d** implies the obvious emendation to *samopyāt*,  
which SPP. even admits into his text, on the authority of the comm., but  
against every known ms.; Ppp., however, gives *samopyā*. The comm.  
explains it by *saṁvapanāt bhūmāu sampatanāt*, and as equivalent to  
*maraņaparyantam* 'till death'; that this last is the virtual sense is  
extremely probable. That *vap* has not the sense 'shave' in the compound  
(cf. AśS. vi. 10. 2) is shown by the inappropriateness of the prefixes  
*sam* + *ā* to that sense, and the frequency of the combination in the  
other sense. ⌊See Bloomfield, 255, *ā́ śīrṣṇáḥ kéśam ópiāt*, 'till she  
shed the hair from her head.'⌋ Ppp. has further *imām u pari dadhmasi*  
in **b**. The comm. gives *kulapā* (for *-pās:* our *pada*-text  
*kula॰pā́ḥ*) in **a**. The resolution *śīr-ṣṇ-aḥ* in **d** would make the  
verse a full *anuṣṭubh;* the Anukr. counts only 14 syllables in the  
second half.

## Translation
2. Let this girl, O king, be shaken down to thee \[as\] bride, O Yama;  
be she bound in her mother's house, also in her brother's, also in her  
father's.

## Notes
Ppp. has *yat* for *eṣā* at the beginning. The comm. foolishly  
interprets *rājan* as indicating Soma, because Soma is first husband of  
a bride (he quotes RV. x. 85. 40: cf. AV. xiv. 2. 3 ff.), and takes  
*yama* as his epithet, as being her constrainer (*niyāmaka*). For  
*ni-dhū* compare iii. 11. 7; at TS. v. 2. 53 it is used with *pitṛṣu*.  
⌊Does not *ni-dhū* covertly suggest *nidhuvana*, which, in its obscene  
sense, may be as old as the Veda?⌋

## Translation
1. Out we drive (*nir-sū*) the pallid sign, out the niggard; then,  
whatever things are excellent (*bhadrá*), those we lead together (?) for  
our progeny.

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** the very venturesome emendation of  
*árātim* to *sám;* the former appears wholly impracticable, and has  
perhaps stumbled into **d** from **b**; Geldner conjectures instead  
*tvā*. Ppp. is defaced, and gives no help. The comm. reads *lakṣmam*,  
and explains *lalāmyam* as accus. sing. masc.: *lalāme bhavaṁ  
tilakasthānagatam;* to *yāni* in **c** he supplies *cihnāni* ⌊making  
**c** a separate sentence and supplying *bhavantu*⌋. It would also be  
possible to make the cesura after *prajāyāi*, and read *nāśayāmasi* (so  
R.). In our edition, dele the accent-mark under *tā-* of *tā́ni* in  
**c**.

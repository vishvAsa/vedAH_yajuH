## Translation
1. Homage be to thy lightning, homage to thy thunder; homage be to thy  
bolt (*áśman*), with which thou hurlest at the impious one (*dūḍáś*).

## Notes
The version of this verse in Ppp. xix. is like ours; in xv., **d** reads  
*yenā dūrāt pradijassasi* (*pratyasyasi?*). The first half-verse is  
found also in VS. (xxxvi. 21 a, b). The irregular combination *dūḍā́śe*  
(p. *duḥ॰dā́śe*) is noted by Prāt. ii. 60. The comm. regards Parjanya as  
addressed, but then proceeds to give another interpretation of the  
verse, based on the absurd assumption that *namas = annam*, which  
appears also in numerous other places. To him, also, *áśman* is a  
*meghanāman*. In our edition, an accent-mark is omitted over the *-śma-*  
of *áśmane*.

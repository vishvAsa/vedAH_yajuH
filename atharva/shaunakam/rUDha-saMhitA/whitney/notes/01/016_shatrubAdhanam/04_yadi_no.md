## Translation
4. If our cow thou slayest, if \[our\] horse, if \[our\] man  
(*púruṣa*), we pierce thee there with lead, that thou be no slayer of  
our heroes.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **c** *sīsena vidhyāmas tvā*.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The 5 hymns of this *anuvāka* ⌊3.⌋, as of the next, have just the norm,  
20 verses, and the quotation from the old Anukr. (given at the end of  
hymn 21) is *viṅśakāv ato 'nyāu*. At the end of the present hymn is read  
*viṅśatyā kuru*, which is perhaps the statement as to the assumption of  
a norm.  
  
The first *prapāṭhaka* ends here.

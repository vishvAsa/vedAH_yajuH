## Comment
Found in Pāipp. i. Kāuś. does not include the hymn among the cātanāni (8. 25), but a Pariś. (ib., note) reckons it to them (in accordance with the Anukr.). Kāuś. (47. 23) uses it once in a rite of sorcery (for the death of one's enemies: comm.), and its commentator (47. 13, note) in another.


## Translations
Translated: Weber, iv. 409; Grill, 1, 75; Griffith, 1. 20; Bloomfield, 65, 256.

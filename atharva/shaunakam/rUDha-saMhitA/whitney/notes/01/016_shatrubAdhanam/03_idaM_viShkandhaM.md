## Translation
3. This overpowers the *víṣkandha;* this drives off (*bādh*) the  
devourers; with this I overpower all the races (*jātá*) that are the  
piśācī́'s.

## Notes
The first half-verse is nearly repeated below, as ii. 4. 3 **a, b**. The  
short *a* in the reduplication of *sasahe* in **c**, though against the  
meter and in part against usage, is read by all the mss., and in the  
comment to Prāt. iii. 13. Ppp. has in **a** *viṣkandam* (but compare ii.  
4. 3, where *-dham*). The comm. explains the (more or less fully  
personified) disorder as a disturbance caused by *rakṣas* or *piśāca*  
and obstructing motion (*gatipratibandhaka*): cf. below ii. 4 and iii.  
9.

## Translation
2. The lead Varuṇa blesses; the lead Agni favors; Indra bestowed on me  
the lead; it, surely, is a dispeller of familiar demons.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *māi 'ndra p-* in **c**, and has for **d** *amīvāyas tu  
cātam* (for *cātanam*). The comm. ascribes the mention of Varuṇa to the  
fact that river-foam is one of the articles declared (Kāuś. 8. 18)  
equivalent to lead, and here intended by that name. ⌊Cf. Bloomfield,  
JAOS. xv. 158.⌋

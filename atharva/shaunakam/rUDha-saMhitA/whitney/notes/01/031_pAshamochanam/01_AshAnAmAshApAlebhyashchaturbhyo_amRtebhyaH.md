## Translation
1. To the four immortal region-guardians of the regions (*áśā*), to the  
overseers of existence (*bhūtá*), would we now pay worship (*vidh*) with  
oblation.

## Notes
The verse occurs also in TB. (ii. 5. 3³) and AśS. (ii. 10. 18): in the  
latter, without variants; TB. inserts *tvā* after *ā́śānām* in **a**. The  
comm. paraphrases *āśās* by *prācyādidiśas,* which is plainly its  
meaning here.

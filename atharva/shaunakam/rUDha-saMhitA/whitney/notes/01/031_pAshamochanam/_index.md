Found in Pāipp. i. The hymn is called in Kāuś. (38. 11) āśāpālīyam, and is also reckoned by the schol. (8. 23, note) to the vāstoṣpatīyāni or vāstu gaṇa. It is used with xii. 1 in the ceremony (38. 16) for establishing a house, and again, except vs. 3, as dṛṅhaṇāni 'establishers' in a like rite (38. 11); it appears in one of the sava-sacrifices (64. 1) with an offering of four dishes (catuḥśarāva), and in the portent ceremony (127. 6) against obscuration of the "Seven Sages" (the Dipper, or Charles's Wain) by a comet. Verse 2 (32. 27, note; but the comm. says instead vs. 1, quoting its pratika) is reckoned among the aṅholin̄gās, and applied in rites for healing, security, long life, etc.; and vs. 4 (50. 11) in one for good fortune in the night. In Vāit. (36. 20) the hymn (as āśāpālīya) accompanies in the aśvamedha the turning loose of the sacrificial horse. And the comm. quotes it as used in Nakṣ. Kalpa 14 in the adbhuta mahāśanti.

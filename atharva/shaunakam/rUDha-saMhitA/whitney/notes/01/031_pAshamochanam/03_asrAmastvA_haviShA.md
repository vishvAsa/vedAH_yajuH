## Translation
3. Unlamed I sacrifice to thee with oblation; unmaimed I make oblation  
to thee with ghee; the god that is fourth region-guardian of the  
regions, he shall bring hither to us welfare (*subhūtá*).

## Notes
At the beginning, *áśrāmas* is read by half the mss. (including our E.  
I. O. Op. K. Kp.) and by the comm.; SPP. gives *ásr-* in his text, as we  
in ours. *Aślonas* in **b** in our edition is an erratum for *áśloṇas,*  
Ppp. has for **a, b** *aśroṇas te haviṣā vidhema maśrāmas te ghṛt-;* the  
comm. also reads *aśroṇas.* Ppp. gives *turyas* in **c**: the word  
perhaps means simply '\[any\] one of the four.' The Anukr. appears not  
to sanction the resolutions to *tu-ā* which would fill out **a** and  
**b**. The *pada*-mss. mark the division between **c** and **d** after  
*devas,* as the sense, but not the meter, demands.

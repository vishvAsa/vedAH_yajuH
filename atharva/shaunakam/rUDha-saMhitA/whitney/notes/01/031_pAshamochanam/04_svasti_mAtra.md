## Translation
4. Well-being (*svastí*) be to our mother and father, well-being to  
kine, to creatures (*jágat*), to men (*púruṣa*); all welfare \[and\]  
beneficence (? *suvidátra*) be ours; long may we see the sun.

## Notes
For *jagate* in **b** Ppp- has *uta,* with manifest advantage to both  
meter and sense; and it reads *pū́ruṣebhyas* (with our H.s. m.), and in  
**d** *dṛśeva.* Many of the *saṁhitā-*mss. (including our H. K.) give  
*ṇo* after *pitré* in **a**. The comm. gives three different  
interpretations (taking it always, however, from *vid* and not from  
*dā*) for the ambiguous *suvidátra*. The Anukr. appears to read *no  
'stu* in **c**, and *ji-óg* and *sū́-ri-am* in **d** ⌊rather, *jyóg* and  
*sū́ryam*, so as to make 11 + 11: 11 + 8?⌋. ⌊As *jagat*, see Zimmer, p.  
150.⌋

## Translation
4. As between both heaven and earth stands the bamboo (? *téjana*), so  
let the reed-stalk (*múñja*) stand between both the disease and the flux  
(*āsrāvá*).

## Notes
The verse seems unconnected with the rest of the hymn, but to belong  
rather with hymn 3. The comm. glosses *tejana* with *veṇu*. For  
*āsrāva*, cf. ii. 3; vi. 44. 2; the comm. explains it here by  
mūtrātīsāra 'difficulty (?) of urinating' or 'painful urination'  
⌊'diabetes,' rather?⌋. Bloomfield understands it to mean "diarrœa," and  
bases upon this questionable interpretation his view of the meaning of  
the whole hymn, which he entitles "formula against diarrhœa."

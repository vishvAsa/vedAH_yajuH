## Comment
The translation implies emendation in b to vātābhrajás or -jā́s, as suggested by 3 c; it is proposed by Weber, and adopted by Bloomfield, being a fairly plausible way of getting out of a decided difficulty. Weber renders, however, "with glowing wind-breath"; R., "with scorching wind" (emending to -bhrajjās). The comm. reads vātavrajās (a couple of SPP's mss., which usually follow him, do the same), and explains it as "going swiftly like the wind," or, alternatively, "having a collection of winds." The 'bull' is to him the sun, and he forces this interpretation through the whole hymn. Neither he nor Kāuç. nor the latter's scholia see anywhere any intimation of lightning; yet this is perhaps most plausibly to be suspected in the obscurities of the expression (so R. also). The first words in a are viewed as signifying 'just escaped from its fœtal envelop (in the cloud).' Ppp. is wholly defaced in the second half-verse; in the first it offers no variants, merely combining -jaṣ prath- in a, and reading -bhraja st- in b. Emendation in d to yásyāí' kam would improve both meter and sense. Tredhā́ in d must be read as three syllables (as in RV.) to make the verse a full jagatī. ⌊At OB. vi. 59 b, vā́ta-dhrajās is suggested—by R.?⌋

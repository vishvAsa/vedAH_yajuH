## Translation
3. Ye, O gods, that are in the heaven, that are on earth, that are in  
the atmosphere, in the herbs, in the cattle, within the waters—do ye  
make old age the length of life for this man; let him avoid the hundred  
other deaths.

## Notes
The intrusion of *paśúṣu* and *apsú* in **b** spoils the meter ⌊or we  
may read *yé 'ntárikṣa óṣadīṣv apsú antáḥ*⌋; Ppp., omitting *paśúṣu* and  
*antár*, makes it good. The Anukr. requires us to scan the pāda as of 14  
syllables. Prāt. ii. 101 notes the lingualization in forms of *as* after  
*divi*, and the comment cites this passage (**a**) as example. The comm.  
has in **d** *vṛṇakta,* and renders it as causative. ⌊As to 101 deaths,  
see Zimmer, p. 400.⌋

## Comment
Found in Pāipp. i., but damaged and only in part legible. The hymn belongs, according to the comm., to the āyuṣya ('for length of life') gaṇa, although not found among those mentioned (Kāuś. 54. 11, note) as composing that gaṇa; it is used in ceremonies for long life by 52. 18 and 59. 1; also, with i. 9 and other hymns, in the reception of a Vedic student (55.17), and in dismissal from Vedic study (139. 15). And vss. 3, 4 appear in Vāit. (4. 4, 15) in connection with different parts of the parvan-sacrifices. The comm. further quotes it from Nakṣ. Kalpa 17 and 18 in two mahāśānti rites, styled āirāvatī and vāiśvadevī, and from Pariśiṣṭa 5. 4, in the puṣpābhiṣeka ceremony.

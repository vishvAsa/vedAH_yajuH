## Comment
Found in Pāipp. i. (in the verse-order 1, 4, 3, 2). Used by Kāuç. only in a general rite for prosperity (19. 4), to accompany a douche for persons bringing water from two navigable streams and partaking of a dish of mixed grain; it is also reckoned (19. 1, note) to the puṣṭika mantras, or hymns bringing prosperity.

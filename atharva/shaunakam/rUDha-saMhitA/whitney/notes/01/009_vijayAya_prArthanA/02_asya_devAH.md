## Translation
2.. At his direction (*pradiś*), O gods, be there light, sun, fire, or  
also gold; be his rivals (*sapátna*) inferior to him; to the highest  
firmament (*nā́ka*) make this man ascend.

## Notes
The translation implies in **c** the obviously called-for emendation of  
*asmát* to *asmāt;* the comm. first explains it as *asmadiyāt puruṣāt*,  
and then, alternatively, as used for *asmāt* by Vedic shortening of the  
vowel. Ppp. begins with *asmin devāḥ pradiśā;* and its second half-verse  
is quite different: *uttareṇa brahmaṇā vi bhāhi kṛṇvāno anyān adharān  
sapatnān* (**d** = ii. 29. 3 **d**).

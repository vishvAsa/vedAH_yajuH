## Comment
Found in Pāipp. xix. (in the verse-order 3, 4, 1, 2). Used once by Kāuç. (26. 10: the quotation appears to belong to what follows it, not to what precedes), in a remedial rite, apparently for stopping the flow of blood (the comm. says, as result of a knife wound and the like, and also of disordered menses).

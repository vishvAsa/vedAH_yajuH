## Translation
3. Uniform by name is thy mother; uniform by name is thy father;  
uniform-making art thou, O herb; ⌊so⌋ do thou make this uniform.

## Notes
Found also, as noted above, in TB. (ii. 4. 4²), which has for **c**  
*sarūpā 'sy oṣadhe*. Ppp. reads throughout *surūp-*. It inserts between  
this verse and the next: *yat tanūjaṁ yad agnijaṁ citra kilāsa jajñiṣe:  
tad astu sukṛtas tanvo yatas tvā 'pi nayāmasi.*

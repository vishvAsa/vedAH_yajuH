## Translation
2. Four \[are\] the directions of the sky, four also of the earth: the  
gods sent together the fœtus; let them unclose her in order to birth.

## Notes
Or 'unclose it,' *tám*, which SPP. reads in text and comm. (the latter  
omits the word itself in the paraphrase) with the minority of his mss.,  
but against all of ours; Weber and Roth prefer *tám*. The word and its  
predecessor are quoted in the Prāt, (ii. 30), as the earliest example in  
the text of a combination of *n* and *t* without inserted *s*; but the  
form of the quotation (*samāirayantādinām*) prevents our seeing whether  
its authors read *tā́m* or *tám;* the comm. gives *tām*. In **d**, the  
comm. gives the false form *ūrṇavantu*. The text in Ppp. is confused,  
but does not appear to intend any variants from our reading.

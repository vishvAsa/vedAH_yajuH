## Comment
Verses 2-4 occur together in Pāipp. i., 5 and 6 in xx., but at different points. In Kāuś. (33. 1) it is quoted at the beginning of a long and intricate ceremony (filling the whole section) for safe delivery, the first of the strīkarmāṇi or 'women's rites'; its details have nothing to do with the text of the hymn, and cast no light upon the latter's difficulties. The Anukr. add to the author's name: anena mantroktān aryamādidevān nārīsukhaprasavāyā 'bhiṣṭūye 'ṣṭaṁ ca sarvābhir aprārthayat.

## Translation
5. I split apart thy urinator, apart the *yóni*, apart the \[two\]  
groins, apart both the mother and the child, apart the boy from the  
afterbirth; let the afterbirth descend.

## Notes
Ppp. (xx.) has for **a, b** *vi te cṛtāmi tagariṁ v' yoni vi gavenyāu;*  
for **d**, *vi garbhaṁ ca jarāyujaḥ;* and TS. (iii. 3-10¹) presents a  
version nearly accordant with this, but with *takarī́m, gavīnyāù*, and  
(at the end) *jarā́yu ca:* neither has our refrain.

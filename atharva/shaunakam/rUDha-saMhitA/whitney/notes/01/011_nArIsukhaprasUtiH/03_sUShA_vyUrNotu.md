## Translation
3. Let Pūshan (?) unclose \[her or it\]; we make the *yóni* go apart; do  
thou, *sūṣaṇā*, loosen; do thou, *biṣkalā*, let go.

## Notes
The translation implies a very venturesome emendation in **a**, *pūṣā́*  
for *sūṣā́* (all the authorities have the latter): Pūshan, referred to in  
vs. 1 as principal officiating deity, might well be called on to do in  
particular what all the gods were begged to do in vs. 2 **c, d**. ⌊But  
see Bloomfield's comment.⌋ The comm. gives three different etymologies  
for *sūṣā:* root *sū* + suffix *-sā;* root *sū* + root *san;* and  
*su-uṣas*. *Sūṣaṇā* and *biṣkalā* are possibly names of organs; for the  
latter, Ppp. has *puṣkale*, probably an alteration to a more familiar  
word; the comm. understands *sūṣaṇi* and *biṣkali* (of course, equally  
possible); the former, from roots *sū* and *san*, is name of an  
accouching goddess; the latter (for which are given three diverse but  
equally absurd etymologies) is another deity. The Anukr. apparently  
intends the verse to be read as 6 + 8: 7 + 8 = 29, instead of admitting  
the obvious resolution *tu-ám* in **c**. The supplying of *gárbham* as  
omitted at the beginning would make a good *anuṣṭubh*.

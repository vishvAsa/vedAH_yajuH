## Translation
6. As the wind, as the mind, as fly the birds, so do thou, O ten months'  
\[child\], fly along with the afterbirth; let the afterbirth descend.

## Notes
Ppp. has the version *yathā vāto yathā dagha yathā saṣadroyajanta: evā  
te garbha ejatu nir āitu daśamāsyo bahir jarāyuṇā saha*. For 'do thou  
fly' might be given 'do thou fall,' the verb having both meanings. ⌊Ten  
(lunar) months: cf. Weber's second *nakṣatra*-essay, p. 313, *Abh. der  
Berliner Akad.*, 1861.⌋ ⌊Cf. RV. v. 78.8.⌋  
  
    
This *anuvāka* ⌊2.⌋ has 5 hymns, 25 verses; and the old Anukramaṇī, as  
quoted, says *pañca pare tu* (apparently the *vidyāt* quoted at the end  
of *an.* 1 belongs rather here than there).

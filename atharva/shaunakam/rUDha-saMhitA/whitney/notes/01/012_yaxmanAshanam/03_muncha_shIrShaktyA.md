## Translation
3. Release thou him from headache and from cough—whoever hath entered  
each joint of him; the blast (? *śúṣma*) that is cloud-born and that is  
wind-born, let it attach itself to forest-trees (*vánaspáti*) and  
mountains.

## Notes
Ppp. has *sṛjatām* for *sacatām* in **d**. The comm. takes *kāsás* in  
**a** as nomin., explaining it as *hṛtkaṇṭhamadhyavartī prasiddhaḥ  
śleṣmarogaviśeṣaḥ; vātajā́s* to him is *kāuṣṭhyād vāyor utpannaḥ.* ⌊For  
*śīrṣakti*, see Knauer, *Indogermanische Forschungen, Anzeiger*, vii.  
225; Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 416; Böhtlingk, *Berichte der sächsischen  
Ges.*, 1897, xlix. 50, who takes it as 'a stiff neck with head awry.'⌋

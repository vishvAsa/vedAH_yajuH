## Translation
2. Thee, lurking (*śri*) in each limb with burning (*śocís*), we, paying  
homage, would worship (*vidh*) with oblation; we would worship with  
oblation the hooks, the grapples, \[him\] who, a seizer, hath seized  
this man's joints.

## Notes
Or *yás*, at beginning of **d**, is abbreviation for 'when he' or 'with  
which he.' ⌊Render, rather, 'hath seized his (accentless) joints.' The  
patient is in plain sight of the exorcist. Emphatic pronoun is therefore  
needless; so *enam* vs. 3.⌋ Some of our mss., by a frequent blunder,  
read in **a** *śiśṛy-*. The prolongation of the final of *asya* in **d**  
is noted by the comment to Prāt. iv. 79. Ppp. has a very different (and  
corrupt) text:...*śiśriyāno yo gṛhīta parasya gṛbhīti: an̄ko tam an̄ko  
haviṣā yajāmi hṛdi śrito manasā yo jajāna.* The definition of this verse  
and the next as *triṣṭubh* seems to have been lost from the Anukr.,  
which reads simply *dvitīyā* before *antyā 'nuṣṭubh.*

## Translation
3. Of the hundred tubes, of the thousand veins, have stopped forsooth  
these midmost ones; the ends have rested (*ram*) together.

## Notes
In **d**, emendation to *ántyās* 'the end ones' would be an improvement;  
but Ppp. also has *antās: sakam antā 'raṁsata;* its **c** is corrupt  
(*asthū nibaddhāmāvā*); and it inserts *te* after *śatasya* in **a**.

## Translation
1. Yonder on the further shore are she-adders, thrice seven, out of  
their sloughs (*-jarā́yu*); with the sloughs of them do we wrap up (*ápi  
vyā*) the (two) eyes of the malignant waylayer.

## Notes
*Jarā́yu* in the sense 'cast-off skin of a snake' appears to be quotable  
only here; the comm. regards the word as so applied by a figure:  
*jarāyuvat śarīrasya veṣṭakās tvacaḥ.* Ppp. reads *imāṣ pāre* in **a**,  
and *jarjarāyuvaḥ* in **b**; the comm. has instead *nirjarā iva*,  
explaining as *jarārahita devā iva.*

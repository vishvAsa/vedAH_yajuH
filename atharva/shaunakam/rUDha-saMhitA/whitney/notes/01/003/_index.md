title = "3. Against obstruction of urine: with a reed."

## Comment
Of this hymn, only vss. 7-8 are found in Pāipp. (in xix.), without the refrain. It is doubtless intended at Kāuç. 25. 10, as used in a rite for regulating the flow of urine; vss. 8-9 are specified in 25. 12. The "reed" implies some primitive form of a fistula urinaria, the vastiyantra (one of the nāḍiyantrāṇi) of the later physicians—who, however, do not appear to have made frequent use of it.

## Comment
Found in Pāipp. xix., but vss. 3-4 elsewhere than 1-2. The hymn appears to be called (so schol. and the comm.) apanodanāni 'thrusters away' in Kāuś. (14. 14), and quoted and used as such in 25. 22 and (with iv. 33) in 42. 22; it is further applied (with 27 and vi. 3, 76) at the beginning of the svastyayana rites, on going to bed and getting up again (50. 4), and (with i. 13 and other hymns) in the rite of entrance on Vedic study (139. 8).

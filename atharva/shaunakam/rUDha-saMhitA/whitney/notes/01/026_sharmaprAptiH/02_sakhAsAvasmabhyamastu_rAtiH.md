## Translation
2. Be yon Rāti ('liberality') a companion (*sákhi*) for us; a companion  
\[be\] Indra, Bhaga, Savitar of wondrous favors.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
*Rātí* stems to be made a personification here, as in iii. 8. 2 and vii.  
17. 4 below; the comm. makes it equal to Mitra or Sūrya. Ppp. has a very  
different text: *sakhe 'va no rātir astu sakhe 'ndras sakhā savitā:  
sakhā bhagas satyadharmā no 'stu;* which is better as regards both sense  
and meter. The *tripadā* of the Anukr. is probably a misreading for  
*dvipadā;* the mss. agree with it in using no *avasāna*-sign in the  
verse, and SPP. very properly follows them; the *pada*-mss. mark a  
cesura after *rātiḥ.* The comm. makes *citrarādhās* = *bahuvidhaṁ dhanaṁ  
yasya.*

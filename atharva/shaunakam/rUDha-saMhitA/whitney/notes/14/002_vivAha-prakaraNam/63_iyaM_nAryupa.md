## Translation
63. This woman, scattering shrivelled grains (*pū́lya*) appeals: be my  
husband long-lived; may he live a hundred autumns.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **b** *pūlpāni* ⌊instead of our *pū́lyani*. For the  
distinction between *lpa* and *lya* (note to vi. 127. 1), *nāgarī* mss.  
are of course not to be trusted. All but one of SPP's read *pū́lpāni* and  
his two then living *śrotriyas* recited *pū́lpāni*. But in view of the  
Prākrit *pulla* etc. he reads *pū́lyāni*.⌋ Instead of our **d**, Ppp.  
reads *edhantāṁ pitaro mama*. The same verse is found in several Sūtras:  
PGS. (i. 6. 2), HGS. (i. 20. 4), MB. (i. 2. 2), and the Āpast. text  
(Wint., p. 56 ⌊MP. i. 5. 2⌋); but with sundry various readings in **b**  
and **d**: for *pūlyāni*, the Āpast. text has *gúlpāni* ⌊Oxford ed.  
*kúlpāni*⌋, and PGS. *lājān*, while HGS. and MB. give for the whole pāda  
*‘gnāu lājān āvapantī;* in **d** the Āpast. text reads *jī́vātu*, and the  
other three (nearly agreeing with Ppp.) for the whole pāda *edhantāṁ  
jñātayo mama;* MB., moreover, inserts between **c** and **d** *śataṁ  
varṣāṇi jīvatu*. ⌊PGS. has in **c** *āyuṣmān* for *dīrghā́yus*.⌋ ⌊Cf.  
MGS. i. 11. 12 d, and p. 148.⌋ According to Kāuś. 76. 17, the verse is  
repeated while the bride stands firm upon the stone and scatters the  
grains. ⌊For *āvapantikā́*, cf. ii. 3. 1; iv. 37. 10; v. 13. 9 and  
notes.⌋

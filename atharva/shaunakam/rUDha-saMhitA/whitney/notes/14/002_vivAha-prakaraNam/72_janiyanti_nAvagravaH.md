## Translation
72. The unmarried of us seek a wife, the liberal seek a son; may we  
(two), with uninjured life-breath, be companions (*sac*), in order to  
what is great, to winning of strength (? *vā́ja-*).

## Notes
'Of us' in **a** is dual (*nāu*) in the text, but requires, doubtless,  
emendation to *nas* or to *nú*. The corresponding half-verse in RV.  
(vii. 96. 4 **a, b**) has *nú;* it reads *janīyárito nv ágravaḥ  
putrīyántaḥ s-*. That our denominatives have a right to their short *i*  
is further vouched for by their quotation as examples for it under Prāt.  
iii. 18. Whether one should emend in **d** to *bṛhatyāi*, or translate  
as is done above, may be made a question; it seems most likely to be a  
mixed construction, meaning virtually 'in order to the gaining of great  
*vāja*.' *Vā́jasātaye* is never joined with an adjective in RV. Ppp.  
reads with our text throughout.

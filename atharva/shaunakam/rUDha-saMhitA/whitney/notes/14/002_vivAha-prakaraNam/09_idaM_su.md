## Translation
9. Pray hear ye now of me, O men, by what blessing (*āśís*) the two  
spouses attain what is agreeable (*vāmá*): what Gandharvas \[there are\]  
and heavenly Apsarases, who stand upon these forest trees  
(*vānaspatyá*), let them be pleasant unto this bride; let them not  
injure the bridal-car as it is driven.

## Notes
The last four padas form a verse also in the Āpast. text (Wint., p. 70  
⌊MP. i. 7. 8⌋), where for our **d** is read *eṣú vṛkṣéṣu vānaspatyéṣv  
ā́sate*, further *śivā́s* (for *syonā́s*) and *vadhvāì* in **e**, and  
*ūhyámānām* in **f**. In TS. iii. 2. 8⁴ is found the phrase *yám āśírā  
dámpatī vāmám aśnutáḥ*, and *āśīrdāyā́ dámpatī vāmám aśnutām*. The verse  
is to be used, according to Kāuś. 77. 9, when the bridal train passes  
great trees. The Anukr. ⌊appears to scan as 9 + 12: 11 + 12: 11 + 11 =  
66; but pāda **a** is essentially defective⌋. All our mss. ⌊and SPP's  
authorities⌋ read in **e** *te*, which our edition emends to *té;* ⌊but  
SPP. reads *te*, construing **a-d** together, and **e-f** separately:  
'unto thee, the bride here'; which seems hard⌋. Ppp. combines in **c**  
*gandharvā ’ps-*.

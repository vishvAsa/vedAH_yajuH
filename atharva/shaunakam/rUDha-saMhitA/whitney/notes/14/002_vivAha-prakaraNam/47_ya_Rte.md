## Translation
47. He who, without a clamp (? *abhiśríṣ*), before the piercing of the  
neck-ropes (? *jatrú*), combines (*sam-dhā*) a combination—he the  
bountiful, the one of much good—removes again what is spoiled  
(*víhruta*).

## Notes
⌊Or 'joins a joining' and 'mends again what is damaged,' as W. suggests  
in pencil.⌋ This obscure verse is RV. viii. 1 . 12, and is found also in  
several other texts, as SV. (i. 244), MS. (iv. 9. 12), TA. (iv. 20. 1),  
PB. (ix. 10. 1), KśS. xxv. 5. 30. The RV. text differs from ours only by  
having in **d** *íṣkartā* for *níṣk-*; KśS. alone agrees with RV. in  
this; SV. is throughout as AV.; PB. begins *yakṣate cid*, and has  
*vihṛtam* **d**; TA. begins *yád ṛté*, has *jartṛ́bhyas* in **b**,  
*purovásus* in **c**, ⌊and *víhṛtam* in **d** in the Calcutta ed.: the  
Poona ed., p. 327, prints it *víhrutam*, with a *virāma* after the  
*h*!⌋. MS. has a very corrupt text for **a, b** (*jári cétī́d* etc.), and  
*saṁdhís* and *puruv-* in **c**; and the Āpast. text (Wint., p. 69 ⌊MP.  
i. 7. 1⌋) agrees throughout with TA. Ppp. writes *āṛdaḥ* for *ātṛdaḥ*.  
The needed description of the verse as a *pathyābṛhatī* is omitted by  
our Anukr. Vāit. 12. 7 has the verse used as expiation when anything is  
broken during the sacrifice; Kāuś. 77. 7, when anything on the bridal  
car needs mending; and also, 57. 7, when a student's staff is broken.

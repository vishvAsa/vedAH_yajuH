## Translation
12. I cause the bridal-car to be viewed by the houses with worship  
(*bráhman*), with a friendly, not terrible eye; what of all forms is  
fastened on about, let Savitar make that pleasant for the husbands.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *kṛṇotu tat*. According to Kāuś. 77. 14, the verse  
is uttered when the train comes in sight of the house. Āpast. vi. 6  
(Wint., p. 70 ⌊MP. i. 7. 10⌋) has the same verse, with the variants  
*māítreṇa* in **b**, *asyā́m* for *ásti* in **c**, and (like Ppp.)  
*kṛṇotu tát* at the end. The comm. to Āpast. understands **c** of the  
ornaments worn by the bride, as indicated by the reading *asyā́m*. The  
verse (13 + 11: 11 + 12 = 47) is but a poor *jagatī*.

## Translation
28. Of excellent omen is this bride; come together, see her; having  
given unto her good-fortune, go asunder and away with ill-fortunes.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 33, which, however, has a different ending:  
*asyāi dattvā́yā ’thā́ ’staṁ ví páre ’tana;* and this is read also by PGS.  
(i. 8. 9) and MB. (i. 2. 14). ⌊Cf. MP. i. 9. 5; Wint., p. 74; MGS. i.  
12. 1, and p. 157.⌋ According to Kāuś. 77. 10, it is to be addressed to  
women who come to look at the bride on her journey. Ppp. reads in **d**  
*dāurbhāgyena par-*. Our edition should read *dattvā́*.

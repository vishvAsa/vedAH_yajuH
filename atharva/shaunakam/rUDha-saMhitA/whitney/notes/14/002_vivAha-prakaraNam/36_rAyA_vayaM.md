## Translation
36. With wealth may we be well-willing; we have made the Gandharva go  
(*vṛt*) up from here; that god hath gone to the highest station  
(*sadhástha*); we have gone where they lengthen out \[their\] life-time.

## Notes
The prefix *ā́* in **b** seems out of place. The last pāda appears twice  
in RV. (i. 113. 16 **d**; viii. 48. 11 **d**). The definition of the  
verse (as noted under vs. 34) appears to be omitted in the Anukr. For  
the application made in Kāuś. of this and the preceding verses, see  
under vs. 32; it does not seem at all suitable. Ppp. has in **d** for  
*yatra* the variant *vayam* ⌊implying, perhaps, that the Kashmir  
Vāidikas understood *pratiránta* (p. pra॰tiránte) as *pratirántas*.  
⌊With regard to an Anukr. statement that seems to concern this verse,  
see above, p. 739, ¶'s 4, 5, 7.⌋  
  
⌊Cf. xviii. 2. 29 n.⌋

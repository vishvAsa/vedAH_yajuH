## Translation
14. \[As\] a soulful cultivated field hath this woman come; in her  
here, O men, scatter ye seed; she shall give birth to progeny for you  
from her belly (*vakṣáṇās*), bearing the exuded (*dugdhá*) sperm of the  
male (*ṛṣabhá*).

## Notes
A couple of our mss. (⌊E.⌋D.) read *asyā́m* in **c**. The first pāda is  
capable of being compressed into 11 syllables, but with violence. Ppp.  
has for **b** *yasyān naro vapanta bījam asyāḥ*, and in **c** *janayāt*.  
  
⌊The likening of the woman to the field is very familiar later: cf. Manu  
ix. 33 f. Cf. also the  
  
ματρὸς ἄρουραν Aeschylus (Septem, 753); Sophocles' ἀρώσιμοι γὰρ χἁτέρων  
εἰσὶν γύαι (Ant., 569); Eurip. Phoen. 18; etc. My colleague, Professor  
George F. Moore, calls my attention to Koran ii. 22, "Your women are  
your plow-land," in Arabic, *ḥarth*.—Griffith's (not very close) version  
suggests a different interpretation: he takes *dugdhám* as 'milk' of the  
maternal breast. Perhaps after all we should (with W.) join it with  
*rétas*, and in the sense of 'milked'; but with this difference, that it  
refers to the *rétas* which is "milked" as a result of the action  
implied in páso ní galgalīti dhā́rakā at VS. xxiii. 22. Mahīdhara says  
*vīryaṁ kṣarati* (cf. *kṣīram*).—This interpretation is fortified by the  
use of *dhayati* at RV. i. 179. 4, *Lópāmudrā vṛ́ṣaṇaṁ (nadáṁ) dhayati  
śvasántam*.⌋

title = "३२ देवा अग्रे"

## Translation
32. The gods in the beginning lay with (*ni-pad*) their spouses; they  
embraced (*sam-spṛś*) bodies with bodies; like Sūryā, O woman,  
all-formed, with greatness, having progeny, unite (*sam-bhū*) here with  
thy husband.

## Notes
Ppp. combines at the beginning *devā ’gre*. The verse (11 + 11: 12 + 11  
= 45) is almost a good *triṣṭubh*, in spite of the Anukr. ⌊It would be a  
perfect *triṣṭubh* in cadence and otherwise if we had the right to  
excise *nāri*, the intrusive character of which is very likely.⌋ It is  
used in Kāuś. 79. 6 when the bride enters the nuptial bed; and also, in  
75. 11, vss. 32-36 are strangely made to accompany the strewing of  
grasses by the wooers who have gone out to arrange for the bridal.

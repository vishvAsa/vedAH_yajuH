## Translation
5. Your favor hath come, O ye (two) of abundant good things (?  
*vājínīvasu*); \[our\] desires have rested in \[your\] hearts, O Aśvins;  
ye have been twin keepers, O lords of beauty; may we, being dear, attain  
favorers (*aryamán*) of our homes (? *dúrya*).

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 40. 12, RV., however, reading *ayaṅsata* at end of  
**b**. ⌊MP. i. 7. 11 follows the RV. text, but with *kāmāṅ* for *kāmās:*  
cf. Wint., p. 70.⌋ More points than one in the translation are doubtful.

title = "४६ सूर्यायै देवेभ्यो"

## Translation
46. Unto Sūryā, unto the gods, unto Mitra and Varuṇa, unto them who are  
forethoughtful of that which exists, have I paid this homage.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 17, with a differently ordered **d**, *idáṁ  
tébhyo ‘karaṁ námaḥ*, by which is avoided the redundancy of a  
syllable—which the Anukr. passes unheeded. ⌊Ppp. avoids it in yet  
another way by reading *tebhyo ‘ham akaraṁ namaḥ*. Kāuś. uses it twice  
in 77; once in 5, on the wedding-journey; and again in 23, on arrival at  
the new home. ⌊As to the "deity." of the verse, see above, p. 739, ¶'s  
4, 5, 7.⌋

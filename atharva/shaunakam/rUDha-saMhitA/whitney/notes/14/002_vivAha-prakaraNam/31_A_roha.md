## Translation
31. Mount the couch with favoring mind; here give birth to progeny for  
this husband; like Indrāṇī, waking with good awakening, mayest thou  
watch to meet dawns tipped with light.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *suptā* for *subúdhā*, of which the stem and sense  
are questionable (it occurs elsewhere only in vs. 75, below); at the end  
it has *cākaraḥ* (for *jāgaraḥ*). ⌊Cf. Wint, p. 92.⌋ The excess of  
syllables in **d** is a very poor reason for calling the verse (11 + 11:  
11 + 13 = 46) a *jagatī*. In Kāuś. 76. 25 the verse is used, with 1. 60,  
when the bride mounts the couch; and again, 79. 4, when she ascends the  
nuptial bed (vs. 23 immediately follows: see above).

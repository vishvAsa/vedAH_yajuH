## Translation
18. Not brother-in-law-slaying, not husband-slaying be thou here,  
propitious to the cattle, of easy control, very splendid, having  
progeny, hero-bearing, loving brothers-in-law (?), pleasant, do thou  
worship (*sapary*) this householder's fire.

## Notes
Our mss. differ, as in the preceding verse, between *devṛ́kāmā* and  
*devák-* in **c**. The first three pādas agree nearly with RV. x. 85. 44  
**a-c**, but the latter begins **a** with *ághoracakṣus* (like our 17  
**a**) ⌊and omits *ihá*⌋, reads *sumánās* instead of *suyámā* in **b**,  
and in **c** omits *prajā́vatī* and gives *devákāmā;* its fourth pāda is  
the commonplace phrase *śáṁ no bhava dvipáde śáṁ cátuṣpade*. Ppp. reads  
for **a, b**: *adevaraghni patiraghny edhi syonaṣ paśubhyas sumanas  
suvīraḥ;* and, for **c, d** (given, as noted above, as second half of  
the preceding verse): *prajāvatī vīrasūr devṛkāme ’mam agn-* etc.; it  
thus gets rid of the *syonā* whose apparent intrusion spoils the  
*triṣṭubh*-character of our **c, d**. ⌊The ms. reckons *syonā́* to **d**  
(by placing the mark of pāda-division before it); but the integrity of  
*imám* etc. as a pāda (without *syonā́*) is palpable. Likely our text  
represents a blend of two readings: *vīrasū́ur devákāmā sionā́* (RV.), and  
*prajā́vatī vīrasū́r devṛ́kāmā* (Ppp.): cf. under vs. 17.—Perhaps the  
corruption at xviii. 1. 39 below is in part due to a confused blending  
of two readings.⌋

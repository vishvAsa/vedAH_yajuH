## Translation
49. How many witchcrafts in the outer garment (? *upavā́sana*), how many  
fetters of king Varuṇa, what failures, what non-successes—them I cause  
to sit upon this pillar.

## Notes
Ppp. has *paścācāne* in **a** for *upavāsane;* and, for **d**, *asmin tā  
stāno muñcāmi sarvām*. Our P.M.W. read in **d** *tā́ṁ sth-*; the rest,  
*tā́ḥ sth-*. In Kāuś. 79. 23 the verse is used immediately after the  
preceding. The lack of a syllable in **a** is disregarded by the Anukr.

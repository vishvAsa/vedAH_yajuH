## Translation
16. Let your wave smite up the pegs; O waters, release the yoke-ropes  
(*yóktra*); let not the two inviolable \[kine\], not evil-doing, free  
from guilt, come upon what is unpropitious (? *áśuna*).

## Notes
The verse is RV. iii. 33. 13, which, however, reads *śū́nam* for *áśunam*  
in **d**, and *vyènasā* for *-sāu* in **d**; and Ppp. agrees with RV.  
⌊W's "\[kine\]" seems to overlook the gender of *aghnyāú:* see  
Griffith's note, p. 174.⌋ Kāuś. 77. 15 makes the verse accompany the  
sprinkling of the car and unyoking of the oxen at the end of the bridal  
journey.

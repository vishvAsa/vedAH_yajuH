## Translation
1. For thee in the beginning they carried about Sūryā, together with the  
bridal-car; mayest thou, O Agni, give to us husbands the wife, together  
with progeny.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 38, RV. reading *púnaḥ* for *sá naḥ* in **c**.  
All our mss. accent in **d** *ágne*, but it has been emended to *agne*  
in our edition. Ppp. agrees with RV. in having in **c** *punaṣ pat-*.  
⌊Cf. PGS. i. 7. 3; MP. i. 5. 3; MGS. i. 11. 12 **b**, and p. 150.⌋ Kāuś.  
78. 10 quotes this verse with 45 below, both preceded by vi. 78. 1, and  
followed by a long prose-passage, when the pair approach the priest to  
receive a sort of baptism.

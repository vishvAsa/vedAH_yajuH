## Translation
19. Stand up from here; desiring what hast thou (f.) come hither? I  
\[am\] thine overcomer, O Iḍā, out of \[my\] own house; thou that hast  
come hither, O perdition, seeking the empty—stand up, O niggard; fly  
forth; rest not here.

## Notes
This exorcism accompanies, according to Kāuś. 77. 16, a complete  
sprinkling of her new home by the bride. All our mss. ⌊and all SPP's  
authorities⌋ have at end of **c** *ājagándha;* our edition ⌊not SPP's⌋  
makes the, as it seems, necessary emendation to *-ntha*, which Ppp. also  
appears to have. ⌊See Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 108.⌋ Ppp. further reads in  
**a** *-ṭhā ’daṣ kim*, combines *ā ’gā ’haṁ*, and begins **c** with  
*aśūnyeṣī*. In **b** the translation assumes the *pada*-reading  
*iḍe*—not *īḍe*, as previous translators prefer to understand; it is  
hard to tell which word is more out of place. The verse is once more a  
very poor sort of *triṣṭubh*. ⌊It may be counted as 44 syllables. Pādas  
**a, b, c** scan easily as 11 + 12: 11; but the good *triṣṭubh* cadence  
of **d** casts suspicion on the integrity of its prior part.⌋

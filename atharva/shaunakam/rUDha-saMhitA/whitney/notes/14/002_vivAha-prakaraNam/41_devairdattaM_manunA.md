## Translation
41. This bridal garment and bride's dress, given by the gods together  
with Manu, whoso gives to a knowing (*cikitvā́ṅs*) priest (*brahmán*), he  
verily slays the demons of the couch (?).

## Notes
The translation implies at the end the emendation (suggested also by  
Weber, p. 211) of *tálpāni* to *tálpyāni*, as required by both sense and  
meter, and supported by the Ppp. reading *tṛpyāni*. For **b**, Ppp.  
gives *vādhūyaṁ baddho (vadhvo?) vāso ‘syāḥ*, which, though metrically  
awkward, is not redundant in expression. In Kāuś. 79. 21, the verse  
accompanies the priest's acceptance of the bridal garment, given him  
with 1. 25. The verse is a good *triṣṭubh*, if emended as proposed in  
**d**. ⌊Cf. vii. 37. 1 n.⌋

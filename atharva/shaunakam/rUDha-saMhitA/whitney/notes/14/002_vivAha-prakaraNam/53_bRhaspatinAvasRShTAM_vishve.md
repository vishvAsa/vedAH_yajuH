## Translation
53. Her, let go by Brihaspati, all the gods maintained; what splendor is  
entered into the kine, with that do we unite this woman.

## Notes
⌊Cf. Böhtlingk, ZDMG. liv. 614.⌋ Besides the use of vss. 53-58 made by  
Kāuś. 75. 25, as noticed in the preceding note, they are again applied  
in 76. 31, when at the end of the wedding ceremony the bride is  
sprinkled with fragrant powders. The connection of *ávasṛṣṭām* with *ávā  
’sṛkṣata* in vs. 52 **c**, suggests *dīkṣam* as the word to be supplied  
in the first lines of these verses; and so Ludwig translates.

## Translation
26. Of excellent omen, extender (*pratáraṇa*) of the houses, very  
propitious to thy husband, wealful to thy father-in-law, pleasant to thy  
mother-in-law, do thou enter these houses.

## Notes
The comm. to Prāt. iii. 60 notes the accent of *śvaśrvāí*. The verse  
seems to be overlooked altogether in the Anukr. as we have it; it should  
be called a *3-p.* *virāṇ nāma gāyatrī* (11 + 11: 11 = 33). It is used  
in Kāuś. 77. 20 as the bride enters her new abode.

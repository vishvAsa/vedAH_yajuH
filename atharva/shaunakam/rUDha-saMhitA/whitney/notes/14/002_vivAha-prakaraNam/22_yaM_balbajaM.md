title = "२२ यं बल्बजं"

## Translation
22. What rushes (*bálbaja*) ye cast down, and \[what\] hide ye spread  
under, that let the girl (*kanyā̀*) of good progeny mount, who finds a  
husband.

## Notes
*Balbaja* is the *Eleusine indica*, a coarse rush-like grass. In Ppp.,  
the parts of vss. 22 and 23, and of 24 and 25, are more or less  
exchanged. In Kāuś. 78, the second pāda is first quoted (in 2), after  
our vs. 21; then follows (in 3) **a**, then (in 4) the first part of vs.  
23, then (in 5) our **c**, then (in 6) the second half of vs. 23, all  
accompanying the corresponding acts of preparing a seat for the bride,  
that she may take a Brahman-boy into her lap, to encourage the  
obtainment of male progeny. It may be that Ppp. follows with its changed  
order the succession of the acts as given in Kāuś.

## Translation
52. Eager, these young girls, going to a husband from the father's  
world, have let go the consecration: hail!

## Notes
All our mss. ⌊and SPP's authorities⌋ leave *yatīḥ* in **b** unaccented,  
as if 1. 32 **c**, as if *pátiṁ yatīḥ* were a sort of compound word,  
⌊although the *pada*-text treats them as separate words!⌋. ⌊Cf. MP. i.  
4. 4, and Wint, p. 54, vs. 4, p. 55 n. 1.⌋ The Anukr. counts in *svā́hā*  
at the end as a metrical part of the verse. According to Kāuś. 75. 24,  
this verse is uttered as the bride lays fuel on the fire; then ⌊75.  
25⌋, with seven verses, (apparently, this and the six that follow ⌊so  
schol.⌋), the prepared water is heated, and with vs. 65 below, the bride  
is bathed.

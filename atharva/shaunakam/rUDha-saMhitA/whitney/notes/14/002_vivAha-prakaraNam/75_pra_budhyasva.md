## Translation
75. Continue thou awake, waking with good awakening, unto length of life  
of a hundred autumns; go to the houses that thou mayest be  
house-mistress; let Savitar make for thee a long life-time.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **c** *gṛhān pre ’hi sumanasyamānā*, and combines in  
**d** *tā ”yus sav-*. We had ⌊part of **a**, above, in 31 **c**⌋; **c**  
above as 1. 20 **c**; and **d** as 1. 47 **d** ⌊nearly =⌋ 2. 39 **d**.  
According to Kāuś. 77. 13, the verse is to be used if the bride falls  
asleep on the road.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The Anukr. is not content with this length of hymn, but adds three more  
pieces from other parts of the Veda to fill up the "wedding of Sūryā":  
*sahṛdayam* (iii. 30. 1) *ity atharvā sāumyam* ⌊sāmmanasyam?⌋  
*ānuṣṭubham ā no agna* (ii. 36. 1) *iti pativedanaḥ sāumyaṁ trāiṣṭubhaṁ  
vi hī* (xx. 126. 1) *’ti tryadhikāi ”ndro* ⌊*tryadhikam āindro?*⌋  
*vṛṣākapir indrāṇi ’ndraś ca* (mss. *-drasya*) *samūdire pān̄ktam ity eṣa  
sāutyavivāha iti*.  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 1 hymn (but see pages 738-9) and  
75 verses. The quoted Anukr. says *pañcasaptatir uttaraḥ* (see p. 738).⌋  
  
⌊Some mss. sum up the book as of 2 hymns and 139 verses (see p. 739).⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the twenty-ninth *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

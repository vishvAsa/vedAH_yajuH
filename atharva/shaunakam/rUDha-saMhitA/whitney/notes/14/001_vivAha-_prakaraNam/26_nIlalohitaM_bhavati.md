title = "२६ नीललोहितं भवति"

## Translation
26. It becomes blue-red; \[as\] witchcraft, infection, it is driven away  
(?); her relations (*jñātí*) thrive; her husband is bound in bonds.

## Notes
Is RV. X. 85. 28, without variant. *Vy àjyate* is translated as coming  
from root *aj* instead of *añj*, 'is smeared.' Pāda **a** perhaps refers  
to the bloody discoloration of the garment; **d** to its ill effects if  
not duly expiated. The Āp.-text (Wint., p. 67 ⌊MP. i. 6. 8⌋) has for a  
*nīlalohité bhavataḥ*, as if the garments were two. RV. and AV.  
*pada*-texts have *āsaktīḥ* undivided.

## Comment
The hymn (except vss. 4, 62, which are wanting altogether, and 41, 42, which occur in other books) is found also in Pāipp. xviii., with petty differences of order, noted under the verses. A large part of the anuvāka or hymn corresponds to the wedding hymn (x. 85) in the Rig-Veda. The Vāit. does not treat the marriage ceremony, and only four or five of the verses of the book are quoted by it; but a large part of them are used in the sections (75-79) of the Kāuś. which deal with the subject.

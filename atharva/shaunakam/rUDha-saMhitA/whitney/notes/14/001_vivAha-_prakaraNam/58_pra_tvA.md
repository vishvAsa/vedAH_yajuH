## Translation
58. I release thee from Varuṇa's fetter, with which the very propitious  
Savitar bound thee; wide space (*loká*), an easy road here, do I make  
for thee, O bride (*vadhū́*), with thy husband.

## Notes
The first half-verse is identical with vs. 19 **a, b**, and corresponds  
with RV. x. 85. 24 **a, b** (which reads at end *suśévaḥ*). Ppp. reads  
for **a-b** *imāṁ vi ṣyāmi varuṇasya pāśaṁ tena tvā* etc.; ⌊cf. the TS.  
version of our 19 **a**⌋. ⌊As noted under vs. 19, Ppp. makes our 58 **c,  
d** change place with our 19 **c, d**, reading, however, *sūgam itra*  
for our *sugám átra* and *sahapatnī vadhūḥ* for our *sahápatnyāi  
vadhu*.⌋ Vss. 58, 59, 61 appear to be overlooked by the Anukr.,  
probably by a loss of something out of the text: this (11 + 11: 10 + 12  
= 44) is an irregular *triṣṭubh;* ⌊the longer form *pánthānam* would  
relieve the difficulty: cf. vs. 34, where, as between the longer and  
shorter equivalent forms, our text is most clearly at fault⌋.

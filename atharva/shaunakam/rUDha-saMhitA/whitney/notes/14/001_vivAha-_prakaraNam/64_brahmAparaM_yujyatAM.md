## Translation
64. Let the *bráhman* be yoked after, the *bráhman* before, the  
*bráhman* at the end, in the middle, the *bráhman* everywhere; going  
forward to an impenetrable stronghold of the gods, do thou (f.),  
propitious, pleasant, bear rule in thy husband's world.

## Notes
Besides the use of the verse in Kāuś. 77. 20, as noticed just above, it  
is quoted, with 2. 8, in 77. 2, when the bride sets out, with a Brahman  
in front. In 79. 28, it is allowed to be substituted for vs. 23; and in  
that case (? 79. 32) the ceremony is called *brāhmya* instead of  
*sāurya*.  
  
⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, with 1hymn (but see page 739, top) and  
64 verses. The quoted Anukr. says *ādyaḥ sāuryaś catuḥṣaṣṭiḥ* (see p.  
738).⌋

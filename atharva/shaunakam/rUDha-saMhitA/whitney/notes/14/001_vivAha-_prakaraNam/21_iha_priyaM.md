## Translation
21. Let what is dear succeed (*sam-ṛdh*) here for thy progeny; watch  
thou over this house in order to housewife-ship; mingle thy self  
(*tanū́*) with this husband; then shalt thou in advanced age speak to the  
council.

## Notes
RV. (x. 85. 27) reads in **a** *prajáyā* (as does also Ppp.), and in  
**c-d** *sṛjasvā́ ’dhā jívrī viddátham ā́ vadāthaḥ*. Our **d** is the same  
with viii. 1. 6 **d** above, and our mss. here also read *jírvis*  
(except Bs.I., *jívis*), which ought to have been adopted in our text.  
The Āpastamba text (Winternitz, p. 74 ⌊MP. i. 9. 4⌋) has *jīvrī*. The  
verse, with several others, is quoted in Kāuś. 77. 20 in connection with  
the bride^s entering her new abode. The verse lacks two syllables of  
being a full *jagatī*. ⌊Vs. discussed by Bloomfield, JAOS. xix.² 14; cf.  
Baunack, KZ. xxxv. 495, 499.⌋

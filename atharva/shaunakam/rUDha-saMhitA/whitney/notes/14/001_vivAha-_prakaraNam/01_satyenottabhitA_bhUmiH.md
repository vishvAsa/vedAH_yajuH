## Translation
1. By truth is the earth established (*ut-stabh*); by the sun is the sky  
established; by righteousness the Ādityas stand; Soma is set (*śritá*)  
upon the sky.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 1, without variant. The *pada*-text also reads  
*úttabhitā*, by Prāt. iv. 62, the *s* being omitted by ii. 18. Kāuś.  
directs vss. 1 and 23 to be used in preparing the sacrificial fire, at  
the beginning of the chapter on the marriage-rites (75. 6: according to  
the comm., vss. 1-16 are meant, and 23-24); and again, near the end of  
the chapter (79. 16), the whole book is directed to be so used. ⌊Ppp.  
has *satvena* for *satyena* at the beginning.⌋ ⌊Cf. MP. i. 6. 1, and  
Wint., p. 66.⌋

## Translation
37. He who shines (*dī*) without fuel within the waters, whom the devout  
(*vípra*) praise at the sacrifices (*adhvará*)—O child of the waters,  
mayest thou give waters rich in honey, with which Indra increased, full  
of heroism.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 30. 4, which accents *dī́dayat*, and reads at the end  
*vīryā̀ya*. Ppp. combines in **a** *yo ‘nidhmo*. Kāuś. 75. 14 makes the  
verse accompany the piercing (*pra-vyadh*) of a stick of wood (*loga*)  
in the water.

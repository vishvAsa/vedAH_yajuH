title = "२९ तृष्टमेतत् कटुकमपाष्ठवद्"

## Translation
29. Harsh is that, sharp, barbed, poisoned; that is not to be eaten;  
what priest (*brahmán*) knows Sūryā, he indeed deserves the bride's  
\[garment\].

## Notes
RV. (x. 85. 34) inserts another *etát* after *káṭukam*, and reads  
*vidyā́t* for *véda* in **c**. The omission of *káṭukam* (with, in RV.,  
*etát*) would rectify the meter of **a**; as it stands, it is an  
extremely poor "*bṛhatī*" pāda. *Áttave* 'to be eaten' is very strange  
here. Sūryā in **c** is generally understood to mean 'the Sūryā-hymn.'

## Translation
52. Be this woman mine, bringing prosperity (*pósya*); Brihaspati hath  
given thee to me; in company with me ⌊as husband⌋ do thou live, rich in  
offspring, a hundred autumns.

## Notes
Bp. and Bs.p.m. give in **c** (as does Ppp.) *prajā́vatī*, and I.K.  
*prajā́vati;* *prajā́vatī* is evidently the preferable reading; ⌊and is  
implied in the translation⌋. ⌊Of SPP's authorities, 4 have *prajā́vatī*  
against 6 with *prajāvati* (which latter he adopts): but not less than 7  
have (like W's I.K.) the impossible *prajā́vati*, which supports both  
readings or neither!⌋ The verse is found also in PGS. i. 8. 19, and in a  
*khila* to RV. x. 85 (Aufrecht², p. 682); both have *prajāvatī;* in  
**a**, both have *dhruvāi ’dhi poṣye* (RV. *-ṣyā*) *mayi*. ⌊See also MP.  
i. 8. 9: that also has *prajā́vatī*.⌋

## Translation
9. Soma was the bride-seeker; both Aśvins were wooers, when Savitar gave  
to her husband Sūryā, praising (*śaṅs*) with her mind.

## Notes
Is RV. x. 85. 9, without variant, save that our *pada*-mss. falsely  
leave *adadāt* unaccented. 'Praising,' apparently 'assenting gladly.'  
Ppp. reads at end *‘dadhāt*.

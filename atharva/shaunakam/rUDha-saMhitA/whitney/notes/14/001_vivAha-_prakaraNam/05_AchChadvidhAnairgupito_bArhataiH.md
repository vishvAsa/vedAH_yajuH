## Translation
5. Guarded by covering-arrangements, defended by watchmen (??  
*bárhata*), O Soma, thou standest hearing the pressing-stones; no  
earthly one partakes of thee.

## Notes
Is RV. X. 85. 4, without variant. All this talk about the moon as  
identical with Soma at the beginning of the *Sūryā*-hymn seems very  
meaningless unless Sūryā is really the moon, who every month "goes to"  
her spouse the sun.

## Translation
60. Bhaga fashioned the four feet; Bhaga fashioned the four frame-pieces  
(? *úṣyala*); Tvashṭar adorned (*piś*) the straps (? *várdhra*) along in  
the middle; let her be to us of excellent omen.

## Notes
Kāuś. uses the verse not only as stated in the preceding note, but also  
(76. 25), more properly, with 2. 31, when the bride mounts the couch  
(*talpa*). Ppp. reads in **a** *padas;* in **b**, *catvāry aṣpadāni;* in  
**c**, *madhyato varadhrāṁ*. ⌊For *úṣyala*, cf. note to vi. 139. 3.⌋  
⌊For the addition to the Anukr. at this point, see above, p. 740, ¶2,  
and especially the note to XV. 5. 7.⌋

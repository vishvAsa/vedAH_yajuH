## Translation
19. I release thee from Varuṇa's fetter, with which the very propitious  
Savitar bound thee; in the lair (*yóni*) of righteousness, in the world  
of the well-done, be it pleasant for thee accompanied by the wooer  
(*-sambhalá*).

## Notes
The first three pādas are the same with RV. x. 85. 24 **a-c**, the only  
RV. variant being *suśévaḥ* at end of **b**; for **d**, RV. has *áriṣṭāṁ  
tvā sahá pátyā dadhāmi*. TS. (i. 1. 10²; iii. 5. 6¹) has a nearly  
corresponding verse: *imáṁ ví ṣyāmi váruṇasya pā́śaṁ yám ábadhnīta savitā́  
sukétaḥ: dhātúś ca yónāu sukṛtásya loké syonám me sahá pátyā karomi*.  
Our first half-verse is repeated below as 58 **a, b**; and the *pratīka*  
quoted in Vāit. 4. 11 doubtless belongs to the latter, and not to this  
verse as assigned by the editor. On the other hand, the *pratīka* quoted  
in Kāuś. 75. 23, used in connection with loosing the scarf (*veṣṭa*)  
tied about the bride, doubtless belongs here. The Āpastamba-text  
(Winternitz, p. 63) gives two slightly differing versions of the verse  
⌊MP. i. 5. 16⌋. Ppp. puts the verse next after our vs. 16; ⌊but further  
it makes our 19 **c, d** change place with our 58 **c, d**, reading,  
however, *‘stu sahapatnī vadhū* for our *astu sahásambhalāyai*.

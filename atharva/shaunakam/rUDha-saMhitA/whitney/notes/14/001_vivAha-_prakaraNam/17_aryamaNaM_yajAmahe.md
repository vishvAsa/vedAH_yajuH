## Translation
17. We make offering to Aryaman of good connections, husband-finder;  
like a gourd from its bond, from here I release, not from yonder.

## Notes
This verse is found as RV. vii. 59. 12, a late and ungenuine appendage  
to that hymn, and having no *pada*-text; its reading is very different,  
namely: *tryàmbakaṁ yajāmahe sugándhim puṣṭivárdhanam: urvārukám iva  
bándhanān mṛtyór mukṣīya mā́ ’mṛ́tāt;* and with this agree TS. (i. 8. 6²)  
and MS. (i. 10. 4), except that they accent *sugandhím* in **b**; VS.  
(iii. 60) has *tryàmbakam* in **a**; for **b**, *sugandhím pativédanam;*  
for **d**, *itó mukṣīya mā́ ’mútaḥ*. Ppp. has at end *muñca mā ‘mutaḥ*.  
Vāit. 9. 19 quotes the RV. verse in the *cāturmāsya* ceremony, giving  
the text in full; Kāuś. 75. 22 makes our verse accompany an oblation  
offered when the wooer comes in. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
redundant syllable in **c** (read *-kám ’va*). ⌊For 17, 18, cf. MP. i.  
5. 7, and Wint., p. 56.⌋

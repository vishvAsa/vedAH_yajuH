## Translation
36. With what \[splendor\] the backsides of the courtezan (*mahānagnī́*),  
O Aśvins, or with what the strong drink, with what the dice were flooded  
(*abhi-sic*), with that splendor favor ye this woman.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
That is, apparently, give her all the attractions which these various  
seductive things are known to possess. 'Courtezan,' lit. 'great naked  
woman,' emending to *-nagnyā́s:* ⌊but all authorities, both SPP's and  
W's, have -naghnyā́s⌋. The verse has a distant likeness to one in PGS.  
ii. 6. 12. The *ṣ* of *aṣicyanta* is by Prāt. ii. 92, where this example  
is quoted in the commentary. The redundant syllable in the first pāda  
passes unheeded by the Anukr. For the use of the verse in Kāuś. see the  
note to the preceding verse. Ppp. puts the verse before our 35 as noted  
above, and the ms. reads for **a**: *yan mā nagnā jaghnam*.

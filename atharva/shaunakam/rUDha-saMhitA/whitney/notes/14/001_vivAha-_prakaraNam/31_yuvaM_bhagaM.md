## Translation
31. Do ye (two) bring together a successful (*sámṛddha*) portion,  
speaking right in right-speakings; O Brahmaṇaspati, make the husband  
shine (*ruc*) for her; let the wooer (*sambhalá*) speak this speech  
agreeably (*cā́ru*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
According to Kāuś. 75. 8, 9, this verse is addressed to the wooer and  
his companion, when they are sent out to win the bride; the second  
half-verse to the priest (who is one of them?). 'Make shine,' doubtless  
'set in a favorable light' The verse ⌊scanned by the Anukr. as 11 + 9:  
12 + 12 = 44⌋ may best be read as 11 + 11: 12 + 12; ⌊but **d** has a bad  
cadence⌋. Ppp. reads *mṛtyodyena* at end of **b**, and *ṣumbhalo* in  
**d**.

## Translation
38. Now do I remove (*apa-ūh*) the glistening seizer (*grābhá*),  
body-spoiling; what sheen is excellent, that I draw up (*ud-ac*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads in the first half-verse *tanūdūṣim athi nudāmi*. For its  
second half it has *yaś śivo bhadro rocanas tena tvām api nudāmi*,  
making a fair half-*anuṣṭubh*. According to Kāuś. 75. 15, 16, the thing  
(the pierced piece of wood) is removed with the first two pādas; and  
with the third water is drawn up (*anvīpam* 'in the direction of the  
current') and is then presented with vs. 39. The verse (9 + 8: 11 = 28)  
is described by the Anukr. with mechanical correctness.

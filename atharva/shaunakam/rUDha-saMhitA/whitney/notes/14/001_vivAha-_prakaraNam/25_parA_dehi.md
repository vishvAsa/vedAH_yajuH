## Translation
25. Give thou away the *śāmulyà;* share out goods to the priests  
(*brahmán*); it, becoming a walking (*padvánt*) witchcraft, enters the  
husband \[as\] a wife.

## Notes
RV. (x. 85. 29) differs only by reading *bhūtvī́* in **c**; our  
*pada*-text has *bhūtvā́: ā́: j-*. According to Kāuś. 79. 20, the verse  
accompanies the giving away of the bride's undergarment, which is  
regarded as extremely ill-omened if not so disposed of and expiated by  
gifts to the Brahmans. ⌊Cf. the Anukr. extracts, p. 759, end.⌋ *śāmulyà*  
is defined in the Pet. Lexx. as "a woolen shirt," as identical with  
*śāmūla*, which is so defined by the comm. to LśS. ix. 4. 7. The  
Āpastamba text (Winternitz, p. 100 ⌊MP. i. 17. 7⌋) reads instead  
*śābalyà*.

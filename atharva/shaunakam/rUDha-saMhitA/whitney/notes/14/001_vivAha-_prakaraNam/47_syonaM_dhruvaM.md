## Translation
47. I maintain for thee, in order to progeny, a pleasant, firm  
(*dhruvá*) stone in the lap of the divine earth; stand thou on that, one  
to be exulted after, of excellent glory; let Savitar make for thee a  
long life-time.

## Notes
Ppp. puts *syonam* after *dhruvam* in **a**, reads *pṛthivyām* in **b**,  
and *tam ā rohā ’numadyā suvīrā* for **c**, and *tvā* for *te* in **d**  
⌊i.e., it has *tvāyus* for *ta āyus*⌋. In Kāuś. 76. 15, the first  
half-verse accompanies the setting of a stone in a lump of dung, and in  
76. 16 the second accompanies the stepping of the bride upon it: this  
at the bride's home; and the same is repeated (Kāuś. 77. 17, 19) in the  
new home of the pair after their arrival there. Pāda **a** has 12  
syllables, unnoticed by the Anukr.

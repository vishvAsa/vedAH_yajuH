## Translation
50. I grasp thy hand in order to good-fortune, that with me as husband  
thou mayest be long-lived; Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Purandhi  
⌊*púraṁdhi*⌋—the gods have given thee to me in order to housewifeship.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 85. 36, which varies only by reading at the  
beginning *gṛbhṇā́mi*. MB. (i. 2. 16) has precisely the RV. form of the  
verse; HGS. (i. 20. 1) and Āpast. (Wint., p. 49 ⌊MP. i. 3. 3⌋) read in  
**a** *suprajāstvāya*, and HGS. has also *gṛhnāmi* and (at end of **b**)  
*asat*. ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 10. 15 a, and p. 150.⌋ ⌊As to *puraṁdhi*, cf. WZKM.  
iii. 268; and Pischel, *Ved. Stud.* i. 202-216.⌋

title = "१५ पञ्च राज्यानि"

## Translation
15. The five kingdoms of plants, having Soma as their chief (*śréṣṭha*),  
we address; the *darbhá*, hemp, barley, *sáha*—let them free us from  
distress.

## Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **b** by reading *brūmasi;* in **c** it puts  
*bhan̄gas* before *darbhas*. The mss., as usual, differ as to the accent  
of *rājya;* several (including our O.) read *rā́jyāni*, and our R.s.m.  
has *rājyā̀ni*. The comm. calls *saha* simply 'a kind of herb.'

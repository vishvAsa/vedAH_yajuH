## Comment
Found also (except vs. 25) in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊The hymn is not cited in the text of Kāuç. nor of Vāit.⌋


## Translations
Translated: Muir, v. 397 (part); Scherman, p. 87 (part); Deussen, Geschichte, i. 1. 305-310; Henry, 120, 156; Griffith, ii. 75; Bloomfield, 226, 629.—See Deussen's valuable introduction. He does not believe that ucchiṣṭa means 'remnant of the offering' in this hymn, but rather 'residuum in general,' the remainder that we get after subtracting from the universe all the forms of the world of phenomena.

## Translation
34. If thou hast eaten it with other eyes than those with which the  
ancient seers ate this, thou wilt become blind: thus one says to him; it  
verily \[have\] I not \[eaten\] coming hither, nor retiring, nor coming  
on; with sun-and-moon as eyes, with them have I eaten it, with them etc.  
etc.

## Notes
All the mss. read *sūryācandramasā́bhyām*, which SPP. has very properly  
retained in his text; ours was altered to agree with vi. 128. 3, but the  
alteration should have been the other way.

## Translation
26. The theologues (*brahmavādín*) say: hast thou eaten (*pra-aś*) the  
rice-dish as it was retiring (*párāñc*), or as it was coming on  
(*pratyáñc*)?

## Notes
The *pluta-* or protracted syllables in this and the next verse are  
quoted in Prāt. i. 105, but nothing is said as to their accentuation,  
from which it seems most plausible to infer that the protraction made no  
difference in the accent; and though in the Brāhmaṇas a protracted  
syllable is always accented ⌊see *Gram.* §78 a⌋, that is not the  
invariable rule in the Vedic texts (thus, only once among the three  
instances occurring in RV.). Here the mss. are greatly at variance.  
⌊SPP's V. (a then living *śrotriya*) read *prā́śī́3ḥ;* and by his ms.  
D^(c) the reading *prā́śī́ḥ3* is given *secunda manu*. Among our mss.,  
O.R.Kp. (and E.?) give *prā́śī́ḥ3*. SPP. reports that 16 of his  
authorities agree in giving *pratyáñcā́3m;* and (apart from the presence  
or position of the *3*) this seems to be the reading of many of W's  
mss.⌋ SPP's text gives an accent to the protracted syllable in both  
cases in both vs. 26 and vs. 27.—⌊SPP's *pada*-reading in vs. 26 is  
*prá: āśī́3ḥ*, and in 27 it is *prá: ā́śī́3ḥ*. An accented *ā́* in *āśī́3ḥ*  
would require *pra॰ā́śī́3ḥ* (cf. vs. 28); but one does not see why the *ā*  
should be accented.⌋

## Translation
56. If he is not scathed a complete scathing, before old age breath  
quits him.

## Notes
⌊The quotations from the Old Anukr. for the *paryāya-sūkta* are given  
piecemeal at the end of each *paryāya*. They may here be given together  
in their metrical form:  
  
ekatriṅśad bhavet pūrvas tasmād dvāsaptatiḥ paraḥ:    
tṛtīyaḥ saptako dṛṣṭo "bṛhaspatiḥ śirasy" api:  
  
'In the \[hymn beginning\] "bṛhaspatiḥ śiraḥ"' etc.—The summations of  
*gaṇas* and (*gaṇa-*)*avasāna-rcas* are as follows: I. *g.*, o; *av.*,  
31; 11. *g.*, 18; *av.*, 72; III. *g.*, o; *av.*, 7. Total of *av.*,  
110.—The second *paryāya-sūkta* is called also a *gaṇa-sūkta*.⌋

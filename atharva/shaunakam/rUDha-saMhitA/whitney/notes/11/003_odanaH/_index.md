## Comment
⌊Prose, except vss. 19-22.⌋ A corresponding passage is found in Pāipp. xvi., but so different in detail that it would require to be given in full for comparison; and this has not been done.


SPP., without any good reason,* counts the three paryāyas or divisions of this hymn as so many independent hymns, thus not only defacing the structure of the book, but defeating all the references that had been made to it in lexicons and elsewhere.


*⌊Whether Whitney's condemnation of SPP's procedure is justified or not may be decided when all the facts are before us. Some of them have been put together by me, above, pages 610, 611, which see.⌋


⌊The hymn is not cited by Vāit.; nor in the text of Kāuś., unless vs. 31 is meant at 62. 8: but Keśava (p. 3531) cites it for use in witchcraft practices (so the comm.), and also (p. 3652) for use in the bṛhaspati sava (so comm.).⌋





## Translations
Translated: Henry, 106, 145; Griffith, ii. 61.—Cf. especially Henry's introduction, p. 145. The rice-dish, hot and yellow and nourishing, is a symbol of the sun (cf. vs. 50); its ingredients and the utensils used in making it are identified with all sorts of things in the most grotesque manner of the Brāhmaṇas.

## Translation
31. Wipe off, O serving priest (*adhvaryú*), this face of the bearing  
one (? *babhrí*); make thou, understanding it, room for the sacrificial  
butter; wipe off with ghee along all \[its\] members; I make a road to  
the Fathers that is heaven-going.

## Notes
The real sense of the epithet *babhri* applied to the *odana* or  
rice-dish is obscure; the comm. explains it here with *bharaṇaśīlasya  
poṣakasya pakvasyā odanasya*, 'supporting' or 'nourishing.' The comm.  
appears to read *vidvān* instead of *pravidvān* in **b**; Ppp. has  
*prajānan*. Ppp. has *yat* for *yas* in **d**. According to Kāuś. 62.  
15, the verse accompanies the making of an *āpāna* (? the mss. vary as  
to the word) above (*upari*); which the comm. explains by *odanasyo  
’pari gartaṁ kuryāt*, glossing *lokam* in **b** with *sthānaṁ  
gartarūpam;* what is meant is obscure.

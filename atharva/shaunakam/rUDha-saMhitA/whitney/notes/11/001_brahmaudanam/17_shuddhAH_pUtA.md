## Translation
17. Let these cleansed, purified, worshipful maidens, the waters,  
beauteous ones, creep down to the pot; they have given us abundant  
progeny, cattle; let the cooker of the rice-dish go to the world of the  
well-doers.

## Notes
⌊Pāda **a** is identical with vs. 27 **a** and vi. 122. 5 **a**.⌋ The  
mss. are about equally divided in **c** between *bahulā́m* and *bahulā́n*  
(our I.T.K.Kp. have the latter; O. has *-lāṁn*); SPP. accepts the  
latter, we the former; the comm. has *-lān;* and he reads *pakvā* for  
*paktā* in **d** ⌊or **c**⌋. Ppp. has *dadat* for *adus* in **c**, and  
*eti* for *etu* in **d**. The verse concerns the pouring in of the  
water: so Kāuś. 61. 34-5, and 2. 8.—⌊If we read *bahulā́ṅś ca* in **c**,  
and in **d** *pakvāúdanasya* as a compound (against the *pada*-division,  
which reckons *paktā́* to c, and against the double accent) and *u* for  
*etu*, we get most acceptable sense and meter: *lokám* would be  
construed as coördinate with *paśū́n* and *pakvāúdanasya* as coördinate  
with *nas* (cf. xi. 8. 10 **c** and Speyer, *Vedische Syntax*, §71,  
end). The heroic surgery implies no worse corruptions than we have often  
seen. But this is all mere suggestion.⌋

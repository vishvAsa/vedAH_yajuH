## Translation
13. Go away, woman; come back quickly; the stall (goṣṭhá) of the waters  
hath ascended thee for bearing; seize then of them ⌊f.⌋ whichever shall  
be worshipful; having shared \[them\] out wisely, then leave the others.

## Notes
The comm. explains *goṣṭha* by *jalarāśi;* it is rather, doubtless, the  
vessel in which the water is brought, on the shoulder or head  
(*adhi-ruh:* comm. *śirasi ā-ruh*). ⌊Cf. OB. iii. 261 b.⌋ The comm.  
reads *āsan* at end of **c**. Ppp. combines *yajñiā ’san* in **c**, and  
in **d** reads *vibhajya*, and *hvayīta* for *jahītāt*. SPP. reads in  
**b** *goṣṭhó ‘dhy*, with the majority of his authorities.

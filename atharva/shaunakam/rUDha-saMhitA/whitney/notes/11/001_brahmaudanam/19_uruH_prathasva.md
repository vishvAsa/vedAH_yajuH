## Translation
19. Spread thyself broad, with great greatness, thousand-backed, in the  
world of the well-done: grandfathers, fathers, progeny, descendants  
(*upajā́*): I am thy fifteen-fold cooker.

## Notes
Fifteen-fold ⌊cf. *Skt. Gram.* §488⌋, probably, as representing so many  
generations, or degrees of kindred. The verse accompanies the boiling  
⌊Kāuś. 61. 37: employed also in connection with other verses at 68. 27⌋,  
and alludes apparently to the swelling of the mess in the process. Ppp.  
combines *te ‘smi* at the end. The mss. vary between *paktā́* and  
*paktvā́* in **d** (our T.K.Kp. have *-tā́*) SPP. reads *paktā́*, with the  
large majority of his authorities, and it is doubtless the true reading.  
The comm. has again *pakvā*. ⌊Correct the Berlin ed. to *paktā́*.⌋

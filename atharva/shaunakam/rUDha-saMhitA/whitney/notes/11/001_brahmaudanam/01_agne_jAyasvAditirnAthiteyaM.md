## Translation
1. O Agni, be thou born; Aditi here, suppliant, cooks a  
*brahmán*-rice-dish, desiring sons; the seven seers, being-makers—let  
them churn thee here together with progeny.

## Notes
Aditi's cooking of a rice-dish in order to obtain progeny is repeatedly  
referred to in the Brāhmaṇas—probably by way of echo of this verse:  
compare TS. vi. 5. 6¹; TB. i. 1. 9¹; K. vii. 15; MS. i. 6. 12; ⌊ii. 1.  
12 and references⌋; ⌊also AV. vi. 81. 3⌋; the comm. quotes the TS.  
passage in his explanation of the verse. He defines a *brahmāudana* as  
*brahmaṇe jagatsraṣṭre svāhākareṇa deya odanaḥ*, and then adds: *yad vā  
brahmāudanasavākhye ‘smin karmaṇi brāhmaṇānām bhojanāya bhāgatvena  
kalpita odano brahmāudanaḥ*.

## Translation
18. Cleansed with prayer (*bráhman*) and purified with ghee, shoots of  
Soma \[are\] these worshipful rice-grains; enter ye the waters; let the  
pot receive you; having cooked this, go ye to the world of the  
well-doers.

## Notes
A few mss. (including our O.) read *etu* for *eta* in **d**. Ppp. has  
instead *eti;* further, in **a**, *utpūtās*, and, in **c**, *apa  
praviśyatu*. The verse accompanies the pouring of the rice-grains into  
the water; so Kāuś. 61. 36, and 2. 9. ⌊Read *somāṅśā́vas?*⌋ ⌊The Anukr.  
seems to scan as 12 + 13: 12 + 13 = 50; but the mark of pāda-division is  
after *carur*, not before it.⌋

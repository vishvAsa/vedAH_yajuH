## Translation
9. Join thou on the hide these two allied stones; split apart the shoots  
(*aṅśú*) successfully for the sacrificer; smiting down, smite them that  
would fight her; bearing up thy progeny aloft, lift up.

## Notes
The feminine participles in **c, d** indicate that the verse is  
addressed to the wife of the sacrificer, though the comm. understands  
the first half as for the priest. *Aṅśu* he regards as applied by a  
figure to the rice, as *grāvāṇāu* 'soma-pressing-stones,' means mortar  
and pestle. 'Smite down' and 'lift up' are the alternate movements of  
the pestle, each viewed as symbolical. *Imām* is redundant in **c** as  
regards both meter and sense; perhaps it has blundered in here out of  
11 **c**. Ppp. is corrupt in **c** and **d**, but can be seen to read  
*uddharantī* in **d**. The verse and its parts are quoted in Kāuś. 61.  
18, 22, 24.

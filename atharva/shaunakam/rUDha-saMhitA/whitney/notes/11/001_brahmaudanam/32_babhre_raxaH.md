title = "३२ बभ्रे रक्षः"

## Translation
32. O bearing one, \[as\] a demon, strew discord for them, for  
whatsoever non-Brahmans shall sit by thee; rich in ground (? *purīṣín*),  
spreading themselves forward, let not them of the seers, partakers of  
thee, suffer harm.

## Notes
With the first half-verse compare vs. 26 **a, b**, above; the last pāda  
is the same with 25 **d**. The construction of *rákṣas* in **a** is  
doubtful; it might be vocative; the comm. combines it into a compound  
with *samadam;* and he treats *te*, as before, as if it were *té*. Ppp.  
reads at beginning of **b**, as our text in vs. 26, *subrāhmaṇās*. The  
verse is not quoted in Kāuś.

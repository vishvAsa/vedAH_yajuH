## Translation
36. Gather thou together unto, go thou together forth after; O Agni,  
make ready (*kalpay-*) the roads traveled by the gods; by them,  
well-made, may we go after the offering, that stands upon the  
seven-rayed firmament.

## Notes
All the mss. ⌊save one or two of SPP's⌋ leave *agne* unaccented, as if  
it belonged to **a**, and Bp. puts the double division-mark after it  
accordingly; SPP. reads with the ⌊majority of his⌋ mss.; we have made  
the necessary emendation to *ágne*. Ppp. reads at the beginning  
*samātanuṣva;* for **c** it has *yebhis sukṛtāir anu prajñeṣṭhaṅs sa  
yajñe*. The comm. regards **a** as addressed to the rice-dish, which is  
to 'gather up ' all its members. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 63. 9, but  
not in a way to cast any light upon it. TS. iv. 7. 13⁴ and MS. ii. 12. 4  
are to be compared with the first half-verse, but they vary much from it  
and from one another.

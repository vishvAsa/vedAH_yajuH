## Translation
8. Drawing in her *karū́kara*, seeking with her mind her son, husband,  
brother, also her people (*svá*)—in case of thy bite, O Arbudi.

## Notes
The ending is the same with that of vs. 7, understood as the comm. takes  
it; we might also supply '\[he being\] bitten' etc. The Pet. Lex.  
renders karūkara 'vertebra of the neck and spine': rather (in śB. xii.  
2. 4^(10, 14)), perhaps, 'a point or spinous process of a vertebra.' The  
comm. explains *karu* as an imitative word, and *karūkara* as meaning  
anything that makes the sound *karu*, and so designating  
*hastapādādyavayavagataṁ saṁdhimad asthijātam;* and he goes on *loke hi  
bhayavaśād ubhayor hastayoḥ parasparān̄gulinipīḍanena tādṛśaṁ śabdam  
utpādayanti*. This is far from relieving satisfactorily the obscurity.  
Most of our mss. accent *svā̀n* in **c**.

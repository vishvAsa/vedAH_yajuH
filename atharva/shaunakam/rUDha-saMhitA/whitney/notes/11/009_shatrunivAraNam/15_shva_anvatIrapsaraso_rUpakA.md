## Translation
15. Dog-accompanied Apsarases, she-jackals (? *rū́pakā*) also, O Arbudi,  
the *riśā́*, licking much in the inner vessel, seeking what is  
ill-deposited—all these (f.), O Arbudi, do thou make our enemies to see,  
and do thou show forth specters;—

## Notes
The conclusion is nearly the same with vs. 1 **e, f, g**, above, and is  
also repeated below ⌊vss. 22, 24⌋. The accent of *śvànvatīs* seems  
certainly wrong, but it is read by all the mss., and avouched by the  
commentary to Prāt. iii. 73. The translation of *rūpakā* is that of the  
minor Pet. Lex., apparently founded solely on an Avestan analogue; the  
comm. defines it as *māyāvaśāt kevalaṁ rūpamātreṇo ’palabhyamānāḥ  
senārūpakāḥ*. He reads *antaḥ* and *pātre* as two independent words,  
according to his custom of caring nothing for accent. For *riśām*  
("tearing one, as designating some small animal," minor Pet. Lex.) he  
reads *vaśām* 'cow,' so that we lose any light he might have cast on the  
obscure description. Bp. reads *riṣā́m*. Prāt. iii. 75 and iv. 77  
prescribe the *pada*-reading *durnihita-*.

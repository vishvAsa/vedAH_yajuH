## Translation
7. Smiting herself, tear-faced, and crop-eared (?), let her yell, with  
disheveled hair, when the man is slain, bitten (? *rad*), O Arbudi, of  
thee.

## Notes
'Her'—namely, the wife or sister or the like; more distinctly pointed to  
in the next verse. *Radita* ought to mean rather 'scraped' or  
'scratched'; there seems to be no other example of it in the sense  
'bitten': perhaps as a mere scratch from the fang of a serpent is enough  
to kill. The comm. takes *radita* as a noun (like *ruta, stnita, citta*,  
etc.), = *dantāir vilekhane khādane sati*. Of kṛdhukarṇ#i the comm.  
says: *kṛdhv iti hrasvanāma: karṇābharaṇaparityāgena hrasvakarṇī*. The  
verse is translated (also vs. 14, and 10. 7) by Bloomfield, in AJP. xi.  
340.

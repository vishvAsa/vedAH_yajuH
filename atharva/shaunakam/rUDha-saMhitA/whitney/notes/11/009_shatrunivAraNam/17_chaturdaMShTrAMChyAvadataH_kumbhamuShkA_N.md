## Translation
17. The four-tusked ones, the black-toothed, the pot-testicled, the  
blood-faced; they that are self-frighting and frighting.

## Notes
The first four epithets are accus. pl. masc.; probably, like the accus.  
fem. at beginning of vs. 16, objects of *prá darśaya* 'show forth' in  
vs. 15. The comm. explains *svabhyasās* and *udbhy-* by *svāyattabhītayo  
rākṣaṣāḥ* and *udgatabhītayaḥ*.

## Comment
This and the following hymn are wanting in Pāipp., although bits of vss. 15-17 of this one are to be found in Pāipp. xvii. The opening words of the two are quoted together in Kāuç. 16. 21, in connection with rites for insuring success in war. ⌊The use of the two hymns forms a sequel to the rites described in the introduction to viii. 8, which see; and cf. under viii. 8. 24.⌋

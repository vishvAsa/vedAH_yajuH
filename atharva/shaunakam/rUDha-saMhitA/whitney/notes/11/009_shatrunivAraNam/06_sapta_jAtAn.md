## Translation
6. Presenting to view, O Nyarbudi, the seven kinds of specters, with  
them all do thou stand up, when the butter is offered, with the army.

## Notes
The *pada*-text reads in **a** *jātā́n: ni॰arbude;* but the reading is  
plainly false, and should be either *jātā́: ni॰arbude*, or *jātā́ni:  
arbude;* either of these, considering that to the scribes *nya* and  
*nnya* are entirely equivalent and exchangeable (see my *Skt. Gr.* §§  
229, 232), would correctly represent the *saṁhitā*-reading. ⌊Cf. the  
reading of the comm. at 10. 21.⌋

## Translation
8. The establishing of a fire, also the consecration, the  
desire-fulfiller, together with the meter (*chándas*); the removed (?  
*útsanna*) sacrifices, the sacrificial sessions (*sattrá*), are set  
together in the remnant.

## Notes
All the *pada*-mss. read in **b** *kāma॰práḥ: chándasā:*, but no  
*saṁhitā*-ms. gives correspondingly *kāmapráś chán-* they vary between  
*-prá chán-* (thus the majority) and *-práḥ chán-* (including our I.K.);  
both editions emend to *-práś chán-;* the comm. understands the two  
words as one compound. He also reads *utsannayajñās* as a compound in  
**c**, and takes it to mean sacrifices that have gone out of use and  
knowledge.

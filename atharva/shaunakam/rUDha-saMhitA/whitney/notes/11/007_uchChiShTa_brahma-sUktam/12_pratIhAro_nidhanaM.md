title = "१२ प्रतीहारो निधनं"

+++
## Translation
12. The response (*pratīhārá*), the conclusion (*nidhánd*), both the  
all-conquering and the on-conquering (*abhijít*) one, the same-day and  
overnight ones \[are\] in the remnant, the twelve-day one: also that in  
me.

## Notes
Ppp. has at the beginning *pratihāro*. ⌊The comm. joins the "also" to  
what precedes and says that "that in me" (supply *bhavatu*) is to be  
understood as a prayer: cf. vss. 5, 14.⌋

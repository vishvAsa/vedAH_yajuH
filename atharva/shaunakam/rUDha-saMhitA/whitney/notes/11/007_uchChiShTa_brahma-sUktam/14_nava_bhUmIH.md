## Translation
14. The nine earths, oceans, skies, are set (*śritá*) in the remnant;  
the sun shines in the remnant; day-and-night: also that in me.

## Notes
The *pada*-mss. in general read simply *śritā́* (or *śṛtā́*) in **b**. Two  
or three mss. (including our O.) read *‘pi* in **d**. Ppp. reads in **a,  
b** *bhūmyāṁ samudrasyo ’chiṣṭe*, and has *ca* for *api* in **d**. ⌊The  
comm. treats the last words of the vs. as under vs. 12.⌋

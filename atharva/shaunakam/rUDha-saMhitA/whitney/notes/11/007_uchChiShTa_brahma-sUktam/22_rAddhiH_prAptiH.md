## Translation
22. Success (*rā́ddhi*), attainment, obtainment, permeation, greatness,  
prosperity ⌊*edhatú*⌋—in the remnant over-attainment and growth  
(*bhū́ti*) \[is\] put in, put down, put.

## Notes
Several of our mss. (P.M.W.I.O.) accent *vyā́pti* in **b**. All the mss.  
save one or two (including our B.) leave *edhatuḥ* unaccented, as if it  
were taken for a 3d dual perfect; both editions read *edhatúḥ*. The  
comm. strangely reads at the end *hitāḥ;* ⌊but the *pada*-text makes all  
three words of **d** singular⌋.

## Translation
3. In the remnant \[are\] the being one and the non-being one, both,  
death, vigor, Prajāpati; they of the world (*lāukyá*) are supported  
(*ā-yat*) on the remnant, both *vrá* and *drá;* also fortune (*śrī́*) in  
me.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *‘saṅś;* ⌊for *asaṅś*⌋ in **a**; in **d**, where we should  
welcome its aid in making sense, it is corrupt, reading  
*pṛścadṛścāvṛścīr mayi;* it also combines *ucchiṣṭā ”yattās* in **c**.  
The comm. has *āhitās* again instead of *āyattās* in **c**; he supplies  
*prajās* to *lāukyās;* and he explains *vras* as *vārako varuṇaḥ* and  
*dras* as *drāvako ‘mṛtamayaḥ somaḥ*, and the last clause by  
*tatprasādāc chrīḥ sampad inayi viditṣy āhitā ”sthitā bhavatu*.

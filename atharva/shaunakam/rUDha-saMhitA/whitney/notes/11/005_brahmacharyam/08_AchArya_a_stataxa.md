## Translation
8. The teacher fabricated both these envelops (*nábhas*), the wide,  
profound, \[namely\] earth and sky; them the Vedic student defends by  
fervor; in him the gods become like-minded.

## Notes
The last pāda is identical with 1 **b** above. Ppp. is more original,  
reading for **c, d**: *tāu brahmacārī tapasā ’bhi rakṣati tayor devās  
sadamādam madanti;* it also omits *ime* in **a**; and it puts the verse  
after our vs. 9. The comm. ⌊and two of SPP's authorities⌋ read *tam* for  
*te* at beginning of **c**.

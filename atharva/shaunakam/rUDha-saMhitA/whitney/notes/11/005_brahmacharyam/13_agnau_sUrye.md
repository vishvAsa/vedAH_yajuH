## Translation
13. In the fire, in the sun, in the moon, in Mātariśvan, in the waters,  
the Vedic student puts fuel; their gleams (*arcís*) go about separately  
in the cloud; their sacrificial butter (*ā́jya*) is man, rain, waters.

## Notes
Ludwig conjectures "*purīṣam* fog" in **d** for puruṣas. Ppp. is too  
corrupt in **c, d** to be of service. 'Their' in **c, d** is *tā́sām*  
fem., apparently relating to *samidhas* 'sticks of fuel,' though we had  
only the singular in **b**; but the comm. regards it as 'of fire etc.,'  
the fem. being used because the last of the series (⌊the  
meter-disturbing⌋ *apsu* ' waters ') was feminine—which is possible.

## Translation
14. The teacher \[was\] death, Varuṇa, Soma, the herbs, milk; the  
thunder-clouds were warriors; by them \[was\] this heaven (*svàr*)  
brought.

## Notes
This verse stands in Ppp. before our vs. 13; it reads at the beginning  
*parjanyas* instead of *ācāryas*, reads in **c** *jīmūtā ”saṅ*, and in  
**d** *svar ābharam*. The comm., in order to put some sense into the  
identification of the teacher with death and Varuṇa, regards it as  
alluding to the instruction of Naciketas by Death (Kaṭha Upanishad,  
etc.) and of Bhṛgu by Varuṇa ⌊TA. ix. 1, etc.⌋. ⌊For **c, d**, Roth  
compares śB. xi. 8. 1².⌋

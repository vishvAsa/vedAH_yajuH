## Translation
16. The great body which lay there, put together by the  
putting-together—who brought into it the color with which it shines  
(*ruc*) here today?

## Notes
Ppp. reads *adadhat* for *aśayat* in **a**, *mayi* for *mahat* in **b**,  
and *ko ‘smin* in **d**. SPP. reports all his *pada*-mss. as having at  
the end *ā॰ábharat*, which he emends to *ā́: abharat;* our *pada*-mss.  
give the latter.

title = "२९ अस्थि कृत्वा"

## Translation
29. Having made bone \[their\] fuel, then they caused eight waters to  
settle; having made seed \[their\] sacrificial butter, the gods entered  
man.

## Notes
The first part of the verse is spoiled in Ppp. The comm. has the more  
regular accus. pl. *apas* in **b** (the *pada*-text *aṣṭá: ā́paḥ*, as  
required by the accent; the comm. in general pays no heed to accent). He  
acutely refers to Tāitt. Brāh. i. 1. 9⁴, where bone is identified with  
fuel, and seed with sacrificial butter.

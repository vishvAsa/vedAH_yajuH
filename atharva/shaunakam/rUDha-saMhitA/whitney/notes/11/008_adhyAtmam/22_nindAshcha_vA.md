title = "२२ निन्दाश्च वा"

## Translation
22. Both revilings and non-revilings, both what \[says\] "come on"  
(*hánta*) and "no," faith, the sacrificial fee, and non-faith, entered  
the body afterward.

## Notes
Ppp. combines *vā ’nindāś* in **a**. The majority of mss. (including our  
Bp.B.P.M.E.T.R.K.) read *dakṣiṇā́* in **c**; ⌊if I understand W's  
Collation Book, only Bp.T.K. among his mss. are noted as so reading;⌋  
both editions give *dákṣiṇā*. The comm. explains the word as meaning  
*dhanasamṛddhi*. ⌊Cf. Oldenberg, ZDMG. l. 449.⌋

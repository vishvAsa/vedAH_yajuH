Book XI.

⌊This eleventh book is the fourth book of the second grand division of
the Atharvan collection. As to the general make-up of the books of this
division, see page 471. The Old Anukramaṇī describes the length of hymns
6 and 8 by stating the excess of each over 20 verses. All of the book
except hymns 3 and 8 has been translated by Bloomfield in *Sacred Books
of the East*, vol. xlii.; and all of it by Victor Henry, *Les Livres X,
XI et XII de l'Atharva-véda traduits et commentés*, Paris, 1896. Here
again we have the *bhāṣya* for the entire book.⌋

⌊The ritual uses of this book are confined for the most part to the
first hymn, nearly every verse of which is quoted in Kāuśika 60-63 and
65 in connection with the details of the *sava* sacrifice. Of the other
nine hymns only sporadic citations are made by Kāuśika; and in the
Vāitāna, only a single quotation (of 2. 1) is made out of the whole
book.⌋

⌊**Paryāya-hymns:** for details respecting them, see pages 471-2. The
*paryāya*-hymn of this book is hymn 3, with 3 *paryāyas*.\]

⌊**Discrepancies of hymn-numeration**, as between the two editions, in
so far as they are occasioned by the counting of each *paryāya* as a
separate hymn by the Bombay edition. The matter is discussed at this
place because it is in this book, page 625, that Whitney has condemned
the procedure of the Bombay edition. The facts are as follows:⌋

⌊☞ See p. cxxxiv and p. 1013.⌋

  

⌊In book viii., the Bombay edition, counting separately each of the 6
*paryāyas* of our last hymn (h. 10), makes for that book a total of 15
hymns; but, since the discrepancy is confined to our last hymn, the plus
of 5 does not affect the numeration of the preceding 9.⌋

⌊In book ix., the Bombay edition, counting separately each of the 6
*paryāyas* of our hymn 6 (its 6-11), has a plus of 5 for our h. 7 (its
12) and the following. Our h. 7 is also a *paryāya*-hymn; but since it
has but 1 *paryāya*, the plus remains a constant from our h. 7 to the
end. The total is again 15.⌋

⌊In book x. there is no *paryāya*-hymn to affect the numeration.⌋

⌊In book xi., the Bombay edition, counting the 3 *paryāyas* of our hymn
3 as its 3 and 4 and 5, has a plus of 2 for our 4 (its 6) and the
following. Its total is therefore 12.⌋

​

⌊In book xii., the Bombay edition, counting separately each of the 7
*paryāyas* of our last hymn (h. 5), makes for that book a total of 11
hymns; but, since the discrepancy is confined to our last hymn, the plus
of 6 does not affect the numeration of the preceding 4.⌋

⌊In book xiii., the Bombay edition, counting separately each of the 6
*paryāyas* of our last hymn (h. 4), makes for that book a total of 9
hymns; but the discrepancy is confined to our last hymn (as in books
viii. and xii.), and the plus of 5 does not affect the numeration of the
preceding 3.⌋

⌊Book xiv. contains no *paryāya*-hymn. Books xv. and xvi. consist wholly
of *paryāyas*, the former of 18 and the latter of 9, and there is
accordingly no practical discrepancy between the two editions.⌋

⌊In his Critical Notice (prefixed to vol. i.), pages 19-23, S. P. Pandit
rests his procedure in this matter of numeration upon the authority of
the Major Anukr. and of the Minor or Old Anukr. (*Pañcapaṭalikā*): see
especially his page 23, end. His citations undoubtedly prove the right
of each *paryāya* to be presented separately, and they are so presented
in the Berlin edition. But the mss., in numbering the verses of each
*paryāya*, begin anew each time with 1; perhaps this is required by the
prescription of the Old Anukr. (Critical Notice, p. 23), *paryāyeṣv
avasānānām ṛgbhis tulyo vidhir bhavet*. Accordingly, R. and W. may be
wrong in numbering the verses of a group of *paryāyas* continuously (see
above, p. 472, top). But I am not sure that independent verse-numbering
for each *paryāya* forbids the grouping of several related *paryāyas*
into one *sūkta*. This is the real point at issue between the two
editions and I will not try to decide it.⌋

⌊I will say, however, that the uniformity of structure in books
viii.-xi. as books of ten hymns each (see p. 471), which uniformity
results from counting the *paryāyas* in groups, seems to support the
procedure of R. and W. Moreover, as W. says (p. 472, top), the
*paryāyas* of a given group taken together do "evidently constitute each
⌊group⌋ a whole"; and he is borne out by the comm. (at vol. iii., p.
56²²), who speaks of the "rice-dish-triad," our xi. 3, as constituting
one "subject-matter-hymn" (*arthasūkta:* but not in its narrower
technical sense).—It may be added that the Major Anukr., at the end of
its 7th *paṭala* and of its treatment of our book xi., says *evaṁ
ṣaṭtriṅśad arthasūktāni:* that is right; for books viii.-xi. have,
according to the Berlin count, (4 × 10 hymns =) 40 hymns, of which 4
hymns (our viii. 10, ix. 6, ix. 7, and xi. 3) are *paryāya-sūktas*,
leaving 36 *artha-sūktas*. But this does not prove that our 4
*paryāya-sūktas* should not be counted as 16 (cf. p. 471, end).⌋

⌊The *anuvāka*-division of the book (as is explained on page 472) is
into five *anuvākas* of two hymns each. The "decad"-division likewise is
as described on page 472. A tabular conspectus for book xi. follows:

Here ¶ means "paragraph of a *paryāya*" (such as is numbered as a
"verse" in the Berlin edition) and P means "*paryāya*." The last line
shows the "decad"-division. Of these "decads," *anuvākas* 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 contain respectively 7, 3, 5, 6, and 6 (in all, 27 "decads");
while *anuvāka* 2 has 3 *paryāyas*. The sum is 27 "decad"-*sūktas* and 3
*paryāya-sūktas* or 30 *sūktas*.⌋

## Translation
23. He who stands propped up in the atmosphere, killing the  
non-sacrificing, the god-mockers—to him be homage with the ten clever  
ones (*śákvarī*).

## Notes
The 'ten clever ones' are probably the fingers: cf. v. 28. 11; the comm.  
glosses the word with *an̄gulibhis*, as = *karmasu śaktābhiḥ*. Ppp.  
begins *yas tiṣṭhati viśvabhṛto antarikṣe ‘yajvanaṣ pra-*.

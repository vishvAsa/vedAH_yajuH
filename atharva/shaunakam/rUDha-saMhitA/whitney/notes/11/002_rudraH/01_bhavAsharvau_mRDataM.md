## Translation
1. O Bhava-and-śarva, be gracious; do not go against \[us\]; ye lords of  
beings, lords of cattle, homage to you! \[the arrow\] that is fitted,  
that is drawn, do not let fly; do not harm our bipeds nor quadrupeds.

## Notes
The comm. first explains *mā́* in **a** as if it were *mā*, object of  
*abhí yātam*, and then, alternatively, in its proper sense. ⌊For  
*ā́yata*, see note to vi. 65. 1.⌋

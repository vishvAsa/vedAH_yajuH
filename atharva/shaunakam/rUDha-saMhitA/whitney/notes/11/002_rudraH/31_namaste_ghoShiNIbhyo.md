title = "३१ नमस्ते घोषिणीभ्यो"

## Translation
31. Homage to thy noisy ones, homage to thy hairy ones, homage to those  
to whom homage is paid, homage to the jointly-enjoying—homage,  
\[namely\], O god, to thine armies; welfare \[be\] to us, and  
fearlessness to us.

## Notes
The adjectives are fem., as belonging to *senābhyas*. Ppp. disagrees  
with our text in the last two thirds of the verse, but is corrupt. The  
comm. reads *cana* at the end. ⌊The vs., as noted above, is quoted in  
the first *abhaya gaṇa* (note to 16. 8).⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 68 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *tathāi ’va rāudre ‘pi parās tu viṅśateḥ*, designating the  
hymn as a "Rudra-hymn."⌋

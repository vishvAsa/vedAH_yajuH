title = "२४ तुभ्यमारण्याः पशवो"

## Translation
24. To thee are assigned the forest animals ⌊paśú⌋, the wild beasts in  
the woods, the geese (*haṅsá*), eagles, hawks, birds; thine, O lord of  
cattle, is the monster (? *yakṣá*) within the waters; for thine increase  
flow the waters of the heaven.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, for **b**, *tubhyaṁ vayāṅsi śakunāṣ patatriṇaḥ*, elides the  
*a* of *apsu* in **c**, and combines *divyā ”po* in **d**. The comm. has  
*mṛdhe* at the end, explaining it as = *undanāya*. He takes *yakṣam* as  
= *pūjyaṁ svarūpam*, but does not give any reason why, etymological or  
other. ⌊Our **a** is nearly xii. 1. 49 **a** (with the same redundancy  
of a dissyllable), and **b** is precisely xii. 1. 51 **b**: for  
*paśavas*, cf. also iii. 31. 3, xi. 5. 21, and iii. 10. 6 note.⌋

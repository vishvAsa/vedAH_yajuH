## Translation
25. The dolphins (*śiṅśumā́ra*), boas (*ajagará*), *purīkáyas*, *jashás*,  
fishes, rajasás, at which thou hurlest: there is no distance for thee  
nor hindrance for thee, O Bhava; at once thou loolcest over the whole  
earth; from the eastern thou smitest in the northern ocean.

## Notes
Ppp. begins *siśumārā 'jagarāḥ purīṣayā jagā mat-*. The comm. has  
*pulīkayās* (like MS.); he takes *rajasā́* (p. *-sā́ḥ*) as if it were the  
instr. sing, *rájasā;* he passes *jaṣā́s* and *mátsyās* without mention,  
but defines *śiṅśumāra* as 'a kind of crocodile (*nakra*)' and *ajagara*  
as 'a kind of serpent.' For *jaṣā́s*, some of the mss. (including our  
Bp.P.M.W.) have *jakhā́s*, one or two (including our I.) have *jaghā́s*,  
and one of SPP's *jhaṣā́s;* doubtless it is the sea-monster called later  
*jhaṣa*. Nearly all the mss. have *sárvān* in **d** (only our B. ⌊and  
D.Kp.?⌋ and two of SPP's *sárvāṁ*), and SPP's text accordingly admits  
it, though it seems an evident error, and the comm. reads *-vām*. Most  
of the *pada*-mss. resolve *pariṣṭhā́sti* into *-sthā́: ásti* (instead of  
*asti*). We are surprised to find a 'northern' ocean spoken of, and set  
over against the 'eastern' one ⌊cf. xi. 5. 6⌋, but *úttara* cannot well  
mean anything else. Consistency requires the reading *-smint sam-* in  
**e**, but the *t* is accidentally omitted in our text, and SPP's also  
leaves it out.

## Translation
2. Make ye not bodies for the dog, the jackal, for the buzzards (?  
*alíklava*), the vultures, and them that are black \[and\] greedy  
(*aviṣyú*); let thy flies, lord of cattle, let thy birds not find  
themselves at food.

## Notes
'Bodies' (*śarīra*) must be taken here in the sense of 'dead bodies.'  
The accent of *kártam* is, though rather strange, not indefensible, as  
in the former of two parallel clauses; the comm. reads instead kartum*.*  
*Atíklava* is found only here and in 9. 9, and is rendered purely  
conjecturally; the comm. reads instead *aviklabebhyas*, and Ppp.  
*ariklavebhyas*. All the *pada*-mss. separate *mā́vidanta* at the end  
into *mā́: avidanta;* SPP., in his *pada*-text, makes, with the comm.,  
the necessary emendation to *vid-*. The construction and sense of **d**  
are obscure and doubtful; Ppp. has a wholly different reading: *viśase  
mā viśyantu*.

## Translation
17. If they have gone forward to the gods' strongholds, have made the  
*bráhman* their defenses; if (? *yát*) they have encouraged (?  
*upa-vac*) themselves, making a body-protection, a complete  
protection—all that do thou make sapless.

## Notes
The verse occurred above as v. 8. 6, and the comm. declines to repeat  
his explanation there given—which, however, is not in our hands.

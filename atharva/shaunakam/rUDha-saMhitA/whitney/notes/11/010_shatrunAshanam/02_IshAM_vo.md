## Translation
2. Your mastery I know, \[your\] kingdom, O Trishandhi, together with  
red ensigns; what in the atmosphere, what in the sky, and what men  
(*mānavá*) \[are\] on the earth, let those ill-named ones sit (?  
*upa-ās*) in the mind (*cétas*) of Trishandhi.

## Notes
The translation implies *veda rā́jyam* in **a**, while all the  
*pada*-mss. treat the word as a compound (*veda॰rā́jyani*). The comm.  
takes *veda* as an independent word, but renders it as a 3d sing., with  
*triṣandhis* supplied as subject; and he understands the enemies as  
addressed by *vas* in **a**. He supplies *ketavas* to the three *ye*'s  
in **c, d**, regarding *mānavās* as adj., 'human.' And he cuts off the  
last two pādas, adding them instead to vs. 3, and reading at the  
beginning *trisandhe tve* ("= *tava*"); explaining *upāsatām* by  
*sambhajantām*, and making the following nouns its subject. For  
*durṇāmānas* he has *-nam* (as also our B.O.).

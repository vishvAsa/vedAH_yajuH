## Translation
20. Let the white-footed one (f.) fall upon (? *sam-pat*) yonder lines  
of our enemies; let yonder armies of our enemies be confounded today, O  
Nyarbudi.

## Notes
The second pāda is identical with 9. 18 **b**; to be put in any  
connection with it, the words of the first pāda require to be rendered  
otherwise than in 6 **a**, 7 **a**, above. The comm. again reads *śucas*  
for *sicas*, as in the other passage ⌊9. 18: comm. p. 181¹⁷⌋.

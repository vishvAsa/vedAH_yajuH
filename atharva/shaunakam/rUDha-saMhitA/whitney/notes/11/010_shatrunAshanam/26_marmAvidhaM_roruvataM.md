## Translation
26. Let the eagles (*suparṇá*) eat him, pierced to the vitals, crying  
loudly, lying crushed, the evil-minded one—what enemy of ours wishes to  
fight against this opposing offering.

## Notes
The translation implies the emendation (which Ludwig's version also  
makes) of *suparṇāís* to *suparṇā́s* in **a**. The comm. takes it as  
qualifying *śarāis* understood and adjunct of *marmāvídham:* 'pierced  
etc. by well-feathered arrows.' In the irregular meter of the first  
line, the division is perhaps best made before *adantu;* a small  
minority of SPP's mss. so regard it, and accent adántu accordingly, and  
he follows them in his text; our Bp. puts its pāda-division after  
*adantu*, and, with one other ms., leaves the word without accent. ⌊See  
Henry's elaborate conjectures, p. 172: *marmāvídho róruvataḥ suparṇā́  
gaṇāír adantu mṛditám śáyānam*. The other versions imply *mármaviddham*,  
and Bloomfield expressly conjectures *marmaviddhám*, overlooking the  
accent; but the comm. to Prāt. iv. 68 quotes *marmāvídham* as an  
instance of non-separation in *pada*-text.⌋

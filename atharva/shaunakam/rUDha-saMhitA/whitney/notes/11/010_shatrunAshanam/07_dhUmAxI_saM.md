## Translation
7. Let the smoke-eyed (f.) one fall together, and the crop-eared one  
(f.) yell; it being conquered by the army of Trishandhi, let the ensigns  
be red.

## Notes
The comm. supplies *parakīye bale* to *jité;* the *pada*-reading (simply  
*jité*) forbids us to regard the word as fem. dual. He takes the  
epithets in the first half-verse first as applying to the enemy's army,  
and then to the *kṛtyā* which is invoked against it. The verse is  
translated by Bloomfield, as noted above (see 9. 7), at AJP. xi. 340.

## Translation
12. Breath is *virā́j*, breath the directress; breath all worship; breath  
is the sun, the moon; breath they call Prajāpati.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *prāṇo sarvam* ⌊sandhi!⌋ for *prāṇaṁ sarve* in **b**, and its  
**c** is *prāṇo ‘gniś candramās sūryaṣ*. The comm. explains *deṣṭrī* as  
= *svasvavyāpāreṣu sarveṣām prerayitrī paradevatā*.

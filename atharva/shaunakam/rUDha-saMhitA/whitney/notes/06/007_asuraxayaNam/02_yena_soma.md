## Translation
2. By what, O Soma, overpowering one, thou shalt make the Asuras subject  
to us, by that do ye bless us.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has, for **a**, *yebhis soma sahantya*, and, for **c**, *tenā no  
‘vitā* ⌊that is, *avitā́*⌋ *bhuvaḥ*, thus relieving the embarrassing  
change of number ⌊in the verb⌋ from **a, b** to **c**; emendation to  
*vocatāt* in our **c** would accomplish the same result.

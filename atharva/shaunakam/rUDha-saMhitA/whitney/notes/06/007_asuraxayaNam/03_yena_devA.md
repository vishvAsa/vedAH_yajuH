## Translation
3. By what, O gods, ye did repel (*vṛ*) the mights of the Asuras, by  
that do ye yield refuge unto us.

## Notes
Ppp. begins with *yāni*, and has correspondingly *tebhis* for *tena* in  
**c**. This facilitates the rendering of *avṛṇīdhvam* by its natural  
meaning 'did choose'; there is no other known example of a *nā*-form  
from *vṛ* 'repel.' The comm. renders it *tataḥ pṛthakkṛtya yūyaṁ  
sambhaktavantaḥ*. ⌊Ppp. has for **c** *tebhir na adhi vocata*.⌋

## Translation
1. O *apacíts*, fly forth, like a bird (*suparṇá*) from its nest; let  
the sun make remedy; let the moon shine you away.

## Notes
It was Bloomfield (in the article referred to above) who first  
maintained that the *apacít* is a pustule or sore. The comm. directly  
identifies the *apacits* with the *gaṇḍamālās*, "scrofulous swellings of  
the glands of the neck" (BR.), and explains all the processes implied in  
the hymn as referring to such. His etymology of the word under this  
verse is 'gathered offward by reason of defect' (*doṣavaśād apāk  
cīyamānāḥ*), and he describes them as 'beginning from the throat \[and\]  
proceeding downward' (*galād ārabhya adhastāt prasṛtāḥ*). The accent of  
*kṛṇótu* in **c** is the usual antithetical one; SPP. makes a wholly  
unnecessary and very venturesome suggestion to explain it.

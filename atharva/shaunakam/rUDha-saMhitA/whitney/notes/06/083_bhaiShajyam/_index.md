## Comment
⌊Part (vs. 4) prose.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. i. (but without the added vs. 4). Kāuś. (31. 16) employs it in a healing rite, with vii. 76 (against gaṇḍamālā, schol., comm.); vss. 3 c, d and 4 are specified in the sequel of the rite (31. 20, 21); the comm. treats vs. 4 as beginning of hymn 84; it is applied by Kāuś. in the treatment of a sore of unknown origin (ajñātārus: catuṣpād gaṇḍa, comm.).

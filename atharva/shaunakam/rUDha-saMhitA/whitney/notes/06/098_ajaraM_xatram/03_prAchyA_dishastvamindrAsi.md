## Translation
3. Of the eastern quarter thou, O Indra, art king; also of the northern  
quarter art thou, O Vritra-slayer, slayer of foes; where the streams go,  
that is thy conquest; in the south, as bull, thou goest worthy of  
invocation.

## Notes
The verse is found in TS. (ii. 4. 14¹) and MS. (iv. 12. 2). Both begin  
with *prā́cyāṁ diśí*, and have *údīcyām* (without ⌊the meter-disturbing⌋  
*diśáḥ*) in **b**, ending with *vṛtrahā́ ’si;* in **d**, TS. has (better)  
*edhi* for *eṣi*, and MS. the same, with *hávyas* before it. Ppp. is  
mutilated, but has evidently *prācyāṁ diśi*. The third pāda evidently  
describes the west; that does not suit the basin of central India.

## Translation
2. Ye who run (*dhāv*) stringing \[the bow\], drawing \[the arrow\]  
(*ā-yam*), hurling—handless are ye, O foes; Indra hath now demolished  
you.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
⌊For *ā-yam*, cf. vi. 65. 1.⌋ Our text reads at the end *-śarāit*, on  
the authority of Bp.E.I.R.T. and O.; all SPP's authorities ⌊save his B.,  
which has *-śarīn*⌋ give *-śarīt*, which he has accordingly rightly  
adopted, as the better supported as well as the regular form ⌊cf. vi.  
75. 1⌋. Ppp. has *parā ’śarī*. ⌊With regard to these *āi*-forms, see the  
note to vi. 32. 2.⌋ SPP., contrary to his usual practice, retains the  
*ḥ* of *śatravaḥ* before *sth-*. The comm. has *stana* in **c**.  
⌊"Demolished" stands in rapport with "demolisher" of 65. 1.⌋

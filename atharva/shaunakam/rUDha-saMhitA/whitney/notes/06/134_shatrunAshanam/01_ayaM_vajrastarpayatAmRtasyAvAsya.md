## Translation
1. Let this thunderbolt gratify itself with right (? *ṛtásya*), let it  
smite down his kingdom, away his life; let it crush \[his\] neck, crush  
up his nape, as Cachīpati of Vritra.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vratena* instead of *ṛtasya* in **a**, meaning perhaps  
*mṛtena*, which would be a welcome improvement, suggesting emendation of  
our text to *-tām mṛtásya* 'on the dead man,' anticipating the result of  
the action imprecated in the next pāda. Ludwig translates as if it were  
*amṛtasya*, which is to be rejected. The comm. renders it simply  
'truth, or sacrifice,' and regards a staff (*dhāryamāṇo daṇḍaḥ*) as  
intended by *vajra;* in **b** he apparently overlooks and omits *ava*.  
The *pada*-reading at end of **c** is *uṣṇíhā*, as if for *-hāu*, dual;  
the comm. reads *-hāḥ*, which is doubtless the right form. Ppp. leaves  
off the last pāda, but whether it ends **c** with *uṣṇihāḥ* I am not  
informed. Ppp. also has *jīvam* for *jīvitam* in **b**, and *skandhā*  
for *grivās* in **c**. ⌊The Anukr. ignores the *jagatī* rhythm of **a**  
and **c**.⌋

## Translation
1. Glorious let the bounteous Indra make me; glorious both  
heaven-and-earth here; glorious let god Savitar make me; may I be dear  
here to the giver of the sacrificial gift.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *me indro maghavā* in **a**; for **b**, *yaśasaṁ soma varuṇo  
vāyur agniḥ;* and ends with *-ṇāyā syām aham*. The comm. has *dhātur*  
instead of *dā-* in **d**. As *jagatī*, the verse is both irregular and  
deficient.

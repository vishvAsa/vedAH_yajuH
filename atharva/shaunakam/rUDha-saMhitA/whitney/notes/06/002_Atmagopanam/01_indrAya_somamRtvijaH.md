## Translation
1. For Indra, O priests, press the soma, and add the water; \[Indra\]  
who shall hear the praiser's words and my call.

## Notes
Or, 'the words and call of me the praiser.' With **b** compare RV. vii.  
32. 6 **d**. Ppp. has, for **b, c**, *śṛṇotanā tu dhāvata: stotriyaṁ  
havaṁ śṛṇavad dhavaṁ tu naḥ*. The comm. regards *ā́ dhāvata* as referring  
to the process called *ādhāvana*, performed for the *adābhya graha*, and  
refers to ĀpśS. xii. 8. 2: or, alternatively, to the general  
purification of the soma. The concluding four syllables of each verse  
seem like secondary appendages.

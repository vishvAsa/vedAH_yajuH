## Translation
2. Offered to art thou, offered unto; thou art the weapon of the seers  
(*ṛṣi*); partaking (*pra-aś*) first of the vow (*vratá*), be thou a  
hero-slayer, O girdle.

## Notes
For the first pāda Ppp. has only the single word *āhuta* (perhaps by  
accidental omission); in **d** it reads *avīraghnī*. The comm. explains  
*vrata* as either 'vow' or, by the usual secondary application, 'milk  
etc' (*kṣīrādikam*); to *abhihutā* in **a** it prefixes an explanatory  
*sampāta-*.

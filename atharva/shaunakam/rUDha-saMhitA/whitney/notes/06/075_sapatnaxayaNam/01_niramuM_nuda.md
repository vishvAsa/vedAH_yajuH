## Translation
1. I thrust yon man out of home, the rival who fights \[us\], with the  
oblation of ejectment; Indra hath demolished him.

## Notes
One of our mss. (O.) reads at the end also here (cf. 66. 2, above ⌊and  
note to 32. 2⌋) *-śarāit*. Ppp., also TB.Āp., have *nirb-* at the  
beginning of **c**; and TB.Āp. have *eṇam* in **d** (the two agree in  
every point through the hymn). ⌊Ppp. *parāśarī*, as at 66. 2.⌋

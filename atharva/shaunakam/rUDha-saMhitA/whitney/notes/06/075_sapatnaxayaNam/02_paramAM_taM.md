## Translation
2. Let Indra, Vritra-slayer, thrust him to the most distant distance,  
whence he shall not come back, through constant years (*sámā*).

## Notes
Ppp.TB.Āp. read *tvā* for *tám* in **a**, and TB.Āp. *nayatu* for  
*nudatu* in **b**, while Ppp. has, for **b**, *indro devo acīkḷpat;* all  
three have *-yasi* at end of **c**.

## Translation
3. As the Ādityas, severe (*ugrá*), not bearing enmity, united with the  
Vasus, with the Maruts, so, O three-named one, not bearing enmity, do  
thou make these people here like-minded.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **a**, *vasavas* instead of *vasubhis*, and, in **c, d**,  
*-yamānam imaṁ janā saṁmanasaṁ kṛṇu tvam*, which is better in so far as  
it makes *ahṛṇ-* adjunct of the object rather than of the subject in the  
sentence; our text desiderates *ahṛṇīyamānān*. The verse is found also  
in TS. (ii. 1. 11³), which has, in **b**, *marúdbhī rudrā́ḥ* (our reading  
seems a corruption of this) *samájānatā ’bhí;* and, in **c, d**,  
*-yamānā víśve devā́ḥ sámanaso bhavantu*. A god *triṇāman* appears to be  
met with only in this verse; the one meant is probably Agni, as  
conjectured by BR., and also explained by the comm.

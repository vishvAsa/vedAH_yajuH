## Translation
1. Both the five and the fifty that gather against those of the nape—let  
them all disappear from here, like the noises (? *vāká*) of the  
*apacíts*.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Mányās* etc. may of course as well be nom., and the comm. so  
understands them, supplying *gaṇḍamālās* 'pimples, swellings' for them  
to agree with; *abhí* would then be left without object, or with  
indefinite object, 'one,' understood. The comm. renders *vākā́s* by  
*vacanīyā doṣāḥ*, and takes *apacítām* as accus. fem. pple: "as  
blameworthy faults leave an honored woman"! Under VS. xvii. 57, the  
comm. renders *vākā́s* by *vākyāni*.

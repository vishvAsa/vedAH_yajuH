## Comment
⌊"Verse" 3 is prose.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xix.; and in TS. iii. 3.82-3. Kāuś. uses the hymn in a rite ⌊21. 7⌋ for prosperity (for fatness in grain, comm.), and it is reckoned (note to 19. 1) to the puṣṭika mantras. Vāit. (31. 4) has it in the sattra, on the ekāṣṭakā day, with offerings to the two deities mentioned.

## Translation
1. Let the lord of the cloud (*nábhas*) here, the fattener, protect us,  
\[grant\] unequalledness (?) in our houses.

## Notes
For the obscure *ásamāti* in **c**, the minor Pet. Lex. conjectures  
*ásamarti* 'unharmedness,' which TS. has in the corresponding pāda,  
making an *anuṣṭubh* of the verse, with *gṛhā́ṇām ásamartyāi bahávo no  
gṛhā́ asan* for second half; the comm. explains it as 'absence of  
division (*pariccheda*)\* of the grain lying in our storehouses'; Ppp.  
is defaced, but appears to have read something different. TS. further  
has *nábhasā purás* for *-saspátis* in **a**. Most of our *saṁhitā* mss.  
(except E.H.s.m.O.) read *ṇaḥ* after *gṛhéṣu;* SPP. reports nothing of  
the kind from his authorities. The comm. regards Agni as intended by the  
"fattener." \*⌊I think the comm. intends rather 'absence of  
determination or measure': i.e. "may the grain be abundant beyond  
measure."⌋

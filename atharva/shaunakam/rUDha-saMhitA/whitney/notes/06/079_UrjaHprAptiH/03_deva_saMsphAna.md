## Translation
3. O divine fattener, thou art master of thousand-fold prosperity;  
bestow upon us of that; assign to us of that; of that from thee may we  
be sharers.

## Notes
In the first clause, Ppp. corrupts to *sahasrapośiṣe;* it omits *tasya  
no rāsva*, and has *bhakṣīmahi* for *bhaktivāṅsaḥ syāma*. TS. has  
*sahasrap-*, and, after the division-mark, *sā́ no rāsvā́ ’jyānim* etc.  
(an entirely different close). The last part of the verse is found in K.  
v. 4, which reads at the end *bhaktivāno bhūyāsma;* and TB. iii. 7. 5⁷  
has the last phrase with ⌊tásyās te⌋ bhakṣivā́ṇaḥ syāma: *a curious set  
of variants, all irregular or anomalous. The verse, according to the  
comm., is addressed to the sun.*

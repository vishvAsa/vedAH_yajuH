## Translation
 3. That fluttering mind (*manaská*) that has found place in (*śritá*)  
thy heart—from it I set free thy jealousy, like the hot vapor from a bag  
of skin.

## Notes
The translation implies at the end the emendation (first proposed in  
BR.) of the apparently senseless *nṛ́tes* into *dṛ́tes*, which the comm.  
reads, and which SPP. has accordingly admitted into his text; the result  
of fermentation, escaping when the vessel is opened, is apparently  
intended. Ppp., however, has *nṛtes*, although it gives sundry various  
readings (in part mere corruptions): for **a**, *yad yan me hṛdi  
srukaṁ;* in **b**, *prathayiṣṇukam;* in **c**, *taṁ te riṣyāmi mu-*. The  
comm. divides **b** into *manas kam patayiṣṇu kam*.

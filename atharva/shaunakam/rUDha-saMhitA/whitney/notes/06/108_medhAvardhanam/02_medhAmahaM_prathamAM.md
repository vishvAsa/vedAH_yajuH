## Translation
2. I call first, unto the aid of the gods, wisdom filled with *bráhman*,  
quickened by *bráhman*, praised by seers, drunk of (?) by Vedic  
students.

## Notes
Ppp. omits *brahmajūtām* in **b**, without rectifying the meter, which  
can only be saved by leaving out the superfluous *prathamā́m* in **a**.  
It avoids, in **c**, the doubtful *prapītām* by reading instead  
*praṇihitām;* and it has *avasā* (for *avase ā?*) *vṛṇe* in **d**.  
*Prápītām* should perhaps be understood as coming from *pra-pī* or  
*pra-pyā;* the comm. takes it alternatively\* both ways, paraphrasing it  
with either *sevitām* or *pravardhitām*. The Anukr. reckons  
*brahmaṇvatīm* to **b** (so do the *pada*-mss.), and passes without  
notice the deficiency of a syllable in **a**; in fact, *prathamā́m* is  
intruded, and the verse otherwise a good *anuṣṭubh*. \*⌊That is, he  
refers it to *pibati* by *sevitām* and to *pī* or *pyā* by  
*pravardhitām*.⌋

## Translation
4. The wisdom that the being-making seers, possessed of wisdom,  
know—with that wisdom do thou make me today, O Agni, possessed of  
wisdom.

## Notes
Many of the mss. (including our P.M.H.I.K.O.) leave *vidus* unaccented  
at the end of **b**. The second half-verse is VS. xxxii. 14 **c, d**  
(which has *kuru* for *kṛṇu*); ⌊so also RV. *khila* to x. 151⌋.

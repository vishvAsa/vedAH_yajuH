## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (in the verse-order 1, 3, 2). Used by Kāuç. (23. 12-16) in a ceremony for welfare called citrākarman: after due preparation and ceremony, the ears are cut with vs. 2, and the blood is wiped off and eaten (by the creature, comm.) with vs. 3. The hymn is reckoned (note to 19. 1) to the puṣṭika mantras. The schol. also uses vs. 2 in the ceremony of letting loose a bull (note to 24. 19).

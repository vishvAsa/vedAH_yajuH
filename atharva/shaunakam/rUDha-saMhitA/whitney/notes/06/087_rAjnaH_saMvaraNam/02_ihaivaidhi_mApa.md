## Translation
2. Be thou just here; be not moved away; like a mountain, not unsteady;  
O Indra, stand thou fixed just here; here do thou maintain royalty.

## Notes
RV.TB. have again *-cācalis* at end of **b**, and TB. has *vyathiṣṭhās*  
for *ápa cyoṣṭhās* in **a**. The metrical contraction *parvate ’va* is  
not opposed by the Anukr. At beginning of **c**, RV.TB.Āp. have the  
better reading *índra ive ’há* (to be read *índre ’ve ’há:* whence,  
doubtless, the AV. version); and, as the comm. gives the same, SPP. has  
adopted it in his text, against all his authorities as well as ours. The  
AV. version (found also in Ppp.) is not to be rejected as impossible;  
the person is himself addressed in it as Indra: i.e., as chief. Ppp. has  
*ni* for *u* in **d**. ĀpśS. (xiv. 27. 7) has the RV. version, except  
*yajñam* for *rāṣṭram* in **d**. In our text an accent-sign has dropped  
out under the *ṣṭhe* of *-ṣṭhe ’há* in **c-d**.

## Translation
1. The berry (*pippalī́*), remedy for what is bruised (? *kṣiptá*), and  
remedy for what is pierced—that did the gods prepare (*sam-kalpay-*)  
that is sufficient for life.

## Notes
As elsewhere, the mss. waver between *pippalī* and *piṣpalī* (our  
Bp.E.O.R.p.m. read the latter). All the *pada*-mss. stupidly give  
*jī́vita: vāí* as two independent words. Ppp. has, in **a**, *kṣupta-*  
for *kṣipta-*; and, for **b**, *uta ca viśvabh-*; further, for **d**,  
*alaṁ jīvātavā yati*.\* In the *kampa* between **a** and **b**, SPP.  
unaccountably reads *ū3ta* instead of *u1ta;* the fact that his mss.  
happen in this case all to agree in giving *ū3ta* is of no account  
whatever, since they are wildly inconsistent in this whole class of  
cases; among our mss. are found *ū3*, *ū1*, and *u3*. The comm. gives  
two alternatives both for *kṣipta-* and for *atividdha-*: for the former  
*tiraskṛta* (of other remedies) and *vātarogaviśeṣa*, and so on.  
\*⌊Intending -*tavāi iti*?⌋

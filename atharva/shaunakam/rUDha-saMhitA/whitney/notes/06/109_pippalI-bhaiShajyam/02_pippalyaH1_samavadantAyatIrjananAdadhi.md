## Translation
2. The berries talked together, coming from their birth: whomever we  
shall reach living, that man shall not be harmed.

## Notes
The second half-verse is the same, without variant, as RV. x. 97. 17  
**c, d** (found also as VS. xii. 91 **c, d**, and in TS. iv. 2. 65 and  
MS. ii. 7. 13: the latter reading *-mahe* in **c**); while the first  
half is a sort of parody of the corresponding part of the same verse:  
*avapátantīr avadan divá óṣadhayas pári;* our *-vadantā ”yatī́s* is  
probably a corruption of *-vadann āy-*. There is again, in **a**, a  
disagreement among the mss. as to *pippalyàs*, our Bp.E.I.O., with a  
number of SPP's authorities, giving *piṣp-*. The comm. explains the word  
by *hastipippalyādijātibhedabhinnāḥ sarvāḥ pippalyaḥ;* and their "birth"  
to have been contemporaneous with the churning of the *amṛta*. ⌊Ppp.  
ends with *pāuruṣaḥ*.⌋

## Translation
1. Since, an ancient one, to be praised at the sacrifices, thou sittest  
as *hótar* both of old and recent—do thou, O Agni, both gratify thine  
own self, and bestow (*ā-yaj*) good fortune on us.

## Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 11. 10 (also TA. x. 1⁶⁹). Our text has several  
bad readings, which are corrected in the other version: *kám* in **a**  
should be *kam*, *satsi* should be *sátsi*, and *piprā́yasva* should be  
*-práy-* (TA. has, in **a**, *pratnóṣi*, which its comm. explains by  
*vistārayasi!*): this last the comm. also reads, but renders it  
*ājyādihaviṣā pūraya*. The verse is not at all a *pan̄kti*, although  
capable of being read as 40 syllables.

## Translation
3. We have become united with splendor, with fatness (*páyas*), with  
bodies (*tanū́*), with propitious mind; let Tvashṭar make for us here  
wider room; let him smooth down what of our body is torn apart.

## Notes
This verse is found also in many other texts, its first half generally  
without variation; only PB. (i. 3. 9: this half-verse alone) has  
*tapobhis* for *tanūbhis* at end of **a**. VS. (ii. 24 et al.) has for  
**c, d**: *tváṣṭā sudátro vi dadhātu rā́yó ‘nu mārṣṭu tanvò yád  
víliṣṭam*, and the rest follow this rather than our text; only TA. (ii.  
4. 1) has *no átra* in **c**, and TS. (i. 4. 44) *no átra várivaḥ  
kṛṇotu;* MS. (i. 3. 38 et al.) and śśS. (iv. 11. 6) add *nas* (like AV.)  
after *ánu* in **d**, and MS. ends with *víriṣṭam* (TS., of course, has  
*tanúvas*). Ppp. has, in **c**, *sudatro varivaṣ kṛ-*, differing from  
all. The comm. renders *anu mārṣṭu* by *hastena śodhayatu*. ⌊Cf. von  
Schroeder's *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 72.⌋

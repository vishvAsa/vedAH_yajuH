## Translation
2. Again let breath, again let soul (*ātmán*) come unto us; again let  
sight, again let spirit (*ásu*) come unto us; let Vāiśvānara, our  
unharmed body-protector, stand between \[us and\] all difficulties.

## Notes
Compare TA. ii. 5¹⁷, MS. i. 2. 3, Āp. x. 18. 3, all of which have a  
different (and TA. a much longer) enumeration in **a, b**, with the verb  
*ā́ ’gāt* 'hath come.' In **c**, MS. and Āp. omit *nas*, TA. reads  
instead *me;* in **d**, for *antás tiṣṭhāti*, TA. and Āp. have *áva  
bādhatām*, MS. *ápa b-*. Ppp. agrees nearly with MS. by reading in **a**  
*punar manaḩ punar āyur na mā ”gaṅ;* in **c** it has *adbhutas* for  
*adabáhas;* its **d** is *antas tiṣṭhāsi duritād avadyāt;* and it  
combines *tanūpāntas*.⌋ ⌊Cf. also MGS. 1. 3. 2 and p. 152, s.v. *punar  
me;* and MB. i. 6. 34.⌋

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Reckoned by Kāuç. (9. 2) to the bṛhachānti gaṇa, and also (note to 7. 14) to the apāṁ sūktāni; and again (41. 14), with vi. 19 etc., used in a rite for good fortune: as to its combination (30. 11) with the preceding hymn, see that hymn. In Vāit. (4. 14) it accompanies in the parvan sacrifices the pouring out of water.

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., and in K. xl. 9. Reckoned by Kāuś. (9. 2) to the bṛhachānti gaṇa, and used (41. 14), with vi. 19, 23, 24, etc., in a rite for good fortune; in the kāmya ceremonies (59. 10), for splendor*; also, in the chapter of portents (133. 2), on occasion of one's house burning down; it is further (note to 50. 13) included in the rāudra gaṇa. In Vāit. (2. 17) vs. 3 accompanies, in the parvan sacrifice, two offerings of butter to Agni and Soma. *⌊Varcas: so the comm.; but Bloomfield reads vyacas, which accords better with 1 d of the text.⌋

## Translation
2. O Anumati, assent to (*anu-man*) this; O design ('ā́kūti*), mayest  
thou constrain (*sam-nam*) this. Ye gods, send etc. etc.*

## Notes
'Design' (*ā́kūti*) is evidently here a personification  
(*saṁkalpābhimāninī devatā*, comm.), as is often *ánumati* 'assent.' No  
ms. reads *namas*, without accent, and SPP. accordingly prints *námas*  
in his text; ours emends to *namas;* the comm. takes the word as a noun;  
*idam* in **a** he explains by *madabhilaṣitam*. The Anukr. heeds not  
that the first pāda is *triṣṭubh*.

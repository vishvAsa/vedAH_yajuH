## Translation
1. Them yonder let the winged missile come upon; what the owl utters,  
\[be\] that to no purpose, or that the dove makes its track (*padá*) at  
the fire.

## Notes
The second and third pādas are RV. x. 165. 4 **a, b** (we had **d** in  
the last verse of the preceding hymn); RV. omits *vā* in **c**; its  
addition damages the meter of the *pāda*, but the Anukr. overlooks this.  
⌊Pādas **b, c** also occur at MGS. ii. 17. 1 **d**—cf. under h. 27.⌋

## Translation
2. Homage be to thee, O Nirṛti, thou of keen keenness; unfasten the  
bond-fetters of iron. Yama verily giveth thee back to me; to that Yama,  
to death, be homage.

## Notes
The "thee" of the second half-verse is doubtless the person on whose  
behalf the spell is uttered. The first half-verse is found combined with  
our 3 **c, d** into one verse in VS. (xii. 63) and TS.MS. (as above).  
They all read *sú* for *astu* in **a**, and for *tiginatejas* TS. has  
*viśvarūpe* (Ppp. has *viśvavāre*); their **b** is *ayasmáyaṁ ví cṛtá  
bandhám etám*. Ppp. has *-yān pra mumugdhi pāśān* for **b**, and, for  
**c, d**, our 3 **c, d**. The whole verse is nearly repeated below, as  
84. 3. Only the last pāda is *jagatī*.

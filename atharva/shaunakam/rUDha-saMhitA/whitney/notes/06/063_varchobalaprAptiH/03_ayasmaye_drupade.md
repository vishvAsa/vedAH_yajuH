title = "०३ अयस्मये द्रुपदे"

## Translation
3. Thou wast bound here to an iron post (*drupadá*), bridled with deaths  
that are a thousand. Do thou, in concord with Yama, with the Fathers,  
make this man ascend to the highest firmament.

## Notes
We have the same change of address here as in the preceding verse, and  
it proves that the make-up of the material as given by the Yajus texts  
is more original and correct. They read, in **c, d**, *yaména tváṁ  
yamyā́* (TS.MS. *-yā́*) *saṁvidānó ’ttamé* (TS. *-mám*) *nā́ke* (TS.  
*-kam*) *ádhi rohayāi ’nam* (TS. *-ye ’mám*). Ppp., as noticed above,  
has **c, d** of this verse as 2 **c, d**, reading *-dāno ’ttame nāke*  
(like V.S.MS.). The last pāda is found also as that of i. 9. 2, 4; xi.  
1. 4. With the contraction *bedhiṣe ’ha*, the verse would be a good  
*triṣṭubh*. ⌊The vs. recurs at vi. 84. 4.⌋

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. v. Used by Kāuç. (47. 14) in a rite of sorcery with the preceding hymn (which see); and also later in the same rite (47. 18), with smiting down the staff three times. *⌊The Anukr. text is here confused and defective. Its reading (with the probable omission supplied in brackets) is, antyā bhurik [anuṣṭub, dvitiyā bhurik] tripadā gāyatrī.⌋

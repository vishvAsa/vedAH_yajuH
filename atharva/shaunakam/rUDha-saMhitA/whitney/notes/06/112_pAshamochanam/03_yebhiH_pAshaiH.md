## Translation
3. With what bonds the overslaughed one is bound apart, applied and tied  
up on each limb—let them be released, for they are releasers; wipe off  
difficulties, O Pūshan, on the embryo-slayer.

## Notes
The comm. again commits the violence of understanding *párivittas* in  
**a** as if it were *parivettā* 'the overslaugher.' The participles in  
**b** are nom. sing, masc., applying to the bound person. The comm.  
again reads *utthitas*, again supported by a few mss. (including our  
H.I.), and the *pada*-text again has *útsitaḥ*, undivided. All our mss.  
save one (K.), and all but one of SPP's, read *te* (without accent) in  
**c**; the translation given implies the emendation to *té*, which is  
made in SPP's text, also on the authority of the comm. After it, SPP.  
reads *mucyantām*, with, as he claims, all but one of his authorities;  
of ours, only D.Kp.T. have it, and K. *mucyatām*, all the rest  
*muñcantām*, as in our text. In Ppp., this verse is found in i., in this  
form: *ebhiṣ pāśāir muduṣāu patir nibaddhaḥ paroparārpito an̄ge-an̄ge vi  
te cṛtyantāṁ vicṛtām hi santi* etc. (**d** as in our text).

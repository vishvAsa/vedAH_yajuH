## Translation
1. If knowing, if unknowing, we have committed sins, do ye free us from  
that, O all gods, accordant.

## Notes
The reading *sajóṣasas* at the end in our text is, though evidently  
preferable, hardly more than an emendation, since it is read only by our  
P.M.T.; SPP. gives *sajoṣasas;* the comm. takes the word as a  
nominative. With the verse may be compared VS. viii. 13 f (prose). The  
redundant syllable in **a** is ignored by the Anukr.

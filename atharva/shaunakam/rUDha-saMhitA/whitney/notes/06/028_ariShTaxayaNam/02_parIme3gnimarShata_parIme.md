## Translation
 2. These have taken fire about; these have led the cow about; they  
have gained themselves fame (*śrávas*) among the gods—who shall venture  
to attack them?

## Notes
The RV. has the same verse at x. 155. 5 (also VS., xxxv. 18, precisely  
the same text with RV.), reading, for **a, b**, *párī ’mé gā́m aneṣata  
páry agním ahṛṣata*. Ppp. transposes **a** and **b** and reads *pary  
agnim aharṣata* (a false form). The *arṣata* of our text is plainly  
nothing but a corruption; and part of the mss. (including our P.M.W.I.)  
have instead *ariṣata* ⌊or *arīṣata;* K. *riṣatu*⌋.

## Translation
1. Unto thee, O Indra, on account of width, thee against (*purā́*)  
distress I call; I call on the stern corrector, the many-named,  
sole-born.

## Notes
In spite of its wrong accent (cf. *aṇimatás, sthavimatás*\*) *várimatas*  
is probably an adverb in *tas*. The comm. interprets it, doubtless  
correctly, "for the sake of width" (*urutvād dhetoḥ*): i.e., of free  
space, opposed to distress or narrowness. ⌊The derivatives of *aṅh* and  
*uru* are in frequent antithesis, as, e.g., at RV. v. 24. 4.⌋  
'Sole-born,' i.e. 'unique.' Ppp. ends **b** with *aṅhúraṇebhyaḥ*. \*⌊MS.  
iii. 10. 4, p. 135, 1. 4.⌋

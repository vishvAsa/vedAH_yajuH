## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (for other correspondences, see under the verses). Employed by Kāuś. (31. 22) in a remedial rite against reviling by a Brahman, against dropsy, etc. (the direction in the text is simply iti mantroktasyāu ’ṣadhībhir dhūpayati), making incense with herbs; and it is regarded (note to 32. 27) as included among the aṅholin̄gas.

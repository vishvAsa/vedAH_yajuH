title = "०१ यमो मृत्युरघमारो"

## Translation
1. Yama, death, the evil-killer, the destroyer, the brown śarva, the  
blue-locked archer, the god-folk that have arisen with their army—let  
them avoid our heroes.

## Notes
All the authorities read *ástrā* in **b**; both editions make the  
necessary emendation to *ástā*, which is also read by the comm. and by  
Ppp. Ppp. further, in **b**, has *bhava* instead of *babhrus*, and ends  
with *-khaṇḍī*; in **c** it has *vṛn̄janti* (its exchange of *-ti* and  
*-tu* is common).

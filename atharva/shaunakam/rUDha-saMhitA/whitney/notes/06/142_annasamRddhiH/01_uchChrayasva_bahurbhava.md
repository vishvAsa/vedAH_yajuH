## Translation
1. Rise up (*ut-śri*), become abundant (*bahú*) with thine own  
greatness, O barley; ruin (*mṛ*) all receptacles; let not the bolt from  
heaven smite thee.

## Notes
Instead of *mṛṇīhi* in **c**, the comm. reads *vṛṇīhi*, which he says  
is, 'by letter-substitution,' for *pṛṇīhi* 'fill'! *Pṛṇīhi* would be an  
easier reading, and was conjectured by Ludwig, and before him by  
Aufrecht (KZ. xxvii. 218). ⌊Griffith and Bl., 'fill them till they  
burst.'⌋

## Translation
3. With honey I mix (*pṛc*) the streams; the rugged (? *párvata*)  
mountains \[are\] honey; honey is the *Páruṣṇī*, the *Cī́pālā;* weal be  
to thy mouth, weal to thy heart.

## Notes
The comm. reads at the beginning *madhv ā pṛñce;* he takes the streams  
for the Ganges etc., the mountains (*párvata*) for the Himālaya etc.,  
and the hills (*girí*) for their foot-hills; the *paruṣṇī* for the great  
river of that name, and *śīpālā* as adj., 'rich in  water-grass'  
(*śāivāla*): all these are to pour on (*ā siñcantu*) poison-removing  
honey. The Ppp. text is quite different: *abhi nā pṛkṣa nadyaṣ parvatāi  
’va girayo madhu: madhu pṛṣṭī śīpālā samāste ‘stu śaṁ hṛdaya*. Perhaps  
*paruṣṇī* signifies here an 'eddying' brook, and *śīpālā* a pool 'rich  
in water-plants.' ⌊Considering that the effect of snake-bite upon heart  
and blood must have been well known to even the most unlettered Hindu, I  
am tempted to suggest emendation of *āsné* to *asné*.⌋ ⌊In R. and W's  
ed., correct *nadyò3* to *nadyà1ḥ*.⌋

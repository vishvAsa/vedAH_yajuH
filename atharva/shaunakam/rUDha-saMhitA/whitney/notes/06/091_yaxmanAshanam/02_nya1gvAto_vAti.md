## Translation
2. Downward blows the wind; downward burns the sun; downward the  
inviolable \[cow\] milks; downward be thy complaint.

## Notes
This verse is RV. x. 60. 11; the latter rectifies the meter of **a** by  
introducing *áva* (*‘va*) before *vāti* ⌊or rather, by not being guilty  
of the haplography which spoils our AV. text: cf. note to iv. 5. 5⌋. The  
Anukr. ignores the deficiency of our text.

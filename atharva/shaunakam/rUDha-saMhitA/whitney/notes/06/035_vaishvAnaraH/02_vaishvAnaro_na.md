## Translation
2. Vāiśvānara, our ally (*sajū́s), hath come unto this our offering—Agni,  
at our songs, in our distresses.*

## Notes
The two Sūtras have for **c** *agnir ukthena vāhasā* (found in VS.MS. in  
combination with 1 **a, b**); Ppp., as also noticed above, has for **c**  
our 1 **c**. The translation given implies that *áṅhasu* (which is read  
by all the mss. without exception, and is quoted so in the commentary to  
Prāt. iv. 32) is the same with the usual *áṅhaḥsu;* no stem *áṅhan* is  
found anywhere else; the comm. foolishly explains it by  
*abhigantavyeṣu*, adj. to *uktheṣu*. The translation, moreover,  
represents the *pada*-text reading of *ā́gamat* in **a** as *ā́: agamat;*  
but it seems altogether likely that the true meaning is *ā́: gamat* 'may  
he come.'

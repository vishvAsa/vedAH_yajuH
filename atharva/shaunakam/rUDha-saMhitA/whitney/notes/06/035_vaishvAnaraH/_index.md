## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., and in the śrāuta-Sūtras of Āśvalāyana (viii. 11.4) and śān̄khāyana (x. 9. 17); the first verse, further, in VS. and MS. This hymn and the one following are called by Kāuś. (31. 5) vāiśvānarīya, and used in a general remedial rite; and verse 35. 2 is reckoned (note to 32. 27) to the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa. In Vāit, hymn 35 appears alone in the agnicayana (29. 5), with i. 21 and vii. 84, accompanying the covering of the first courses of bricks.

## Translation
3. May Vāiśvānara shape the praise and song of the An̄girases; may he  
extend to them brightness (*dyumná*) \[and\] heaven (*svàr*).

## Notes
Of the two Sūtras, śśS. supports our *cākḷpat* (comm. *cakṛpat*) in  
sense by reading *jījanat;* AśS. has the better reading *cākanat* 'take  
pleasure in.' AśS. also has *an̄girobhyas* in **a** (both preserve the  
*a* of *an̄g-*); Ppp. has no *an̄girobhis*. In **b**, Ppp. and śśS. have  
*yajñam* for *uktham;* AśS. has *stoma* for *-mam*, and in **c** omits  
*ā* (if it is not a misprint); Ppp. has *pra* instead of *āi ’ṣu*.

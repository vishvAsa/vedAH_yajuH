## Translation
1. May Vāyu collect them; let Tvashṭar stay fast in order to \[their\]  
prosperity; may Indra bless them; let Rudra take care for \[their\]  
numbers.

## Notes
*Samā́karat* (p. *sam॰ā́karat*) might, of course, also be indicative  
(*sam-ā́-akarat*). Ppp., in **c**, combines *indrā ”bhyo*, and reads  
*bruvat;* in **d**, it has *‘va gachatu* for *cikitsatu*. The comm.  
renders *dhriyatām* by *dhārayatu*, and **d** by  
*pādāsyādirogaparihāreṇa bahvīḥ karotu*.

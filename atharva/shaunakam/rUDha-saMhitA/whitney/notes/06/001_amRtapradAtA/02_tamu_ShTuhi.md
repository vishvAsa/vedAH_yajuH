## Translation
2. Praise thou him who is within the river, son of truth (*satyá*),  
\[him\] the young, of unhateful speech, very propitious.

## Notes
Again all the mss. spoil the structure of the verse by putting the  
division-mark after *sūnúḥ*. In both verses, SPP's text follows the  
mss., while ours emends in accordance with the true sense—which is now  
further supported by the other text, and by Ppp. An easier reading is  
offered by AśS., namely *tam u ṣṭuhy antaḥsindhuṁ sūnuṁ satyasya  
yuvānam: adro-*. Indra is called "son of truth" in RV. viii. 58 (69). 4;  
the descriptions of the verse suit Savitar ill. The comm. understands  
'the river (*sindhu*)' as "the ocean (*samudra*), in the midst of which  
the sun is seen rising," and foolishly gives as alternative sense of  
*yuvan* "repeller (*yu*) of darkness." The Anukr. apparently scans 11: 6  
+ 8 = 25.

## Translation
3. May he, indeed, god Savitar, impel (*sū*) for us many amrtas, both  
the good praises, unto welfare.

## Notes
The division of the mss. is this time that also of our text; but the  
meter is pretty hopeless (*bhū́ri amṛ́tā* would rectify **b**), and **c**  
apparently corrupt. Ppp. has, for **b**, *sāviṣad vasupatir vasūni*  
(making **a, b** nearly equal RV. vii. 45. 3 **a, b**), and AśS. the  
same with omission of *vasūni*. In **c**, Ppp. ends with *sugātum*  
(perhaps 'to sing well both good praises'); AśS. reads *ubhe sukṣitī  
sudhātuḥ*. The Pet. Lex. ⌊vii. 1045⌋ suggests, for **c**, *ubhe srutī su  
gātave:* cf. RV. ix. 78. 2; the varieties of reading show that the pāda  
was virtually unintelligible to the text-makers. The comm. takes  
*suṣṭutī* first as the *bṛhat* and *rathantara sāmans*, and then,  
alternatively, as the *stuta* and *śastra*. Of course, if the verse is  
to be taken (as seems necessary) as a spoiled *gāyatrī*, we ought to  
read *sā́viṣat*, with accent. The Anukr. seems to scan 11 + 6: 9 = 26.

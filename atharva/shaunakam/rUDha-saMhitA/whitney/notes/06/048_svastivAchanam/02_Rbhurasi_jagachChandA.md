title = "०२ ऋभुरसि जगच्छन्दा"

+++
## Translation
2. A Ribhu art thou, with *jágat* for meter; I take hold etc. etc.

## Notes
All the other texts put this verse last, as it properly belongs.  
śB.TS.GB. end all three verses in the same way; CCS. omits the refrain  
after the first verse, but states that it is the same in the others;  
KśS. ends also with *-chandās* in the second and third verses. Instead  
of *ṛbhúr asi*, TS. has *sághā ’si* (*jágatīchandās*), GB. and PB. have  
*svaro ‘si gayo ‘si*, and śśS. has *sakhā ‘si patvā*.

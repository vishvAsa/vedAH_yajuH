## Translation
2. The water which the gods poured for you, O *upajī́kās*, on the waste,  
with that, which is impelled by the gods, spoil ye this poison.

## Notes
All the authorities\* read *upajīkās*, vocative, which was, without good  
reason, altered to *upajī́kās* in our edition. The comm., however, with  
his ordinary disregard of accent, understands *devā́s* as vocative, and  
*upajīkās* as nominative. He quotes from TA. v. i. 4 the passage which  
describes the *upadī́kās* (so called there) as 'penetrating to water,  
wherever they dig'; they are a kind of ant: cf. note to ii. 3. 4. Ppp.  
reads *upacīkā*, and combines *-kā ”siñcan;* also, in **b**, *dhanvann*.  
\*⌊But SPP's Bh. has *upajīkā́s!*⌋

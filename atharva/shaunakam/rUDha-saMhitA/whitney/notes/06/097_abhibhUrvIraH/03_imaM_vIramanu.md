## Translation
3. Be ye excited after this formidable hero; take hold, O companions,  
after Indra, the troop-conqueror, kine-conqueror, thunderbolt-armed,  
conquering in the course (*ájman*), slaughtering with force.

## Notes
This verse appears again as xix. 13. 6, in the midst of the hymn to  
which it belongs, and which is found also in various other texts. The  
verse corresponds to RV. x. 103. 6, SV. ii. 1204, VS. xvii. 38, and one  
in TS. iv. 6. 4², MS. ii. 10. 4. They all reverse the order of the two  
half-verses, begin our **c** with *gotrabhídaṁ govídam*, and have,  
instead of our **a**, *imáṁ sajātā ánu vīrayadhvam;* TS. differs from  
the rest by reading *‘nu* for *anu* in our **b**. The comm. explains  
*ájma* by *ajanaśīlaṁ kṣepaṇaśīlaṁ śatrubalam*. ⌊The word "in" were  
better omitted from the translation of **d**.⌋

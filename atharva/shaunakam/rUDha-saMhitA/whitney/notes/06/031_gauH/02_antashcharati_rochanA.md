## Translation
2. He moves between the shining spaces, from the breath of this  
outbreathing \[universe\]; the bull (*mahiṣá*) hath looked forth unto  
the heaven (*svàr*).

## Notes
RV. (with which, through the whole hymn, SV. and VS. entirely agree)  
reads (as does TS.) *apānatī́* (p. *apa॰anatī́*) at end of **b**; in  
**c**, it reads *dívam* for *svàḥ*. TS. inverts the order of **a** and  
**b**, and has the same **c** as our text; on the other hand, MS. has  
our **b**, but *arṇavé* (for *rocanā́*) in **a**, and a wholly peculiar  
**c**: *práti vām sū́ro áhabhiḥ*. Ppp. has (nearly as TS.), for **a, b**,  
*yasya prāṇād apānaty antaś carati rocanaḥ;* and *divam* (with RV.) at  
the end. The sense of the verse is very obscure, made so by the  
unintelligible second pāda; Roth suggests *apānati* ⌊as 3d singular⌋,  
with *rocanā* "stars" as subject: "They die at his breath": but this  
teems with difficulties. ⌊In Geldner's note, *anati* was taken as 3d  
plural.⌋ Our P.M.I.R.T.K., and all SPP's authorities, separate *rocanā́  
asyá* in *saṁhitá* (the *pada*-text reading -*nā́*), and SPP. has  
accordingly, properly enough, adopted it in his text: see the note to  
Prāt. iii. 34. ⌊Ppp. also has *vyākhyan*.⌋

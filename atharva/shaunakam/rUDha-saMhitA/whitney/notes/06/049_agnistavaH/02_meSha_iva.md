## Translation
2. Like a ram, thou art bent both together and wide apart, when in the  
upper wood \[the upper\] and the lower stone devour; exciting (*ard*)  
head with head, breast (*ápsas*) with breast, he gnaws the soma-stalks  
(*aṅśu*) with green mouths.

## Notes
In **a**, 'ram' (*meṣá*) perhaps means something made of ram's wool or  
skin; or the action of the stones is compared to that of a ram, butting  
and drawing back. K. (of which I happen to have the readings in this  
verse) gives *meṣa iva yad upa ca vi ca carvati*, and Āp. the same,  
except the blundering *carvari* for *carvati*. The comm. has *ucyase*  
for *acyase*. Ppp's **a** is *tveṣāi ’va siñca itaror varṇyate*. In  
**b**, which is the most hopeless part of the verse, K. reads *yad  
apsaradrūr uparasya khādati*, and Āp. doubtless intends the same, but is  
corrupted in part to *apsararūparasya*. The comm. has *aparas* for  
*uparas*. In **c**, K. has *vakṣasā vakṣa ejayann*, Āp. the same, and  
also, blunderingly, *girāu* for *śiro*. Ppp. has *apsarā ’pso*. In  
**d**, K. begins with *aṅśum;* Āp. has the same and also *gabhasti;* the  
comm. again *bibhasti*. The comm. has two different conjectures, both  
worthless, for *uttaradrāu*. ⌊Pischel discusses *ápsas*, *Ved. Stud.* i.  
308 ff., and this vs. at p. 312. Aufrecht discusses the roots *bhas*,  
KZ. xxxiv. 458. Hillebrandt discusses this vs., *Ved. Mythol.* i. 154.⌋

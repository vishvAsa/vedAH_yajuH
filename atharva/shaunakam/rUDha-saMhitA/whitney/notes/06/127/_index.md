## Comment
This hymn is not found in Pāipp. Kāuç. applies it (26. 33-39), with ii. 7, 25; vi. 85, 109; viii. 7, in a healing rite against various diseases (with this hymn specially the person treated is to be smeared by means of a splinter of palāça, ib. 34; and the head of one seized by Varuṇa is to be anointed, ib. 39); and it is reckoned (note to 26. 1) to the takmanāçana gaṇa.

## Comment
This hymn is not found in Pāipp. Kāuç. applies it (52. 3), with vi. 63 and 121, in a rite for welfare. The comm. takes no notice of this, but regards the hymn as implied in 31. 21: see under the preceding hymn. In Vāit. (38. 1) it is found used in a healing rite in the puruṣamedha: this also the comm. overlooks.

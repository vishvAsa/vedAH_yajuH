title = "०१ देवाः कपोत"

## Translation
1. Seeking what, O gods, the sent dove, messenger of perdition, hath  
come hither, to it will we sing praises, make removal; weal be \[it\] to  
our bipeds, weal to our quadrupeds.

## Notes
RV. has precisely the same text in this verse. Ppp. begins with *devaṣ  
k-*. Some of the mss. (including our P.M.W.T.) read *níḥkṛtiṁ* in **c**.  
The verse lacks two syllables of being a full *jagatī*.

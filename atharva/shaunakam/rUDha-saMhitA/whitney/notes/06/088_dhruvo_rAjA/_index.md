## Comment
The hymn does not occur in Pāipp., but its first two verses are RV. x. 173. 4, 5 (continuation of those corresponding to our 87). For its use by Kāuś. with the preceding hymn, see under the latter.


## Translations
Translated: by the RV. translators and by Zimmer (p. 163), in part; and Ludwig, p. 255; Griffith, i. 293.

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xv.* (but 1 c, d and 2 a, b are wanting, probably by an error of the copyist), and in the same other texts as the preceding hymn (RV.VS.TS.MS.: in MS. the three verses are not in consecution with those of 125). Applied by Kāuś. (16. 1) in a battle rite, with v. 20, as the drums and other musical instruments of war, duly prepared, are sounded thrice and handed to those who are to play them. Vāit. (34. 11) has it (also with v. 20) in the same ceremony as the preceding hymn, as the drum-heads are drawn on. *⌊Seems to be an error for Pāipp. vii.⌋


## Translations
Translated: by the RV. translators; and Griffith, 1.315—See also Bergaigne-Henry, Manuel, p. 156.

## Translation
3. The portion that is blind, that is reverted (*pinaḥsará*), set in the  
trees—therewith make me portioned; let the niggards run away.

## Notes
Extremely obscure. There must be some special connection, unclear to us,  
between *bhaga* and *śiṅśapā*. The comm. understands the god Bhaga, and  
explains the epithet 'blind' in this verse by referring to Nirukta xii.  
14, and 'reverted' as relating to his consequent inability to go  
forward; he reads *āhatas* in **b** for *āhitas*, and pictures the blind  
Bhaga as running against the trees along his way! The sense is, perhaps,  
the fortune or beauty that lies invisible and withdrawn in the trees.  
Ppp. ends **b** with *vṛkṣe sārpitaḥ*, and has, for **c**, *bhage nī  
rāme ‘stu śāṅśapo*.

## Translation
1. Me with a portion (*bhága*) of *śiṅśápā*, together with Indra \[as\]  
ally, I make myself portioned; let the niggards run away.

## Notes
The mss. blunder over the word *śāṅśapéna*. SPP. reports only  
*śāṅśaphéna* as variant (read by two of his); ours have that, and also  
*śāṅsayéna* and *sāṅśayéna;* our text reads wrongly ⌊*cāṅśayéna* correct  
to *śāṅśapéna*⌋. The comm. gives *saṁśaphena*, and etymologizes it  
accordingly as *sam* = *śapha!* Ppp. has *sāṅśapena*. The *śiṅśapā* is  
the *Dalbergia sisu*, a tree distinguished for height and beauty. The  
comm. understands *bhaga* throughout the hymn as the god Bhaga. ⌊The  
refrain recurs at xiv. 2. 11.⌋ The Anukr. overlooks the lack of a  
syllable in **c**.

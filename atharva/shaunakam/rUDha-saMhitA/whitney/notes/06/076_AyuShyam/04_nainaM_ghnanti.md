## Translation
4. They that go about (*paryāyín*) do not slay him, he goes not down to  
the dead (? *sanná*)—the *kṣatríya* who, knowing, takes the name of Agni  
unto length of life.

## Notes
Ppp. has, in **b**, *evam* for *ava;* and, in **c**, *viśvā* for  
*vidvān*. The comm. understands *sannān* as '(the enemies) even when in  
his neighborhood'; Ludwig, 'die \[im Hinterhalt?\] gelagerten': cf. TB.  
ii. 4. 7¹¹ *sannā́n mā́ ’va gāta*.  
  
⌊A supplementary note from Roth says that Ppp. has, inserted just before  
iv. 9. 7 of the Vulgate, the following: *nāi ’naṁ ghnantu paryāyaṇo na  
manvāṁ iva gacchati: jane mana pramīyate yas tvāṁ bibharty āñjana* (cf.  
iv. 9. 5 **d**).⌋

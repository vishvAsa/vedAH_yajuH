## Translation
3. From day-and-night, from the asterisms, from sun-and-moon, do thou, O  
king *śakadhū́ma*, make auspicious day for us.

## Notes
This verse, as already noted, is wanting in Ppp., but its second half  
nearly agrees with that of the Ppp. version of vs. 2. The accent in  
**b** should be emended to *sūryācandramasā́bhyām*, as is read below ⌊see  
W's note⌋ in xi. 3. 34. The first half-verse is metrically irregular.

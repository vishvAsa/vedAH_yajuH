## Translation
3. Where the well-hearted, the well-doing revel, having abandoned  
disease of their own selves, not lame with their limbs, undamaged in  
heaven (*svargá*)—there may we see \[our\] parents and sons.

## Notes
⌊The first half we had at iii. 28. 5.⌋ The verse corresponds to TA. ii.  
6. 2¹⁰, which reads *mádante* at end of **a**, *tanvā̀ṁ svā́yām* at end of  
**b**, *aśloṇā́n̄gāir* (so Ppp. also) in **c** (also *áhṛtās*, but this is  
doubtless a misprint ⌊he Poona ed. reads in fact *áhrutā*⌋), and  
*pitáraṁ ca putrám* at the end. The comm. reads *tanvās* in **b**, with  
part of the mss. (including our P.M.I.O.), and *aśroṇās* in **c**. ⌊For  
the substance of the vs., cf. Weber, *Sb.* 1894, p. 775.⌋

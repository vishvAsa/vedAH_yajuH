## Translation
1. If (*yát*) atmosphere, earth, and sky, if father or mother we have  
injured (*hiṅs*), may this householder's-fire lead us up from that to  
the world of the well-done.

## Notes
The first half-verse is found, without variation, in a number of other  
texts: in TS. (i. 8. 5³), TB. (iii. 7. 12⁴), TA. (ii. 6. 2⁸), MS. (i.  
10. 3), AśS. (ii. 7. 11); they do not agree entirely in the second half  
which they put in place of ours. Ppp. agrees with some of them, reading  
*agnir mā tasmād enaso gārhapatyah pramuñcatu*. Only **b** is really  
*jagatī*.

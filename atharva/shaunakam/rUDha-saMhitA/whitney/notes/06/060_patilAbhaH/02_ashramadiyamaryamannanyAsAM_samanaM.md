## Translation
2. This woman, O Aryaman, hath toiled, going to other women's assembly;  
now, O Aryaman, shall another woman come to her assembly.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **c** *nv asyā ’ryaman*. The comm. has *śamanam* in **b**  
and **d**, and *anu* for *nu* in **c**. He makes no difficulty in taking  
*ā́yati* (p. *ā॰áyati*) as a 3d pl., which it is not; we ought to have  
either *ā́yan* (*ā॰áyan*), or *ā́nya* instead of *anyā́ḥ:* the translation  
implies the latter. The proper *pada* reading would be *ā́: ayati*. ⌊For  
*sámanam* 'wedding-assembly,' see Bergaigne, *Rel. Véd.* i. 159, n. 3.  
Comm. renders *an̄gá* by *he;* Bloomfield, "without fail."⌋

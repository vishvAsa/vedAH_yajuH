The verse corresponds nearly to ix. 1. 18, below; but the latter has a quite different first half, and with it Ppp. precisely agrees. What our aragarāṭa's are is wholly obscure, and the word is most probably a corruption. The comm. explains it in two alternative ways: as kings that 'go' (aṭa) in 'spoke(ara)-swallowers(gara),' i.e. chariots; or, as 'shouts' (rāṭa) of soldiers that 'go' (ga) at the 'enemy' (ara = ari)!

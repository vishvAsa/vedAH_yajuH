## Translation
2. \[Be\] their counsel (*mántra*) the same, their gathering the same,  
their course (*vratá*) the same, their intent alike (*sahá*); I offer  
for you with the same oblation; do ye enter together into the same  
thought (*cétas*).

## Notes
The other texts differ from ours in the first half-verse only in this,  
that RV.TB. read *mánas* instead of *vratám* in **b**; but our **c** is  
their **d** (TB.\* having *saṁjñā́nena* for *samānéna*), and their **c**  
agrees nearest with our **d**, TB. reading *s. kéto abhí sáṁ  
rabhadhvam*, RV. *s. mántram abhí mantraye vaḥ*, and MS. *s. krátum abhí  
mantrayadhvam*. Ppp. has, for **b**, *samānaṁ cittaṁ saha vo manāṅsi*,  
and omits **d**. The Anukr. omits to describe the verse, as a  
*triṣṭubh*. \*⌊TB. has also *yajāmas* for *juhomi.*⌋

## Translation
2. The intoxication that is thine, with loosened hair, with disheveled  
hair, wherewith thou makest a man to be laughed at—far from thee do I  
wrench \[out\] other woods; do thou, O *śamī́*, grow up with a hundred  
twigs.

## Notes
Even the lines of this verse seem unrelated. Ppp. has, in **a**, *mado  
vikeśo vikeśyo;* and its **c, d** are entirely different: *bhrūṇaghno  
varivāṇā janitvaṁ tasya te prajayas suvāmi keśam*. SPP. reads  
*śatávalśā* in **d**, with a part of the mss. (including our P.M.K.Kp.).  
The comm. explains *vṛkṣi* by *vṛścāmi;* but its connection and form, in  
the obscurity of the verse, are doubtful. ⌊W. Foy discusses root *vṛj*,  
KZ. xxxiv. 241 ff., and this vs. at p. 244.⌋ R. writes: "The fruit of  
the *śamī*, the pod or kernels, is regarded (Caraka, p. 182, 1. 6) as  
injurious to the hair; and from the designation *keśamathanī* in Rājan.  
8. 33 is to be inferred that it makes the hair fall out. But nothing is  
said of an intoxicating effect. To the two trees usually identified with  
*śamī*, *Prosopis spicigera* and *Mimosa suma*, belongs neither the one  
nor the other effect. Nor is either 'of great leaves.'" ⌊The  
Dhanvantarīya Nighaṇṭu, p. 188 of the Poona ed., also speaks of *śamī*  
as *keśahantrī* and of its fruit as *keśanāśana*.⌋

## Translation
1. This barley, combined with honey, the gods plowed much on the  
Sarasvatī, in behalf of Manu (?); Indra, of a hundred abilities, was  
furrow-master; the liberal (? *sudā́nu*) Maruts were the plowmen.

## Notes
Ppp. has this verse only by citation of its *pratīka*, as if it had  
occurred earlier; but it has not been found elsewhere in the text. It  
occurs also in TB. (ii. 4. 87; exactly repeated in ĀpśS. vi. 30. 20;  
PGS. iii. 1. 6), MB. ii. 1. 16, and K. (xiii. 15). The TB. version  
begins with *etám u tyám mádh-* (so MB. also), and it gives in **b**  
*sárasvatyās* and *manā́v:* cf. *manā́v ádhi*, RV. viii. 61. 2; ix. 63. 8;  
65. 16; and the translation follows this reading; MB. has *vanāva  
carkṛdhi*. The comm., too, though he reads *maṇāú*, explains it by  
*manuṣyajātāu*. In **a**, he has *saṁjitam* (for *saṁyutam*). He  
explains *acarkṛṣus* by *kṛtavantas*, as if it came from root *kṛ!*  
⌊SPP. reads *maṇāú*, without note of variant.⌋

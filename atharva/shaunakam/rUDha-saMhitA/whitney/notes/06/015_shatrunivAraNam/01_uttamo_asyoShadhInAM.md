title = "०१ उत्तमो अस्योषधीनां"

## Translation
1. Thou art the highest of herbs; of thee the trees are subjects  
(*upastí*); let him be our subject who assails us.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 97. 23 (with which VS. xii. 101 precisely agrees),  
which has, for **a**, *tvám uttamā́ ’sy oṣadhe*, and accents *úpastayas  
úpastis*. Ppp. elides the *a* of *asi* in **a**, and in **c, d** has  
*upastir asmākaṁ bhūyād yo ‘sman*. The comm. regards the *palāśa* tree  
as addressed.

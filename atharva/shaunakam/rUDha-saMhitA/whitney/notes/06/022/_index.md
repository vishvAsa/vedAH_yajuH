## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. Used by Kāuç. (30. 11) in a remedial rite against protuberant belly etc. Keç. and the comm. read further in the rule the pratīka sasruṣīs of hymn 23, and detail a second lengthy process in the same rite as performed with the two. Hymns 22-24 are also explained as among the apāṁ sūktāni (7. 14 and note). In Vāit. (9. 5) this hymn appears in the cāturmāsya sacrifice as addressed to the playing (krīḍin) Maruts.

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. The hymn ⌊not 1 cd, 2 cd⌋ occurs in TB. (iii. 7. 98-9), and parts of it elsewhere, see under the verses. ⌊For 1 and 3, see also v. Schroeder, Tübinger Kaṭha-hss., p. 70 and 61.⌋ Hymns 117-119 are used in Kāuç. (133. 1) in the rite in expiation of the portent of the burning of one's house; and Keç. (to Kāuç. 46. 36) quotes them as accompanying the satisfaction of a debt after the death of a creditor, by payment to his son or otherwise; the comm. gives (as part of the Kāuç. text) the pratīka of 117. ⌊For the whole anuvāka, see under h. 114.⌋ In Vāit. (24. 15), in the agniṣṭoma, h. 117 goes with the burning of the vedi.

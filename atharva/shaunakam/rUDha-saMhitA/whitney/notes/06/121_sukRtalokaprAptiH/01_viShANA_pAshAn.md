## Translation
1. An untier, do thou untie off us the fetters that are highest, lowest,  
that are Varuṇa's; remove (*nis-sū*) from us evil-dreaming \[and\]  
difficulty; then may we go to the world of the well-done.

## Notes
*Viṣā́ṇā* (p. *vi॰sā́nā*) is doubtless 'antler' here, as at iii. 7. 1, 2  
⌊which see⌋ (though neither Kāuś. nor the schol. nor our comm. make  
mention of such an article as used here); but it was necessary to render  
it etymologically, to bring out the word-play between it and *ví ṣya;*  
the comm. treats it as a participle (= *vimuñcatī*), disregarding, as  
usual, the accent (really *vi-sā́* + *ana* ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §1150 e⌋). The  
second pāda is the same with vii. 83. 4 **b**. The proper readings in  
**c** are (see note to Prāt. ii. 86) *duṣṣvāpnyam* and *níṣṣva*, which  
the mss. almost without exception\* abbreviate to *duṣvap-* and *níṣva*,  
just as they abbreviate *dattvā* to *datvā*, or, in vs. 2 **a**,  
*rájjvām* to *rájvām* (see my *Skt. Gr.* §232). SPP. here gives in his  
*saṁhitā*-text *ní ṣva*, with all his authorities; our text has *níh  
ṣva*, with only one of ours (O.): doubtless the true metrical form is  
*níṣ ṣuvā ’smát*. ⌊Cf. Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 119, note.⌋ Ppp. lacks our  
second half-verse, having instead 2 **a, b**. \*⌊That is, if we take the  
occurrences of the words as a whole in AV.⌋

## Translation
3. Let the divine Aśvins, lords of beauty, protect us; let  
dawn-and-night also make broad for us; O child of the waters, in case of  
any detriment to \[our\] household; O divine Tvashṭar, increase \[us\]  
in order to our completeness.

## Notes
Ppp. has, in **a**, *sudaṅsasā* for *śubhas patī;* and in **c, d** it  
reads *vihvṛtī kayasya cid devo ‘sūvandadhite śarma yacha naḥ*. The  
comm. partly agrees with it in reading *abhihvṛtī* and *kayasya*  
(explaining it as for *kasya*); it also has at the beginning *pātam*,  
and takes the nouns that follow as vocatives. It understands *ábhihvṛtī*  
(p. *-tī íti*) as a locative (= *-hvṛtāu* or *-hvaraṇe*), as is done in  
our translation ⌊cf. JAOS. x. 389⌋. The accent requires amendment, to  
*abhíhrutī*. Florenz suggests the substitution of *abhihrútas*, which  
would be an easier reading.

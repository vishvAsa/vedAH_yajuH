## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. In Kāuç. (50. 13) hymns 3-7 (pātaṁ na iti pañca; the comm. says it means 'with five verses') are directed to be used with vi. 1 etc. for success in traffic (see under h. 1). Hymn 3 is connected with i. 26, 27 and vi. 76 at the beginning of the welfare-rites (50. 4), and it is reckoned (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa. By Vāit. (16. 9), hymns 3-6 are muttered in the agniṣṭoma by the hotar after the prātaranuvāka.

## Translation
1. Now do I adorn this man as superior to his fellow, for attainment of  
Indra; do thou increase his authority, his great fortune, as the rain  
the grass.

## Notes
The first half-verse is very obscure, and the rendering given only  
tentative; it implies the emendation of *tát* in **a** to *tám*, or else  
of *idám* to *imám* (as antecedent to *asyá* in **c**), and the  
understanding of *yujá* as for *yujás*, instead of *yujé*, which the  
*pada*-text gives for it both here and in 2 **d**; to read further  
*índra* (voc.) in **b** would much lighten the difficulty here, and also  
furnish a subject for the appeal in the next line. A dative with  
*uttara* is a construction perhaps unknown elsewhere. The comm.  
comfortably explains *yuje* as a verb "= *yojayāmi*." Ppp. reads *yujaṁ*  
(probably a mere error of the transcriber); and, for **b**, the corrupt  
*yene ’ndraṁ śumbhā nv iṣṭaye;* in **c** it has *yasya* for *asya*. The  
Anukr. seems to allow the contraction *vṛṣṭir ’va* in **d**. ⌊Roth's  
collation gives *yugaṁ* in **a**, and *yuga* in 2 **d**; but it may be a  
mere omission of the accent by which he distinguishes the palatal sonant  
(*g′* = our *j*) from the guttural sonant (*g*).⌋  
  
⌊Plate 453¹⁷ reads *yugaṁ*.⌋

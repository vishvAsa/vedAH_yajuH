## Translation
3. If from \[our\] mother or if from our father, forth from brother,  
from son, from thought (*cétas*), this sin hath come to \[us\]—as many  
Fathers as have fastened on (*sac*) us, of them all be the fury  
propitious \[to us\].

## Notes
In most of the *pada*-mss. *ā́gan* at end of **b** is wrongly resolved  
into *ā́: agan*, instead of *ā॰ágan* (our Kp. has *ā॰agan*). *Cétasas*  
the comm. understands to mean 'our own mind'; we should be glad to get  
rid of the word; its reduction to *ca*, or the omission of *bhrā́tur* or  
*putrā́t*, would rectify the redundant meter, which the Anukr. passes  
unnoticed. The comm. paraphrases *pari* in **b** apparently by *anyasmād  
api parijanāt!*

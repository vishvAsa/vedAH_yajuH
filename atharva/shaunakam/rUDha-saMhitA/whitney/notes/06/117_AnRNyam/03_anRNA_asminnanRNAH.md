title = "०३ अनृणा अस्मिन्ननृणाः"

## Translation
3. Guiltless in this \[world\], guiltless in the higher, guiltless in  
the third world may we be; the worlds traversed by the gods and  
traversed by the Fathers—all the roads may we abide in guiltless.

## Notes
The verse is found in TB. (iii. 7. 9⁸⁻⁹), TA. (ii. 15⁴), and ĀpśS.  
(xiii. 22. 5), with *-miṅs tṛ-* at junction of **a** and **b** (except  
in TB. as printed), with *utá* inserted before *pitṛyā́ṇās* and *ca  
lokā́s* omitted after it (thus rectifying the meter, of which the Anukr.  
ignores the irregularity), and with *kṣīyema* (bad) at the end. *Anṛṇá*  
means also 'free from debt or obligation'; there is no English word  
which (like German *schuldlos*) covers its whole sense. The comm. points  
out that it has here both a sacred and a profane meaning, applying to  
what one owes to his fellow-men, and what duties to the gods. Ppp.  
combines *anṛṇā ’smin* in **a**, and has the readings of TB. etc. in  
**c**, and *adīma* for *ā kṣiyema* at the end.

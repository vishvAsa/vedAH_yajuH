## Translation
3. Let him give us that wide wealth, of reddish (*piśán̄ga-*) aspect;  
Indra \[is\] most powerful lord among the people.

## Notes
Ppp., also the comm., and one of our MSS. (H.) read *dadhātu* in **a**,  
and AA. and śśS. and the comm. have *tám* for *tā́m;* Ppp. gives *no*  
instead; instead of *urúm* in **b**, śśS. has *puru*, and AA. repeats  
*rayím*. In **c**, both AA. and śśS. read *tavastamas;* the comm.,  
*tuvittamas*. Our *tuvíṣṭamas* is vouched for by two rules of the  
Prātiśākhya, iii. 96 and iv. 59. Further, the comm. in **b** reads  
*-sadṛśam*. That the verse is *uṣṇih* and not *gāyatrī* appears not to  
be noted in the Anukr. ⌊śśS. omits **a** at the end.⌋

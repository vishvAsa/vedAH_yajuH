title = "०२ स विश्वा"

## Translation
2. He shaped himself unto all things; he, the controlling one, sends out  
the seasons, drawing out the vigor (*váyas*) of the sacrifice.

## Notes
The verse is corrupt in Ppp., but the second and third pādas in it  
exchange places, as they do in the SV. version. SV. also reads, for  
**a**, *yá idám pratipaprathé*, and has *svàr* for *váyas* in **c**; it  
and all the other versions read *ṛtū́n;* our *ṛtū́ṅr* is quoted in Prāt.  
ii. 29, and in the comment to i. 68. The comm. reads in **a** *viśvāḥ*  
and *cakṛpe*, and some of our authorities (P.I.K.), with the great  
majority of SPP's, also have *víśvāḥ;*  but SPP. gives *víśvā* in his  
text, as we have done. AśS. (viii. 9. 7) and śśS. (x. 11. 9) read  
instead *viśvam*, and *cākḷpat*. TB. (ii. 4. 1⁹⁻¹⁰) makes an *anuṣṭubh*  
verse of our 3 **b, c** and 2 **a, b**; it reads, for our 2 **a**, *sá  
idám práti paprathe*.

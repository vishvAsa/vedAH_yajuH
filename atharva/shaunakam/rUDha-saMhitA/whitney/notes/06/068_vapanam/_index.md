## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (in the verse-order 1, 3, 2), and in part in various Gṛhya-Sūtras, as noted under the several verses. ⌊Further, in MP. ii. 1. 1-3; and MGS. i. 21. 2, 3, 14, 6 (cf. also Knauer's Index, p. 148, s.v. uṣṇena, p. 146, and p. 154).⌋ The hymn is used by Kāuś., as was to be expected, in the godāna ceremony (53. 17-20), vs. 1 being addressed to the vessel of water used, vs. 2 accompanying the wetting of the youth, and vs. 3 the parting and cutting of the hair. Further, in the upanayana, at the beginning of the whole ceremony (55. 2), with the directions "do as directed in the text" etc.

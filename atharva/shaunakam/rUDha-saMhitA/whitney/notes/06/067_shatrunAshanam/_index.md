## Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Used by Kāuç. (14. 7) in a battle rite with the two preceding hymns (and reckoned with them to the aparājita gaṇa): see under 65; also (16. 4) in another rite of the same class, for terrifying enemies, with vi. 98, with the direction "the king goes thrice about the army."

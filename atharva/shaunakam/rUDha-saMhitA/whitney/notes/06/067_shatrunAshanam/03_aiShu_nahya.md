## Translation
3. Fasten thou, as bull, the skin upon them; make the fear of the  
fallow-deer; let the enemy hasten (*eṣ*) away; let the cow hasten hither  
to us.

## Notes
The sense of **a** is very obscure. One is tempted to combine  
*vṛṣājinam* into one word. The comm. makes *hariṇasya* (=  
*kṛṣṇamṛgasya*) depend on *ajínam*, which cannot well be right, though  
it may be questioned whether, as dependent on *bhíyam*, it is subjective  
or objective genitive.\* He explains the "skin" as used for  
*somamaṇiveṣṭana;* and the "cow" (**d**) as the enemy's wealth, in cows  
and the like. The combination of *úpa eṣatu* into *úpeṣatu* falls under  
Prāt. iii. 52, and the case is quoted in the commentary to that rule.  
⌊Correct *nahyá* to *nahya* (accent-mark slipped out of place).⌋ \*⌊In a  
marginal note, W. compares *mitra-tū́rya*, v. 20. 7.⌋

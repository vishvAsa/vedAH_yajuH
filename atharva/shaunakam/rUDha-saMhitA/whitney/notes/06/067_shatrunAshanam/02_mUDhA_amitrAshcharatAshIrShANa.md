## Translation
2. Go about confounded, ye enemies, like headless snakes; of you there,  
confounded by Agni, let Indra slay each best man (*vára*).

## Notes
This verse is SV. ii. 1221, and one of the supplementary verses to a RV.  
hymn (RV. x. 103. 15). SV. has, for **a, b**, *andhā́ amitrā bhavatā  
’śīrṣāṇó ‘haya iva*, and, in **c**, *agnínunnānām*. The RV. version (see  
Aufrecht's 2d edition, ii. 682) accents *amítrā*, reads *-ṣāṇā́ áh-* in  
**b**, and, in **c**, *agnídagdhānām agnímūḻhānām*. The translation  
implies the emendation *amitrās* instead of *amítrās*, which latter is  
given by all the authorities, and hence accepted in SPP's text. The  
comm. understands *amitrās*, voc.; and he explains **b** to mean as  
snakes with their heads cut off can merely move about, but not do  
anything in particular.

## Comment
Found also (excepting vs. 3) in Pāipp. xix., the fourth verse not in company with the others. For other correspondences, see under the verses. Used by Kāuç. (46. 19) in an expiatory rite for incontinence, fastening on a rope of darbha; and in rites for welfare (52. 3), with vi. 84 and 121, to accompany acts of release; vs. 4, further (46. 22), in an expiatory rite for a spontaneously kindled fire. Vāit. has the vss. 1, 2, and 4 singly in the agnicayana (28. 27, 26; 29. 8), with the laying of bricks consecrated to nirṛti etc.

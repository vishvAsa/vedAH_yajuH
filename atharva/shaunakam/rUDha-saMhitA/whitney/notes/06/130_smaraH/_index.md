## Comment
Hymns 130-132 are not found in Pāipp. Hymn 130 and the next two are used by Kāug. (36. 13-14) in a women's rite (duṣṭastrīvaśīkaraṇakarmaṇi, comm. and Keś.), with strewing of beans (comm. and Keś. read māṣān, not māṣasmarān), burning of arrow-tips, and ⌊comm. and Keś.⌋ piercing of an effigy.

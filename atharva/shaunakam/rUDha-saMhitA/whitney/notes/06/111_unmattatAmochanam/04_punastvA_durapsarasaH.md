title = "०४ पुनस्त्वा दुरप्सरसः"

## Translation
4. May the Apsarases give thee again, may Indra again, may Bhaga again;  
may all the gods give thee again, that thou mayest be uncrazed.

## Notes
The *saṁhitā* reading in **a** and **c** would, of course, equally admit  
of *tvā: aduḥ* 'have given thee,' and this would be an equally  
acceptable meaning; the comm. so understands and interprets. In our  
text, read *púnas* at beginning of **c** (the sign for *u* dropped out).  
  
The difference of meter tends to point out vs. 1 as an alien addition by  
which this hymn has been increased beyond the norm of the book.

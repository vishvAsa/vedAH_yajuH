title = "०३ आयुर्ददं विपश्चितं"

## Translation
3. The life (*ā́yus*)-giving, inspired (*vipaścít*), famous plant of  
Kaṇva, the all-healing one, have I brought; may it quench this man's  
unseen ones.

## Notes
Ppp. begins **a** with *āyurvidam*, and **c** with *aharṣam*. SPP. has,  
in **c**, *ā́ ’bhāriṣam*, although it is both ungrammatical and  
unmetrical, because nearly all his authorities read so (the comm. gives  
*-rṣam*), as do part of ours (H.D.R.). ⌊As to Kanva's plant, cf. iv. 19.  
2.⌋

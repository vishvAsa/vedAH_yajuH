## Comment
Found also, with considerable variation, in Pāipp. xix. Used by Kāuś. (36. 28-30), in the section of rites concerning women, for the appeasement of anger: with vs. 1, one takes a stone on seeing the angry person; with vs. 2 one sets it down toward the same; with vs. 3 one spits upon it (abhiniṣṭhīvati: the text would suggest rather abhitiṣṭhati). The hymn is reckoned also (note to 26. 1) to the takmanāśana gaṇa. In Vāit. (12. 13) it is employed in the agniṣṭoma in case of an outbreak of anger.

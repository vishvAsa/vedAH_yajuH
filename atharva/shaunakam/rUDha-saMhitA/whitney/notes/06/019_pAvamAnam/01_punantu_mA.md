## Translation
1. Let the god-folk purify me; let men (*mánu*) purify me with prayer  
(*dhī́*); let all beings purify me; let the purifying one purify me.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *mām*. The verse is found in sundry other texts,  
with considerable varieties of reading: the first pāda is the same in  
all (only RV. has *mā́m*); in the second, RV. (ix. 67. 27) has *vásavas*  
for *mánavas*, while VS. (xix. 39) reads *mánasā dhíyas*, and TB. (i. 4.  
8¹) and MS. (iii. 11. 10) agree with AV.; in the third, VS. agrees with  
AV., and MS. differs only by giving *bhūtā́ mā*, while TB. has *víśva  
āyávaḥ*, and RV. *víśve devāḥ punīhí mā;* the fourth is omitted in TB.,  
and RV.VS. have *jā́tavedaḥ punīhí mā*, while MS. differs only by  
*punāhí*. The readings of K. (xxxviii. 2) I have not. The comm. explains  
*dhiyā* in **a** by *buddhyā karmaṇā vā*, and *pavamānas* in **d** as  
either wind or soma.

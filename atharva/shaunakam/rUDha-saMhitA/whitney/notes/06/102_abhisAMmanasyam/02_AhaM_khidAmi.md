## Translation
2. I drag along (*ā-khid*) thy mind, as a king-horse a side-mare (?);  
like grass cut by a whirlwind, let thy mind twine itself to me.

## Notes
Some of SPP's authorities give *pṛṣṭhyā́m* in **b**; but in general the  
mss. cannot be relied on to distinguish *ṣṭy* and *ṣṭhy*. The Pet. Lex.  
understands the word with *ṭh*, but the minor Pet. Lex. with *ṭ*, in the  
sense here given, which Grill (following Roth) accepts. ⌊Cf. W's note to  
xviii. 4. 10.⌋ The comm. explains the word as *śan̄kubaddhām* '\[a mare\]  
tied to a stake (to the pole of the chariot?)', *rājāśva* as  
*aśvaśreṣṭha*, and *ā khidāmi* as *madabhimukham utkhanāmy unmūlayāmy  
āvarjayāmi*. The reading *tṛ́ṇma* in **c**, which our edition wrongly  
accepts, is that of only two of our mss. (Bp.Bp.²). ⌊Read therefore  
*tṛ́ṇam*.⌋ The comm. explains *reṣman* as *reṣako vātyātmako vāyuḥ*. Ppp.  
ends **b** with *pṛṣṭyāmayaḥ*.

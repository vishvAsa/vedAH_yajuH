title = "०३ अन्यत्रास्मन्न्युऽच्यतु सहस्राक्षो"

## Translation
3. Elsewhere than \[with\] us let the thousand-eyed immortal one make  
its home; whomsoever we may hate, him let it come upon (*ṛch*); and whom  
we hate, just him do thou smite.

## Notes
Ppp., as above noted, has the first half of this verse as its 2 **c,  
d**, reading corruptly *nyucya* for *ny ucyatu;* its version of **c, d**  
is *yo no dveṣṭi taṁ gacha yaṁ dviṣmas taṁ jahi*. The comm. renders *ny  
ucyatu* by *nitarāṁ gacchatu*.

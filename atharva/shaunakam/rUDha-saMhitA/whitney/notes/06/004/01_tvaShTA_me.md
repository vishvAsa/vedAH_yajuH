title = "०१ त्वष्टा मे"

## Translation
1. Tvashṭar \[protect\] my address (*vácas*) to the gods, \[also\]  
Parjanya, Brahmaṇaspati; with sons, with brothers, let Aditi now protect  
our hard to surpass \[and\] saving power.

## Notes
The verse is found also in SV. (i. 299), which has *no* for *me* in  
**a**, and, at the end, *trā́maṇaṁ vácaḥ*, thus rectifying the meter of  
the last pāda. Ppp. ends with *trāmaṇe śavā*. The form *trā́maṇaṁ* seems  
to be a bastard neut., corresponding to the masc. *trā́māṇaṁ* ⌊cf. JAOS.  
x. 522, 530: there seem to be no *man*-stems used as adjectives in the  
neuter⌋, and to have been avoided in AV. by the substitution of  
*trā́yamāṇaṁ;* of the resulting metrical disturbance the Anukr. takes no  
notice.

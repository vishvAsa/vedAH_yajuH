## Translation
2. Let Aṅśa, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Aditi—let the Maruts protect  
\[us\]; may the hatred of that injurer pass away; repel the foe from  
near by.

## Notes
The accent of *pā́ntu* (if correct) shows that only *marútas* is felt to  
be its subject; but Ppp. reads instead *aditiḥ pātv aṅhasaḥ*. In **c**,  
the comm. has *abhihvṛtas*. The last pāda is obscure, and at least in  
part corrupt. The want of accent of *yāvayat* is wrong, and its form is  
unmotived; emendation to *yāváya* or *-yan* can hardly be avoided.  
*A'ntitam* (for which Ppp. gives *anthitam*) is read by all the mss.,  
and occurs again at viii. 5. 11, so that it must be regarded as the real  
AV. reading. It is emended in our edition to *ánti tám;* and the comm.  
also so understands it (*tam eva śatrum antikāt*). It is translated as  
if emended to *ántitas;* or *ántitam* might be an anomalous equivalent  
of *antikam*. The verse (12 + 8: 12 + 8 = 40) is not properly a  
*saṁstārapan̄kti*.

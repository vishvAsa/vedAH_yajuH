## Translation
3. Twelvefold is deposited what was wiped off by Trita—sins of human  
beings; if from that the seizure hath reached thee, let the gods make it  
disappear for thee by the incantation.

## Notes
'Twelvefold': i.e., apparently, in twelve different places, or classes,  
or individuals. TB. (l.c.) specifies eight offenders to whom the  
transference was successively made; and the "twelve" is made up,  
according to the commentator, of the gods, Trita and his two brothers,  
and these eight. ⌊The vs. is no *pan̄kti*.⌋  
  
This hymn is the last of the 11, with 37 verses, that constitute the  
eleventh *anuvāka;* the Anukr. says: *prāk tasmāt saptatriṅśaḥ*.

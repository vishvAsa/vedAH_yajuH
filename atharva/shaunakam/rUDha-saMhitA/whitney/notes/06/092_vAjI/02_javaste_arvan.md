## Translation
2. The quickness, O courser, that is put in thee in secret, also that  
went about committed to the hawk, to the wind—with that strength do  
thou, O steed, being strong, win the race, rescuing in the conflict.

## Notes
This verse also is found in VS. (ix. 9 a), with considerable variants:  
at the beginning, *javó yás te vājin;* for **b**, *śyené páritto ácarac  
ca vā́te;* in **c**, *nas* for *tvám;* for **d**, *vājajíc ca bháva  
sámane ca pār-*. Ppp. resembles this in **b**: *śyene carati yaś ca  
vāte*. Half SPP's authorities end with *-iṣṇú*; I have noted no such  
reading among our mss. The Anukr. ignores the irregularity of this  
verse and of vs. 3. ⌊The vs. is discussed by Bloomfield, JAOS. xvi. 17,  
or *Festgruss an Roth*, p. 154. For **d**, see Pischel, *Ved. Stud.*,  
ii. 314, and Baunack, KZ. xxxv. 516.⌋

## Translation
2. This is the down-course of the waters, the abode (*nivéśana*) of the  
ocean; in the midst of a pool are our houses: turn thy faces away.

## Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 142. 7 **a, b** (also VS. xvii. 7 **a,  
b**; TS. iv. 6. 1³; MS. ii. 10. 1), without variation. The last pāda is  
by the comm. regarded as addressed to the fire (one of whose common  
epithets is *viśvatomukha* 'having faces in every direction'); perhaps  
rather 'the points of thine arrows': cf. VS. xvi. 53.

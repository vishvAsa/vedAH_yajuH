## Translation
1. In thy course hither, \[thy\] course away, let the flowery *dū́rvā*  
grow; either let a fountain spring up there, or a pond rich in lotuses.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 142. 8; where, however, the words in  
**b** are all plural, and **c, d** read thus: *hradā́ś ca puṇḍárīkāṇi  
samudrásya gṛhā́ imé*. SPP., against the majority of his authorities,  
strangely adopts in his text the RV. version of **b**; it is read also  
by the comm., and apparently by Ppp.; we have noted only one of our mss.  
as having *puṣpíṇīḥ* (O.s.m.). The comm. says: *anenā ’gnikṛtabādhasyā  
’tyantābhāvaḥ prārthitaḥ*.

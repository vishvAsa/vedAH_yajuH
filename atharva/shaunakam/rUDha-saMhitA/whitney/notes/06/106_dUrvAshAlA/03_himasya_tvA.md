## Translation
3. With a fetal envelop of snow, O house, do we envelop thee; for mayest  
thou be for us having a cool pond; let Agni make a remedy.

## Notes
The first two pādas correspond to VS. xvii. 5 **a, b** (also in TS. iv.  
6. 1¹, MS. ii. 10. 1), which, however, has *ágne* instead of *śā́le;* a  
RV. *khila* to x. 142 differs only by *dadātu* for *kṛṇotu* in **d**.  
Ppp. has, in **c**, *-hradāya* for *hradā hi*, and, in **d**, also  
*dadātu* for *kṛṇotu*. None of our mss., and very few of SPP's  
authorities, read *agníṣ k-* in **d**, though it appears to be called  
for by Prāt. ii. 65, and both editions accept it. The comm. explains the  
envelop to be *avakārūpeṇa śāivālena*. ⌊Ppp. combines *bhuvo ‘gnir.*⌋

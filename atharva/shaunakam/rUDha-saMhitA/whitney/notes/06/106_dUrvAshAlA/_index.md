## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix. (with the verse-order 2, 1, 3). Kāuś. employs the hymn (52. 5) in a rite for welfare, to prevent conflagration of the house: a hole is made inside, and water conducted into it, etc. And vss. 3, 2 appear in Vāit. (29. 13), with others, in the agnicayana, in the rite of drawing a frog, water-plant, and reed over the site of the fire-altar.

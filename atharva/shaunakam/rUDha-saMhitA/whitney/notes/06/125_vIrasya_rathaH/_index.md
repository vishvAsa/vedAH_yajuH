## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xv. (in the verse-order 2, 3, 1). This hymn and the next are six successive verses of RV. (vi. 47. 26-31), and also of VS. (xxix. 52-57), TS. (iv. 6. 65-7), and MS. (iii. 16. 3). In Kāuç. (15. 11) it ⌊and not xii. 3. 33⌋ is used in a battle-rite, with vii. 3, 110, and other passages, as the king mounts a new chariot (at Kāuç. 10. 24 and 13. 6 it is ix. 1. 1 that is intended ⌊so SPP's ed. of the comm. to iii. 16⌋, not vs. 2 of this hymn). In Vāit. (6. 8), vss. 3 and 1 are quoted in the agnyādheya, accompanying the sacrificial gift of a chariot; and the hymn (or vs. i), in the sattra (34. 15), as the king mounts a chariot.

## Translation
3. Fly out forth from here, O *balā́sa*, like a young *āśuṁgá;* then,  
like the \[last\] year's bulrush, scud away, innocuous to heroes.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **b**, *suparṇo vasater iva* ⌊cf. RV. i. 25. 4⌋ 'like a  
bird from its nest': a much easier reading. The comm. explains *āśuṁga*  
as an ordinary adjective, 'swiftgoing,' and, instead of *śiśuka*, reads  
*śuśuka* "a wild animal so called." For **c, d**, Ppp. has *adhe ’ṭa ivā  
’hano ‘padrāhy avāiraha*. The comm. reads *itas* ⌊that is *itás*⌋, pple  
of root *i*, for *íṭas* in **c**. The Anukr. appears to sanction the  
contraction *iṭe ’va* in **c**.

## Translation
1. As the black snake spreads himself at pleasure, making wondrous forms  
(*vápus*), by the Asura's magic (*māyá*), so let this arid suddenly make  
thy member altogether correspondent (? *sáṁsamaka*), limb with limb.

## Notes
The comm. reads *sitas* instead of *asitás* in **a**, and explains it as  
'a man that is bound.' He takes *arka* as 'an amulet of *arka*-tree'  
(*Calotropis gigantea*, of which various medicinal use is made). In  
**d** he reads *saṁ samagam* and paraphrases the latter with 'of like  
going' (*samānagamana*). The Petersburg Lexicon conjectures for  
*sáṁsamaka* 'joined to one another.' The verse is mixed *triṣṭubh* and  
*jagatī*.

## Translation
3. As much of a limb as is that of the *párasvant*, that of the  
elephant, and that of the ass—as great as of the vigorous (*vājín*)  
horse, so great let thy member grow.

## Notes
The comm. reads and explains *yāvad an̄gīnam* at the beginning as two  
independent words; the metrical irregularity, as well as the  
anomalousness of the word as a derivative and compound, suggest  
emendation to *yā́vad án̄gam* (*an̄gam* = *pasas*). ⌊Cf. Pischel, *Ved.  
Stud.*, i. 83, with reference to the ass.⌋  
  
The seventh *anuvāka*, having 11 hymns and 34 verses, ends here; and the  
mss. quote the old Anukr. to this effect: *catasṛbhir adhikas tu  
saptamaḥ syāt*.

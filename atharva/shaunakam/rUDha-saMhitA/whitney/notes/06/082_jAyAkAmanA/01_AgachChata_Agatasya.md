## Translation
1. I take the name of the arriving, the arrived, the coming one; Indra  
the Vritra-slayer I win (*van*), him of the Vasus, of a hundred-fold  
power.

## Notes
The construction of *van* with a genitive is apparently elsewhere  
unknown, and is of doubtful sense. Ppp. has instead *rājño* 'of the  
king,' which makes the correctness of *vanve* very doubtful. Ppp. also  
combines *āgachatā ”gatasya* in **a**. The comm. reads at the end  
*śatakrato*, vocative; he apparently takes *āyatás* in **b** as  
*ā́yatas*, from *yam* (*niyato ’ham*) ⌊or, alternatively, with  
*indrasya*⌋.

## Translation
3. O *tāuvilikā*, quiet down; this racket hath quieted down; both the  
brown and the brown-eared one: go away, O *nirāla!*

## Notes
It is perhaps by a misprint that SPP. reads *áva:* *īlaya* (for *il-*)  
in the *pada*-text of **a** (though our D. has also *īl-*). To the  
comm., *tāuvilikā* is the name of a *piśācī* that produces disease;  
*āilaba*, a kind of disease of the eyes; *babhru* and *babhrukarṇa*,  
causes of disease; and *nirāla*, also a disease. The translation implies  
the emendation of *nír āla* to *nirāla*.\* Ppp. has a peculiar text:  
*tāulike ‘ve ’layā ’vā imāilavāilāi: ihas tvām āhutiṁ jusāṇo manasā  
svāhā;* but part of this belongs perhaps to the following piece. ⌊The  
Anukr. scans as 8 + 9: 8 + 6.⌋, \*⌊Comm. reads *nirāla;* R. has *nír  
āśala*, and T. has *nílāśala*. Comm. has further *apāihi!*⌋

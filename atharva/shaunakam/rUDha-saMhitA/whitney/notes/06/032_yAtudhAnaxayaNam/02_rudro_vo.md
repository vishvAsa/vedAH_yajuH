## Translation
2. Rudra hath crushed (*śṛ*) your necks, O *piśācás;* let him crush in  
(*api-śṛ*) your ribs, O sorcerers; the plant of universal power hath  
made you go to Yama.

## Notes
A few of SPP's authorities (also the Anukr., in citing the verse) read  
*aśarīt* in **a**. Some of our mss. accent *piśācā́ḥ* at end of **a**  
(P.M.I.p.m.), and *yātudhānā́ḥ* (P.M.I.); all the *pada*-mss. absurdly  
have *viśvátaḥ॰vīryāḥ* at end of **c**. Ppp. has, for **a, b**, *śarvo  
vo grīvāy aśarīṣ piśācā vo ’pa śṛṇāty agniḥ* and in **d** it gives  
*mṛtyunā* for *yamena*. ⌊The "verbal forms with suspicious *āi*" in the  
AV. (*śarāis* etc., *asaparyāit:* cf . *Gram.* §§555 c, 904 b, 1068 a)  
have been treated by Bloomfield, ZDMG. xlviii. 574 ff., and Böhtlingk,  
ibidem, liv. 510 ff. Cf. also note to xviii. 3. 40.⌋

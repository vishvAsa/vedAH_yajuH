title = "32. Against demons."

## Comment
The first two verses found also in Pāipp. xix.* Kāuç. has the hymn (or vss. 1, 2) in a remedial rite against demons (31. 3); the fire is circumambulated three times, and a cake is offered; and it is reckoned (note to 8. 25) to the cātana gaṇa. Verse 3 is by itself reckoned (note to 16. 8) to the abhaya gaṇa, and also (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa. *⌊Ppp. then has a third verse, whose a = vi. 40. 1 a, and whose b is corrupt. Roth's note seems incomplete.⌋

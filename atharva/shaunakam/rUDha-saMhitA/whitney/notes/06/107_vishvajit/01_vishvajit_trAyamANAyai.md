## Translation
1. O all-conqueror (*viśvajít*), commit me to rescuer; O rescuer,  
protect both all our bipeds, and whatever quadrupeds are ours.

## Notes
Ppp. begins *trāyamāṇe sarvavide mām;* it omits *nas* before *rakṣa* in  
the refrain. All the beings addressed are doubtless female; the comm.  
has nothing to say in explanation of them otherwise than that they are  
divinities so named.

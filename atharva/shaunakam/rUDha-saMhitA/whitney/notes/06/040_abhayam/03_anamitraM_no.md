## Translation
3. Freedom from enemies for us below, freedom from enemies for us above;  
O Indra, make freedom from enemies for us behind, freedom from enemies  
in front.

## Notes
Or, these four directions admit of being understood (so the comm.) as  
from the south, from the north, from the west, in the east. The verse is  
found also in the Kāṇva version of the Vājasaneyi-Saṁhitā (iii. 11. 6),  
with *me adharā́g* in **a**, *udák kṛdhi* in **b**, and *paścā́n me* in  
**c**; further, in K. (xxxvii. 10).

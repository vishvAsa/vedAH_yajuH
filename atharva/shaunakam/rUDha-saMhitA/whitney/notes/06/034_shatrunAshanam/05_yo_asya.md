## Translation
5. Who, the bright Agni, was born on the further shore of this firmament  
(*rájas*): may he etc. etc.

## Notes
Nearly all our mss. (all save O.D.K.), and the great majority of SPP's,  
read *ajāyata*, without accent, at end of **b**; both editions give  
*áj-*. RV. has *asya*, unaccented, in **a**. The verse is also found in  
TS. (iv. 2. 52), TB. (iii. 7. 8¹), and MS. (ii. 7. 12\*), all beginning  
**a** with *yát* and **c** with *tát*, and having, instead of *śukró  
agnír*, *śukráṁ jyótir* (but MS. *maháś citráṁ jyótir*); all accent  
*ájāyata*, and TB.MS. accent *asyá* with our text. \*⌊Also at iii. 2. 4,  
with the same reading, save *pariṣad*.⌋

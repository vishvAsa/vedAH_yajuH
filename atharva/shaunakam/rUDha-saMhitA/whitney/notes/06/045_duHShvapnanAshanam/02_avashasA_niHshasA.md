## Translation
 2. If (*yát*) by down-utterance, out-utterance, forth-utterance we  
have offended (*upa-ṛ*), waking or (*yát*) sleeping, let Agni put far  
away from us all disagreeable ill-deeds.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to RV. x. 164. 3, which reads in **a** *yád āśásā  
niḥśásā ’bhiśásā;* of these words the first and third have usage  
elsewhere, and a determinable meaning, 'wish' or 'expectation' and  
'imprecation.' The Atharvan substitutes occur only here, and the root  
*śaṅs* is not met with combined with either *ava, nis* (except in the  
doubtful *ániḥśasta*, RV. once), or *parā;* so that it has been  
necessary to render the words mechanically above. TB. (iii. 7. 12⁴) has  
**a** only, with *niśásā* (instead of *niḥśásā*), which is equally  
unsupported.\* The comm. regards all the words as containing the root  
*śas* 'cut,' paraphrasing it by *hiṅs* 'injure'; *upārima* he renders by  
*upārtāḥ pīḍitā bhavema*, turning the active into a passive. ⌊Pāda **b**  
recurs at vi. 96. 3.⌋ \*⌊TB. has *yád āśásā niśásā yát parāśásā*,  
blending RV. and AV. readings.⌋

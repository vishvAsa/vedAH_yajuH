## Translation
3. If (*yát*), O Indra, O Brahmaṇaspati, we also proceed falsely, let  
the Ān̄girasa, forethoughtful, protect us from difficulty, from distress.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 164. 4, which, however, has the better readings  
*abhidrohám* for *ápi mṛ́ṣā* in **b**, and *dviṣatā́m* for *duritā́t* in  
**d**. Ppp. reads, for **d**, *dviṣatas pātu tebhyaḥ*.  
  
It is probably only on account of the occurrence in it of the word  
*svapantas* (2 **b**) that this hymn is in our text put in connection  
with the one that follows.

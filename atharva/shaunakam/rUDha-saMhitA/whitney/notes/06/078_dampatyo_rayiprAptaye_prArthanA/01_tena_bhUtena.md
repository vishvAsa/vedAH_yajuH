title = "०१ तेन भूतेन"

## Translation
1. By this actual (? *bhūtá*) oblation let this man be filled up again;  
the wife that they have brought to him, let him grow superior  
(*abhi-vṛdh*) to her by essence (*rása*).

## Notes
Ppp. has *bhūtasya* for *bhūtena* in **a**, and inverts the order of  
words in **b**. Grill acutely suggests *bhūtyena* in **a**, 'for  
prosperity (*bhūti*),' and the comm. paraphrases it with  
*samṛddhikareṇa* 'prosperity-malting.' *Abhi* in **d**, and in 2 **a,  
b**, seems to have a meaning like that which it has in *abhi-bhū*. The  
comm. makes no difficulty of rendering the neuter *vardhatām* as if it  
were causative. Ppp. takes away the difficulty of the expression in this  
verse by the very different reading *jāyāṁ yām asmā ’vidaṁ sā rasenā  
’bhi vardhatām*.

## Translation
1. This portion I, knowing, make over \[to thee\], O Viśvakarman,  
first-born of right; by us \[is it\] given, beyond old age; along an  
unbroken line may we pass (*tṛ*) together.

## Notes
The connection in this verse is obscure; *prathamajā́s* 'first-born' in  
**b** can only qualify "I" grammatically; doubtless it should be  
vocative, belonging to Viśvakarman. The comm. connects *dattam* directly  
with *bhāgam*, which he explains by *pakvam annaṁ havirbhāgaṁ vā*. The  
second half-verse corresponds to TA. ii. 6. is **c, d** (in immediate  
connection with the two preceding verses of our text also), which  
differs only by reading at the end *carema;* and this the comm. also  
reads. The first half-verse in TA. is as follows: *sá prajānán  
prátigṛbhṇīta vidvā́n prajā́patiḥ prathamajā́ ṛtásya;* and Ppp. apparently  
intends a similar reading; it has *taṁ prajānan ity ekā*, as if the  
verse had occurred earlier in the text; but it has not been found.

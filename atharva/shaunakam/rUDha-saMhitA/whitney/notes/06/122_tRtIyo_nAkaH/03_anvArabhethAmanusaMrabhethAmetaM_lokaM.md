## Translation
3. Take ye (both) hold after, take hold together after; to this world  
they that have faith attach themselves (*sac*); what cooked \[offering\]  
of yours is served up in the fire, combine ye, O husband and wife, in  
order to the guarding of it.

## Notes
The verse is found in TA. (ii. 6. 2⁷), with great differences of text:  
*anu-* is omitted at the beginning; *anu*, second time in **a**, is  
accented, *ánu;* **b** is *samānám pánthām avatho ghṛténa; pūrtám* for  
*pakvám* is read (also by Ppp.), and *yád* inserted before *agnāú*, in  
**c**\*; **d** is *tásmāi gótrāye ’há jā́yāpatī sáṁ rabhethām*. The  
reading *pūrtám* is against our understanding *pakvám* of the body  
prepared by fire for the other world. The comm. explains *páriviṣṭam* by  
*prakṣiptam*, the TA. comm. by *pariprāpitam*, both apparently taking it  
from root *viś*. The verse is found repeated, with a different  
beginning, as xii. 3. 7. It is too irregular to be called a simple  
*triṣṭubh*. \*⌊Thus rectifying its meter.⌋

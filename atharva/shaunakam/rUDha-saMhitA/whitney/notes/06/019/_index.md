In Kāuç. it is included (9. 2) in the bṛhachānti gaṇa; it is associated (as are vi. 23, 24, 51, 57, 59, 61, 62) with i. 4-6 etc. in a rite for good fortune (41. 14); it appears in the savayajñās (66. 16), with the pavitra sava; and the comm. declares it and vi. 51, 62 to be intended by pavitrāis at 61. 5, also in the savayajña chapter. In Vāit. it accompanies a purifying rite (11. 10) in the agniṣṭoma, and (with vi. 69 etc.) the pouring out of the surā in the sāutrāmaṇī ceremony ⌊30. 13⌋; and vs. 2 in the agnyādheya (6. 11), with an offering to Agni pavamāna.

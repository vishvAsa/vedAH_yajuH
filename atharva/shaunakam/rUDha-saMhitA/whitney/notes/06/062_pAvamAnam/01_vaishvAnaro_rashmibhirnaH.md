title = "०१ वैश्वानरो रश्मिभिर्नः"

## Translation
1. Let Vāiśvānara (Agni) by his rays purify us, the wind, lively with  
mists (? *nábhas*), by his breath; let heaven-and-earth, rich in milk,  
righteous, worshipful, purify us by milk.

## Notes
The verse is found also in TB. (i. 4. 8³) and MS. (iii. 11. 10). They  
read *mā* for *nas* in **a** and **d**, *mayobhū́s* (which is decidedly  
better) for *nábhobhis* at end of **b**, and *páyobhis* for *páyasvatī*  
in **c**. Pāda **c** is *jagatī*.

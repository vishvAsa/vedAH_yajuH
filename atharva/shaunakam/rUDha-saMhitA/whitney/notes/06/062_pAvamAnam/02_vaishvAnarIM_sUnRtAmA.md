## Translation
2. Take ye hold upon the pleasantness of Vāiśvānara, of which the  
regions are the smooth-backed bodies; with that, singing in joint  
revelings, may we be lords of wealth (pl.).

## Notes
The sense, especially of **b**, is obscure, and the version mechanical;  
**b** is perhaps a reminiscence of RV. i. 162. 7 **b**. Found,  
considerably altered in **a, b**, in VS. (xix. 44), and TB.MS. (as  
above). They read for **a, b** *vāiśvadevī́ punatī́ devy ā́ ’gād yásyām*  
(TB. *yásyāi*, MS. *yásyās*) *imā́* (TB.MS. omit) *bahvyàs* (TB.  
*bahvī́s*) *tanvò* (TB. *tanúvo*) *vītápṛṣṭhāḥ;* all have *mádantas* for  
*gṛṇántas* in **c**, and TB.MS. *-mā́dyeṣu*—this last an alteration  
plainly called for by the meter; and the Anukr. does not describe the  
verse as *nicṛt*. Ppp. has at the beginning *vāiśvadevyaṁ*, for **b** a  
wholly different text, *śuddhā bhavanta śucayaṣ pāvakāḥ* (our 3 **b**),  
and in **c**, corruptly, *-nta sasada ādayema*. The variants indicate,  
as often elsewhere, the hopelessness of a rendering.

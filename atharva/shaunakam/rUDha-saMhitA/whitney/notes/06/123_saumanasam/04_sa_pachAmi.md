## Translation
4. He do I cook, he do I give, he do I offer; \[as\] he, let me not be  
parted from what is given.

## Notes
That is, from my gifts, or their reward. The comm. counts and explains  
these two quasi-verses, 3 and 4, as one. But the Anukr. reckons this  
hymn (as it reckoned the preceding one) as one of five verses  
(*pañcarca*), and SPP's edition as well as ours so divides. ⌊'As that  
one, I cook' etc. would be an equally accurate translation, and the  
English of it is not so harsh.⌋

⌊**Paippalada excerpts concerning book xx.**⌋

⌊Roth, at the end of his Collation, adds the Ppp. variants for verses 12
and 16 and 17 of AV. xx. 34; the hymn appears in Ppp. xiii. and
corresponds to the *sá janāsa índraḥ* hymn, RV. ii. 12.⌋

⌊Verse 12. In **a**, Ppp. has *paryacarakṣac* instead of *paribhávaṁ;*
its *b* is *yo vārgakasya vāpibat sutam;* its reads *yajamānaṁ bahuṁ
janaṁ;* and in **d**, it has *āmorucakṣat* for *ámūrchat*.⌋

⌊Verse 16. In **a**, Ppp. has *vyakṣat putror up-* for *vyàktaḥ pitrór
up-*; its **b** is simply *bhuvana veda janitaḥ;* its **c** is *parasyā
bhaviṣyamāṇo hrojokṣad*.⌋

⌊Verse 17. In **a**, Ppp. has *haryasyaśur* for *háryaśva āsutér*.⌋

⌊Then follows a note to the effect that nothing of the Kuntāpa hymns
appears in Ppp.⌋

⌊Roth's Collation closes with the words:

"explicit feliciter 25. Juni 1884."⌋

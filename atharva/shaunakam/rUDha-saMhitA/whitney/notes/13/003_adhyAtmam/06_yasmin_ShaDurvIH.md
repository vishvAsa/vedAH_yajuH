## Translation
6. Upon whom are set (*śritá*) the six wide \[spaces\], the five  
quarters, the four waters, the three syllables (? *akṣára*) of the  
sacrifice; who, angered, looked with his eye between the two firmaments  
(*ródaṣī*)—against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
All our mss. read at end of **b** *akṣárā* (not *-rāḥ*), doubtless under  
the influence of the ordinary use of *akṣára* as neuter. The omission in  
**c** of *cākṣuṣā* would better both sense and meter. The verse as best  
read (12 + 12: 14: 44 = 82) lacks two syllables of a full *prakṛti*, but  
could easily be filled up by resolution. ⌊For the transition *-t* after  
*yásmin*, cf. Prāt. ii. 9 note.⌋ ⌊Caland, p. 173, understands this vs.  
and the following to be intended at Kāuś. 49. 24, 25, for use in the  
ceremony of the "water-thunderbolts": cf. introd. to x. 5.⌋

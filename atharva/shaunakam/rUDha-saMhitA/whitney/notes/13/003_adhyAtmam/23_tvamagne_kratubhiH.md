title = "२३ त्वमग्ने क्रतुभिः"

## Translation
23. Thou, O Agni, impelled by powers (*krátu*), by lights (*ketú*),  
didst shine up, a kindled song (? *arká*) in the sky; unto what did the  
Maruts, having the spotted one for mother, sing, when the gods generated  
the ruddy one?—Against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
Pischel (*Ved. Stud.* i. 26) takes *arká* as 'sun'; the connection with  
*abhy ārcan* in **c** is strongly opposed to this. The last pāda is the  
same with 12 **c** above. The verse (12 + 12: 12 + 11: 44) counts  
properly 91 syllables, one short of a full *vikṛti*.

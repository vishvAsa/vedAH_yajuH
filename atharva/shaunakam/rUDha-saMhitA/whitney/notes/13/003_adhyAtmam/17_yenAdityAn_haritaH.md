## Translation
17. By whom the yellow steeds draw the Ādityas together; by what  
sacrifice go many foreknowing; which, sole light, shines forth  
variously—against that god etc. etc.

## Notes
*Yajñéna* 'sacrifice' in **b** looks as if it needed emendation, and the  
irregularity of the pāda suggests corruption. Our mss. read at the end  
*ví bhāti* and the *pada*-text has *ví॰bhāti\*;* our text makes a change  
of accent to *vibhā́ti*. The verse (11 + 14: 11: 44 = 80) counts up a  
precise *kṛti*.  
  
\*⌊A similar *pada*-reading, impossible with the accentless verb-form,  
we met at vi. 74. 2 (see the note thereto) and at vi. 114. 2 (see note).  
And here, as at vi. 74. 2, a suspicion arises that an error has come in  
from confusion with a similar form near by, here with the ending of vs.  
16 proper, where *ví bhāti* is called for. All SPP's authorities have  
*ví bhāti*, except his P², which has *vi॰bhā́ti*. This reading he also  
adopts.—The rationale of the blunder at xiv. 2. 59 (see note) appears to  
be Similar. Cf. also the accent of *sarvé* at xiii. 4. 21, and note.⌋

## Translation
1. He who generated these two, heaven-and-earth; who clothes himself in  
existences, making them a garment (*drā́pi*); in whom abide the six wide  
directions, toward which he, the flying one, looks all abroad—against  
that god, angered, \[is\] this offense (*ā́gas*); whoso scathes a Brahman  
that knows thus, do thou, O ruddy one, make him quake, destroy him;  
fasten on the fetters of the Brahman-scather.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
All the mss. agree in the accent of *drā́pi* (RV. always *drāpí*). As is  
their habit, they give of the refrain only the single word *tásya*  
except in vss. 1 and 25; and there they set the *avasāna* not before  
*tásya*, but after *devásya:* in our edition this perversion of the  
natural division is corrected. The refrain, if we contract *yá evám* to  
*yāí ’vám*, is a regular *triṣṭubh;* its addition to a preceding verse  
makes this hymn one of especially long meters; the first verse, 8 pādas  
of 11 syllables each, is an exact *ākṛti*. The verse ⌊or the hymn: see  
introduction⌋ is (though v. 12. 9 has the same *pratīka*) doubtless the  
one quoted in Kāuś. 49. 19, with xiii. 1. 28 and xvi. 6. 1, to accompany  
the laying on of fetters; and Bloomfield suggests that the whole hymn  
(or *anuvāka*) is intended also in 63. 21, one does not see why.

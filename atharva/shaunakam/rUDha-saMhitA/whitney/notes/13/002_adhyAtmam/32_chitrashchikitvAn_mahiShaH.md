title = "३२ चित्रश्चिकित्वान् महिषः"

## Translation
32. Wondrous, understanding (*cikitvāṅs*), a bull (*mahiṣá*), an eagle,  
making to shine the two firmaments (*ródasī*), the  
atmosphere—day-and-night, clothing themselves about with the sun,  
lengthen out all his heroisms.

## Notes
The adjectives in **a, b** are nom. masc. sing., and the shift of  
construction in the second half-verse is a notable one. Ppp. combines  
*suparṇā ”roc-*, and reads *rodasīm* in **b**. The verse is used in  
Vāit. 33. 8 in a sacrificial session, with the remaining verses to the  
end of the hymn. Ppp. puts our vs. 33 before this. ⌊The first pāda is  
nearly the same as 42 **c**.⌋ ⌊Henry discusses the vs. in *Mém. de la  
Soc. de linguistique*, x. 86.⌋

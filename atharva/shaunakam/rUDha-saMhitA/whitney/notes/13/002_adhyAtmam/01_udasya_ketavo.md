## Translation
1. The bright (*śukrá*) shining lights (*ketú*) of him go up in the  
sky—of the men-watching Aditya, him of great courses (*-vratá*), liberal  
(*mīḍhvā́ṅs*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **d** *mahīvr-*. Kāuś. 58. 22 prescribes the use  
apparently of the whole hymn (with xvi. 3 and xvii.) in an act of  
worship to the rising sun, in a ceremony for long life; also (with the  
same and other hymns, and xiii. 1. 25) in 18. 25, in the *citrākarman:*  
see the note to 1. 25 above. Vāit. 9. 16 uses it in the *cāturmāsya*  
ceremony when turning toward the sun in the east.

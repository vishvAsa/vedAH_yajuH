## Translation
26. He who belongs to all men (*-carṣaṇí*) and has faces on all sides,  
who has hands on all sides and palms on all sides—he brings together  
with his (two) arms, together with his wings (pl.), generating  
heaven-and-earth, sole god.

## Notes
The verse is, with considerable variations, RV. x. 81. 3, found also in  
VS. (xvii. 19: same text as RV.), TS. (iv. 6. 2⁴), TA. (x. 1. 3), and  
MS. (ii. 10. 2). None of the other texts has *yás* in **b**, and only  
MS. in **a**; they begin *viśvátaścākṣur* (but MS. *yó viśvácakṣur*); in  
**b**, RV.VS. begin with *viśvátobāhur*, TS.TA.MS. *-hasta*, and all end  
with *viśvátaspāt;* in **c**, for *bhárati*, RV. (and VS.) has  
*dhámati*, TS.TA. *námati*, MS. *ádhamat;* in **d**, RV.VS.MS. give  
*dyā́vābhū́mī*. Ppp. agrees with RV. in **b-d**. The meter, fairly regular  
in RV., is distorted greatly in our text (13 + 13: 11 + 12 = 49); the  
Anukr. gives an acceptable definition of it. The sense also is much  
defaced in the first line as we have it. Vāit. 29. 14 uses the verse to  
accompany a certain *graha* in the building of the fire-altar.

## Translation
6. Well-being, O sun, \[be\] to thy chariot for its moving, wherewith  
thou goest at once about both borders (*ánta*)—which thy yellow steeds,  
of excellent draught, draw: a hundred horses, or else seven, numerous.

## Notes
'At once' (*sadyás*), doubtless 'on one and the same day'; 'borders,'  
i.e. 'horizons.' Half the mss. read *báhiṣṭhās*, both in this and in the  
next verse. Ppp. has in **a** *carato rathāsi*, and in **b**  
*paryāsi;*\* and for **d**, instead of repeating 7 **d**, it gives *tam  
ā roha sukham āsy aśvam*. ⌊"Numerous" is fem.; and we may think of  
"horses" as fem.⌋ \*⌊For the relation of *pariyāsi* to *paryāsi*, cf.  
that of *-āni yasya* to *-āṅsy asya*, above, x. 7. 20, and see *Gram.*  
§233 a.⌋

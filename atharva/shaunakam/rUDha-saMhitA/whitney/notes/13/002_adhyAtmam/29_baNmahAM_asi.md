## Translation
29. Verily (*báṭ*), great art thou, O sun; verily, O Āditya, great art  
thou; great is the greatness of thee the great one; thou, O Āditya, art  
great.

## Notes
This verse is RV. viii. 90 (or 101). 11, and is found also in VS.  
(xxxiii. 39) and SV. (i. 276; ii. 1138), while its *pratīka* is given by  
TB. (i. 4. 5³: very strange, since the whole verse occurs in no  
Tāittirīya text). RV. and VS. read, for **c, d**, *mahás te sató mahimā́  
panasyate ‘ddhā́ deva mahā́ṅ asi;* ⌊the vs. is repeated in RV. form at xx.  
58. 3;⌋ and SV. the same, except *paniṣṭama mahnā́* for *panasyate  
‘ddhā́*.

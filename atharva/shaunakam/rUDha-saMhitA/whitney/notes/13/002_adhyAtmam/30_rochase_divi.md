## Translation
30. Thou shinest (*ruc*) in the sky, thou shinest in the atmosphere, O  
flying one; on the earth thou shinest, thou shinest within the waters;  
both oceans thou hast penetrated (*vi-āp*) with thy sheen (*rúci*); a  
god, O god, art thou, a heaven-conquering bull (*mahiṣá*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *svarvit*. The Anukr. understands the structure of  
the verse as 12 + 9 + 7: 12 + 11 = 51; but it is plainly a mixed  
*triṣṭubh-jagatī*, rather, with *patan̄ga* intruded at the end of **a**,  
and possibly one *rócase* in **b**. All the mss. accent *patan̄ga*,  
because they reckon it, with the Anukr., as first word in a pāda; it  
should properly be *patan̄ga*.

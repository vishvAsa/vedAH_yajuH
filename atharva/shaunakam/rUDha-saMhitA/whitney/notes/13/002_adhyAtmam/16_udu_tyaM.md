## Translation
16. This heavenly Jātavedas the lights (*ketú*) draw (*vah*) up, for  
every one to see the sun.

## Notes
Or *sū́ryam* may be in apposition with *jātávedasam*. 'Draw,' i.e. as  
horses do. This verse, with the eight that follow, constitute RV. i. 50.  
1-9, in the same order of verses, and with few variants; they are also  
all found in one or more other Vedic texts: this one in SV. (i. 31), VS.  
(7. 41; 8. 41; 33. 31), TS. (i. 2. 8²; 4. 43¹), and MS. (i. 3. 37)—in  
all, without a variant. The whole hymn ⌊i.e. vss. 16-24⌋ is repeated  
further in xx. 47. 13-21. This verse is used three times in Vāit.: at  
21. 23; at 33. 5 (with the following five verses); and at 39. 16 (with  
the following two verses). ⌊The *pratīka* is cited at MGS. i. 2. 4. The  
frequency of the citation or occurrence of the verse may be judged by  
consulting MGS. Index, p. 148.⌋

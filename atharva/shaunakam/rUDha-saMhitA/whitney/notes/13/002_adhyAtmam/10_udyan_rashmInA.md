## Translation
10. Rising, thou extendest thy rays; thou adornest thyself with all  
forms; thou illuminest (*vi-bhā*) with might (? *krátu*) both oceans,  
encompassing all worlds, shining.

## Notes
Ppp. has an altogether different **b**: *prajās sarvā vi paśyasi*. ⌊It  
may be that "adornest" is a slip on W's part. Cf. Henry's note, p.  
37-38.⌋

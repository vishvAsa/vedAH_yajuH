## Translation
45. Thine, too, are two billions, \[many\] billions (?); or else thou  
art a hundred million.

## Notes
The translation implies the readings *bádve bádvāni*, which, on account  
of the accent, seem probably meant by the mss., which vary between  
*bádhv-, báddh-, báddhv-;* K. reads *baddhve vádvāni*, D. *báddhe  
baddhā́ni*. ⌊SPP's authorities also exhibit very wide disagreements,  
which reflect a corresponding uncertainty of the tradition.⌋ The word is  
just such a one as the mss. might be expected to boggle and blunder  
over, both they and we being left without help from the sense. Henry,  
who accepts the same emendation, understands *bádve* as locative, which  
is perhaps better, and at any rate favored by the fact that the  
*pada*-text does not read *bádve íti*.

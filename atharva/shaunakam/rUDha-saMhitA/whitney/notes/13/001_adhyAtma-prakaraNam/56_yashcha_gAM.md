## Translation
56. Whoever both kicks a cow with the foot and urinates in face of the  
sun—of such a one I hew off (*vraśc*) thy root; thou shalt not further  
cast (*kṛ*) shadow.

## Notes
⌊Cf. the note on the vs. concerning posture in urination at vii. 102:  
and add that Buddhaghosa, in his comment on the description of the  
Acelakas, at Dīgha Nikāya, viii. 14 (as reported by Davids, Translation,  
p. 227), speaks of the standing posture as wrong.—As to making water  
with face towards the sun, cf. MBh. xiii. 104. 75 (5029), and note to  
Manu iv. 48 in my *Reader*, p. 349, and the references there given,  
especially the reference to Jolly's Viṣṇu, SBE. vii. 194 f.—As for the  
loss of the shadow, cf. the Peter Schlemihl story; also Jātaka, i. 102⁹;  
vi. 337¹¹.⌋  
  
The character of this and the following verses shows that Ppp. has  
reason for not making them a part of the hymn. This verse makes its  
appearance in Kāuś. 49. 26, at the conclusion of a series of witchcraft  
ceremonies. ⌊For the theoretical *k* of *pratyán̄k*, see note to vi. 51.  
1.⌋

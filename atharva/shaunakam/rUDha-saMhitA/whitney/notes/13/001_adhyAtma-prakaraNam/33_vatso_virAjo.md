## Translation
33. The young (*vatsá*) of the *virā́j*, the bull of prayers (*matí*),  
mounted, bright-backed, the atmosphere; with ghee they sing (*arc*) the  
song (*arká*) unto the young; him, being *bráhman*, they increase with  
*bráhman*.

## Notes
Ppp. combines in **b** *-pṛṣṭho ant-*. TB. (ii. 8. 8⁹) has a  
corresponding verse, but with numerous variants: *pitā́ virā́jām ṛṣabhó  
rayīṇā́m antárikṣaṁ viśvárūpa ā́ viveśa: tám arkāír abhy àrcanti vatsám  
bráhma sántam bráhmaṇā vardháyantaḥ*. ⌊Bloomfield, AJP. xii. 441, would  
emend *arkám* to *aktám*; but the TB. variant is very much against it.⌋  
Our verse is quoted in Kāuś. 12. 4, at the end of a charm for securing  
one's wishes.

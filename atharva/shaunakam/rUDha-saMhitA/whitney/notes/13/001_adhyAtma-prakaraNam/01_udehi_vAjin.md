## Translation
1. Rise up, O powerful one (? *vājín*) that \[art\] within the waters,  
enter into this kingdom \[that is\] full of pleasantness; the ruddy one  
(*róhita*) that generated this all—let him bear thee, well-borne, unto  
kingdom.

## Notes
*Róhita* is evidently a name or form of the sun; and the *vājin* (Henry,  
'conqueror of booty') addressed is also the sun. The verse ⌊with faulty  
accents⌋ is found also in TB. (ii. 5. 2¹), which reads ⌊*asi* after *yó*  
in **a**⌋, *ā́ viśa* in **b**, and, for **d**, *sá no rāṣṭréṣu súdhitāṁ  
dadhātu*, which seems better, as removing the difficulty of the sun  
establishing the sun. Ppp. reads *viśvabhṛtaṁ* for *viśvam idam* in  
**c**; and it has *pipartu* for *bibhartu* at the end; ⌊we had the  
converse at xi. 5. 4⌋. The resolution *ud-ā́-ihi* is required to fill out  
the meter of **a**. All the four hymns of the book (under the name  
*rohitās*) are prescribed in Kāuś. 99. 4 to be used in case of a  
darkening (eclipse) of the sun. The first half-verse is, according to  
Kāuś. 49. 18, to be used in the witchcraft ceremony of the  
'water-thunderbolts' (see x. 5) 'when the boat sinks.' ⌊Cf. AJP. xii.  
431.⌋

title = "५३ वर्षमाज्यं घ्रंसो"

## Translation
53. Rain as sacrificial butter, heat as fire, earth as sacrificial  
hearth took shape; there, with songs (*gír*), the fire shaped these  
mountains aloft.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *‘gnir* in **a**, and some of our mss. (P.M.p.m.W.) give the  
same. P.M.W. also have in common the blunder *bhū́mipr ak-* in b. It is  
doubtless by a loss of part of its text that the Anukr. does not define  
vss. ⌊57-58⌋ as *anuṣṭubh*, although it describes a minor feature of vs.  
57, taken as an *anuṣṭubh*. ⌊With 52, cf. vs. 46.⌋

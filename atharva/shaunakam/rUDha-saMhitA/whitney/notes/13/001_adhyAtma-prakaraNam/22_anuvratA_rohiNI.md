## Translation
22. She that is ruddy (*róhiṇī*) is submissive to the ruddy one, being  
liberal (*sūrí*), of beautiful color, vast (*bṛhatī́*), very splendid; by  
her may we conquer booty (? *vā́jān*) of all forms; by her may we  
overcome all fighters.

## Notes
*Róhiṇī*, doubtless the dawn. Our *pada*-mss. read in **c** *-rūpām*, by  
a blundering misapprehension of the assimilated nasal in the combination  
*-pāṅ ja-* ⌊Prāt. ii. 11⌋. M.p.m. ⌊and SPP's C.⌋ read at end *syāma;*  
the passage is quoted as an instance of *ṣy-* in the comm. to Prāt. ii.  
107. Ppp. reads *sūryas suv-* in **b**, and combines *pṛtanā ’bhi* in  
**d**. In the Anukr. (by an exceptional usage hardly met with elsewhere)  
this verse and the next, and a little later vs. 27, are specified as  
*prākṛta* ⌊mss. *prakṛta*⌋: i.e., as following the established norm of  
the hymn, which is *triṣṭubh*.

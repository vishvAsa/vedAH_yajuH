## Translation
16. This one clothes himself in the embryo (womb?) of the earth; this  
one clothes himself in the sky, the atmosphere; this one, on the summit  
of the reddish one, has penetrated the heaven (*svàr*), the worlds.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *viṣṭapas sv-* in **c-d**, and *sam ānaśe* in **d**. The  
verse (9 + 9: 8 + 8 = 34) seems to be overlooked in the Anukr., or its  
definition has dropped out of the mss. Verses 16-20 are prescribed in  
Kāuś. 54. 10 to accompany, in the *godāna*-ceremony, the dressing of the  
child in a new garment. They are much better suited to that use than to  
their surroundings here.

## Translation
15. Unto thee ascended *bṛhatī́* and *pan̄ktí*, unto \[thee\], O  
Jātavedas, *kakúbh* with honor; unto thee ascended the *uṣṇíhā*  
syllable, the *váṣaṭ*-utterance; unto thee ascended the ruddy one along  
with seed.

## Notes
Or *uṣṇihā॰akṣaráḥ* (so p.) is, in spite of its accent, an adjective to  
*vaṣaṭkāraḥ* (so Henry). Read in **a** *bṛhaty ùtá;* though all our mss.  
except ⌊O.⌋ K. happen to agree here in lengthening the *ù*. *Saha* at  
the end is, of course, a misprint for *sahá*. Ppp. reads *at* for *uta*  
in **a**, and *viśvavedaḥ* in **b**. ⌊The Anukr. appears to count the  
syllables as 11 + 10: 13 + 13 = 47.⌋ The metrical irregularities in this  
book exceed the ordinary measure. ⌊For vss. 15, 17-20, cf. AJP. xii.  
434.⌋

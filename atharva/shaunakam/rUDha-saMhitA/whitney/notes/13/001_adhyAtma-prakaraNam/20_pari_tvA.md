## Translation
20. May Savitar, god Agni, surround thee \[with honor\]; with honor may  
Mitra-and-Varuṇa deck (*abhi*⌊+*dhā*⌋) thee; striding down all niggards  
come thou; thou hast made this kingdom full of pleasantness.

## Notes
The shift from *pári* in **a** to *abhí* in **b** makes a mixed and  
difficult construction. Ppp. combines *devo ‘gnir* in **a** and *sarvā  
’rātīr* in **c**, and reads (better) *kṛṇuhi* in **d**.

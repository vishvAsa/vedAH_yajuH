## Translation
2. Up hath arisen the power (? *vā́ja*) that is within the waters; mount  
(*ā-ruh*) thou the clans (*víś*) that are sprung from thee (*tvádyoni*);  
assuming (*dhā*) the soma, the waters, the herbs, the kine, make thou  
the four-footed, the two-footed ones to enter here.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In **b** begins the play of words upon the root *ruh* 'ascend, mount,  
grow,' and its compounds and derivatives; this play is suggested by the  
at least apparent relationship between *ruh* and *rohita*, ⌊and is found  
with considerable elaboration throughout⌋ these hymns. Here it doubtless  
signifies 'have supremacy over.' Ppp. combines in **b** *viśā ”roha*, in  
**c** *dadhāna ’po ’ṣadh-*, and in **d** *dvipadā ’veś-*; and this last  
we have to accept in order to make a *triṣṭubh* pāda. In **a** the  
resolution of *ā́ agan*, and in **b** that of *tuád-*, make the meter  
right. The Anukr. takes no notice of any irregularity in the verse.

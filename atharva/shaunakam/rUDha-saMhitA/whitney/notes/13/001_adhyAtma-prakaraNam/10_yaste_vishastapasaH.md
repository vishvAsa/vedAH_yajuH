## Translation
10. What clans (*víś*) of thine came into being out of ardor (*tápas*),  
those have come hither after the young (*vatsá*), the *gāyatrī́;* let  
them enter (*ā-viś*) into thee with propitious mind; let the ruddy young  
with its mother go against \[them\].

## Notes
Or (in **a**) 'what clans came into being out of thy heat.' In **b**,  
the *pada*-text has *ihá: ā́: aguḥ*. In **d**, *sámmātā* means more  
probably 'having a common mother,' but the sense is too obscure to allow  
of much confidence in any translation. The TB. version (ii. 5. 2²) reads  
in **a** *tápasā* (better); for **b**, *gāyatráṁ vatsám ánu tā́s ta ā́  
’guḥ;* in **c**, *máhasā svéna;* in **d**, *putró* (for *vatsó*). The  
Anukr. does not heed that the last pāda is *jagatī*. Ppp. combines in  
**d** *vatso ‘bhy*.

## Translation
21. All the gods in him become single.

## Notes
The last three verses are nearly identical with 11-13 above. Of the last  
two the Anukr. does not define the meter, perhaps by an omission in the  
ms. (or else because they were defined just above). All our mss. save  
one (D.) ⌊and all SPP's authorities, except P²⌋ accent *sarvé* in 21, as  
if because of *eté* in 13. ⌊Both editions emend to *sárve*.⌋

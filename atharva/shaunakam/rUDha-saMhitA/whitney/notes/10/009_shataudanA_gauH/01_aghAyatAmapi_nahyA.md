## Translation
1. Fasten thou up the mouths of the mischief-making ⌊ones⌋; bring  
(*arpay-*) this thunderbolt upon our rivals; given by Indra, first, with  
a hundred rice-dishes, cousin-slaying, the success (*gātú*) of the  
sacrificer.

## Notes
It is a cow (f.) accompanied by a whole hundred of *odanas* or offerings  
of boiled rice, that is here the subject; we had in various places above  
a goat (m.) with five such additions. Ppp. reads in **d** *yajamānāya*.  
The Anukr. does not heed that the third pāda is *jagatī*.

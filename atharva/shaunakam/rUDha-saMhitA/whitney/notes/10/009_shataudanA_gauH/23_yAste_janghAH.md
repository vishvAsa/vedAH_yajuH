## Translation
23. What hind-thighs are thine, what dew-claws, \[what\] pasterns  
(*ṛchára*), and what thy hoofs—let them yield etc. etc.

## Notes
One of our mss. (O.) reads in **b** *ṛtsárās*, and Ppp. supports it by  
giving *kṛtsarās*.  
  
⌊The reading *ṛtsárās* seems to be supported by E. as well as by O. and  
Ppp. Its phonetic relation to *ṛcchárās* resembles that of Pāli  
*ucchādana, jighacchā, bībhaccha* to Skt. *utsādana, jighatsā, bībhatsa*  
(Kuhn, *Pāli-gram.*, p. 52, gives *kucchā* = kutsā, *vaccha* = *vatsa*).  
Unless I err, our vulgate text here shows a Prākritism such as we have  
good right to assume also at iii. 12. 4, in case of the much-discussed  
*ucchántu*, which may be a mere vernacularized rendering of *ukṣántu*  
(cf. *tacchaka* = *takṣaka*, Kuhn, l.c.).⌋

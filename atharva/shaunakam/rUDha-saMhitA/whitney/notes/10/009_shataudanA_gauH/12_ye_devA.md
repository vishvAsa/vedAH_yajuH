title = "१२ ये देवा"

## Translation
12. The gods that are stationed (*-sad*) in the sky, and that are  
stationed in the atmosphere, and these that are upon the earth—to them  
do thou always yield (*duh*) milk, butter, also honey.

## Notes
Several of the mss., with a carelessness common in such cases, read  
*dhukṣa* in **d**. We have to resolve *deva-ā* in **a**, in order to  
make a normal pāda. Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by reading instead  
*pitaras* for *devās*. ⌊Ppp. combines *-ṣado ‘ntar-* in **a-b**.⌋

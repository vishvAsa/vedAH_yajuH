## Translation
3. Be thy tail-tuft the sprinklers; let thy tongue do the cleansing, O  
inviolable one; do thou, having become clean, fit for sacrifice, go on  
to heaven, O thou of the hundred rice-dishes.

## Notes
The form *bā́las* (which Ppp. also reads) ⌊as against *vā́las*⌋ is vouched  
for ⌊incidentally⌋ by the comm. to Prāt. i. 66 ⌊in its discussion of the  
exchange of *r* and *l*⌋. The verse is quoted in Kāuś. 65.9. *Sam  
mārṣṭu* = 'serve as *sammārjana*.'

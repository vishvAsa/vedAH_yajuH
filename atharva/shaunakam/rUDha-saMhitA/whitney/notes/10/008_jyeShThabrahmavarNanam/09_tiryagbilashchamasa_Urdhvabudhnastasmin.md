## Translation
9. A bowl (*camasá*) with orifice sideways, bottom-side up—in it is  
deposited glory of all forms; there sit together the seven seers, who  
have become the keepers of it, the great one.

## Notes
The verse has a correspondent in śB. xiv. 5. 2⁴ (BAU. ii. 2. 4). This  
reads at the beginning *arvā́gbilas;* in **c**, *tásya...tī́re* for  
*tát...sākám;* and, for **d**, *vā́g aṣṭamī́ brā́hmaṇā saṁvidānā́*. The  
Brāhmaṇa itself explains the head as intended, the seven seers being the  
seven *prāṇas* or senses (the seven orifices of the head); this is  
extremely implausible. Ppp. reads at beginning of **c** *atrā ”sata*.

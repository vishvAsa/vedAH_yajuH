## Translation
13. Prajāpati goes about (*car*) within the womb; not being seen, he is  
manifoldly born (*vi-jā*); with a half he has generated all existence;  
what his \[other\] half is—which sign is that?

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The third pāda is the same with 7 **c** above; the second half-verse is  
found below as xi. 4. 22 **c, d**; to the first half-verse corresponds  
VS. xxxi. 19 **a, b** and TA. iii. 13. 1³ **a, b**: both reading  
*ájāyamānas* at beginning of **b**; ⌊so *Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 84⌋. Ppp. reads  
in **b** *prajāyate*, and, for **c, d**, *ardhene ’daṁ pari babhūva  
viśvam etasyā ’rdhaṁ kim u taj jajāna*. The Anukr. takes no notice of  
the *jagatī* pāda **b**.

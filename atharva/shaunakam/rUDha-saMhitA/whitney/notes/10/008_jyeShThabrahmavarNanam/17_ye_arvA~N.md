## Translation
17. They who hitherward, in the middle, or also anciently, speak round  
about him who knows the Veda, they all speak around the sun (*ādityá*),  
Agni \[as\] second, and the threefold swan (*haṅsá*).

## Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (ii. 15⁸), which omits *mádhye* and reads  
*purāṇé* in **a**, and *tṛtī́yam* (for *trivṛ́tam*) in **d**. ⌊Cf.  
*Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 63.⌋ Our *pada*-text ⌊as also SPP's⌋ reads near the  
beginning *arvā́n̄*, which is doubtless an error for *arvā́k* (though TA.  
reads *arvā́n̄ utá*). Perhaps *védam* in **b** is to be rendered simply  
'knowledge.' The Anukr. takes no notice of the two redundant syllables  
in **c**.

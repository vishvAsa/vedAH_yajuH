title = "१२ अनन्तं विततं"

## Translation
12. What is endless, stretched out on many sides; what is endless, and  
what has an end, ending together—these (two) the lord of the firmament  
keeps (*car*) separating (*vi-ci*), knowing what is and what shall be of  
it.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *samakte* at end of **b**, *prajānan* at end of **c**, *yadi*  
for *uta* in **d**. Probably earth and heaven are intended. The metrical  
definition of the Anukr. fits the verse (9 + 10: 11 + 10 = 40) fairly.

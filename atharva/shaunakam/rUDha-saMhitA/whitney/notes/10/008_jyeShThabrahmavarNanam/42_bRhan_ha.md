## Translation
42. The reposer, the assembler of good things, like god Savitar, of true  
ordinances (*-dhárman*), he stood like Indra in the conflict for riches.

## Notes
The verse corresponds with pādas **a, c, d** of RV. x. 139. 3 and of VS.  
xii. 66, TS. iv. 2. 5⁴, MS.ii. 7. 12. RV. reads at the beginning *rāyó  
budhnáḥ* (for *nivéśanaḥ*) the other texts have at the end *pathīnā́m*.  
The verse is quoted in Vāit. 28. 28.

## Translation
3. Three offspring (*prajā́*) went an over-going; others settled  
(*ni-viś*) about the sun (? *arká*); great stood the traverser  
(*vimā́na*) of space (*rájas*); the yellow one (m.) entered into the  
yellow ones (f.).

## Notes
The verse is RV. viii. 90 (101). 14, which reads, for **a**, *prajā́ ha  
tisró atyā́yam īyur;* at end of **b**, *viviśre;* for **c, d**, *bṛhád  
dha tasthāu bhúvaneṣv antáḥ pávamāno haríta ā́ viveśa* (the last pāda is  
our 40 **d** below). AA. (ii. 1. 1⁴) has the same version as RV. JB.  
(ii. 224) has a version agreeing in the main with RV., but beginning  
like ours, *tisro ha prajā*, ending **b** with *viviśyur*, beginning  
**c** with *bṛhan* (but *bṛhad* in a following brief exposition); in  
**c**, again, with our text, *rajaso vimānāi ’va* (in the exposition  
simply *vimāne*); in **d** as RV. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
defective fourth pāda. Ppp. reads *na* (for *ha*) and *vimānaṁ* in  
**c**, and combines *prajā ’ty-*, and *anyā ’rkam*.

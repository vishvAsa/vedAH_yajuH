## Translation
34. Of whom the wind \[was\] breath-and-expiration, \[of whom\] the  
An̄girases were the eye; who made the quarters fore-knowing (?  
*prajñā́na*)—to that chief *bráhman* be homage.

## Notes
Ppp. gets rid of the obscure *prajñānīs* by reading for **c** *divaṁ yaś  
cakre mūrdhānaṁ*. The Anukr. describes correctly vss. 34 and 36.

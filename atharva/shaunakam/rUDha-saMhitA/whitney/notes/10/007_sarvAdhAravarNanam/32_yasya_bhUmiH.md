## Translation
32. Of whom earth is model (*pramā́*) and atmosphere belly; who made the  
sky his head—to that chief *bráhman* be homage.

## Notes
In this and the two following verses and vs. 36 we have the anomaly that  
*bráhman*, neuter, is apparently referred to by the masculine relative  
*yás* (in accordance with which the genitive *yásya* is also doubtless  
to be understood as masculine); perhaps we ought to render the last pāda  
thus: 'to him, \[who is\] the chief *bráhman*,' etc. ⌊Cf. Deussen, p.  
312.⌋ The verse is shorter by two syllables than verses 34 and 36, with  
which the Anukr. reckons it, and, on the other hand, agrees with 33, to  
which the Anukr. gives a different name.

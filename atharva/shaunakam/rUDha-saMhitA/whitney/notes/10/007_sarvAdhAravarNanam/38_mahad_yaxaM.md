## Translation
38. A great monster (*yakṣá*) in the midst of the creation (*bhúvana*),  
strode (? *krāntá*) in penance on the back of the sea—in it are set  
(*śri*) whatever gods there are, like the branches of a tree roundabout  
the trunk.

## Notes
The first pāda is repeated below, as 8. 15 **c**. Ppp. combines in **d**  
to *paritāi ’va*. Notwithstanding the lack of a syllable in **a**, the  
Anukr. ⌊balancing **a** with redundant **d**?⌋ calls the verse simply a  
*triṣṭubh;* the hymn is so long that it has apparently been forgotten  
that the whole was called *trāiṣṭubha*, and that therefore no *triṣṭubh*  
needs a further specification. Since there are more regular  
*anuṣṭubh*-verses than *triṣṭubh* also, we should expect rather the  
designation *ānuṣṭubham* for the hymn. Read at end of **a** *mádhye* (an  
accent-sign dropped out). ⌊With regard to Brahm as a "wonder" (*yakṣá*),  
see introduction.⌋

title = "२५ बृहन्तो नाम"

## Translation
25. Great (*bṛhánt*) by name \[are\] those gods who were born out of the  
non-existent; that one member of Skambha people call non-existent  
beyond.

## Notes
The second half-verse is capable of other interpretations; Ludwig emends  
*parás* to *purā́;* Muir, tacitly, to *páram;* Scherman translates it  
'afterwards' (*nachher*); Ppp. reads instead *puras*. One of our mss.  
reads in **b** *‘satas p-;* ⌊and so does SPP. without report of  
variant⌋.

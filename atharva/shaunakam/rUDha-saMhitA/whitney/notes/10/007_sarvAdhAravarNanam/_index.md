## Comment

Found also (except vss. 13, 42-44) in Pāipp. xvii. (with slight differences of order, noted under the verses). Neither Kāuś. nor Vāit. takes any notice of the hymn.—*⌊If the hymn is trāiṣṭubham, why are these verses specified? see note to 38.⌋ †⌊As to the Anukr's description of this verse, see under the verse.⌋


## Translations
Translated: Muir, v. 380-384 (vss. 1-41); Ludwig, p. 400; Scherman, p. 50 (vss. 1-41: with comment); Deussen, Geschichte, i. 1. 310 (sympathetic interpretation and useful introduction); Henry, 22, 68; Griffith, ii. 26.—As to the appearance of Brahm as a new conception, as a Wunderding (yakṣá: vs. 38), cf. the Kena Upanishad, § 3, vss. 14-25, and Deussen's introduction, Sechzig Upanishad's, p. 204.—The hymn is nearly related to the following one (8), and, with many a riddle and paradox, they both lead up to the fundamental conception of the Upanishads (see last verse of hymn 8), the idea of the Ātman.—In the new volume of the Ved. Stud., iii. 126 ff., Geldner discusses yakṣá at length.

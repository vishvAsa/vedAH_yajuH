## Translation
35. The *skambhá* sustains both heaven-and-earth here; the *skambhá*  
sustains the wide atmosphere; the *skambhá* sustains the six wide  
directions; into the *skambhá* hath entered this whole existence  
(*bhúvana*).

## Notes
The *pada*-text has (as translated) *skambhé* in **d**. Ppp. puts the  
verse after our 36, and reads in **a** *pṛthivīṁ dyām utā ’mūṁ*, and in  
**d** combines *skambhāi ’daṁ*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the  
irregularity of the verse (14 + 11: 11 + 13 = 49). ⌊Bergaigne, *Rel.  
Véd.*, ii. 122, would separate *pradiśas* from *urvīs*.⌋

title = "४२ तन्त्रमेके युवती"

## Translation
42. A certain pair of maidens, of diverse form, weave, betaking  
themselves to it, the six-pegged web; the one draws forth the threads  
(*tántu*), the other sets \[them\]; they wrest not off (*apa-vṛj*), they  
go not to an end.

## Notes
*Ápa vṛñjāte* perhaps means only 'break off, finish.' ⌊*Ná gamāto*,  
'they shall not go' etc.⌋ A nearly related verse is found in TB. (ii. 5.  
5³); *dvé svásārāu vayatas tántram etát sanātánaṁ vítataṁ ṣáṇmayūkham:  
ávā ’nyā́ṅs tántūn kiráto dhattó anyā́n nā́ ’pa vṛjyā́te* (? both text and  
comm. have in the Calc. ed. *nā́ṣapṛjyā́te* ⌊and in the Poona ed.  
*nā́vapṛjyā́te* ) *ná gamāte ántam;* this is a preferable version  
especially of **c**. We have to resolve *tan-tṛ-am* in order to make a  
full triṣṭubh. ⌊The TB. comment makes the verse refer to day and night:  
cf. RV. i. 113. 3.⌋

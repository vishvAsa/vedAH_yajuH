## Translation
7. In what, having established \[them\], Prajāpati maintained all the  
worlds, that Skambha tell \[me\]: which forsooth is he?

## Notes
Many of our mss. appear to read *stabdhā́* in **a**, but it is doubtless  
only carelessness in writing. Here again, as above and in the verses  
below where the refrain is written out, part of the mss. accent *svít*.

## Translation
23. All trembled at the embryo, while being born, of her who gives not  
birth (? *asūsū́*); for "the cow hath given birth," they say of her;  
shaped (m.) by charms (*bráhman*); for it is her connection.

## Notes
Much here is obscure and doubtful. *Asūsū́* (not divided in p.) ought, by  
its accent, to be *asū-sū* 'giving birth to one who does not herself  
give birth' ⌊*Gram.* § 1147 c⌋. The connection of *kḷptás* with *vaśā́*  
is strange; the former belongs probably to *gárbhas* understood. The  
accent of *āhús* indicates that *hí* belongs with it, and not with  
*sasū́va*. The name *vaśā́* used for the cow throughout the hymn implies  
non-pregnancy. Ppp. reads at the end *brahmaṇā kḷpta* ⌊R's Collation  
spells it *klipta*⌋ *uta bandhur asyāt*. ⌊The verse may be counted as 36  
syllables; but the nearest approach to a natural scansion would seem to  
be 8 + 8: 11 (*taām*) + 11.⌋ ⌊I will not attempt to revise W's treatment  
of this verse. Griffith and the other translators may be consulted.⌋

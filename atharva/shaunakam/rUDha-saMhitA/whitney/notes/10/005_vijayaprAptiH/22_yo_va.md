## Translation
22. What untruth soever we have spoken since a three years' period,—let  
the waters protect me from all that difficulty, from distress.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
We had the second half-verse as vii. 64. 1 **c, d**; and Ppp. has again  
the same variants as there; it also reads in **a** *āikahāyanāt*. The  
word *trāihāyaṇā́t* (p. *trāihāyanā́t*) is noted in Prāt. iv. 83. The  
verse is quoted in Kāuś. 46. 50 in **a**. *prāyaścitta* ceremony ⌊Keś.:  
for lying or cheating⌋; and it is reckoned (see note to Kāuś. 32. 27) as  
belonging to the *aṅholin̄ga gaṇa*. The Anukr. does not heed the  
redundant syllable in **a**.

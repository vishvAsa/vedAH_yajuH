## Translation
49. Crush away the sorcerers with heat; crush away, O Agni, the demon  
with flame; crush away with burning the false worshipers; crush away the  
greatly gleaming ones that feed on lives.

## Notes
These two verses are viii. 3. 12, 13. As usual in such a case, only the  
first words are given here in the mss. (both *pada* and *saṁhitā*):  
thus, *yád agna íti dvé*. Unfortunately it was overlooked by us that  
*yád agne* begins not only viii. 3. 12, but also vii. 61. 1; and, though  
both passages fit about equally ill into the connection here, yet the  
meter of vii. 61. 1, 2, being *anuṣṭubh*, implies a less oversight on  
the part of the Anukr., and, on the whole, the chance is in favor of the  
latter passage (vii. 61. 1, 2) being the one here intended. If in any  
one of the mss. accessible to us since the publication of the text there  
occurs anything to settle the question, it has been overlooked by us.  
⌊SPP. fills out the *pratīka* with viii. 3. 12, 13; but herein he may  
merely have followed the Berlin edition.⌋

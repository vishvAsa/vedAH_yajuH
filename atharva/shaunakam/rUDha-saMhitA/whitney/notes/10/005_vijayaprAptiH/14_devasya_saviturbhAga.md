## Translation
14. God Savitar's portion are ye, sperm of the etc. etc.

## Notes
In these verses, Pāipp. makes 9 and 10, also 11 and 12, change places.  
After our 13 it inserts two more verses, beginning *bṛhaspater* and  
*prajāpater;* and in our 14 it omits *devasya*, and reads *śuklaṁ devīr  
āpo*. To read *dhattana* for *dhatta* ⌊and pronounce *dhā́manā* would  
make a regular *anuṣṭubh* of the refrain. The Anukr., as usual, gives no  
real description of the agglomeration, but calls 11 and 14 *pan̄kti*  
because they count up 40 syllables (9: 8 + 7: 8 + 8 = 40), and the  
others *bṛhatī* because they have nearly 36 syllables. As to the alleged  
quotation of vs. 7 in Kāuś. 49. 25, see above, note to vs. 6.

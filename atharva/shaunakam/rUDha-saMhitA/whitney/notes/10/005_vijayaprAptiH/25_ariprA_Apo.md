## Translation
25. Vishṇu's stride art thou, rival-slaying, earth-sharpened  
(*-sáṁśita*), Agni-brightened; after earth I stride out; from earth we  
disportion him who hates us, whom we hate; let him not live; him let  
breath quit.

## Notes
The Pāipp. version of sections B. and C. agrees with that of our text  
with only trifling differences; the details are not furnished. It is not  
difficult to read this and the following verses of B. into *śakvarī* and  
*atiśakvarī* verses, as required by the Anukr. (this, for example, as 10  
+ 10: 9 + 8: 9 + 10 = 56). The whole section, apparently, is quoted by  
its common *pratīka* in Kāuś. 6. 14, to accompany the taking of the  
Viṣṇu strides in a *parvan* ceremony; and again in 49. 14 ⌊after hurling  
the water-bolts: cf. introd.⌋. ⌊Cf. vii. 31. 1 **d**.⌋

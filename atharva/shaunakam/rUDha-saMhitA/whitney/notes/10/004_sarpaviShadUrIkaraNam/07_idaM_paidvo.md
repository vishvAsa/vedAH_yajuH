## Translation
7. Here was Pāidva born; this \[is\] his going-away; these \[are\] the  
tracks of the snake-slaying vigorous steed.

## Notes
⌊For the difficult and debatable form *ahighnyo*, BR. and W. assume a  
stem *ahighnī́*. This is probably to be considered, not as a feminine  
formation (cf. my *Noun-Inflection*, JAOS. x., p. 384), but rather as a  
masculine, like the masc. proper names *Tiraścī́* (l.c., p. 367 end), or,  
better, like the masculines *ahī́*, *āpathī́*, *prāvī́*, *starī́* etc.  
(about a dozen of them. l.c., p. 369, middle: genitive *ahyò* etc.). In  
the latter case we might regard the printed accent *ahighnyó*, when  
contrasted with the *ahyò* of the RV., as characteristic of the AV. (cf.  
l.c., p. 369 top): but both W's and SPP's authorities are here uncertain  
as to the accent: the majority have *ahighnyó*, p. *ahi॰ghnyáḥ;* K. and  
three of SPP's have *ahighnyò;* while W's D. and SPP's P.² have  
*áhi॰ghnyaḥ*.—Or have we, after all, to assume a stem *ahighní* (cf.  
*sahasraghní*, xi. 2. 12), of which this would be a genitive like  
*ary-ás?*—One wonders why the reading is not simply *ahighnó;* but not a  
ms., either of W's or of SPP's, gives that reading.—Cf. *atighnyàs*, xi.  
7. 16.⌋

## Translation
8. What is shut together may it not open; what is opened may it not shut  
together; in this field \[are\] two snakes, both a female and a male;  
those \[are\] both sapless.

## Notes
The first half-verse we had above as vi. 56. 1 **c, d** ⌊see note for  
suggested emendation⌋, also applied to a snake. The curiously irregular  
verse (7 + 7: 8 \[7?\] + 11 = 33) is strangely defined by the Anukr.

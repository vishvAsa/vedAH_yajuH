## Translation
9. Sapless here \[are\] the snakes, they that are near and they that are  
far; with a club (*ghaná*) I slay the stinger (*vṛ́ścika*), with a staff  
the snake that has come.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The second half-verse is found in a suppl. to RV. i. 191; see Aufrecht's  
RV.², p. 672; instead of *ahim* is there read *aham*. Ppp. reads *ye  
‘nti te ca* in **b**; and all our mss. ⌊save D., which has *áti*⌋ leave  
*anti* unaccented (it is emended to *ánti* in our text), as if by some  
carelessness *yé ‘nti* had been changed to *yé anti;* it is one of the  
strangest of the many strange blunders of the AV. text. ⌊One might think  
that this vs. or one much like it was had in mind by Karṇa in his  
address to śalya, MBh. viii. 40. 33 = 1848.⌋

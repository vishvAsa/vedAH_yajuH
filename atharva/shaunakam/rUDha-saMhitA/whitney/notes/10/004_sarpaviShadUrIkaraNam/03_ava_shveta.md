## Translation
3. Smite down, O white one, with the foot, both the fore and the hind;  
like water-floated wood, sapless \[is\] the snakes' poison, fierce water  
(*vā́r*).

## Notes
Ppp. puts the verse after our 4, and reads at the end *vār id ugram*.  
Part of our mss. (T.D.K.) read *vā́r*, accented, in both verses, and that  
seems most likely to be the true reading; the translation adopts it.  
⌊Pischel takes it as "halte auf," *Ved. Stud.*, ii. 75.⌋ The first  
half-verse is read in several *gṛhya-sūtras* (AGS. ii. 3. 3; PGS. ii.  
14. 4; śGS. iv. 18; HGS. ii. 16. 8), as part of a verse in a charm  
against serpents; they all begin with *apa* instead of *ava*. ⌊Cf. also  
MGS. ii. 7. i a.⌋ The verse (8 + 8: 8 + 8 + 3) would be more properly  
called *upariṣṭād bṛhatī*.  
  
⌊Cf. xviii. 1. 32 n.⌋

## Translation
26. He (it?) hath come to be afar; he hath obstructed the poison; he  
hath mixed poison in poison; Agni hath put out the snake's poison; Soma  
hath conducted \[it\] out; the poison hath gone after the biter; the  
snake hath died.

## Notes
Ppp. reads (corruptly) *āre ‘bhūd viṣam aro viṣe viṣam aprayāg api:  
agnir aher nir adhād viṣam somo anṛnāiḥ dviṣam ahīr amṛtaḥ*. Kāuś.  
prescribes the use of the verse in 32. 24. ⌊With the ideas of **b** and  
**e**, cf. vii. 88. 1. With reference to the auto-toxic action of  
snake-venoms, see note to v. 13. 4.⌋ ⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*,  
with 2 hymns and 51 verses. The quoted Anukr. says "*indrasya  
prathamaḥ*" (see vs. i).⌋

title = "२९ यो वै"

## Translation
29. Whoever indeed knoweth that *bráhman's* stronghold, covered with  
*amṛ́ta*—unto him both the *bráhman* and the Brahmans have given sight,  
breath, progeny.

## Notes
The verse is found also in TA. (i. 27. 3), which reads *purīm* at end of  
**b**, *brahmā* for *brāhmāś* in **b**, and *āyuḥ kīrtim* for *cakṣuḥ  
prāṇam* in **d** (the accentuation is corrupt and worthless through the  
whole verse). Ppp. has also in **d** *āyuṣ* for *cakṣuḥ*, and at the end  
*dadhuḥ*.

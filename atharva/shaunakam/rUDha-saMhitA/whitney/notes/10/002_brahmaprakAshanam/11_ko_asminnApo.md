## Translation
11. Who disposed in him waters, moving apart, much moving, produced for  
river-running, strong (*tīvrá*), ruddy, red, dark and turbid, upward,  
downward, crosswise in man?

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *āpo dadhāt*, and in **c** combines (as the meter  
requires us to read) *tīvrā ’ruṇā*. The verse (8 + 8 + 7: 11 + 11 = 45)  
is very stupidly defined as *jagatī* by the Anukr.

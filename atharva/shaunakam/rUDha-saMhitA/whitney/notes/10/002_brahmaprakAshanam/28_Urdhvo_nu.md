## Translation
28. Was he now created upward (*ūrdhvá*)? \[or\] was he now created  
crosswise? did man grow unto (*ā-bhū*) all the quarters?—he who knoweth  
the *bráhman's* stronghold, from which man is \[so\] called.

## Notes
The meaning of the protracted final syllables here is unquestionable,  
although it has been overlooked by both Muir and Ludwig. The cases of  
protraction call out much treatment from the Prāt.: see the rules i. 70,  
97, 105; iv. 6, 120, 121, and the notes upon them. The mss. differ in  
regard to accenting or leaving unaccented the final syllable of **b**;  
nor is the usage of either RV. or AV. sufficiently settled to determine  
which reading ought to be preferred. *Puruṣa* in this verse and the  
sequel seems to approach its later meaning of 'supernal Person or  
Spirit.' There is no apparent connection between the two halves of the  
verse: for the second, see vs. 30. The whole verse is wanting in Ppp.  
The Anukr. should have called it a *prastārapan̄kti;* *bhurig bṛhatī* is  
purely mechanical (10 + 11: 8 + 8 = 37).

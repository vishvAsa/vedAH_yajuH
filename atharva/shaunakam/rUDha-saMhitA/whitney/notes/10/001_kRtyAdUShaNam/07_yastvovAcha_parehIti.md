## Translation
7. He who said to thee "go forth," against the current, up-stream, him,  
O witchcraft, do thou return against; seek not us who are innocent.

## Notes
Of this verse is legible in Ppp. *udāyyam* in **b**; as for our mss.,  
they cannot be relied upon in the least to distinguish *pya* and *yya*,  
but the majority rather favor *udāyyàm*, while P. reads *-āryyàm*, D.  
*-ājyàm* (?), W. -*āhyam*. Neither word has been found anywhere else,  
but doubtless *udāpyàm* is the true form.

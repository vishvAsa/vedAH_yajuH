## Translation
2. Having a head, having a nose, having ears, put together, all-formed,  
by the witchcraft-maker—let her go far off; we push her away.

## Notes
The addition of a *ca* at the end of a would rectify the meter, and  
justify the Anukr. The *pada*-reading *śīrṣaṇ॰vátī* is by Prāt. iv. 99,  
and the word is quoted there in the comment as an example. Ppp. puts the  
adjectives in the accus., and reads, instead of our **c**: *pratyak pra  
hiṇmasi yaś cakāra tum ṛcchatu:* cf. vs. 5 **c** and v. 14. 11 **c**.

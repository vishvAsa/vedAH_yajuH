## Translation
10. In that we have come upon the ill-portioned one (fem.), bathed  
forth, whose young (*-vatsá*) is dead—let all ill (*pāpá*) go away from  
me; let property come unto (*upa-sthā*) me.

## Notes
The *pada*-mss. have in **b** *upa॰eyimá*, and combination to *upeyimá*  
falls under the rule Prāt. iii. 38, although the *ā* contained in  
*eyimá* (= *ā-īmiyá*) does not appear ⌊as *ā*⌋ in the *pada*-text. ⌊Ppp.  
ends a corruptly with *pṛṣṇipathāṁ*.⌋

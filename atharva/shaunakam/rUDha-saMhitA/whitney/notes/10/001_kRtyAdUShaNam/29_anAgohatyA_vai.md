title = "२९ अनागोहत्या वै"

## Translation
29. The slaying of an innocent person is indeed fearful, O witchcraft;  
slay thou not our cow, horse, man; wheresoever thou art set down, from  
there we make thee stand up; become thou lighter than a leaf.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The *pada*-text has in **d** *út: sthāp-*; the example of the omitted  
*s* is quoted under Prāt. ii. 18. The verse (10+ 10: 8 + 8 + 8 = 44) is  
very badly defined by the Anukr. Ppp. reads in **a** *-hatyam* and  
*bhīmam*.

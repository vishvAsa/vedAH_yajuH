## Translation
15. Saying "this is the road, O witchcraft," we conduct thee; thee that  
wast sent forth against \[us\] we send forth back again; by that  
\[road\] go against \[them\], breaking, like a draft-cow with a cart,  
all-formed, wearing a wreath (? *kurūṭín*).

## Notes
The last word is found only here, and has to be rendered conjecturally  
(with the Pet. Lexx.). All the *saṁhitā*-mss. ⌊or rather, most of them:  
see also note to Prāt. iii. 35⌋ combine *kṛtyé ’ti* ⌊and thus indeed the  
meter requires us to pronounce⌋; but our edition restores the more  
correct reading ⌊*kṛtya íti*⌋, since the Prāt. does not countenance the  
irregularity; we should expect to find it with *vandane ’va* (in ii.  
56). Ppp. reads at the beginning *ayaṁ panthā ’pinayāmi tvā kṛtye  
prahitāṁ prati* etc.; in **c** ⌊or rather **c-d**⌋, *tuñjaty anasvinī  
’va*. In the Anukr. it seems as if *catuṣpadā*. must be a misreading for  
*pañcapadā* (11 + 11: 8 + 8 + 8 = 46): but compare vs. 19.

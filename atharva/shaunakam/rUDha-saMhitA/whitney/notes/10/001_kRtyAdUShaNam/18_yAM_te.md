title = "१८ यां ते"

## Translation
18. What \[witchcraft\] they buried for thee in the *barhís*, what in  
the cemetery, \[what\] witchcraft or secret spell (*valagá*) in the  
field, or practised against thee in the householders' fire—they, being  
wiser, \[against thee\] who art simple, innocent.

## Notes
Ppp. helps both meter and sense by inserting *cakrus* before *barhiṣi*  
in **a**; it also arranges *kṛtyāṁ kṣetre* in **b**, combines *dhīratarā  
’nāg-* at the end, and adds, to complete the verse, *tam* ⌊so Roth's  
Collation! for *tām*?⌋ *ito nāśayāmasi*. The Anukr. notices neither the  
deficiency in **a** nor the redundancy in **d**.

title = "२६ परेहि कृत्ये"

## Translation
26. Go away, O witchcraft; stand not; lead, as it were, the track of one  
pierced; it is a deer, thou a deer-hunter; it is unable to put thee  
down.

## Notes
'Lead,' in **b**, appears to be used in the sense of 'follow'; the  
'track' is doubtless that of the maker: ⌊cf. note to xi. 2. 13⌋. The  
*pada*-text divides *mṛga॰yúḥ:* cf. Prāt. iii. 18.

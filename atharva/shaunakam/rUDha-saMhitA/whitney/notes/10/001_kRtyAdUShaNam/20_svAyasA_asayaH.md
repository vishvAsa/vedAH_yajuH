## Translation
20. There are knives of good metal in our house; we know thy joints, O  
witchcraft, how many they are; just stand up; go away from here; unknown  
one, what seekest thou here?

## Notes
That is, 'thou who art no acquaintance of ours.' The Anukr. is much more  
scrupulous than usual in calling the verse (12 + 11: 8 + 8 = 39) *virāj*  
⌊scanning a perhaps as 11⌋. Ppp. begins with *svayasā*. The third pāda  
is quoted in Kāuś. 39. 19.

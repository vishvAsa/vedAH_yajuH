## Translation
12. From sin against the gods, against the Fathers, from name-taking,  
that is designed, that is devised against \[any one\], let the plants  
free thee by their energy (*vīryà*), with spell (*bráhman*), with  
verses, with milk of the seers.

## Notes
'Milk' (*páyas*) in the last pāda looks like a corrupt reading, but Ppp.  
appears to have the same; Bp.E. accent *payasā́*. ⌊As for the  
combinations of *-ā ṛ-*, see note to Prāt. iii. 46.⌋ Several mss.  
(Bp.O.p.m.R.T.K.) read *pitryā̀t* in **a**. The verse, which ought to be  
called an *anuṣṭubgarbhā triṣṭubh* (11 + 8: 11 + 11 = 41), is very  
foolishly described by the Anukr. as a *pan̄kti*, because it contains  
nearly (and can easily be reduced to precisely) 40 syllables.

## Translation
3. In that the skilful smith (*tákṣan*) hath smitten thee away with the  
hand by a knife, from that let the lively, bright (*śúci*) waters purify  
thee, that art bright.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **b** *vāśyā*, which is the more proper form of the word.  
But *vāsyā* is read also in the Āp. (vii. 9. 9) version of the verse,  
which further has *te* for *tvā* in **a**, and, for **c, d**, *āpas tat  
sarvaṁ jīvalāḥ śundhantu śucayaḥ śucim*. In Kāuś. 8. 13 and Vāit. 10. 3,  
the verse is used to accompany the washing off of an instrument or post.

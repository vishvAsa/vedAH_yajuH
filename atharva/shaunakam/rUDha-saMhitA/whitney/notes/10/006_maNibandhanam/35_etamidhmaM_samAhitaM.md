## Translation
35. This fuel, laid on together, do thou, O Agni, enjoying, welcome with  
oblations; in him may we find favor, welfare, progeny, sight, cattle—in  
Jātavedas kindled with worship (*bráhman*).

## Notes
Some of our mss. (R.T.p.m.D.) read *agne* without accent, and this is  
decidedly preferable, since a pāda-division before *juṣāṇás* gives an  
*anuṣṭubh* pāda followed by a *triṣṭubh*, while one after the same word  
gives a *triṣṭubh* followed by an irregular combination of syllables.  
The *pada*-text puts its mark of pāda-division after *juṣāṇas*, to  
correspond with its accentuation of *ágne*. ⌊Of SPP's authorities, only  
four have *agne* against nine with *ágne*, and his text adopts the  
latter reading.⌋ The concluding division is hopelessly unmetrical. The  
Anukr. intends us to divide 8 + 11 (or 11 + 8): 8 + 8 + 11 = 46, a  
*virāḍ jagatī*. The verse is thrice quoted in Kāuś. (2. 41; 19. 24; 137.  
30) to accompany the piling of fuel on the fire. It is wanting in Ppp.  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. says for this sixth hymn *pañca* (i.e. 5 over  
30).—Here ends the third *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 85 verses.⌋

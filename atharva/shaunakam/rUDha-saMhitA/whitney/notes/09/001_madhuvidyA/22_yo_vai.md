## Translation
22. He who knows the seven honeys of the whip becomes rich in honey: the  
Brahman, and the king, and the milch-cow, and the draft-ox, and rice,  
and barley; honey the seventh.

## Notes
One does not see why the Anukr. calls the passage *brāhmī purauṣṇih*  
⌊that is ⁶⁄₄ of 12: 8 + 8 = 18: 12 + 12 = 42⌋ rather than simply *brāhmī  
uṣṇih* ⌊⁶⁄₄ of 8 + 8: 12 = 12 + 12: 18 = 42⌋; it is the only example of  
either name in the treatise. ⌊The not very sufficient reason for the  
preference would seem to be the position of the *avasāna*, which divides  
the "vs." as 18:24 and not as 24: 18.⌋ ⌊Ppp. has in **a** *madhukaśāyās*  
for *kaś-* and *sapta madhumatīm* for *madhumān bhavati;* then follows  
*madhumato lokāṅ jayati* (cf. vs. 23).⌋

## Translation
18. What honey on hills (*girí*), on mountains, what in kine, in horses,  
in strong drink (*súrā*) as poured out, what honey \[is\] there, \[be\]  
that in me.

## Notes
With this verse and the next are to be compared vi. 69. 1, 2 ⌊where the  
use by Vāit. is given⌋. Ppp. has only *yadi giriṣyavipāṁ citviṣī* in  
place of this verse, and puts it before our 16.

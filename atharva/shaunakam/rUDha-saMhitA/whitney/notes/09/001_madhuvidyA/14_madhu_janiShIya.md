## Translation
14. May I generate honey; may I win honey; rich in milk, O Agni, have I  
come; unite me here with splendor.

## Notes
The second part of the verse we have had above as vii. 89. 1 **c, d**.  
The edition reads, with all the mss., *vaṅśiṣīya*, but it should be  
emended to *vaṅsiṣīya* (root *van*); cf. the similar misreading at xvi.  
9. 4. Ppp. reads *madhu janiṣī manu mambikīyah;* and it combines *agnā  
"gamaṁ*. By reckoning the first part of the passage as metrical (which  
it is not) the Anukr. counts out a good *purauṣṇih*.

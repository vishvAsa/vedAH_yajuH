## Translation
6. Who knows (*pra-vid*) that, who understands (*cit*) that which  
\[is\] the unexhausted soma-holding vessel of the heart of it? The  
priest (*brahmán*) of excellent wisdom—he may revel in it.

## Notes
'Of it' (**b**) is fem., and so relates to the 'honey-whip'; 'in it,' at  
the end, relates to the 'vessel.' *Akṣitas* (Ppp. *akṣatas*) at the end  
of **b** is plainly an intrusive addition to the pāda; the Anukr.,  
wrongly reckoning the initial *a* of *asyās* as unelided, counts 15  
syllables in the pāda, and calls both this and the next verse by the  
unusual and indefinite name *mahābṛhatī*.

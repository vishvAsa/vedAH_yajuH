## Translation
35. Whoever knows the season "up-going" by name, each up-going fortune  
of his unfriendly foe he takes to himself; that verily is the season  
"up-going" by name, namely the goat etc. etc.

## Notes
These four verses agree in number of syllables, and the name given them  
by the Anukr. (*prakṛti*) demands 84; this number it is possible to make  
out by resolutions of *saṁdhi*, though the natural reading gives only 80  
(10 + 20: 15: 20 + 15 = 80). Saṁyatī́m॰saṁyatīn in vs. 33 **b** is quoted  
by the commentary under Prāt. iv. 44, as an example of a repeated  
separable word which gives up in *pada*-text its individual separation  
in favor of that between the repetitions. Read in 32 **c** *yád ajáḥ*  
(an accent-sign gone), and supply an omitted mark of punctuation after  
*datte* in 33.

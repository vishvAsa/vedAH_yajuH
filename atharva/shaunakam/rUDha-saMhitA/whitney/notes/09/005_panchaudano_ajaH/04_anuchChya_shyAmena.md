## Translation
4. Cut along this skin with the dark \[metal\], O slaughterer, joint by  
joint with the knife (*así*); do not plot against \[him\]; do not be  
hostile to \[him\]; prepare him joint-wise; set him up apart in the  
third firmament.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **d**, *sukṛtām madhye adhi vi śraye ’mam*. The Anukr.  
weakly calls the verse a *jagatī*, although it is a *triṣṭubh* with  
three redundant syllables (doubtless *śyāména* or *viśastar*) in **a**.  
The *pada*-text divides *paru॰śaḥ*, by Prāt. iv. 19.

title = "२१ सत्यं चर्तं"

## Translation
21. Both truth and right its eyes, all truth \[and\] faith its breath,  
the *virā́j* its head; this verily is an unlimited offering, namely  
(*yát*) the goat with five rice-dishes.

## Notes
The second *satyam* in vs. 21 is doubtless a corrupt reading, and the  
Ppp. version indicates that we should have instead *rūpám* ('the  
universe its form,' instead of 'all truth'). Ppp. reads, for the two  
verses: *ajaṣ pañcāudano vy akramaia tasyo ’ra iyam abhavad udaram  
antarikṣam: dyāuṣ ṭe pṛṣṭhaṁ diśaṣ pārśve: dīśaś cā ’tidīśaś ca śṛn̄ge  
satyaṁ ca ṛtaṁ ca cakṣuṣī viśvarūpaṁ śraddhā* etc. All the  
*saṁhitā*-mss. read *ca rtáṁ* (instead of *ca ṛtáṁ*) near the beginning  
of vs. 21. The text of the Anukr. is apparently defective, leaving out  
the metrical definition of vss. 20-22 and vs. 25.

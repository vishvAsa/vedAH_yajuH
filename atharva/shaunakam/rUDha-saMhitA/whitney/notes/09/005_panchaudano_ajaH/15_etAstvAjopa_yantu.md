## Translation
15. Unto thee, O goat, let these streams of soma (*somyá*) go, divine,  
ghee-backed, honey-dripping; establish thou earth and sky, upon the  
seven-rayed back of the firmament.

## Notes
The mss. in general (not P.M.) accent *ája* in **a**. They are rather  
evenly divided between *ádhi* and *‘dhi* in **d** (W.I.O.R.T.K. have  
*‘dhi*). Compare with **a, b** the refrain to iv. 34. 5-7. Ppp. reads  
for **a**: *etās tvā dadhārā ’cchamayanti viśvatās somyaṁ;* ⌊*somyaṁ*  
would seem to be the beginning of Ppp's **b**;⌋ in **c, d**, for  
*uta...pṛṣṭhe*, it gives *divaṁ sadasva nāke tiṣṭhāsy*. Pādas **b, c**  
are metrically irregular, but the Anukr. does not heed it.

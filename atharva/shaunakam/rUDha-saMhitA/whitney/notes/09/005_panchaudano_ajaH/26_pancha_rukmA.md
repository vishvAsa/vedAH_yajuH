## Translation
26. Five gold ornaments become light for him; his garments become a  
defense for his body, he attains the heavenly (*svargá*) world, who  
gives a goat with etc. etc.

## Notes
Here are plainly four pādas, of which the first three are metrical, with  
the refrain added (11 + 11: 8 + 15); the definition of the Anukr. seems  
to imply 11 + 10: 8 + 7 + 9 = 45 syllables, or a *bhurik triṣṭubh*.

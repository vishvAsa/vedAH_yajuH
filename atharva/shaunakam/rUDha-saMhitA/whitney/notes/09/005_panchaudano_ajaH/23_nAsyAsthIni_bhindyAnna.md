## Translation
23. He should not split its bones; he should not suck out its marrow;  
taking it all together, he should cause it to enter here and here.

## Notes
Or, 'should cause this and this to enter'; the sense is obscure. Ppp.  
reads in **c** *sarvāṇi* for *sarvam enam*. By calling the verse a  
*purauṣṇih*, the Anukr. intends that its first two pādas be read as one,  
of 12 syllables. The Kāuś. quotes (66. 31, 32; next after quotations of  
verses from hymn 3) both halves of the verse, the latter to accompany  
the act of piercing an object and scattering it into a pit filled with  
water.

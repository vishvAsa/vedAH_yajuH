## Translation
15. Between both heaven and earth what expanse \[there is\], therewith  
do I accept this dwelling of thine; the atmosphere that pervades  
(*vimā́na*) space (*rájas*), that do I make a paunch (*udára*) for  
treasures; therewith I accept the house for this man.

## Notes
This verse in Kāuś. 66. 28 accompanies the "acceptance" of the house in  
question. The Anukr. calls it an *atiśakvarī*, though it contains only  
57 syllables (12 + 12: 11 + 11: 11) instead of 60. Ppp. reads at end of  
**b** *tāi ’māṁ* (an abbreviation which is here acceptable, as making a  
good *triṣṭubh*—pāda ⌊such was the case at ix. 2. 7 also⌋), and in **e**  
*yac chālāṁ* for *tena ś-*.

title = "२३ इमा आपः"

## Translation
23. I bring forward these waters, free from *yákṣma*, dispellers of  
*yákṣma*; I set forth unto the houses, together with immortal fire.

## Notes
We had this verse above, as iii. 12. 9. Ppp. (which omitted it as part  
of that hymn) reads in **a** *harāmi*, and in **c** *abhi* (for *upa*).

## Translation
3. Lightning his tongue, the Maruts his teeth, the Revatīs his neck, the  
Kṛittikās his shoulders (*skandhā́s*), the hot drink (*gharmá*) his  
withers (*váha*).

## Notes
*Váha* is properly the "carrying" part, that on which the yoke rests.  
The Revatīs and Kṛttikās, two asterisms, in Pisces and Taurus  
respectively; their connection with the parts to which they are assigned  
is, as in nearly all the other cases in this hymn, of the most purely  
imaginary and meaningless kind. Ppp. has only as far as *dantāṣ*,  
following it with *pavamānaṣ prāṇaḥ*. Read in our text *grīvā́ḥ*  
(*visarga*-sign omitted). The *pada*-text has *kṛ́ttikāḥ*, and some of  
the mss., as usual, retain the *ḥ* before the following *sk*. The verse  
has but 23 syllables (unless we analyze *jihu-ā́*).

## Translation
4. Vāyu his all (*víśvam*), the heavenly world his *kṛṣṇadrá*, the  
whirlwind (? *niveṣyà*) his separator (? *vidháraṇī*).

## Notes
The words here in part (and in the last clause the distinction of  
subject and predicate) are wholly obscure. The *pada*-text divides  
*kṛṣṇa॰drám* ('black-runner'?). Many of the mss. (E.O.D.R.T.K.) accent  
*niveṣyáḥ*. Ppp. reads *viśvaṁ vāyuṣ kaṇṭhas svargo lokaṣ kṛṣṇadra  
vyadriṇī vivaśvaḥ;* and then it adds the omitted part of our vs. 3  
except *vahaḥ* at the end.

## Translation
14. The grains of rice, of barley, that are scattered out—those are  
soma-shoots (*aṅśú*).

## Notes
The Anukr. requires *-yante aṅś-* to be read, although the passage is  
quoted under Prāt. i. 69 as an example of the elision of initial *a*  
with the transfer of its nasalization to the eliding *e*. Ppp. reads at  
the end *aṅśava eva te ‘nūpyante*.

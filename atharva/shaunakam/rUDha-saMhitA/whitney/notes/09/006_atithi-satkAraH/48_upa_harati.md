## Translation
48. \[When\] he meets the guests with his eyes, he utters hing;  
\[when\] he greets \[them\], he preludes; \[when\] he offers water, he  
sings the *udgīthá;* \[when\] he presents \[food\], he responds; the  
remnant (*úchiṣṭa*) \[of the food\] is the conclusion: the conclusion of  
etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. seems again to mix in matter from vs. 46, reading *yācaty udakavaty  
aparāhṇa\* prati harati*. ⌊See also note to vs. 23.⌋ The first  
subdivision makes the 30 syllables required by the Anukr. if we give  
syllabic value (*-ti*) to the thrice-occuring verb-ending *-ty;* and  
similarly we get 16 for **b**. \*⌊The phonetic resemblance of  
*udakavati* to *ud gāyati* (cf. note to ii. 13. 3) and of *aparāhṇa* to  
*upa harati* is obviously the occasion for the confusion.⌋

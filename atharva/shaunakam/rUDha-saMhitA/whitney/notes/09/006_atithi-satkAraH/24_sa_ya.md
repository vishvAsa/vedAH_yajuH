## Translation
24. He who, knowing thus, shall partake, not hating, he shall not  
partake the food of one hating, not of one that is doubted, nor of one  
doubting (?).

## Notes
We must emend at the end either to *mī́māṅsamānasya* or to  
*mīmāṅsyámānasya;* the translation assumes the former. Bp.¹ reads  
*vidyā́t* for *vidvā́n*, and it would be a welcome improvement; the same  
reads the first time *aśnīyā́t*, which seems necessary if *vidvā́n* and  
not *vidyā́t* is read, and which is implied in the translation. Ppp. has  
instead *tasmān na dviṣann adyān na dviṣato ‘nnam adyān na mīm-*. The  
two mss. of the Anukr. describe the verse differently but equivalently,  
both requiring 34 syllables (which implies restoration of *‘nnam* to  
*ánnam*).

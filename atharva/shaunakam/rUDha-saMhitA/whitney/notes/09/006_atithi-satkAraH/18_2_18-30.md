## Translation
18. The lord of guests verily makes for himself a sacrificer's  
*brā́hmaṇa* in that he looks at the \[portions\] to be partaken of,  
saying "is this larger, or this?"

## Notes
Several of the mss. (O.R.D.) accent at the end *bhū́yā́s* (D. *bhū́yā́ḥ* 3),  
which is the far preferable reading; *bhū́yās* (read by I.) could be  
borne, since in RV. and AV. the usage does not seem yet established that  
the protracted final syllable is acute, in addition to whatever accent  
the word may have on other syllables ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §78⌋; but *bhūyās*,  
as our edition reads, in accordance with nearly all the mss. compared up  
to the time of its publication, is nothing but a blunder. The protracted  
words are quoted in Prāt. i. 105. The verse counts naturally 18 + 8 + 8  
= 34 syllables (the second and third pādas being really metrical). ⌊Scan  
rather 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 with the Anukr.⌋ Ppp. reads *kṛṇute* and  
*avekṣata*.

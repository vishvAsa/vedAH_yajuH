## Translation
30. \[The fire\] that is the guests', that is the fire of libations  
(*āhavanī́ya*); the one in the dwelling (*véśman*), that is the  
householder's fire (*gā́rhapatya*); the one in which they cook, that is  
the southern fire (*dakṣiṇāgní*).

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sā ”havanīyo yo ‘nnakaraṇasya* ⌊intending *-karaṇas sa?*⌋  
*dakṣiṇāgnir yo veś- sa gār-*. The metrical definition of the Anukr.  
requires us to restore at the beginning *yó átith-*.

## Translation
13. I ask of thee the extreme (*pára*) end of the earth; I ask the seed  
of the male (*vṛ́ṣan*) horse; I ask the navel of all existence; I ask the  
highest (*paramá*) firmament (*vyòman*) of speech.

## Notes
RV. ⌊vs. 34⌋ exchanges the place of **b** and **c**, and rectifies the  
meter by inserting another *tvā* before *vṛ́ṣṇo*, and reading *pṛchā́mi  
yátra bhúvanasya nā́bhiḥ*. Ppp. follows RV. in the former case, but in  
the latter has *pṛchāmi tvāṁ bh. n.;* it makes ⌊as between **b** and  
**c**⌋ the same inversion of order as RV.; and it begins **d** with  
*vācaṣ pṛchāmi*. The Anukr. takes no notice of the irregularity of our  
meter. The verse, with the following one, is found also in other texts:  
VS. xxiii. 61, 62; TS. vii. 4. 18²; LśS. ix. 10. 13, 14. VS. reads in  
both verses precisely as RV., and LśS. differs from it only by having  
*pṛchāmas* instead of *-mi* four times in vs. 13. TS. has for 13 **b**  
*pṛchā́mi tvā bhúvanasya nā́bhim*. The two verses are quoted in Vāit. 37.  
3.

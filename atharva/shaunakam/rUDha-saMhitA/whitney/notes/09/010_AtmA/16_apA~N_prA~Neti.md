## Translation
16. Offward, forward goes, seized by *svadhā́*, the immortal one, of  
like source with the mortal; the two, constantly going separate  
apart—the one they noted, the other they noted not.

## Notes
Haug and Hillebrandt (*Ved. Mythol.*, i. 336, note) both understand  
*svadhā́* here as meaning the offering to the manes, but their  
conjectural interpretations of the verse are totally discordant. ⌊The  
vs. is RV. vs. 38 without variant. See the interpretations of Roth and  
of Böhtlingk as cited under vs. 8 above.—The Kaṭha variant (WZKM. xii.  
282) is *áprān̄* for *ápān̄*.—The vs. is found at AA. ii. 1. 8.⌋

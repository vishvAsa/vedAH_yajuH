## Translation
5. Lowing, mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her mind,  
hath she come unto \[it\]; let this inviolable one yield milk for the  
Aśvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.

## Notes
This verse, again, is vii. 73. 8, above, excepting that the latter reads  
*nyā́gan* at end of **b**. Our *pada*-text has here *abhi॰ā́gāt*, while  
that of RV. ⌊vs. 27⌋ gives *abhí: ā́: agāt;* both yield the same  
*saṁhitā*-reading.

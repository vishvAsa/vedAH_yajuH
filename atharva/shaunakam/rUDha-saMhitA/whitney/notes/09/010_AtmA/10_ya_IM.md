## Translation
10. He who made him knows not of him; \[he is\] verily out of sight now  
of him who saw him; he, enveloped within his mother's womb, with his  
much progeny, entered into perdition (*nírṛti*).

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The translation follows the RV. reading, *nírṛtim*, in **d**, since the  
nom. *-tis* seems unconstruable. Both RV. ⌊vs. 32⌋ and Ppp. put the  
verse after our vs. 11, and the latter reads *so ‘sya* in **a**. Haug  
interprets the lightning to be intended.

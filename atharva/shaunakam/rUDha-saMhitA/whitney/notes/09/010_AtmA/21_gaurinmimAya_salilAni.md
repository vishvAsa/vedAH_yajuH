## Translation
21. The cow verily lowed, fashioning the seas; one-footed, two-footed  
\[is\] she, four-footed; having become eight-footed, nine-footed,  
thousand-syllabled, a series (*pan̄tí*) of existence; out from her flow  
apart the oceans.

## Notes
The five pādas are vs. 41, and 42 **a**, of the RV. hymn; which,  
however, reads *gāurī́s* for *gāúr íd* in **a**, and *paramé vyòman* for  
*bhúvanasya pan̄tíḥ* in **d**. The RV. vs. 41 occurs also in TB. ii. 4.  
6¹¹ ⌊and it is there followed by the RV. vs. 42 entire⌋ and TA. i. 9. 4,  
with the RV. readings, excepting *gāurī́* at the beginning ⌊and *tásyām*  
in TB. for *tásyās*⌋. Our pādas **b-e**, again, are repeated as xiii. 1.  
42 below. The verse (12 + 12: 12 + 11 + 11 = 58) lacks two syllables of  
being a proper *atiśakvarī* (60 syllables).

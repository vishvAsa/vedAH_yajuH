## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xvi. (in the verse-order 1-3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 10-13, 15, 14, 16-22, 24, 23). Not noticed in Vāit., and not in Kāuś. in a way to cast any light whatever upon it; the hymn is quoted in Kāuś. 24. 19 (with vi. 111) in the ceremony of turning a bull loose, and vs. 24 separately in the same ceremony in Kāuś. 24. 21; also vs. 1 in 66. 18 in connection with a bull; the hymn is reckoned (see note to Kāuś. 19. 1) among the puṣṭika mantras.

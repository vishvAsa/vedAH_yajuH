## Translation
11. Kāma hath slain (*vadh*) them that are my rivals; he hath made for  
me wide space, prosperity; let the four directions bow to me; let the  
six wide ones ⌊fem.⌋ bring ghee to me.

## Notes
The third pāda was found above as v. 3. 1 **c**. It is unusual for the  
Anukr. to note as *bhurij* a *triṣṭubh* containing a *jagatī-*pāda. ⌊Cf.  
Bergaigne, *Rel. Véd.* ii. 122.⌋

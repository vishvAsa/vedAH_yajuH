## Translation
13. Agni \[is\] a repeller (? *yava*), Indra a repeller, Soma a  
repeller; let the repelling (? *yavayā́van*) gods repel (*yu*) him.

## Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ This translation is altogether questionable. Perhaps the verse  
accompanies a ceremony in which barley (*yáva*) is used, a play on words  
being intended between *yáva* 'barley' and the root *yu* 'repel';  
*yavayā́van* would then be 'going in barley.' Ppp. has for second half  
*yavayanty amum amuṣyāyaṇam amuṣyāṣ putraṁ jīvalokaṁ mṛtalokaṁ katā  
’mum*. It is strange that the Anukr. does not note the paragraph as  
*dvyavasānā*.

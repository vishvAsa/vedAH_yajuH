## Translation
5. That daughter of thine, O Kāma, is called a milch-cow, what utterance  
(*vā́c*) the poets name *virā́j;* with that do thou avoid them that are my  
rivals; let breath, cattle, life avoid them.

## Notes
Or **a** might be 'that milch-cow is called thy daughter.' O. reads  
*páry eṇān* in **d**; but the passage is quoted under Prāt. iii. 80 as  
one in which the lingualization of *n* does not take place.

## Comment
⌊Partly prose—"vs." 13.⌋ Found also (except vs. 4) in Pāipp. xvi. ⌊with vs. 16 before 12 and vs. 24 before 20⌋. The hymn (vs. 1) is prescribed in Vāit. 24. 10 to be recited, with homage to Kāma, in a part of the Agniṣṭoma ceremony; and in Kāuç. 49. 1 it (vs. 1) accompanies the release of a bull in a witchcraft ceremony.

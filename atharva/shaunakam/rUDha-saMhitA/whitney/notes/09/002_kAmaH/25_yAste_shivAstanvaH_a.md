## Translation
25. What propitious excellent bodies thou hast, O Kāma, with which what  
thou choosest becometh real, with them do thou enter wholly into us;  
make evil devices (*dhī́*) enter away elsewhere.

## Notes
The combination *tā́bhiṣ ṭvám* is an example under Prāt. ii. 84, and is  
quoted in the commentary there. Ppp. reads *vṛṇīte* at end of **b**,  
*upa-* for *abhi-* in **c**, and *upa* for *apa* in **d**. The Anukr.  
pays no heed to the extra syllable in **d**. The verse is quoted in  
Kāuś. 24. 29 in the *āgrahāyaṇī* ceremony, to accompany the act of lying  
down (apparently merely on account of the occurrence of -*saṁ-viś* in  
**c**).  
  
⌊The quoted Anukr. here says *kāmasūktaḥ*.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the first *anuvāka*, with 2 hymns and 49 verses.⌋

## Translation
13. They that break apart the crown, rushers against the head  
(*mūrdhán*)—not injuring, free from disease, let them run out, out at  
the orifice.

## Notes
The 'they' in this and the following verses (13-18) is fem. The Pet.  
Lexx. take *arṣaṇī́* in **b** as an independent noun (it is found only  
here), and conjecture it to mean 'pricking pains.'

## Translation
2. Seven harness (*yuj*) a one-wheeled chariot; one horse, having seven  
names, draws (*vah*) \[it\]; of three naves \[is\] the wheel, unwasting,  
unassailed, whereon stand all these existences.

## Notes
Doubtless the sun. The verse is repeated as xiii. 3. 18. It occurs also  
in TA. iii. 11. 8, with *anarvāṁ yene ’mā v. bhuvanāni t.* in **c, d**  
(the accent of the verse is too corrupt to heed).

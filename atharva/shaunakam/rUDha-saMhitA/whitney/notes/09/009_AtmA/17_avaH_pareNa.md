## Translation
17. Below the distant (*pára*), thus beyond the lower, bearing (*bhṛ*)  
her calf with her foot, the cow hath stood up; whitherwards, to what  
quarter (*árdha*) hath she forsooth gone away? where giveth she birth?  
for \[it is\] not in this herd.

## Notes
The Anukr. takes no notice of the redundant syllable in **a**; we may  
suppose *pará enā́-* to be combined to *parāí ’nā́-*. ⌊The verse is  
repeated below as xiii. 1. 41. RV. ends with *antáḥ* for *asmín*. The  
Kaṭha variant *párākāt* for *párāgāt* (WZKM. xii. 282) shows an exchange  
of surd and sonant, the reverse of that noted at ii. 13. 3.⌋

## Translation
5. Let him who truly knows ⌊here⌋ tell (*brū*) the set-down track of  
this pleasant bird; the kine extract (*duh*) milk from his head;  
clothing themselves in a wrap, they have drunk water with the foot.

## Notes
Explained as relating to the clouds and the sun. The verse is vs. 7 in  
RV., and also in Ppp.; the latter reads *śīrṣṇā* in **c**.

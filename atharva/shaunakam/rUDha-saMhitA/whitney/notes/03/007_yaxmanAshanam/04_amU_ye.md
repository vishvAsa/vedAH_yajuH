## Translation
4. The two blessed stars named Unfasteners (*vicṛ́t*), that are yonder in  
the sky—let them unfasten of the *kṣetriyá* the lowest, the highest  
fetter.

## Notes
The verse is nearly identical with ii. 8. 1 above, which see ⌊**b**  
recurs at vi. 121. 3 **b**; v. Schroeder gives the Kaṭha version of **a,  
b**, *Zwei hss.*, p. 15, and *Tübinger Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 75⌋. Ppp. makes  
it in part yet more nearly so, by beginning with *ud agātām bhagavatī*,  
but reads in **c** *vi kṣetriyaṁ tvā ’bhy ānaśe* ⌊cf. our 6 **b**⌋; and  
its end and part of vs. 6 (which next follows) are defaced.

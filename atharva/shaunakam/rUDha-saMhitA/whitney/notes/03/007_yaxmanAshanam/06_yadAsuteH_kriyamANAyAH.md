## Translation
6. If from the drink (? *āsutí*) that was being made the *kṣetriyá* hath  
come upon (*vi-aś*) thee, I know the remedy of it; I make the *kṣetriyá*  
disappear from thee.

## Notes
The word *āsutí* is of doubtful and disputed sense; Weber says "infusio  
seminis" ⌊as immediate cause of the "Erb-übel," which is Weber's version  
of *kṣetriyá*⌋; Grill, "gekochter Zaubertrank"; the comm., *dravībhūtam  
annam* 'liquidized food.'

## Translation
1. On the head of the swift-running gazelle (*hariṇá*) is a remedy; he  
by his horn hath made the *kṣetriyá* disappear, dispersing.

## Notes
*Viṣā́ṇā* is divided (*vi॰sā́nā*) in the *pada*-text, as if from *vi* +  
*sā* 'unfasten'—which is, indeed, in all probability its true  
derivation, as designating primarily a deciduous horn, one that is  
dropped off or shed; and in this peculiarity, as distinguished from the  
permanent horns of the domestic animals, perhaps lies the reason of its  
application to magical remedial uses. The verse occurs also in ĀpśS.  
xiii. 7. 16 ⌊where most mss. have *raghuṣyato*⌋. For the *kṣetriya*, see  
above, ii. 8.  
  
⌊☞ See p. 1045.⌋

## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii., with few variants, but with vs. 5 at the end. Used by Kāuś. (27. 29) in a healing ceremony (its text does not specify the disease); and reckoned (26. 1, note) to the takmanāśana gaṇa. And the comm. quotes it as employed by the Nakṣ. ⌊śānti?⌋ K. (17, 19) in the mahāśānti called kāumāri.

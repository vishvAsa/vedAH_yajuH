## Translation
3. With what splendor the elephant came into being, with what the king  
among men (*manuṣyà*), among waters, with what the gods in the beginning  
went to godhood—with that splendor do thou, O Agni, now make me  
splendid.

## Notes
*Apsú*, in **b**, is an impertinent intrusion as regards both sense and  
meter; it is wanting in Ppp. In **c** all the mss. give *āyam* (*saṁh.,  
āyaṁ*); our edition makes the necessary emendation to *ā́yan*, and so  
does SPP. in his *pada*-text; but in *saṁhitā* (perhaps by an oversight)  
he reads *āyan*, unaccented; the comm. has *āyan* (accent doubtful): cf.  
iv. 14. 1 **c**, where the mss. again read *āyam* for *āyan* in the same  
phrase. Ppp. has a very different second half-verse: *yena devā jyotiṣā  
āyām udāyan tena mā ’gne varcasā saṁ sṛje ’ha*. The comm. makes *apsu*  
in **b** mean either "\[creatures\] in the waters," or else "\[Yakshas,  
Gandharvas, etc.\] in the atmosphere." The metrical definition of the  
Anukr. is mechanically correct ⌊52-2 = 50⌋ if we count 13 syllables in  
**b** ⌊and combine *varcasāgne*⌋!

## Translation
1. Let elephant-splendor, great glory, spread itself, which came into  
being from Aditi's body; that same have all together given to me—all the  
gods, Aditi, in unison.

## Notes
⌊Cf. vii. 17. 3 n.⌋  
  
A number of the mss. (including our Bp.Op.) read *ā́dityās* ⌊accent!⌋ in  
**b**, and several of ours follow it with *yám* instead of *yát*. Ppp.  
rectifies the meter of **d** by reading *devāsas*. Emendation in **a**  
to *bṛhádyaśas* would be acceptable. śB. (iii. 1. 3. 4; perhaps on the  
basis of **b**?) has a legend of the production of the elephant from  
something born of Aditi (see R. in *Ind. Stud.* xiv. 392). The comm.  
explains *prathatām* in **a** by *asmāsu prathitam prakhyātam bhavatu*  
'be proclaimed as belonging to us.' In our edition, an accent-mark has  
dropped out from under the *ba* of *-babhūva*. An irregular verse,  
scanned by the Anukr. as 12 + 10: 10 + 10 = 42, but convertible into 45  
syllables by resolving *tanú-as, sáru-e, víśu-e* (of which only the  
first is unobjectionable). ⌊If we read *devāsas* in **d**, the vs. is in  
order (12 + 11:? + 11), except in **c** (*tád ít sárve?*).⌋

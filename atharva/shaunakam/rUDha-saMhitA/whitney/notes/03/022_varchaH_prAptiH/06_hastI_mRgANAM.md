## Translation
6. Since the elephant has become the superior (*atiṣṭhā́vant*) of the  
comfortable (? *suṣád*) wild beasts, with his fortune \[and\] splendor  
do I pour (*sic*) upon myself.

## Notes
That is, 'I shed it upon me, cover myself with it.' The comm.  
understands the somewhat questionable *suṣád* nearly as here translated,  
"living at their pleasure in the forest"; and *atiṣṭhāvant* as  
possessing superiority either of strength or of position.  
  
Weber entitles the hymn, without good reason, "taming of a wild  
elephant."

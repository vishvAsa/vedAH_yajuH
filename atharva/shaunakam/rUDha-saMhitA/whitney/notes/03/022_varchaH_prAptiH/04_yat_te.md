## Translation
4. What great splendor becomes thine, O Jātavedas, from the offering;  
how great splendor there is of the sun, and of the *ásura*-like  
elephant—so great splendor let the (two) Aśvins, lotus-wreathed, assign  
unto me.

## Notes
All the mss. read in **b** *bhavati*, and SPP. accordingly adopts it in  
his edition; ours makes the necessary correction to *bhávati*. The comm.  
reads *āhute*, vocative, at end of **b**; Ppp. has instead *āhutam;* and  
then adds to it, as second half-verse, our 3 **d, e** (with *abhya* for  
*adyá*, and *kṛdhi* for *kṛṇu*), putting also the whole ⌊i.e. our 4 **a,  
b** + 3 **d, e**⌋ before our vs. 3; and then it gives the remainder  
(**c-f**) of our vs. 4 here, with *kṛṇutām* for *ā́ dhattām*, and in  
**c** *yavad varcaḥ sūr-*.

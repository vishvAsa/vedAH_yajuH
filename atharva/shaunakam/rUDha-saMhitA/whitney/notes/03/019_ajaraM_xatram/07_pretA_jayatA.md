## Translation
7. Go forth, conquer, O men; formidable be your arms (*bāhú*); having  
sharp arrows, slay them of weak bows; having formidable weapons, having  
formidable arms (*bāhú*), \[slay\] the weak ones.

## Notes
The first half-verse is RV. x. 103. 13 **a, c** (found also in SV. ii.  
1212; VS. xvii. 46), without variation; TS. (iv. 6. 4⁴) has the same two  
pādas together, but reads *úpa pré ’ta jáyatā nara sthirā́ vaḥ* etc. Ppp.  
has the first half-verse (with *pra yatā* and *vas*), adding as second  
half *indro vaś śarma yacchaty anādhṛṣyā yathā ’satā*. The verse is not  
*virāj* ⌊7 + 8; 11 + 12⌋, if the obviously proper resolutions are made.

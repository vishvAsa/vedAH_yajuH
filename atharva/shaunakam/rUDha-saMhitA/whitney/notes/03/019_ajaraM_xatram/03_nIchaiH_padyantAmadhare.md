## Translation
3. Downward let them fall, let them become inferior, who shall fight  
against (*pṛtany-*) our bounteous patron (*sūrí*); I destroy the enemies  
by my incantation; I lead up our own men.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *adhas pad-* at the beginning, and *indram* for *sūrim* in  
**b**. The second half-verse is found in VS. (xi. 82 **c, d**), TS.  
(iv. 1.10³), and MS. (ii. 7. 7), with the various readings *kṣiṇómi* and  
*svā́ṅ;* the comm. also gives *kṣiṇomi*. The comm. renders *sūrím* by  
*kāryākāryavibhāgajñam*. The Anukr. should call the verse *virāṭ  
prastārapan̄kti*, since it properly scans as 11 + 11: 8 + 8 = 38.

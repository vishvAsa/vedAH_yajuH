## Translation
8. Being let loose, fly thou away, O volley, thou that art sharpened up  
by incantation; conquer the enemies; go forth; slay of them each best  
one; let no one soever of them yonder be released.

## Notes
Pādas **a-c** and **e** are RV. vi. 75. 16, a verse found also in a  
number of other texts: SV. ii. 1213; VS. xvii. 45; TS. iv. 6. 4⁴; TB.  
iii. 7. 6²³; ĀpśS. iii. 14. 3. RV.SV.VS. agree throughout, having  
*gácha* for *jáya* at beginning of **c**, and, for **d**, *mā́ ’mī́ṣāṁ káṁ  
canó ’c chiṣaḥ;* the others have this **d**, except that they put *eṣām*  
in place of *amī́ṣām;* they also give *viśa* for *padyasva* at end of  
**c**, and TS. has the nom. *-śitā*, which is better, at end of **b**,  
while TB. and ĀpśS. alter to *ávasṛṭaḥ párā pata śaró* (for *śáro?*)  
*bráhmasaṁśitaḥ*. Our **d** is found again as xi. 10. 21 **b**; our  
**e**, as viii. 8. 19 **d**; xi. 9. 20 **d**; 10. 19 **d**. The presence  
of *-saṁśite* in this verse gives it a kind of right to stand as part of  
the hymn, of which *sam-śā* is the unifying word; vss. 6 and 7 are  
probably later additions. In Ppp., vss. 6-8, with RV. x. 103. 10, form a  
piece by themselves; vs. 8 ends with *pra padyasva sā māiṣāṁ kaṁ cano ’c  
chiṣaḥ* (nearly as RV.). Correct the accent-mark in **d** so as to read  
*váraṁ-varam*.

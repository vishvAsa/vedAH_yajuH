## Translation
6. Let their energies (*vā́jina*) be excited, O bounteous one  
(*maghávan*); let the noise of the conquering heroes arise; let the  
noises, the clear (*ketumánt*) halloos, go up severally; let the divine  
Maruts, with Indra as their chief, go with the army.

## Notes
With the first two pādas compare RV. x. 103. 10 **a, d**: *úd dharṣaya  
maghavann ā́yudhāni...úd ráthānāṁ jáyatṁ yantu ghóṣāḥ.* Some of our mss.  
(P.M.W.O.Op.Kp.), as of SPP's, read in **c** *ulūláyas*, but both  
editions give *-lul-;* the comm. has *ullulayas*, and declares it an  
imitative word. The omission either of *ululáyas* or of *ketumántas*  
would make a *jagatī* pāda of **c**, and that of *devā́s* would do the  
same for **d**; as the verse stands, the Anukr. scans it 11 + 11: 8 + 8:  
6 + 8 = 52. Part of our mss. (I.O.Op.) agree with the comm. in ending  
this verse with *úd īratām*, and throwing the two remaining pādas into  
vs. 7, to the great detriment of the sense, as well as against the  
probable earlier form of the verse. Ppp. reads: *uddharṣantāṁ vājināṁ  
vājinābhy ad vāirāṇāṁ jayatām etu ghoṣāḥ: pṛthag ghoṣā ulalayaṣ  
ketumantu udīratām;* with **e** and **f** as in our text.

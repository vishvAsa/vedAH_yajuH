## Comment
The verses are found in Pāipp. iii. (in the verse-order 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8). The hymn is applied by Kāuç. (14. 22-24) in a rite for gaining victory over a hostile army, and reckoned (14. 7, note) to the aparājita gaṇa. The Vāit. uses vs. 1 in the agnicayana (28. 15) in connection with lifting the ukhya fire, and vss. 6-8 in a sattra sacrifice (34. 16, 17), with mounting a chariot and discharging an arrow.

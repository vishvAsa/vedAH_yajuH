## Translation
6. Yonder army of our adversaries, O Maruts, that comes contending  
against us with force—pierce ye it with baffling darkness, that one of  
them may not know another.

## Notes
The verse is an addition (as vs. 14) to RV. x. 103 ⌊Aufrecht, 2d ed'n,  
vol. ii. p. 682⌋, but forms a proper part of SV. (ii. 1210) and VS.  
(xvii. 47). RV. VS. read in **b** *abhyāíti nas* (for *asmā́n āíty  
abhí*); SV. has *abhyéti;* all have in **c** *gūhata* for *vidhyata;*  
and with the latter Ppp. intends to agree, but has *guhata.* For *eṣām*  
in **d**, RV. gives *amī́ṣām*, SV. *etéṣām*, and VS. *amī́* and  
accordingly at the end *jānán.* It takes violence to compress our **b**  
into a *triṣṭubh* pāda.

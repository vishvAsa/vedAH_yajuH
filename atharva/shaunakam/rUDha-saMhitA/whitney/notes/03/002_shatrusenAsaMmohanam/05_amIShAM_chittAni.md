## Translation
5. Confounding the intents of those yonder, seizing their limbs, O Apvā,  
go away; go forth against \[them\]; consume \[them\] in their hearts  
with pangs (*śóka*); pierce the enemies with seizure (*grā́hi*), the foes  
with darkness.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 103. 12, which reads in **a** *cittám  
pratilobháyantī*, and, for **d**, *andhéna ’mítrās támasā sacantām;* and  
SV. (ii. 1211) and VS. (xvii. 44) agree with RV. Both *pada*-texts give  
in **b** *gṛhāṇá*, as impv.; but the word is translated above (in  
accordance with Grassmann's suggestion) as aor. pple. fem. *gṛhāṇā́*,  
because this combines so much better with the following *páre ’hi.* A  
number of the *saṁhitā*-mss. (including our P.s.m.E.s.m.I.H.p.m.) make  
the curious blunder of accenting *apvè* in **b**: the comm. explains it  
as a *pāpadevatā*, adding the precious etymology *apavāyayati  
apagamayati sukham prāṇāṅś ca.* ⌊Weber, ix. 482, thinks *apvā* has  
reference to impurity (root *pū*) and to diarrœha as caused by fear. To  
Weber's citation (xvii. 184) from the Purāṇa, add the line near the  
beginning of the Bhīṣma book, MBh. vi. i. 18, *śrutvā tu ninadaṁ yodhāḥ  
śakṛn-mūtram prasusruvuḥ.*⌋ The Anukr. ignores the redundancy in **a**;  
emendation to *cittā́* would remove it.

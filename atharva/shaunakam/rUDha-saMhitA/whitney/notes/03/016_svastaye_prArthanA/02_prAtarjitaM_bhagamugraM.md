## Translation
2. The early-conquering formidable Bhaga do we call, the son of Aditi  
who is disposer (*vidhartár*), to whom every one that thinks himself  
weak \[or\] strong, ⌊to whom even the king⌋ says: "apportion \[me\] a  
portion."

## Notes
*Bhakṣi* in **d** might also be 1st sing. mid. of the *s*-aorist, 'may I  
obtain' (so Weber, etc.); the comm. explains it both ways. Again all the  
other texts, including Ppp., have *huvema* for *havāmahe* in **a**; the  
Anukr. ignores the metrical irregularity caused by our reading. ⌊Note  
the play on the god's name: 'portion' is *bhága*.⌋

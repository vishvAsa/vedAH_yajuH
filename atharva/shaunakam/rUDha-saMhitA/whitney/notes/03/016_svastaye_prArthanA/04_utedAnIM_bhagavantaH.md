## Translation
4. Both now may we be fortunate (*bhágavant*), and in the advance (?  
*prapitvá*) and in the middle of the days; and, O bounteous one, at the  
up-going of the sun, may we be in the favor of the gods.

## Notes
As to the difficult word *prapitvá*, see Bloomfield, JAOS. xvi. 24 ff.;  
"up-going" is probably here 'out-going, disappearance'; the comm.  
renders *prapitvé* by *sāyāhne;* his understanding of *úditāu* is lost  
out of the manuscript. The other texts read *úditā.* ⌊For this vs., see  
especially p. 35 end, 36 top, of Bl's paper.⌋

title = "०३ भग प्रणेतर्भग"

## Translation
3. O Bhaga, conductor, Bhaga, thou of true bestowal, Bhaga, help upward  
this prayer (*dhī́*), giving to us; O Bhaga, cause us to multiply with  
kine, with horses, O Bhaga, with men,—rich in men may we be.

## Notes
In this verse AV. and RV. agree throughout; TB. reads *ava* with  
unlengthened final in **b**, and VS. no with unlingualized nasal in  
**c**.

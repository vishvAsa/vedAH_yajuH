## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv., with very few variants. It is a RV. hymn (vii. 41), repeated also in VS. (xxxiv. 34-40) and TB. (ii. 8. 979) ⌊and MP. i. 14. 1-7, in the same order as here⌋. It is used by Kāuś. ⌊with hymns vi. 69 and ix. 1⌋, in the rite for generation of wisdom (10. 24), to accompany washing the face on arising from sleep; also in certain ceremonies for "splendor" (varcas: 12. 15; 13. 6), with hymns vi. 69 and ix. 1; and it is reckoned to the varcasya gaṇas (12. 10, note; 13. 1, note). In Vāit. (5. 17), vs. 6 accompanies, in the agnyādheya, the horse's setting his foot on the boundary; and its latter half, an oblation in the cāturmasya sacrifice ⌊Vāit. 8. 14⌋.

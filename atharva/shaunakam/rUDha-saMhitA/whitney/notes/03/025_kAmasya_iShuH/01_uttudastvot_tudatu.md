title = "०१ उत्तुदस्त्वोत् तुदतु"

## Translation
1. Let the up-thruster thrust (*tud*) thee up; do not abide (*dhṛ*) in  
thine own lair; the arrow of love (*kā́ma*) that is terrible, therewith I  
pierce thee in the heart.

## Notes
Pāda **a** evidently suggests the finger-thrust of Kāuś.; what *uttudá*  
really designates is matter for guessing, and the translators guess  
differently; the comm. says "a god so named." The comm. has the bad  
reading *dṛthās* in **b**.

## Translation
6. Do ye, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, cast out the intents from her heart; then,  
making her powerless, make her \[to be\] in my own control.

## Notes
P.M.W. begin **c** with *yáthā*. *Asyāi* in **a** is doubtless to be  
understood as a genitive (cf. iv. 5. 6), though the comm. says "a dative  
in genitive sense." ⌊Cf. Lanman, JAOS. X. 359, end.⌋  
  
The fifth *anuvāka* has 5 hymns and 35 verses. The quoted Anukr. says  
*pañca ca rcaḥ*.

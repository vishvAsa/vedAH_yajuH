title = "4. To establish a king."

+++
## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii. Used in Kāuç. only with the next preceding hymn (as there explained), although the two are of essentially different application, this one referring to a king who has been called or chosen, and has to be inaugurated as such. In Vāit. (13. 2), in the agniṣṭoma sacrifice, vs. 7 accompanies, with vii. 28, oblations to pathyā svasti and other divinities.

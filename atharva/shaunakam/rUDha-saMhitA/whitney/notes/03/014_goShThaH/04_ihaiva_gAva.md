## Translation
4. Come ye just here, O kine, and flourish here like *śákā;* also  
multiply (*pra-jā*) just here; let your complaisance be toward me.

## Notes
*śáke ’va* (p. *śákā॰iva*) in **b** is very obscure: Weber renders "like  
dung" (as if *śákā* = *ćákṛt*); Ludwig, "with the dung" (as if *śákā* =  
*śáknā́*); Grill, "like plants" (implying *śākam iva* or *śākā iva*) the  
comm. says "multiply innumerably, like flies" (*śakā* = *makṣikā*); this  
last is, so far as can be seen, the purest guesswork, nor is anything  
brought up in its support; and the "dung" comparisons are as unsuitable  
as they are unsavory. The explanation of the comm. accords with one  
among those offered by the commentators on VS. xxiv. 32 (= MS. iii. 14.  
13) and TS. v. 5. 18¹, where *śákā* also occurs. Ppp. reads *ṣakā iva.*  
SPP. reports his *pada*-mss. as accenting *gā́vaḥ* in **a**, but emends  
in his *pada*-text to *gāvaḥ;* the latter is read by all ours, so far as  
noted.

title = "14. A blessing on the kine."

## Comment
The hymn (except vs. 5) is found in Pāipp. ii. (in the verse-order 2, 4, 6, 1, 3). It is used by Kāuç., with other hymns (ii. 26 etc.), in a ceremony for the prosperity of cattle (19. 14). In Vāit. (21. 26), vs. 2 accompanies the driving of kine in the agnișțoma. The Vāit. use does not appear to be mentioned by the comm., and his report of the Kāuç. use is mostly lost from the manuscript (but filled in by the editor).

## Translation
5. Let your stall be propitious; flourish ye like *śāriśā́kā;* also  
multiply just here; with me we unite you.

## Notes
There is no Ppp. text of this verse to help cast light on the obscure  
and difficult *śāriśākā* (p. *śāriśā́kā॰iva*). The comm. (implying  
*-kās*) explains the word as meaning "kinds of creatures that increase  
by thousands in a moment," but offers no etymology or other support; the  
translators supply a variety of ingenious and unsatisfactory conjectures  
(Weber, "like *śāri*-dung," *śāri* perhaps a kind of bird; Grill  
"\[fatten yourselves\] like the *śārikā*" or hooded crow; Ludwig simply  
puts a question-mark in place of a translation). R. offers the  
conjecture *śāriḥ* (= *śāliḥ*) *śaka iva* 'like rice in manure.' Our P.  
M.E.I, accent *śā́riśā́ke ’va*.  
  
⌊BIoomfield emends to *śāri-śukeva* (= *-kās iva*), 'thrive ye like  
starlings and parrots.' True, these birds are habitual companions in  
literature as in life (see my translation of *Karpūra-mañjarī*, p. 229,  
note), loquacity being their salient characteristic; but what is the  
*tertium comparationis* between the thriving of cows and of starlings?⌋

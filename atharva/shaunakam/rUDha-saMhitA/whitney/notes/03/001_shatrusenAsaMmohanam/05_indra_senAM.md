title = "०५ इन्द्र सेनां"

## Translation
5. O Indra, confound the army of our enemies; with the blast of fire, of  
wind, make them disappear, scattering.

## Notes
The defective first half-verse is completed by Ppp. in this form:  
*manomohanaṁ kṛṇva* (i.e. *kṛṇavas?*) *indrā ’mitrebhyas tvam.* The  
second half-verse is also 2. 3 **c, d**. The comm. explains *dhrājyā* by  
*dahanaviṣaye yā vegitā gatis tathāvidhayā vegagatyā tayor eva vā  
gatyā.*

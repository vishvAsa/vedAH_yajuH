## Comment
⌊A prose hymn.⌋ Found (except vs. 3, apparently omitted by accident) in Pāipp. iii., after h. 26, but at some distance from it. Compare xii. 3. 55-60, where the quarters are rehearsed with the same adjuncts. Compare further TS. v. 5. 101, 2 (a passage immediately preceding that parallel with our h. 26; a bit of brāhmaṇa between the two explains that these divinities are to protect the fire-altar when constructed); and MS. ii. 13. 21: both these omit all mention of arrows. A yet fainter parallelism is to be noted with TB. iii. 11. 5. For the concluding imprecation, compare also VS. xv. 15. For the use in Kāuç. with h. 26, see under that hymn. ⌊For the general significance of the hymn, see my addition to the introduction to h. 26.⌋

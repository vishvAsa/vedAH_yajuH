## Translation
4. As a fountain of a hundred streams, of a thousand streams,  
unexhausted, so this grain of ours, in a thousand streams, unexhausted.

## Notes
The metrical deficiency in **a** calls for a change of reading, and the  
usual correlation of *evá* in **c** suggests *yáthā*; and, as Ppp. reads  
*yathā*, the translation ventures to adopt it, as *út* instead is hardly  
better than unmanageable. Weber supplies *aca;* Ludwig, "I open, as it  
were"; the comm. says that *ut* means *udbhavati*, and does not trouble  
himself about its construction with an accusative; we may take the verse  
as a virtual continuation of vs. 3, and the nouns as governed by  
*samāvahān*. Ppp. makes the verse easy by reading *yathā rūpaś  
śatadhāras sahasradhāro akṣataḥ; eva me astu dhānyaṁ sahasradhāram  
akṣatam*.

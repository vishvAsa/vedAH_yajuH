## Translation
6. Three measures of the Gandharvas, four of the house-mistress; of them  
whichever is richest in fatness, with that one we touch thee.

## Notes
Ppp. reads at the end *marṣāmasi;* the comm. regards the grain as the  
object of address in **d**, and the intent to be "increase thou by the  
act of touching"; Weber understands rather the master of the house, or  
perhaps the harvest-wagon. The "measures" are doubtless those of grain  
set apart; the comm. calls them *samṛddhihetavaḥ kalāḥ;* and he gives as  
alternative explanation of "house-mistress" the Apsarases, spouses of  
the Gandharvas!

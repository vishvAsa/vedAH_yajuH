## Comment
Found (except vs. 7) in Pāipp. v. Used by Kāuś. (21. 1 ff.) in rites for the prosperity of grain-crops, and reckoned (19. I, note) to the puṣṭika mantras. The comm. declares it employed also in the pitṛmedha ceremony (82. 9), but doubtless by an error, the verse there quoted being xviii. 3. 56 (which has the same pratīka).

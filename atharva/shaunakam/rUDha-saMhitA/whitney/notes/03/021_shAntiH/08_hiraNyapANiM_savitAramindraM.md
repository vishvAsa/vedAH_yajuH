## Translation
8. Gold-handed Savitar, Indra, Brihaspati, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, all the  
gods, the Angirases, do we call; let them appease (*śam*) this  
flesh-eating fire.

## Notes
Ppp. inverts the order of **a** and **b**. ⌊MGS. has the vs. at ii. i.  
6.⌋ The comm. gives a double explanation of "gold-handed": either  
"having gold in his hand to give to his praisers," or "having a hand of  
gold"; he also allows us to take *án̄girasas* either as accusative or as  
nominative, "we the Angirases." The Anukr. notes that **c** is *jagatī*.

## Translation
5. Thou on whom as priest (*hótar*) agreed with their mind the thirteen  
kinds of beings (*bhāuvaná*), the five races of men (*mānavá*): to the  
splendor-bestowing, glorious one, rich in pleasantness—to those fires be  
this oblation made.

## Notes
The unusual and obscure number "thirteen" here seduces the comm. into  
declaring first that *bhāuvaná* signifies "-month," coming from  
*bhuvana* "year"; and then the *mānavā́s* are the seasons! But he further  
makes the latter to be the four castes, with the *niṣādas* as fifth, and  
the former the thirteen sons, Viśvakarman etc., of a great sage named  
*bhuvana* (because of *viśvakarvman bhāuvana* in AB. viii. 21. 8-11).  
Ppp. reads *bhuvanā* for *bhāuvanā́s*. The Anukr. does not heed that the  
last pāda is *triṣṭubh*.

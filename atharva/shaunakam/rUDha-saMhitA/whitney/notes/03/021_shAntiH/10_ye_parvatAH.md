## Translation
10. The mountains that are soma-backed, the waters that lie supine, the  
wind, Parjanya, then also Agni—these have appeased the flesh-eating one.

## Notes
All our mss. save one (O.), and all SPP's save two or three that follow  
the comm., read *aśīśamam* (apparently by infection from the end of vs.  
9) at the end; both editions emend to *-man*, which is the reading of  
the comm. ⌊Ppp. has the vs. in vii. (as noted above), and combines  
*-pṛṣṭhā ”pa* in **a-b** and *parjanyā ”d* in **c**.—For "soma-backed,"  
see Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.* i. 60 f.⌋

## Translation
6. To him whose food is oxen, whose food is cows, to the soma-backed,  
the pious: to those of whom the one for all men (*vāiśvānará-*) is  
chief—to those fires be this oblation made.

## Notes
The first half-verse is RV. viii. 43. 11 **a, b** (also found, without  
variant, in TS. i. 3. 147). MS. (ii. 13. 13) has the whole verse as  
pādas **a, b, d, e**, interposing as **c** the pāda (*stómair vidhemā  
’gnáye*) which ends the *gāyatrī* in RV.TS. The meter (8 + 8: 8 + 11)  
is, as *bṛhatī*, rather *nicṛt* than *virāj*.

## Translation
2. \[The fire\] that is within soma, that is within the kine, that is  
entered into the birds, into the wild beasts (*mṛgá*), that entered into  
bipeds, into quadrupeds—to those fires be this oblation made.

## Notes
MS. and K. begin **b** with *váyāṅsi yá āvivéṣa;* Ppp. with *yo viṣṭo  
vayasi*. The comm. takes the kine in **a** as representing the domestic  
animals in general, the fire being that which makes their milk cooked  
instead of raw, as often alluded to. SPP. follows the mss. in reading in  
**b** *váyaḥsu;* our alteration to the equivalent *váyassu* was  
needless. The verse (10 + 11: 13 + 11 = 45) is *bhurij*, but also  
irregular enough. ⌊Pādas **b** and **d** are in order, each a  
*triṣṭubh;* and **c**, if we throw out the second *yás*, is a good  
*jagatī;* **a** is bad.⌋

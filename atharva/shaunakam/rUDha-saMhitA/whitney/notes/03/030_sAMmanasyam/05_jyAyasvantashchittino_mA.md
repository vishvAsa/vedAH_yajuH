## Translation
5. Having superiors (*jyā́yasvant*), intentful, be ye not divided,  
accomplishing together, moving on with joint labor (*sádhura*); come  
hither speaking what is agreeable one to another; I make you united  
(*sadhrīcī́na*), like-minded.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *sudhirās* in **b**, combines *anyo ‘nyasmāi* (as does the  
comm., and as the meter requires) in **c**, and inserts *samagrāstha*  
before *sadhrīcīnān* in **d**; the comm. further has *āita* for *eta* in  
**c** (as have our P.E.). *Jyāyasvant* was acutely conjectured by the  
Pet. Lex. to signify virtually "duly subordinate," and this is supported  
by the comm.: *jyeṣṭhakaniṣṭhabhāvena parasparam anusarantaḥ;* Ludwig  
renders "überlegen." *Sádhura*, lit. 'having the same wagon-pole,' would  
be well represented by our colloquial "pulling together." *Cittínas* in  
**a** is perhaps rather an adjunct of *ví yāuṣṭa* = 'with, i.e. in your  
intents or plans.' The verse (11 + 11: 12 + 12 = 46) is ill defined by  
the Anukr., as even the redundant syllable in **d** gives no proper  
*jagatī* character to the pāda. ⌊Reject *vaḥ* or else read *sadhrī́co?*  
thus we get an orderly *triṣṭubh*.⌋

## Translation
8. Bring forward, O woman, this full jar, a stream of ghee combined  
(*sam-bhṛ*) with ambrosia (*amṛ́ta*); anoint these drinkers (?) with  
ambrosia; let what is offered-and-bestowed defend it (f.: the  
dwelling?).

## Notes
The well-nigh universal reading of the mss. in **c** is *imā́m pātṝ́n*,  
which SPP. accordingly presents in his text, in spite of its grammatical  
impossibility (of our mss., E. gives *pātrén*, *-tren* being a  
misreading of *-tṝn* found also more than once elsewhere; P. has  
*pādán*, and W. *pātrān*); we emended *imā́m* to *imā́n;* but perhaps  
*imā́m pātrīm* 'this drinking-vessel,' which the comm. has, would be  
preferable, as better suited to *sám an̄dhi;* and *enām* at the end would  
then refer to it. The comm. has *sam indhi* instead of *sám an̄dhi;* he  
makes *enām* imply *śālām*. The corresponding verse in Ppp. (xvii.) is  
quite different, and corrupt; *pūrṇāṁ nābhiri pra harā ’bhi kumbham apāṁ  
ramaṅt oṣadhīnān ghṛtasya: imām pātrer amṛtāir ā sam agdhi sthirā vīrās  
sumanaso bhavantu:* this suggests *imā́m pā́trāir amṛ́tasya* in **c**  
'anoint this \[dwelling\] with vessels of ambrosia'; but also its  
separation from the preceding verses makes uncertain its belonging to  
the same ceremony with them. In the ceremonial use, it accompanies the  
entrance into the new dwelling, the wife first, carrying a water-jar.

title = "०९ इमा आपः"

## Translation
9. These waters I bring forward, free from *yákṣma, yákṣma*-effacing; I  
set forth (? *pra-sad*) unto (*úpa*) the houses, along with immortal  
(*amṛ́ta*) fire.

## Notes
The verse, as already noted, is wanting ⌊in this connection⌋ in Ppp.,  
and neither Kāuś. nor the comm. specify anything as to its use. It  
appears again below as ix. 3. 23 ⌊with Ppp. version⌋. The comm. gives no  
explanation nor paraphrase of *prá sīdāmi.* ⌊"Prepositions" discussed,  
Prāt. iv. 3, note.⌋

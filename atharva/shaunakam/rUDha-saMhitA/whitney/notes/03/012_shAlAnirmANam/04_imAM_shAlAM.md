## Translation
4. This dwelling let Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Brihaspati fix, foreknowing;  
let the Maruts sprinkle it with water, with ghee; let king Bhaga deepen  
(*ni-tan*) our ploughing.

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a, b** *vāyur agnis tvaṣṭā hotā ni*, and has *somas*  
(which suits *rājā* better) for *bhagas* in **d**. In **c** it begins  
with the true reading *ukṣantu;* this is so naturally suggested as  
emendation of the *uchántu* of the mss. that all the translators assume  
it (Weber, strangely mistaking the plain statement of the *Index  
Verborum*, accuses us of having wrongly altered *ukṣántu* in our edition  
to *uchántu!*); *ukṣántu* is also read by the comm., and by two or three  
of SPP's mss. that follow him; and SPP. very properly admits it into his  
text. SPP. also reads after it *udnā́*, with the comm., but against all  
his mss. ⌊except the *śrotriya* K⌋; there is no instance where *udnā́*  
and *udnás* are correctly read in any of them (here, our Bp.O.Op. have  
*utnā́*, P.M. *utvā́*, the rest\* *unnā́:* our edition gives *unnā́*, and  
Weber has failed to see that it was corrected in the *Index Verborum*  
⌊under *udán*⌋). The comm. makes **d** refer to the ploughing of the  
site of the house: *śālābhūmeḥ karṣaṇaṁ nitarāṁ karotu.* ⌊\*E.H.D.K.Kp.  
and Ppp. have *unnā́;* I. has *uttā́;* W. has *-tu tvā*.⌋  
  
⌊For *uchantu*, see x. 9. 23 n.⌋

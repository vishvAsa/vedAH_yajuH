## Translation
5. Run forth hither from the furthest distance; propitious to thee be  
heaven-and-earth both; king Varuṇa here saith this thus; he here hath  
called thee; ⌊therefore (*sá*)⌋ do thou come to this place.

## Notes
Ppp. has *babhūtām* for *ubhe stām* at end of **b**, and *ahvat svenam  
ehi* at end of **d**. SPP. reports all his *pada*-mss. as reading *aha*  
instead of *āha* in **c**; no such blunder has been noted in ours. His  
ms. of the comm. also appears to have *āhvat* in **d**, but doubtless  
only by an oversight of the copyist (under the next verse it gives  
*ahvat* in an identical phrase of exposition). MS. (ii. 2. 11; p. 24. 3)  
gives a *pratīka* reading *ā́ préhi paramásyāḥ parāvátaḥ*, while no  
corresponding verse is found in its text—or elsewhere, so far as is  
known, unless here.

## Translation
1. Unto thee hath come the kingdom; with splendor rise forward; \[as\]  
lord of the people (*víśas*), sole king, bear thou rule (*vi-rāj*); let  
all the directions call thee, O king; become thou here one for waiting  
on, for homage.

## Notes
The translation implies in **a** *agan*, which is very probably the true  
reading, though the *pada*-mss. divide *tvā:gan.* The metrical  
redundancy in **a, b** is best removed by omitting *prā́n̄* (for which  
Ppp. and the comm. read *prāk*), which seems (as meaning also 'in the  
east') to have been added in order to make yet more distinct the  
comparison with the sun implied in *úd ihi;* the *pada*-text reckons the  
word wrongly to **b**, and the comm. renders it *pūrvam* 'formerly'; he  
takes *ví rāja* as "be resplendent," which is of course possible. The  
verse has but one real *jagatī* pāda (**a**). ⌊With **d** (= vi. 98. 1  
**d**), cf. *námasopasádyas*, used twice in RV.⌋

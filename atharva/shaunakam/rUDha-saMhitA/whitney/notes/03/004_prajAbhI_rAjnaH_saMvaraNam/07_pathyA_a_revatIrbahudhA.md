## Translation
7. The wealthy roads, of manifoldly various form, all, assembling, have  
made wide room for thee; let them all in concord call thee; to the tenth  
\[decade of life\] abide here formidable, well-willing.

## Notes
*Pathyā revatīs*, divinities of good roads and welfare, are explained by  
the comm. as *patho ‘napetā mārgahitahāriṇya etatsaṁjñā devatāḥ;* or  
else *pathyās* is *pathi sādhavaḥ*, and *revatīs* is *āpas.* Both  
editions read in **d** *vaśe ’há*, but the comm., with SPP's *śrotriyas*  
V. and K., read *vase ’há*, and the translation implies this. Ppp.  
offers no variants for the verse. Many of our *saṁhitā*-mss.  
(P.M.W.E.I.H.) retain the final *visarga* of *saṁvidānāḥ* before *hv-*  
in **c**; SPP. does not report any of his as guilty of such a blunder.  
⌊V. and K. recognize *vaśehá* as a variant.⌋ Ppp. appends another verse:  
*yadi jareṇa haviṣā datvā gamayāmasi: atrā ta indraṣ kevalīr viśo  
balihṛtas karat* (cf. RV. x. 173. 6 **c, d**).

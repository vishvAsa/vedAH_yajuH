## Translation
4. The one god stood up to you, flowing at \[your\] will; "the great  
ones have breathed up (*ud-an*)," said he; therefore water (*udaká*) is  
\[so\] called.

## Notes
The name here really had in mind must be, it would seem, *udan*, but  
*udakám* has to be substituted for it in the nominative; none of the  
other texts offer a different form. TS. improves the meter of **a** by  
omitting *vas*, and TS. and MS. leave the *a* of *api* unelided. Ppp.  
differs more seriously: *eko na deva upātiṣṭhat syandamānā upetyaḥ.*  
*Yathāvaśam* in **b** might be 'at his will,' opposed to *apakāmám* in  
vs. 3. The sense of **c** is rather obscure; the comm. understands:  
"saying 'by this respect on the part of Indra we have become great,'  
they breathed freely (or heaved a sigh of relief:  
*ucchvasitavatyas*)"—which is senseless. R. suggests "Indra put himself  
in their way with the polite address and inquiry: 'their worships have  
given themselves an airing'; and conducted them on their way again";  
Weber understands them to sigh under the burden of the god standing  
"upon" (*ápi*) them. The comm. declares *api* to have the sense of  
*adhi*.

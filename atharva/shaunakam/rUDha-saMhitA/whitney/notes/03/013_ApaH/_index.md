## Comment
The first six verses occur in Pāipp. iii., and also in TS. (v. 6. 1), MS. (ii. 13. 1), and K. (xxxix. 2). The hymn is used by Kāuç. in a ceremony for directing water into a certain course (40. 1 ff.); the pādas of vs. 7 are severally employed in it (see under that verse); it also appears, with other hymns (i. 4-6, 33, etc. etc.), in a rite for good-fortune (41. 14). And the comm. describes it as used by one who desires rain. Verse 7 is further employed, with a number of other verses, by Vāit. (29. 13), in the agnicayana, accompanying the conducting of water, reeds, and a frog over the altar-site.—⌊Berlin ms. of Anukr. reads sindhvabdāivatam.⌋

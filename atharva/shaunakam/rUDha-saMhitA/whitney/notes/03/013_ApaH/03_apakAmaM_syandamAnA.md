## Translation
3. As ye were flowing perversely (*apakāmám*), since Indra verily  
hindered (*var*) you by his powers, you, ye divine ones, therefore the  
name water (*vā́r*) is assigned you.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **c** *indro vas saktabhir devāís.* TS. combines in **d**  
*vā́r ṇā́ma.* The comm. apparently takes *híkam* as a single word (the TS.  
*pada*-text so regards it), quoting as his authority *Nāighaṇṭuka* iii.  
12; and again in **d**, if the manuscript does not do him injustice, he  
reads *hikam* for *hitam.*

## Translation
1. Since formerly (? *adás*), going forth together, ye resounded  
(*nad*) when the dragon was slain, thenceforth ye are streams (*nadī́*)  
by name: these are your names, O rivers.

## Notes
The *pada*-mss. all commit the very gratuitous blunder of writing *tā́ḥ*  
instead of *tā́* at the beginning of **d**, as if it belonged to  
*sindhavas* instead of to *nā́māni;* SPP. emends to *tā́*, and the comm.  
so understands the word. The comm. takes *adás* as Vedic substitute for  
*amuṣmin*, qualifying *áhāu.* None of the other texts gives any various  
reading for this verse. Pāda **d** sets forth, as it were, the office of  
the first four verses, in finding punning etymologies for sundry of the  
names of water.

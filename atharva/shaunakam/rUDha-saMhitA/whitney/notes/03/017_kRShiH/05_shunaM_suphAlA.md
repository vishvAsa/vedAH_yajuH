## Translation
5. Successfully (*śunám*) let the good plowshares thrust apart the  
earth; successfully let the plowmen follow the beasts of draft; O  
śunāsīrā, do ye (two), dripping (?) with oblation, make the herbs rich  
in berries for this man.

## Notes
VS. (xii. 69) and MS. (ii. 7. 12) have the whole of this verse; RV. (iv.  
57. 8) and TS. (iv. 2. 5⁶), only the first two pādas. For *suphālā́s* in  
**a**, VS. (also our I.) has *sú phā́lās*, and RV.TS. *naḥ phā́lās*, both  
preferable readings; RV.VS. have *kṛṣantu* for *tudantu*. In **b**, TS.  
gives *abhí* for *ánu* (our P.M. have *ábhínu*); MS. has *kinā́śo abhy  
ètu vāhāíḥ;* RV.VS., *-śā abhí yantu vāhāíḥ*. In **c**, the comm. gives  
*toṣamāṇā*, explaining it by *tuṣyantāu*. In **d**, the mss. vary (as  
everywhere where the word occurs) between *-pippalā́s* and *-piṣpalā́s;*  
about half are for each; VS. MS. end the pāda with *kartanā ’smé*. Ppp.  
has a peculiar version: *śunaṁ kenāśo anv etu vāhaṁ śunaṁ phālo vinadann  
ayatu bhūmim: śunāsīrā haviṣā yo yajātrāi supippalā oṣadhayas santu  
tasmāi.* The comm. ⌊quoting Yaska⌋ declares *śunāsīrāu* to be Vāyu and  
Āditya (wind and sun); or else, he says, *śuna* is god of happiness and  
*Sīra* of the plow.

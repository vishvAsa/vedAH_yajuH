## Translation
7. O śunāsīrā, do ye (two) enjoy me here; what milk ye have made in  
heaven, therewith pour ye upon this \[furrow\].

## Notes
'Milk,' i.e. nourishing fluid. Weber implies at the end "earth" (instead  
of "furrow"), which is perhaps to be preferred. RV. (iv. 57. 5) reads  
for **a** *śúnāsīrāv imā́ṁ vā́caṁ ju-;* TA. (as above) the same, except  
that it strangely omits the verb, and thus reduces the *triṣṭubh* pāda  
to a *gāyatrī;* both texts mark the principal pāda-division after **b**.  
The comm. changes all the three verbs to 3d dual. The Anukr. forbids in  
**a** the resolution *-sīrā ihá*. In our edition the verse is numbered  
6, instead of 7.

## Translation
9. With ghee, with honey (*mádhu*) \[is\] the furrow all anointed,  
approved (*anu-man*) by all the gods, by the Maruts; do thou, O furrow,  
turn hither unto us with milk, rich in refreshment, swelling with  
fulness of ghee.

## Notes
The verse is found also in VS. (xii. 70), TS. (iv. 2. 5⁶), and MS. (ii.  
7. 12). VS. MS. read *-ajyatām* for *-aktā* in **a**; all make **c** and  
**d** exchange places, and at the beginning of **c** read *asmā́n* for  
*sā́ nas;* and VS.TS. put *páyasā* in place of *ghṛtávat* in **d**, while  
MS. gives *ūrjó bhāgám mádhumat pínv-*.

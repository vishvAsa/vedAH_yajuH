## Translation
1. The poets (*kaví*) harness the plows (*sī́ra*), they extend severally  
the yokes—they the wise ones (*dhī́ra*), with desire of favor (?) toward  
the gods.

## Notes
The verse seems to imply a hidden comparison of the poet's work with the  
plowman's. The other texts (RV. x. 101. 4; VS. xii. 67; TS. iv. 2. 5⁵;  
MS. ii. 7. 12; K. xvi. 11; Kap. xxv. 3) read *sumnayā́* (but K. has  
*-yuḥ*: Kap. not noted), which the translation adopts, *-yāú* seeming an  
unintelligent corruption of it; but the comm. gives a double explanation  
of *-yāu*, one as "desiring a happy-making sacrifice" and qualifying  
*yajamāne* understood, the other as from *sumna-ya* (*-ya* for root  
*yā*) and qualifying *balīvardāu* understood! He makes *sīra* equivalent  
with *lān̄gala*, and takes *vi tanvate* as = "put on the oxen's  
shoulders"; *vi-tan* as here applied seems imitated from its use of  
stringing a bow; in TB. ii. 5. 8¹² we have even *ví tanoti sī́ram.*

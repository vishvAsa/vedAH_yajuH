## Translation
1. Ye gods that are in this eastern quarter, missiles by name—of you  
there the arrows are fire: do ye be gracious to us, do ye bless  
(*adhi-brū*) us; to you there be homage, to you there hail!

## Notes
The corresponding utterance in TS. reads: "missiles by name are ye; your  
houses there are in front (in the east); fire is your arrows, ocean  
(*salilá*)"—and similarly in what follows. Ppp. prefixes *rakṣa* (once  
*rakṣaḥ*) at the beginning of each verse. The comm. appears to take  
*devā́s* throughout as a vocative (*he devāḥ*); he defines it as meaning  
"Gandharvas"; the arrows are either fire or else Agni. The Anukr.  
apparently restores *yé asyā́ṁ*, and also makes the refrain to be of 11 +  
10 = 21 syllables; then the initial "pādas" of 1, of 3 and 4, of 5, of  
2, and of 6 count respectively as 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 syllables, and  
the complete numbers vary from 44 to 48 syllables. ⌊The Anukr. ought to  
call vs. 2 *nicṛt* and vs. 5 *virāj*.—For "gods" as an address to the  
serpents, cf. vi. 56. 1, where they are called "god-people."⌋

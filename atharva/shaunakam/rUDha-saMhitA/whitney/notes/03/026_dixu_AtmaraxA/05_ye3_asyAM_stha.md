## Translation
5. Ye gods that are in this fixed quarter, smearers (*nilimpá*) by  
name—of you there the arrows are the herbs: do ye be etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *vilimpās* for *nil-*, and makes the arrows to be food  
(*anna*). TS. calls the quarter "here (*ihá*)" and puts it after the one  
"above" (our vs. 6); the name is "fleshly, earthly," and the arrows (as  
in Ppp.) "food." The comm. explains *nilimpās* as *nitarāṁ liptāḥ*.

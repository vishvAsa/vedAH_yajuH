## Translation
3. Give birth to a male, a son; after him let a male be born; mayest  
thou be mother of sons, of those born and whom thou shalt bear.

## Notes
All the mss. save one or two (including our E.) read at the end *yā́m;*  
both editions make the necessary emendation to *yā́n*, which the comm.  
also gives. At beginning of **b**, Ppp. reads *tvam*, as do also the  
comm. and a couple of SPP's mss.; and Ppp. ends with *janayāmi ca*. MB.  
(i. 4. 9 **c, d**) has the first half-verse, reading *vindasva* for  
*janaya;* and MP. (as above) ⌊i. 13. 2⌋ also, with *púmāṅs te putró  
nāri* for **a**. And śGS. (as above) has our **a, b**, with, for **c,  
d**, *teṣām mātā, bhaviṣyasi jātānāṁ janayāṅsi ca* ⌊the end corrupt, as  
in Ppp.⌋.

title = "०६ यस्ते हवं"

## Translation
6. Whatever fellow disputes thy call, and whatever outsider—making  him  
go away (*ápāñc*), O Indra, then do thou reinstate (*ava-gamaya*) this  
man here.

## Notes
The comm. explains *sajātá* and *níṣṭya* as *samabala* and *nikṛṣṭabala*  
(!) ⌊as at i. 19. 3⌋, and *ava gamaya* as *bodhaya*. The Anukr. takes no  
notice of the metrical deficiency in **a**; emendation to *-vádati*  
would fairly rectify it. ⌊For *ava-gam*, see note to vs. 4.⌋

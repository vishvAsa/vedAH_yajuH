## Translation
8. I thrust them forth with mind, forth with intent and incantation;  
forth with branch of tree, of *aśvatthá*, we thrust them.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *prāi ’nān nudāmi* (which makes the meter easier), and  
at the end correspondingly the active *nudāmasi;* for **b** it gives  
*pra śṛtyena brāhmaṇā.* The lingualization of the first *n* of *enān* is  
noted in Prāt. iii. 80, and the comment on that rule quotes the instance  
in **c**, but not that in **a**. According to Kāuś. the thing "mentioned  
in the text" (perhaps an effigy of the person aimed at, in the "vitals"  
of which something has been buried by the preceding rule) ⌊having been  
put upon a boat⌋ is with this verse and ix. 2. 4 pushed forth with a  
branch, and with vs. 7 made to float away.

## Translation
3. As thou, O *aśvatthá*, didst break out \[the *khadirá*\] within the  
great sea, so do thou break out all these, whom I hate and who \[hate\]  
me.

## Notes
"The sea," doubtless the atmosphere, as explained by the comm. (and  
Weber). The comm. reads *ábhinas* in **a**, and two or three of SPP's  
mss. so far agree with him as to give the (blundering) *nirábhinnas;*  
this reading exhibits a much less startling and anomalous crowding-out  
of the root-final by the personal ending than does *-abhanas* (see my  
*Skt. Gr.* §555), and so is more acceptable. Some of SPP's mss.  
similarly mix up *bhindhi* and *bhan̄dhi* in **c**; the comm., of course,  
has the former. A part of the mss. (including our Bp.P.M.E.H.) leave  
*mahati* in **b** unaccented (as again at xi. 8. 2, 6). Ppp. *yathā  
’śvattha vibhinacchaṁ tahaty arṇave: evā me śatro cittāni viṣvag bhidhi  
sahasvatā* (cf. our vs. 6 **c, d**).

## Translation
6. As, O *aśvatthá*, ascending them of the forest-trees, thou dost put  
them beneath thee (*ádhara*), so the head of my foe do thou split apart  
and overcome.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. (as we saw above) has the second half of this verse, with variants,  
as its 3 **c, d**. What the *vānaspatyá* is, as distinguished from  
*vánaspáti*, is as obscure as the similar relation of *rtú* and *ārtavá*  
⌊iii. 10. 9 note⌋; possibly 'they of that sort, they and their kind';  
our translation marks, rather mechanically, the distinction. The comm.  
says that here *vanaspati* means "the place where trees grow," and  
*vānaspatya* the trees themselves—which is an explanation quite after  
his kind.

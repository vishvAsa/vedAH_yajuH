## Translation
5. The white-footed sheep, accompanied with five cakes, commensurate  
with \[his\] world, the giver lives upon, \[as\] unexhausted in the sun  
and moon.

## Notes
The five cakes are those laid on the victim as prescribed in Kāuś. (see  
above). In our edition, *sūryamāsáyor* is a misprint for *sūryām-*.

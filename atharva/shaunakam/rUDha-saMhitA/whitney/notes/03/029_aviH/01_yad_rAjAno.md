## Translation
1. What the kings share among themselves—the sixteenth of what is  
offered-and-bestowed—yon assessors (*sabhāsád*) of Yama: from that the  
white-footed sheep, given \[as\] ancestral offering (*svadhā́*),  
releases.

## Notes
By this offering, one is released from the payment otherwise due to  
Yama's councilors on admission into the other world: the ideas are not  
familiar from other parts of the mythology and ritual. ⌊But cf.  
Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.* i. 511; Weber, *Berliner Sb.*, 1895, p.  
845.⌋ The comm. explains thus: *ubhayavidhasya karmaṇaḥ  
ṣoḍaśasaṁkhyāpūrakaṁ yat pāpam puṇyarāśer vibhaktaṁ kurvanti*, as if the  
sixteenth were the share of demerit to be subtracted from the merit, and  
cleansed away (*pari-śodhay-*) by Yama's assistants, etc. In **c** he  
reads *muñcatu* for *-ti;* *śitipād* in **d** he renders *śvetapād*. The  
last pāda lacks a syllable, unless we make a harsh resolution. Our text  
reads in **b** *-pūrttásya;* ⌊for consistency, delete one *t*⌋.

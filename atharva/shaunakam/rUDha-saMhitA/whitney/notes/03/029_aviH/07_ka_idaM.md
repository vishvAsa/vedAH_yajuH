## Translation
7. Who hath given this to whom? Love hath given unto love; love \[is\]  
giver, love acceptor; love entered into the ocean; with love I accept  
thee; love, that for thee!

## Notes
⌊Not metrical.⌋ This "verse" and the following appear to have nothing to  
do with the preceding part of the hymn, which has 6 vss.\* (according to  
the norm of this book). This "verse" is found in a whole series of  
texts, as a formula for expiating or avoiding what may be improper in  
connection with the acceptance of sacrificial gifts. The version of TA.  
(iii. 10. 1-2, 4: also found, with interspersed explanation, in TB. ii.  
2. 5⁵, and repeated in ĀpśS. xiv. 11. 2) is nearly like ours, but omits  
the second *adāt*, and reads *kā́maṁ samudrám ā́ viśa;* that of AśS. (v.  
13. 15) has the latter reading but retains the *adāt*. That of PB. (i.  
8. 17) and K. (ix. 9) differs from ours only by having *ā ’viśat*  
instead of *ā́ viveśa*. MS. (i. 9. 4) omits the phrase *kā́maḥ samudrám ā́  
viveśa*, and reads *kā́māya* for the following *kā́mena*. And VS. (vii.  
48: with it agree śB. iv. 3. 4³² and śśS. iv. 7. 15) has as follows: *kò  
‘dāt kásmā adāt: kā́mo ‘dāt kā́māyā ’dāt: kā́mo dātā́ kā́maḥ pratigrahītā́  
kā́māi ’tát te*. ⌊See also MGS. i. 8. 9, and p. 149.⌋ Of course, the  
comm. cannot refrain from the silliness of taking *kás* and *kásmāi* as  
signifying "Prajāpati," and he is able to fortify himself by quoting TB.  
ii. 2. 5⁵, as he also quotes 5¹ for the general value of the formula;  
and even 5⁶ for the identity of kama with the ocean, although our text,  
different from that of TB., does not imply any such relation between  
them. The Anukr. scans thus; 7 + 6: 11 + 9: 9 + 4 = 46. \*⌊Cf.  
introduction to this hymn.⌋

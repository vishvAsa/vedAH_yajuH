## Translation
6. Agni puts together the breaths; the moon is put together with breath:  
I away from etc. etc.

## Notes
In this verse and those that follow, the refrain has hardly an  
imaginable relation with what precedes it; though here one may  
conjecture that analogies are sought for its last item, *sám ā́yuṣā*.  
According to the comm., Agni in **a** is the fire of digestion, and the  
breaths are the senses, which he fits for their work by supplying them  
nourishment; and the moon is soma ⌊considered as food; for which he  
quotes a passage quite like to śB. xi. 1. 6¹⁹⌋.

## Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Reckoned, with iv. 33 and vi. 26, to the pāpma (pāpmahā?) gaṇa (Kāuś. 30. 17, note), and used by Kāuś. (58. 3), with several others, in a ceremony for long life following initiation as a Vedic scholar; and vs. 10 (vss. 10 and 11, comm.) also in the āgrahāyaṇī sacrifice (24. 31). In Vāit. (13. 10), vs. 10 is uttered in the agniṣṭoma sacrifice by the sacrificer (the comm. says, by the brahman-priest) as he rises to mutter the apratiratha hymn. And the comm. (without quoting any authority) declares the hymn to be repeated by the brahman-priest near water in the pitṛmedha rite, after the cremation.

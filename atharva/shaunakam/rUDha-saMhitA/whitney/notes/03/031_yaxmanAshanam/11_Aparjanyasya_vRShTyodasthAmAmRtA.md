## Translation
11. Hither with Parjanya's rain have we stood up immortal: I away from  
etc. etc.

## Notes
The other texts (see under the preceding verse) all begin with *út*  
instead of *ā́;* for *vṛṣṭyā́*, TS.TA. have *śúṣmeṇa*, VS.AśS.  
*dhā́mabhis*, PGS. *dṛṣiyā;* for **b**, PGS. gives *pṛthivyāḥ  
saptadhāmabhiḥ*, all the others *úd asthām amṛ́tāṅ ánu*. ⌊Here the comm.,  
in citing the refrain, reads *vyāham*, which, as implying *vy-ā-vṛt*, is  
equally good.⌋  
  
As in several cases above, it is obvious that this hymn has been  
expanded to a length considerably greater than properly belongs to it by  
breaking up its verses into two each, pieced out with a refrain. It  
would be easy to reduce the whole material to six verses, the norm of  
this book, by adding the refrain in vs. 1 only (or possibly also in vs.  
4, with ejection of the senseless and apparently intruded vs. 5), and  
then combining the lines by pairs—as the parallel texts prove that vss.  
10 and 11 are rightly to be combined. ⌊The critical status of ii. 10 is  
analogous; see the note to ii. 10. 2.⌋  
  
The sixth and last *anuvāka* has 6 hymns, with 44 verses; and the old  
Anukr. reads: *caturdaśā ’ntyaḥ* (but further *-ntyānuvākasaś* ⌊*śaś*?⌋  
*ca saṁkhyā vidadhyād adhikānimittāt*, which is obscure).  
  
⌊☞ See p. cxl, top.⌋  
  
Here ends also the sixth *prapāṭhaka.*  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Not one of our mss. adds a summary of hymns and verses for the whole  
book.

## Translation
2. If of exhausted life-time, or if deceased, if gone down even to the  
presence (*antiká*) of death, him I take from the lap of perdition; I  
have won (*spṛ*) him for \[life\] of a hundred autumns.

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** *áspārṣam*, which is the reading of our  
edition, supported by RV., and also by the comm. (= *prabalaṁ karomi!*),  
and two of SPP's mss. that follow the latter; the *áspārśām* of nearly  
all the mss. (hence read by SPP.), and of Ppp., can be nothing but a  
long-established blunder. Ppp. has at the beginning *yad ukharāyur y-*.  
⌊At ii. 14. 3 SPP. used the "long ſ" to denote the *kṣāipra* circumflex;  
with equal reason he might use it here for the *praśliṣṭa* of *nī̀ta* =  
*ní-ita.*⌋

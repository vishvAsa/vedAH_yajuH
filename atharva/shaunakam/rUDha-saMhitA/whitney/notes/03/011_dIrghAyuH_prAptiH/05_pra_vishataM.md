## Translation
5. Enter in, O breath-and-expiration, as two draft-oxen a pen (*vrajá*);  
let the other deaths go away (*ví*), which they call the remaining  
hundred.

## Notes
In this verse, as in the preceding and in vs. 7 and elsewhere, SPP.  
makes the indefensible combination *n ch*, instead of *ñ ch*, as the  
result of mutual assimilation of *n* and *ś* ⌊cf. note to i. 19. 4⌋.  
  
⌊As to the "one hundred and one deaths," cf. viii. 2. 27; xi. 6. 16; i.  
30. 3; *ékaśata* in Index; and the numbers in the notable passage, xix.  
47. 3 ff.; Kuhn's most interesting Germanic parallels, KZ. xiii. 128  
ff.; Wuttke, *Deutscher Volksaberglaube*², 301, 335; Hopkins, *Oriental  
Studies*...papers read before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia,

Edward I., §4, concerning the "Fine of Lands," "unless they put in their  
claim within a year and a day ."⌋

## Translation
8. Hither hath come the year, thy spouse, O sole *áṣṭakā;* do thou unite  
our long-lived progeny with abundance of wealth.

## Notes
Instead of repeating the second half-verse of vs. 3, Ppp. gives for **c,  
d** *tasmāi juhomi: haviṣā ghṛtena śāu naś śarma yacchatu.* Against his  
usual habit, the comm. explains **c, d** anew, but quite in accordance  
with his former explanation.

## Translation
9. I sacrifice to the seasons, the lords of the seasons, them of the  
seasons (*ārtavá*), and the winters (*hāyaná*), to the summers (*sámā*),  
the years, the months; for the lord of existence I sacrifice.

## Notes
The change of case, from accusative to dative, in **d**, doubtless  
intends no change of construction. The verse, as noted above, is wanting  
in Ppp.; it is in part repeated below, as xi. 6. 17. According to the  
comm., the "lords of the seasons" are the gods, Agni etc.; the *ārtavas*  
⌊cf. iii. 6. 6 note⌋ are "parts of seasons; other unspecified divisions  
of time, sixteenths, *kāṣṭhās*, etc."; and although *samā, saṁvatsara*,  
and *hāyana* are synonymous, yet *hāyana* here signifies "days and  
nights," and *samā* "half-months."

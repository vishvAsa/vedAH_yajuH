## Translation
11. We, making oblation with *ídā*—I sacrifice to the gods with what is  
rich in ghee; unto houses not disorderly (? *álubhyant*), rich in kine,  
may we enter together.

## Notes
Or, it might be, 'may we lie down, go to rest'; the translation would  
imply more naturally *sam úpa viśema* ⌊the *Index Verborum* takes *úpa*  
as an independent "case-governing" preposition⌋; the comm. says *upe  
’tya saṁ viśema sukhena ni vasema;* he comfortably removes the  
anacoluthon in **a, b** by declaring *yaje* = *yajāmahe*, and takes  
*alubhyatas* as either nom. (*gārdhyam akurvāṇās*) or accus.  
(*gārdhyarahitān*). Ppp. reads for **d** *dṛṣadesvpagomata.*

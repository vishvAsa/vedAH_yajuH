## Translation
5. The forest-tree pressing-stones have made their sound, making the  
oblation of the complete year (*parivatsarī́ṇa*); O sole *áṣṭakā*, may  
we, having good progeny and good heroes, be lords of wealths.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
"Stones": i.e. probably, blocks of wood used instead of stones ⌊see  
Hillebrandt, *Ved. Mythol.* i. 162, 161⌋; or the wooden mortar and  
pestle (so the comm.). Ppp. reads for **c** *ekāṣṭakayī* (= *-kāyāi*)  
*haviṣā vidhema.* Some of the mss. combine *havíḥ kṛ-* in **b**; the  
comment to Prāt. ii. 63 requires *havíṣ k-*, which both editions accept.  
Some of our mss. (P.M.W.Op.) give in **c** *suprajāsas.* HGS. (ii. 14.  
4) and MB. (ii. 2. 13) have a corresponding verse: HGS. begins with  
*ulūkhalās*, combines *haviḥ k-* and reads *-rīṇām* in **b**, and has  
*suprajā vīravantas* in **c**; MB. gives for **a** *āulūkhalāḥ  
sampravadanti grāvāṇas*, ends **b** with *-rīṇām*, and has for **d**  
*jyog jīvema balihṛto vayaṁ te.* ⌊It recurs also at MP. ii. 20. 34 and  
MGS. ii. 8. 4^(b).⌋ The first pāda is *jagatī*, unnoted in the Anukr.  
⌊As to *aṣṭakā*, cf. Zimmer, p. 365.⌋

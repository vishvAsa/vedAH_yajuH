## Translation
1. This is thy seasonable womb (*yóni*), whence born thou didst shine;  
knowing it, O Agni, ascend thou; then increase our wealth.

## Notes
The verse is found in numerous other texts: besides RV. (iii. 29. 10),  
in VS. (iii. 14 et al.), TS. (i. 5. 5² et al.), TB. (i. 2. 1¹⁶ et al.),  
MS. (i. 5. 1 et al.), K. (vi. 9 et al.), Kap. (i. 16 et al.), JB. (i.  
6l): in nearly all occurring repeatedly. VS.TS.TB.JB. differ from our  
version only by reading *áthā* for *ádhā* at beginning of **d**; Ppp.  
and the comm. have *atha;* MS.K. substitute *tátas;* but RV. gives  
further *sīda* for *roha* in **c**, and *gíras* for *rayím* in **d**.  
The comm., in accordance with the ritual uses of the verse, declares  
*ayám* at the beginning to signify either the fire-stick or the  
sacrificer himself.

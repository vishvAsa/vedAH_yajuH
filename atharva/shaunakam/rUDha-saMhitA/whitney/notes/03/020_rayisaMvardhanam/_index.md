## Comment
Excepting the last verse, the hymn is found in Pāipp. iii. (in the verse-order 1-3, 7, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9). It includes (vss. 2-7) a whole RV. hymn (x. 141), with a single RV. verse (iii. 29. 10) prefixed, and only the last two verses occur nowhere else. It is used in Kāuç. (18. 13) in the nirṛtikarman, with an offering of rice mixed with pebbles; again (40. 11), in the rite of the removal of the sacrificial fire, with transfer of it to the fire-sticks or to one's self; again (41. 8), with v. 7 and vii. 1, in a rite for success in winning wealth; and the comm. directs vs. 4 to be used in the sava sacrifices (ity anayā bhṛgvan̄girovidaç catura ārṣeyān āhvayet). In Vāit., vs. 1 appears in the agniṣṭoma sacrifice (24. 14), and again in the sarvamedha (38. 14) with the same use as in Kāuç. 40. 11; and also in the agnicayana (28. 25), with the laying of the gārhapatya bricks; further, verses 2-4 and 7 and 8 in the agnicayana (29. 19); vs. 4 a, b in the agniṣṭoma (15. 16), as the adhvaryu follows the fire and soma; vs. 5 in the same (23. 20), with certain offerings; and vs. 6 in the same (19. 2), with a graha to Indra and Vāyu.

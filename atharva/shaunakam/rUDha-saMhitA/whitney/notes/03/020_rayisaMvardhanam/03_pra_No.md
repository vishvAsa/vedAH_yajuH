## Translation
3. Let Aryaman bestow upon us, let Bhaga, let Brihaspati, let the  
goddesses; let the divine Sūnṛtā also assign wealth to me.

## Notes
Found also in the other texts (RV. x. 141. 2; VS. ix. 29; the rest as  
above; and Kap. 29. 2). All of these, excepting TS., leave *no* in **a**  
again unlingualized; VS.K. substitute *pūṣā́* for *bhágas* in **b**, and  
omit **c**; the others have *devā́s* instead of *devī́s;* for **d**, RV.  
gives *rāyó devī́ dadātu naḥ*, while the others vary from this only by  
*prá vā́k* for *rāyás*. By Sūnṛta (lit. 'pleasantness, jollity') the  
comm. understands Sarasvatī to be intended.

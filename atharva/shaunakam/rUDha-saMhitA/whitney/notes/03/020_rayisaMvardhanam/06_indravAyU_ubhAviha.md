## Translation
6. Indra-and-Vāyu, both of them here, we call here with good call, that  
to us even every man may be well-willing in intercourse, and may become  
desirous of giving to us.

## Notes
Found also (except the last pāda, which even Ppp. repudiates) in RV. (x.  
141. 4), VS. (xxxiii. 86), and MS.K. (as above). For *ubhā́v ihá* in  
**a**, RV. reads *bṛ́haspátim*, and the other texts *susaṁdṛ́śā*. For  
**d**, VS. has *anamīváḥ saṁgáme* for *sáṁgatyām*, and MS. the same  
without *anamīvás;* TS. has (in iv. 5. 1²) a nearly corresponding  
half-verse: *yáthā naḥ sárvam íj jágad ayakṣmáṁ sumánā ásat*. Ppp. omits  
**a**, perhaps by an oversight. The comm. takes *suhávā* in **b** as for  
*suhávāu*, which is perhaps better. In our edition, the word is  
misprinted *susáv-*.

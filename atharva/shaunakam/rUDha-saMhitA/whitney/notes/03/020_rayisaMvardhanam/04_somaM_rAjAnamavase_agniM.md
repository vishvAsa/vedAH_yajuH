## Translation
4. King Soma \[and\] Agni we call to aid with \[our\] songs (*gír*);  
\[also\] Āditya, Vishṇu, Sūrya, and the priest (*brahmán*) Brihaspati.

## Notes
Found in RV. (x. 141. 3), SV. (i. 91), VS. (ix. 26), and TS.MS.K. (as  
above). The only variant in RV. is the preferable *ādityā́n* in **c**; it  
is read also by the other texts except SV.K.; but SV. TS.MS.K. give  
*váruṇam* for *ávase* in **a**; and they and VS. have *anv ā́ rabhāmahe*  
for *gīrbhír havāmahe* in **b**. The comm. takes *brahmā́ṇam* in **d** as  
"Prajapati, creator of the gods."

## Translation
6. I seize \[your\] minds with \[my\] mind; come ye after my intent with  
\[your\] intents; I put your hearts in my control; come with \[your\]  
tracks following my motion (*yātá*).

## Notes
The comm. reads *gṛhnāmi* in **a**, and three or four of SPP's mss.  
follow him; he also makes in **b** a compound of *anucittebhis.* Quite a  
number of mss. (including our P.M.W.H.s.m.I.) very strangely combine at  
the end *-mānar éta.* MB. has a somewhat similar verse at i. 2. 21. How  
heedless the Anukr. is of metrical irregularity is well illustrated by  
**c**, where the desirable alteration of *váśeṣu* to *váśe*, and the  
abbreviation of *hṛ́dayāni* to the equivalent *-yā* (both suggested by  
Weber) would leave a good *triṣṭubh* pāda; there is no *jagatī*  
character to any part of the verse. ⌊The combination *-mānareta* looks  
as if it had blundered in from the end of **b**.⌋

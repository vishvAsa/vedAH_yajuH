## Translation
2. The many roads, travelled by the gods, that go about (*sam-car*)  
between heaven-and-earth—let them enjoy me with milk, with ghee, that  
dealing (*krī*) I may get (*ā-hṛ*) riches.

## Notes
Ppp's version is very different: *ihāi ’vaṣ panthā bahavo devayānām anu  
dyāvāpṛthivī supraṇītiḥ: teṣām ahnāṁ varcasy ā dadhāmi yathā klītvā  
dhanatn āvahāni.* The comm. allows us alternatively to understand  
*deva-* in **a** as "by traders"; he renders *juṣantām* in **c** by  
*sevantām*, as if it were causative. His text has at the beginning *ye  
te panth-*. The emendation, suggested by Weber, of *mā* in **c** to *me*  
would help the sense. The first half-verse is found again below as vi.  
55. 1 **a, b.** To make a regular *triṣṭubh*, we must contract to  
*-pṛthvī́* in **b**, and expand to *krī-tu-ā́* in **d**; the Anukr.  
perhaps regards the two irregularities as balancing one another.

## Translation
6. With what riches I practise bargaining, seeking riches with riches,  
ye gods—therein let Indra assign me pleasure (? *rúci*), let Prajāpati,  
Savitar, Soma, Agni.

## Notes
Ppp. has a better version of **a**: *yat paṇena pratipaṇaṁ carāmi;* and  
it arranges **c** differently: *indro me tasmin ṛcam ā;* and reads  
*bṛhaspatis* for *prajāp-* in **d**. HGS. (i. 15. 1) has a kindred  
verse, with second pāda nearly identical with ours, and *rucam* in  
**c**. ⌊See also MP. ii. 22. 4.⌋ *Rúci*, lit. 'brightness,' is variously  
understood by the translators: Zimmer, "attractive power"; Ludwig,  
"pleasure"; Weber, "understanding"; Grill, "consideration"; the comm.  
explains it by *sarvajanaprītiṁ dhanapradānenā ”dānecchām.* ⌊Ppp. seems  
to omit *dhanena* in **b**.⌋

title = "०६ अभि तेऽधां"

## Translation
6. I have put on (*abhí*) for thee the overpowering one (f.); I have put  
to (*úpa*) for thee the very powerful one; after me let thy mind run  
forth as a cow after her calf, run as water on its track.

## Notes
RV. reads *úpa* for *abhí* in **a**, and has for **b** *abhí tvā ’dhāṁ  
sáhīyasā*. The application of **a** and **b** as made by Kāuś. (see  
above) would suit the prepositions as found in RV. decidedly better than  
as in our text; but much more appropriate is the use made by MP.,  
elements of the root being secretly bound on the arms of the wife, with  
which she embraces the husband below and above ⌊so that one arm is under  
him and the other over him⌋; then in *abhy adhām* is further implied (as  
elsewhere ⌊e.g. iii. 11. 8⌋) the value of *abhidhānī*, the halter or  
bridle with which a horse is controlled. The Anukr. does not sanction  
the resolution *ma-ā́m* in **c**.

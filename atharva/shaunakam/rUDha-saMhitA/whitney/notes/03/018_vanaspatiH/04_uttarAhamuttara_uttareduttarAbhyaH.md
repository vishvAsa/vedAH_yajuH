title = "०४ उत्तराहमुत्तर उत्तरेदुत्तराभ्यः"

## Translation
4. Superior \[am\] I, O superior one; superior, indeed, to them (f.)  
that are superior; below \[is\] she that is my rival; lower \[is\] she  
than they (f.) that are lower.

## Notes
RV. has the better reading *áthā* for *adhás* in **c**, allowing **c**  
and **d** to be combined into one sentence; and the comm. gives  
correspondingly *adha*. Ppp. is more discordant and corrupt: *uttarā  
ā́ham uttarabhyo uttaro ed ādharabhyaḥ: adhaḥ sapatnī sāmarthy adhared  
adhārabhyaḥ*. R. conjectures in **a** *uttarāhāhamuttare*, for *úttarā  
’hám ahamuttaré* ⌊cf. iii. 8. 3⌋. The verse, even if scanned as 7 + 7: 8  
+ 7 = 29, ought to be called *bhurij*.

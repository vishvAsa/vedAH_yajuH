## Translation
1. I turn away from evil-dreaming, from bad dreaming, from ill-success  
(*ábhūti*); I make *bráhman* my inner \[defense\]; \[I put\] away the  
pains having the aspect of dreams.

## Notes
The comm. (also Ppp.) reads *svapnāt* in **b**. A corresponding verse is  
found in KśS. xxv. 11. 20: for **b** it has *pāpaḥ svapnād abhūtyāi;* it  
reads *karave* for *kṛṇve* in **c**, and, for **d**, *paraḥ svapnamukhā  
kṛdhi*. Ppp. ends with *-mukhā suva*. Near half of SPP's authorities  
have *párāḥ* in **d**. The comm. explains *svapnamukhās* by  
*svapnadvārikāḥ*. ⌊Griffith says: "*I turn away:* and lie on my other  
side"—to prevent the recurrence of nightmare. As to **c**, cf. i. 19. 4  
and v. 8. 6.⌋

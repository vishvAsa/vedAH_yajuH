## Translation
1. This Agni, lord of the good, household priest, conquered them of  
increased virility (?), as a chariot-warrior \[conquers\] footmen; set  
down on earth in the navel, brightly shining, let him put under foot  
them who desire to fight \[us\].

## Notes
Our pādas **a, c, d** are **b, c, d** of a verse that is found in VS.  
xv. 51, TS. iv. 7. 13³, MS. ii. 12. 4 with the following first pāda: *ā́  
vācó mádhyam aruhad bhuraṇyús;* they also read *cékitānas* for  
*vṛddhávṛṣṇas*, and, at beginning of **c**, *pṛṣṭhé pṛthivyā́s*, and TS.  
has *kṛṇute* in **d**. Ppp. has in **c** *pṛthivyā*(*s*), which is  
better. The new version of our text so decidedly calls for an accus. in  
**a** that the translation implies *vṛddhávṛṣnyān*, or else the  
understanding of *-vṛṣṇas* as accus. pl. of *-ṣan*, which is perhaps not  
impossible, though against usage in composition. The comm. reads  
*-ṇyas*, also *patnīm* in **b** (having to labor hard to make out a  
sense for the latter). The mss. vary between *patnī́n* and *pattī́n* (our  
Bp.P.M.W.E.I, have the former). The first pāda is *triṣṭubh*.

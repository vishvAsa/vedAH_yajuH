## Translation
1. Again let sense (*indriyá*) come to me, again soul, property, and  
*bráhmaṇa* (sacred knowledge); let the fires of the sacred hearth again  
officiate just here in their respective stations.

## Notes
The verse occurs in śśS. viii. 10. 2, with *mām* for *mā* in **a**, and,  
in **c, d**, *dhiṣṇyāso yathāsthānaṁ dhārayantām ihāi ’va;* and the  
*pratīka púnar mā́m āítv indriyám* is found in TA. i. 32. 1, but might  
rather be intended to quote the parallel but quite different verse found  
at AGS. iii. 6. 8: *punar mām āitv indriyam punar āyuḥ punar bhagaḥ;  
punar draviṇam āitu mām punar brāhmaṇam āitu mām;* which MB. (i. 6. 33)  
also has, with *mā* in **c** and **d**. ⌊Cf. TA. i. 30. 1; also MGS. i.  
3. 1, and p. 152.⌋ AGS. adds a second verse, of which the first half  
corresponds with our **c, d**: *ime ye dhiṣṇyāso agnayo yathāsthānam iha  
kalpatām* ⌊cf. MGS. i. 3. 1⌋. The Anukr. seems to scan **a** and **c**  
as 7 syllables each.

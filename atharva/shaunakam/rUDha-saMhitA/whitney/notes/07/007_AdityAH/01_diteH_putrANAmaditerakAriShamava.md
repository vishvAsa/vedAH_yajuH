## Translation
1. Of Diti's sons, of Aditi's, I have commemorated the aid, of the great  
inviolable gods; for their domain (*dhā́man*) is deep in the sea; no one  
soever is beyond them by homage.

## Notes
This translation is in part mechanical, understanding also *ávas* at  
beginning of **b** (which = RV. x. 36. 11 **b**: cf. also 65. 3 **a**),  
regarding *anarmáṇām* as = *anarváṇām* (so RV.), and giving *gabhiṣák*  
(p. *gabhi॰sák*) the sense conjectured for it by BR., which is also that  
of the comm. (*gambhīram*). The variants of Ppp. and of MS. (i. 3. 9)  
indicate that our text is without much authority: MS. has *d. p. a.  
akāriṣam urúśarmaṇām bṛhatā́m varūtínām: yéṣāṁ nā́māni víhitāni dhāmaśáś  
cittāír yajanti bhúvanāya jīváse;* Ppp. (after **a**), *mahāśarmaṇāṁ  
mahatām anṛmṇām: tvesāyu dhāmi gabhiṣat samudraṁ na hi ṣāṁ ye apasaṣ  
paro ‘sti kiṁ cana*. *Námasā* is perhaps corrupted from *mánasā* ⌊cf.  
iv. 39. 9 n.⌋ and *enān* from *enā́*. The great majority of our mss. (all  
save D.R.) read *akārṣam* at end of **a**; SPP. reports the great  
majority of his as giving *akāriṣam*, which he accordingly adopts in his  
text. Ppp. has *akārṣam*, MS. *akāriṣam*. Our Bp. has *enām* in **d**.  
The testimony of the Anukr. as to *akārṣam* or *-riṣam* is of no value.

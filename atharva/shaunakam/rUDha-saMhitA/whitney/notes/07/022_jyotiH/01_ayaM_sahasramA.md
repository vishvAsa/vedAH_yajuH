## Translation
1. This one \[is\] a thousand for our seeing, thought of the poets,  
light in extent.

## Notes
The translation is only mechanical, the real sense being wholly obscure.  
SV. reads *ā́navo dṛśáḥ* (for *ā́ no dṛśé*); Ppp., *ā na ṛṣiṣ;* and  
*aditir* for *matir*. SV. ends with *vídharma*. The comm. divides the  
verses differently, ending the first with *sam āirayan*, against the  
mss., the Anukr., the SV., and the evident connection ⌊but apparently  
with Ppp.⌋. The metrical definitions of the Anukr. are bad; each verse  
is 12 + 8, the second having an added pāda of 11 syllables.

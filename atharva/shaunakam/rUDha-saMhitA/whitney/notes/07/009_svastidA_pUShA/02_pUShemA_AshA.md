## Translation
2. Pūshan knows throughout all these places; he shall conduct us by that  
which is most free from fear; giving well-being, glowing, preserving  
heroes, let him go before unremitting, foreknowing.

## Notes
This verse is again, without variation, RV. x. 17. 5 (also MS. iv. 14.  
16, with *meṣat* for *neṣat;* TB. ii. 4. 1⁶ and TA. vi. 1. 1⁶, with  
*ághṛṇi* in **c**; but TA. has further *pravidvā́n* at end).

## Comment
Of this hymn only vs. 4 is found in Pāipp. (xx.). For other correspondences see under the several verses. Kāuç. (52. 12), among the rites for welfare (svastyayana), uses the hymn in one for the recovery of lost articles of property; and verse 2 is reckoned (on account of abhayatamena in b) to the abhaya gaṇa (note to 16. 8). Vāit. (8. 13) makes it accompany a libation to Pūshan in the cāturmāsya ceremony.

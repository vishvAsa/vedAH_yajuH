## Comment
The first four verses are found in Pāipp. xx.† It is used in Kāuç. (32. 5) in a remedial rite against venomous bites, with the direction "do as stated in the text"; and vs. 5 accompanies, with vi. 56 etc., an offering in the ceremony of entering on Vedic study (139. 8). *⌊The mss. have -patyam ute ’dam: but the statement should refer rather to the verse than to the hymn.⌋ †⌊Also vs. 8: see below.⌋

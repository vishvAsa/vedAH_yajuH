## Translation
3. That the member may go off, and may be impotent (? *ánāvayas*) toward  
women, of the depending, inciting (?), peg-like, in-thrusting one, what  
is stretched, that do thou unstretch; what is stretched up, that do thou  
stretch down.

## Notes
The epithets in this verse are very obscure, and are rendered for the  
most part only at a venture. The comm. explains *anāvayas* as either  
'not arriving' (from root *vī* = *gam*) or 'not enjoying' (from *ā-vī* =  
*ad*, i.e. *bhakṣ* 'enjoy'); *knadī́vant* (our text reads incorrectly  
*klad-*, with only one ms., Bp.², and the Petersburg Lexicon conjectures  
"perhaps 'wet,'" from a reminiscence of *klid*) he regards as from root  
*krad*, with substitution of *n* for *r*, and renders 'inviting'  
(*āhvānavant*); *śān̄kurá* he derives from *śan̄kū;* *avastha* is to him  
simply = (*strīsamīpe*) *avatiṣṭhamāna*, or (as for *avaḥ-stha*) *striyā  
adhaḥpradeśe sambhogāya tiṣṭhataḥ*. ⌊In **a, b**, Ppp. is quite  
defaced.⌋  
  
Here ends the eighth *anuvāka*, of 9 hymns and 24 verses. The quoted  
Anukr. says *aṣṭamāu nava*, and *caturviṅśa*. ⌊See p. 1045.⌋

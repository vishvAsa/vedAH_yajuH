## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. (in inverse order of verses); and, as connected passage, further in TS. (i. 8. 221) and śśS. (ii. 4. 3). Used by Kāuś. (32. 3), with hymns 42, 46, 78, 112, in a remedial rite for various diseases, with binding of grass on the joints; and also (59. 19) with 17 etc.: see 17. In Vāit. (8. 1), it accompanies an offering to Agni and Vishnu at the beginning of the parvan ceremony. ⌊Whitney seems to doubt whether the Anukr. does not mean to ascribe this hymn (and 27, 28) to Bhṛgvan̄giras.⌋

## Translation
2. O Agni-and-Vishṇu, great \[is\] your dear domain (*dhā́man*); ye  
partake of (*vī*) the ghee, enjoying secret things, increasing by good  
praise in each house; may your tongue move up to meet the ghee.

## Notes
For the exchanges of pādas in the other texts, see under the preceding  
verse; for this verse we have here further AśS. (ii. 8. 3), without such  
exchange. In the material corresponding to our 2, all the other texts  
read *juṣāṇā́* at end of **b**; at end of **d**, TS. has again *-ṇyet*,  
and all the others *-ṇyat;* TS.MS. have *vāvṛdhāna* at end of **c**, and  
TS. *suṣṭutī́r*, MS. *suṣṭutī́*, before it; while AśS.śśS. read instead  
*suṣṭutir vām iyānā*, evidently corrupt. Ppp. has, for **b** (putting it  
in the other verse), *pātaṁ ghṛtasya guhyā juṣāṇaḥ*. VS. (viii. 24) and  
MS. (in i. 3. 39), finally, have a second half-verse nearly like our  
**c, d**, but addressed to Agni, with a wholly different first half: it  
reads *dáme-dame samídhaṁ yakṣy* (MS. *yákṣy*) *agne práti te jihvā́  
ghṛtám úc caraṇyat*. ⌊The "inversion" of the verses in Ppp., taken with  
the "exchange of pādas 1 **b** and 2 **b**," seems to mean that the Ppp.  
reading is as follows: *agnāviṣṇū mahi dhāma priyaṁ vāṁ pātaṁ ghṛtasya  
guhyāni nāma: dame-dame* etc.; and then, *agnāviṣṇu mahi tad vāṁ  
mahitvaṁ pātaṁ ghṛtasya guhyā juṣāṇaḥ: dame-dame* etc.⌋

## Translation
1. O Agni-and-Vishnu, great \[is\] that greatness of yours; ye drink of  
the ghee that is called secret, assuming seven treasures in each house;  
may your tongue move on to meet the ghee.

## Notes
TS. has, in **b**, the imperative *vītám*, and śśS. *pātam*, and both  
*gúhyāni*, which makes of *nā́ma* an accus. pl.; at the end, TS. has  
*caraṇyet*, and śśS. *-ṇyat;* and both *dádhānā* at end of **c**: śśS.  
further exchanges 1 **c** and 2 **c**, and has *upa* for *prati* at  
beginning of **d**. MS. mixes up the material of the two verses still  
more, putting our 1 **b, c** after our 2 **a** in iv. 10. 1, and our 2  
**b, c** after our 1 **a** in iv. 11. 2 (in iv. 10. 1 it reads *gúhyāni*  
and *dádhānā*, like the other two texts, the *pāthás*, like ours); in  
**d** (iv. 11. 2), it has *ánu* (the text wrongly *nú*) instead of  
*práti*, and at the end *-ṇyat*. KB. (vii. 2) has two pādas resembling  
**d** (one with *upa* and one with *prati* at the beginning, and both  
ending with *caraṇyat*). With **b** compare further RV. iv. 58. 1 **c**,  
and with **c** RV. v. 1. 5 ⌊**c** and vi. 74. 1 **c**⌋. Ppp. exchanges  
the place of 1 **b** and 2 **b**, and reads in the former (like śśS.)  
*pātam* and *guhyāni* see my addition to note to vs. 2⌋.

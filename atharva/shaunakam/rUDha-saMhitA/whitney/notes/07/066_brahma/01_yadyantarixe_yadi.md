## Translation
1. If it was in the atmosphere, if in the wind, if in the trees, or if  
in the bushes—what the cattle heard uttered—let that *bráhmaṇa* come  
again to us.

## Notes
Ppp. reads: *yady antarikṣaṁ yadi vā rajāṅsi tata vṛkṣeṣu bhayanalapeṣu:  
ajasravan paś-* etc. Nearly all the authorities give *ásravan* in **c**;  
our D. has *áśr-*, and, according to SPP., three of his *pada*-mss. he  
therefore gives in his text *áśravan*, which is also the comm's reading;  
and that is implied in the translation. The comm. connects the hymn with  
the prescriptions as to the time of study or refraining from study of  
the sacred texts (referring to ĀpśS. xv. 21. 8), and regards it as a  
spell for recovering what has been lost by being learned under wrong  
circumstances—in cloudy weather, in sight of green barley, within  
hearing of cattle, etc.

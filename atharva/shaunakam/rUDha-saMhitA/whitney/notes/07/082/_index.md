Of this hymn, verses 2 and 6 are found in Pāipp. xx., and verse 3 in iii. It is used in Kāuç. (59. 15), with ii. 6, in a rite for success; and also (59. 19), with hymn 17 etc.: see under 17; further, vss. 2-6, in the upanayana ceremony (57. 21), accompany the laying of five pieces of fuel in renewing a lost fire*; and the comm. quotes it from the Nakṣatra Kalpa (17-19) in various mahāçānti ceremonies. Vāit.

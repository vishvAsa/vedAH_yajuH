## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx.; and in VS. (xvii. 74), TS. (iv. 6. 54), MS. (ii. 10. 6), and CB. (ix. 2. 3. 38). This hymn, like the preceding, is used by Kāuç. (24. 7) in a general rite for prosperity, with the binding on of a heifer-rope as amulet. In Vāit. (29. 18), it accompanies the laying on of fuel in the agnicayana ceremony.

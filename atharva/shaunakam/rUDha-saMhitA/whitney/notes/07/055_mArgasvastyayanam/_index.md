## Comment
For the true position of this verse, see the introduction to the preceding hymn. It is not found in Pāipp. This verse (separate from its predecessor) is used in Kāuś. (50. 1-3) for welfare on setting out upon a road, etc. (so at least the comm. determines: he pratīka is doubtful, being identical with that of xii. i. 47).

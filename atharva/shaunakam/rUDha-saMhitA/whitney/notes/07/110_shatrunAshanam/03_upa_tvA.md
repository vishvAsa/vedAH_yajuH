## Translation
3. Divine Brihaspati hath served (? *upa-grah*) thee with a bowl; O  
Indra, enter into us with songs—for the sacrificer, the soma-presser.

## Notes
In **a**, *upa-grah* is rendered as if equivalent to *upa-hṛ;* the comm.  
takes it thus: *anyatra yathā na gacchasi tathā svādhīnaṁ kṛtavān*. The  
comm. regards Indra as addressed in **a, b**, but it is rather the drink  
itself, as received in the bowl: so in Vāit. iii. 17. One might  
conjecture *índo* for *índra* in **c** (our P.O. *índram*), but *indra*  
is cited in Vāit. (ib.); ⌊Garbe overlooked the fact that the second half  
of this vs. was intended⌋. Ppp. adds to the somewhat meaningless **d** a  
fifth pāda: *sarvaṁ taṁ rīradhāsi naḥ:* compare the Ppp. version of vi.  
54. 3. ⌊Ppp. reads in **a** *upāi ’naṁ devās.*⌋

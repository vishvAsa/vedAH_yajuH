## Translation
1. O Agni, together with Indra, ye slay the Vritras irresistibly for  
your worshiper (*dāśvā́ns*); for ye are both best Vritra-slayers.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *hatás* in **b** to *hathás*,  
which the construction clearly demands, and which is read by the comm.,  
as also, in a corresponding verse, by TB. (ii. 4. 5⁷: this has also  
*medínā* for *dāśúṣe* in **a**, and *yuvám* for *ubhā́* in **c**). Both  
editions give *hatás*, with all the mss. Ppp. is defaced, but seems to  
read *atho* for *hato*, and for **c** *ugrāya vṛtrahantamām*. ⌊Render  
rather, 'ye slay the adversaries...adversary-slayers'? cf. iv. 32. 7,  
note.⌋ ⌊MS. has *ágnā índraś ca dāśúṣo* just after its version of our  
vs. 2.⌋

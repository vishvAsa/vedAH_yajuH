## Translation
4. Ill luck (?) to the opposing player; do thou shed upon us with ghee;  
smite thou him who plays against us as a tree with a thunderbolt.

## Notes
Compare above, 50. 1. The obscure word at the beginning is divided  
*ādi॰navám* by the *pada*-mss.; SPP., however, alters his *pada*-text to  
*ādinavám*, simply to agree with the comm's grammatical explanation! as  
if that were of the smallest authority or value; and here it is even  
worse than usual; the comm. makes the word a verb-form from root *dīv* +  
*ā*, and glosses it with *ādivyāmy akṣāir ādīvanaṁ\* karomi!* Ppp.  
treats the verse as a cited one; but it has not been found elsewhere in  
its text. \*⌊In the Corrections to vol. ii., p. 535⁵, SPP. suggests  
*ādevanam*.⌋

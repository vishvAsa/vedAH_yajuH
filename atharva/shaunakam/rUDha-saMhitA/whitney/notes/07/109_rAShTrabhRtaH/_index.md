## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. iv. (in the verse-order 6, 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4). Used by Kāuç. (41. 13), with hymn 50 etc., in a rite for success in gambling: see under 50; and by Vāit. (6. 10), in the agnyādheya ceremony, when the sacrificer hands the adhvaryu the anointed dice, for winning at play the somakrayaṇī cow. ⌊The decad division cuts the hymn between vss. 3 and 4: cf. p. 389.⌋ *⌊Note that iv. 38 is for luck in gambling and is ascribed to the same rishi. Cf. introd. to iv. 38 and 40.⌋

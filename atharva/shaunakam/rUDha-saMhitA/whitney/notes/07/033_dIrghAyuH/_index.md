## Comment
Found, without variant, in Pāipp. vi.; also in a number of other texts: see below. The verse has various uses in Kāuś.: next after hymn 15, in a rite for prosperity (24. 8), with offering a dish of mixed grain; in the ceremony of reception of a Vedic student, twice (57. 22, 25), in the ⌊agnikārya⌋, with sprinkling thrice repeated; and (note to 53. 4) the schol. add it in other rites, the godāna etc. In Vāit. (29. 21), the brahman-priest makes the sacrificer repeat it on being anointed, in the agnicayana ceremony.

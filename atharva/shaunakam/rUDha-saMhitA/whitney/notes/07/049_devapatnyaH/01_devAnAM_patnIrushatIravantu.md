title = "०१ देवानां पत्नीरुशतीरवन्तु"

## Translation
1. Let the spouses of the gods, eager, help us; let them help us forward  
unto offspring (? *tují*), unto winning of booty (*vā́ja*); they that are  
of earth, they that are in the sphere (*vratá*) of the waters—let those  
well-invoked goddesses bestow on us protection.

## Notes
The translation implies the accent *devī́s* in **d**. The other texts  
read accordantly *devīḥ suhavāḥ* and *yachata;* ours substitutes  
*yachantu* and adapts *suhávās* to it, but absurdly leaves *devīs*  
vocative. The comm. reads *yacchatu* at the end; he explains *tujáye* by  
*tokāyā ’patyāya*.

## Translation
3. The upper part of thy womb I make the lower; let there not be progeny  
to thee, nor birth; I make thee barren (*asū́*), without progeny; I make  
a stone thy cover.

## Notes
The mss. are divided between *sū́tuḥ* and *sū́nuḥ* at end of **b** (our  
Bp.D. read *sū́nuḥ*), and SPP. adopts *sū́nuḥ* (following half his  
authorities and the comm.), but wrongly, as the accent plainly shows.\*  
The comm. reads *aśvām* at beginning of **c**, and supports it by a  
ridiculous explanation: it stands for *aśvatarīm* 'a she-mule,' and  
she-mules are not fruitful! ⌊In the Berlin ed., the *ṛ* of *kṛṇomi* in  
**c** is wanting.⌋ \*⌊Cf. the note to i. 11. 1.⌋  
  
The discordance between vs. 1 and vss. 2 and 3 is so complete that it is  
difficult to believe them all to form one hymn together; and vs. 1  
evidently belongs with hymn 34; vss. 2 and 3, moreover, are probably  
combined on account of their resemblance in the closing pādas. But there  
is no disagreement among the authorities with regard to the division.

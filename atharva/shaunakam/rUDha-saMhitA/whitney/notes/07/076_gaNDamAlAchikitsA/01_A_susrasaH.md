title = "०१ आ सुस्रसः"

## Translation
1. More deciduous (pl.) than the deciduous one, more non-existent than  
the non-existent ones, more sapless than the *séhu*, more dissolving  
than salt.

## Notes
Said, of course, of the *apacits*, which are distinctly mentioned in the  
next verse. The translation implies the emendation of the second  
*susrásas* to *susrástarās*, suggested by Bloomfield, as helping both  
sense and meter; Henry alters instead to *asisrasas*. The *ā́* at the  
beginning seems merely to strengthen the ablative force of the first  
*susrásas;* or we might conjecture it to be an interjection of contempt  
or disgust. The comm. understands *āsusrasas* as one word, the *ā*  
having an intensive force; he paraphrases by *pūyādisravaṇaśīlās*, as if  
*sru* were the root of the word. He reads *śehos* in **c**, and explains  
it as *viprakīrṇāvayavo ‘tyantaṁ niḥsāras tūlādirūpaḥ padārthaḥ*, which  
seems a mere guess; Henry substitutes *arasāt*. The prefixion of *ā́* to  
*séhos* would rectify the meter. Ppp. gives no help in explaining the  
verse; it reads, for **a, b**, *nāmann asaṁ svayaṁ srasann asatībhyo  
vasattarā*.

## Comment
Once more (and for the last time) we followed our first mss. and the anuvāka-endings in reckoning as one hymn what other mss., the Anukr., the comm., etc., and hence SPP., regard as two. The verses (except 2) are found scattered in different parts of Pāipp.: 1 in i.; 3-5 (as two verses) in xix.; 6 in xx. This, and not either our division or SPP's, is in accordance with the sense of the verses: 1-2 concern the apacíts, 3-5 the jāyānya; and 6 is wholly independent. The hymn (that is, doubtless, the first two verses ⌊cf. the comm., p. 45621⌋) is used ⌊with vi. 83 (apacitas) or else vii. 74 (apacitām)—see introd. to hymn 74⌋ by Kāuś. (31. 16) in a remedial ceremony against apacits; and Keś. adds vs. 1 also to ⌊the citation apacitām (which he takes to mean vii. 74. 1 and 2) made in Kāuś.⌋ 32. 8; for the use, according to Keś., of vs. 2, see under hymn 74. The third verse (the comm. says, vss. 3-5) appears also by itself in 32. 11, in a rite against rājayakṣma, with a lute-string amulet. Of vss. 5-6 (= hymn 81) there is no appearance in Kāuś.; but verse 6 is used by Vāit. (16. 14) at the noon pressure of Soma.

## Translation
5 (81. 1). We know, indeed, O *jāyā́nya*, thine origin (*jā́na*), whence,  
O *jāyā́nya*, thou art born ⌊*jā́yase*⌋; how shouldst thou smite there, in  
whose house we perform oblation?

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has only **c, d**, as second half-verse to our 4 **a, b**, and  
reads *tvaṁ hanyād yatra kuryān mahaṁ haviḥ*. ⌊We had our **d** at vi.  
5. 3 **a**—The new decad begins here: cf. p. 389.⌋

## Translation
3. He that crushes up the breast-bone (? *kī́kasās*), \[that\] descends  
to the sole (?)—the whole *jāyánya* have I cast out, also whatever one  
is set in the top.

## Notes
That is, apparently, has become seated in the head (or the prominence at  
the base of the neck behind?); Ppp. reads *kaścit kakudhi*. The obscure  
*talīdyàm* is here translated according to Bloomfield's suggestion in  
AJP. xi. 329 or JAOS. xv. p. xlvii. The comm. explains the word as  
follows: *talid ity antikanāma: antike bhavaṁ  
talīdyam:...asthisamīpagatam māṅsam:* a worthless guess; Ppp. reads  
*talābhyām*,\* which might mean 'palms' or 'soles.' For *nír ā́stam* in  
**c** was conjectured *nír-astam* in the AV. *Index*—not successfully,  
on account of the gender of *jāyānya* (m.). Ludwig proposes *nir  
āstham*, and Bloomfield ⌊l.c.⌋ does the same; this seems acceptable  
(whatever the real origin of *āstham*), and the translation follows it.  
⌊For the "root *asth*," see note to xiii. 1. 5 below.⌋ The comm.,  
however, reads *nír hās* (*hār*, from the root *hṛ:* = *nir haratu*)  
*tám*, which SPP. accepts, thinking that the comm. "has doubtless  
preserved the genuine reading" (!), and he even admits it into his text.  
The comm. further reads *prasṛṇāti* in **a**, and *cit* for *ca* in  
**d**. He calls the *jāyā́nya* a *rājayakṣma*, and also regards it as  
identical with the *jāyénya* of TS., and quotes the TS. passage (ii. 3.  
5²) that explains the origin of the latter: *yáj jāyā́bhyó ‘vindat;* he  
states it thus: *sa ca jāyāsambandhena prāpnoti*, or  
*nirantarajāyāsambhogena jāyamānam;* this might be understood as  
pointing to a venereal disease; R. conjectures gout. \*⌊in fact, R's  
Collation gives *talābhyam:* W. seems to take it as a slip for  
*-bhyām*.—Further, this is followed by *upa-*, not *ava-*.⌋

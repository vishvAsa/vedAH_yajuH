## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Further, in RV. (vi. 69. 8), TS. (iii. 2. 112 et al.), MS. (ii. 4. 4), and PB. (xx. 15. 7); AB. (vi. 15) gives a sort of comment on the verse, and a story fabricated to explain its meaning. Used in Kāuś. (42. 6) in a rite for establishing harmony (on the arrival of a distinguished visitor, Keś.). In Vāit. (25. 2), joined with hymns 58 and 51 in recitation in the atyagniṣṭoma ceremony.


## Translations
Translated: Henry, 16, 72; Griffith, i. 347.—Discussed, as RV. verse, by Muir, iv2. 84.—It seems that W. intended to rewrite this.

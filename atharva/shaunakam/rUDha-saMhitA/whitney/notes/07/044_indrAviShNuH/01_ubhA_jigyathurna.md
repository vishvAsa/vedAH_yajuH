## Translation
1. Ye have both conquered; ye are not conquered; neither one of them  
hath been conquered; O Vishṇu, Indra also, what ye fought, a  
thousand—that did ye triply disperse.

## Notes
The other texts have but a single\* variant, *enos* for *enayos* at end  
of **b**; but Ppp. has instead of this *eva vām;* and further, in **d**,  
*sahasraṁ yad adhīraethām*. Some of the *pada*-mss. (including our D.)  
divide *apa-spṛdhethām* in **c**. Henry renders **d** "ye made then  
three thousand (treasures?) to appear." The comm. renders *yat* in **c**  
by *yad vastu prati*, and makes *tredhā* refer to the three things  
(*loka, veda, vāc*) stated to be conquered in the AB. legend. TS. vii.  
1. 6⁷ views the act as a division of a thousand by three. \*⌊The accent  
*víṣṇo*, we must suppose, is a misprint (delete the sign under *ca*):  
for the other texts have *viṣṇo*, accentless, as does the *Index  
Verborum;* and so has SPP. Of his fourteen authorities, seven indeed  
give *víṣṇo*, and so does our I.—doubtless wrongly: cf. Haskell, JAOS.  
xi. 66.⌋

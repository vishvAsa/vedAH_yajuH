## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Applied by Kāuś. (6. 2), in the parvan sacrifice, with offerings in expiation of any thing spilt or overlooked in the ceremony; and later (46. 24), when a direction at the sacrifice has not been fully executed. Used also for a similar purpose in Vāit. in the agniṣṭoma (12. 5), and again later (16. 8).

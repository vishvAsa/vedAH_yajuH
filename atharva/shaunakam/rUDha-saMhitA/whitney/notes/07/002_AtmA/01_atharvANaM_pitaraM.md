## Translation
1. Father Atharvan, god-relative, mother's fœtus, father's spirit  
(*ásu*), young, who understands (*cit*) with the mind this sacrifice—him  
mayest thou proclaim to us here, here mayest thou speak.

## Notes
Ppp. has a quite different version, reading *viśvadevam* instead of  
*devabandhum* in **a**, and, for **c, d**, *ayaṁ ciketā ’mṛtasya dhāma  
nityasya rājaṣ paridhir apaśyat*. The second half-verse is the same with  
5. 5 **c, d** below. The accent of the second *ihá* seems to require  
that the sentence be divided between the two. ⌊The comm., to be sure,  
reads the second *iha* as accentless. Cf. *Gram.* §1260 **c**.⌋

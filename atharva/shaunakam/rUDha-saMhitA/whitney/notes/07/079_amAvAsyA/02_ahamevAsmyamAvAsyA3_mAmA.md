## Translation
2. I myself am Amāvāsyā; on me, in me dwell these well-doers; in me  
came together all, of both classes, the gods and the *sādhyás*, with  
Indra as chief (*jyéṣṭa*).

## Notes
The Petersburg Lexicon\* suggests the plausible emendation of *mā́m ā́* to  
*amā́* at beginning of **b**: if it is not rather *ā́ mā vasanti* intended  
as a play on *amāvāsyā̀*. For the *sādhyas*, see note to vii. 5. 1. The  
Anukr. overlooks the irregularity of **a**. \*⌊vi. 832.⌋

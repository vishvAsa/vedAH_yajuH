## Translation
1. Whoever seeks to harm us in secret, whoever us openly—us, O Agni, one  
of our people, knowingly, or a stranger—to meet them let the toothed  
*áraṇī* go; let there be of them no abode (*vā́stu*), O Agni, nor  
offspring.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. explains *araṇī* as *ārtikāriṇī rākṣasī* 'a pain-causing  
she-demon'; by its form it should be a fem. to *áraṇa* 'strange.' Again  
(as at iv. 16. 1) SPP. unaccountably reads (with the comm., who explains  
it as an *antarhitanāman*) in **a** *nas tāyát* (instead of *na  
stāyát*), and in *pada*-text *tāyát*, although every known *pada*-ms.  
⌊begins the word with *s-* and⌋ *stāyát* alone has etymological  
justification. Some of the *saṁhitā*-mss. (including our W.I.) read *āví  
sv-* in **a-b**. The mss. also vary between *tā́n* and *tā́m* (our Bp. and  
all our *saṁhitā*-mss. have the latter; both editions give the former).  
⌊One does not easily see how the Anukr. justifies its definition.⌋

## Translation
1. The kine have sat in their seat; the bird has flown to its nest; the  
mountains have stood in their site; I have made the (two) kidneys stand  
in their station.

## Notes
Instead of the unsatisfactory and questionable\* *vṛkkāú*, the comm.  
reads *vṛkāu*, and understands it to mean "the he-wolf and the  
she-wolf"; they are to be made to stay in an enemy's house. He also  
reads in **c** a *sthāne*, regarding *ā* as prefix to *asthuḥ*. SPP.  
combines again (cf. 95. 3 **d**) in his text, with the minority of his  
authorities, *asthuḥ sth-*. *Atiṣṭhipan* at the end in our text is a  
misprint for *-pam*. Ppp. appears to read *avīvamam* instead. The second  
half-verse is nearly identical with vi. 77. 1 **c, d**. ⌊Bp. has  
*vṛkvāú;* O., *vṛkvā́v;* E. and SPP's D., *vṛkā́v:* this last is, to be  
sure, not *vṛ́kāu* 'wolves.' But has not the phraseology of vs. 2 of the  
preceding hymn (*atiṣṭhipaṁ vṛ́kāu*) something to do with the placing of  
this one here?⌋

## Translation
2. Walk (*kram*) ye (two) together; leave not the body; let thy breath  
and expiration be here allies; live thou increasing a hundred autumns;  
\[be\] Agni thy best over-ruling shepherd.

## Notes
Ppp. makes the second halves of this verse and of 4 exchange places, and  
in place of **c, d** reads *saṁrabhya jīva śaradas suvarcā ’gniṣ* etc.  
The change from 2d pers. in **a** to third in **b** is sudden beyond the  
usual liberal measure. ⌊In the Berlin ed., an accent-sign is missing  
under the *śa* of *śatám*.⌋

## Translation
3. Thy life-time that is set over at a distance—\[thy\] expiration,  
breath, let them come again—Agni hath taken that from the lap of  
perdition; that I cause to enter again in thy self.

## Notes
With **a, b** compare the similar half-verse xviii. 2. 26 **a, b**. The  
comm. explains *átihitam* as from either of the roots *hi* or *dhā*.  
Ppp. begins differently: *yat tā ”yur;* in **b** it reads *prāṇo yūva te  
paretaḥ;* and it leaves off *te* at the end. Prāt. ii. 46 notes *ā ’hār*  
in **c** ⌊render it rather 'brought hither or back'?⌋.

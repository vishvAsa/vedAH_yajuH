## Translation
1. The breast of thine that is unfailing (?), that is kindly, that is  
favorable, easy of invocation, that is very liberal, with which thou  
gainest (? *puṣ*) all desirable things—O Sarasvatī, mayest thou cause  
\[us\] to suck that here.

## Notes
RV. reads in **a** *śaśayás;* and in **b** (its **c**) *ratnadhā́  
vasuvíd* (for *sumnayúḥ suhávo*). TA.MS. agree in all respects with  
RV.,\* save that TA. has absurdly *víśvāḥ* in **c** (its b). VS. and śB.  
have the RV. readings,\* but our order of the pādas. The comm. reads  
*śiśayus* in **a**, explaining it as either 'causing the prosperity of  
\[its\] young (*śiśu*)' or 'hidden (*nigūḍha*).' ⌊In **d**, Henry  
understands the "child" rather than "us."⌋ \*⌊VS.śB.TA. have *akar*,  
combined (*dhā́tave*) *‘kaḥ;* but the comm. to each of these texts  
renders it by *kuru*.⌋

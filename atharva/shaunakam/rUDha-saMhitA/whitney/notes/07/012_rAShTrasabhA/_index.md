## Comment
The first two verses are found in Pāipp. xx. Kāuś. (38. 27) uses it, with v. 3 and other hymns, in a ceremony for gaining the victory in debate, or in the deliberations of an assembly (the comm. describes it repeatedly as "of five verses," apparently including in its uses 13. 1). *⌊The London ms. reads dvidevatyāuta pitryā; the Berlin ms., -tyāutatpitryā.⌋

## Translation
1. Let both assembly (*sabhā́*) and gathering (*sámiti*), the two  
daughters of Prajāpati, accordant, favor me; with whom I shall come  
together, may he desire to aid (? *upa-śikṣ*) me; may I speak what is  
pleasant among those who have come together, O Fathers.

## Notes
Ppp's version of **c, d** is very different: *yena vadāṁ upa mā sa  
tiṣṭhā ’ntar vadāmi hṛdaye janānām*. The verse is also found in PGS.  
(iii. 13. 3), with much variation: *ubhe* for *avatām* in **a**,  
*sacetasāu* for *samvidāne* in **b**; and, for **c, d**, *yo mā na  
vidyād* *upa mā sa tiṣṭhet sacetano bhavatu śaṅsathe janaḥ*. The comm.  
explains *upa śikṣāt* as either *upetya śikṣayatu: samīcīnaṁ vādayatu*  
or *māṁ vaktuṁ śaktaṁ samartham icchatu*. He reads *vadāmi* in **d**.  
Henry renders *upa-śikṣ* by "pay homage," and emends *pitaras* to  
*nṛṣu*. The meter is irregular.

## Comment
Notwithstanding the close relationship of the two verses reckoned in our edition as constituting this hymn, and their discordance with the following verse (our 55), the Anukr. and some of the mss. (and hence the comm. and SPP's text) take our vs. 1 as a whole hymn, and our vs. 2 and hymn 55 as together one hymn; and this is probably to be accepted as the true traditional division.* Pāipp. has our two verses in xx., but in different places. Kāuś. (42. 9-10), in a rite for the gaining of wealth by teachers (adhyāpakānām arthārjanavighnaśamanārtham, comm., p. 402, end), gives as pratīka simply ṛcaṁ sāma, which would imply either or both verses; Dārila explains dvābhyām 'with two,' which might mean either hymns or verses. The comm. ⌊p. 41011⌋ appears to regard vs. 2 (57. 1) as intended in rule 9, and both vs. 1 and vs. 2 (56 and 57) in rule 10. *⌊The decad-division comes between vss. 1 and 2: cf. p. 389.⌋

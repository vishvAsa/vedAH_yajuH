## Translation
1. O Soma-and-Rudra, eject asunder the disease that has entered our  
household; drive far to a distance perdition; any committed sin put away  
from us.

## Notes
The first three pādas occur in RV. vi. 74. 2 (**a, b, c**) and MS. iv.  
11. 2, and the last two (repeating **c**) in RV. i. 24. 9 and MS. i. 3.  
39; TS. i. 8. 22⁵ has the whole verse. At beginning of **c**, all  
(RV.MS. in the former occurrence) have *āre bādhethām*, omitting *dūrám*  
(in the latter occurrence, RV. *bā́dhasva dūre*, MS. *āré bādhasva;* both  
*mumugdhi* in **d**). Ppp. reads, in **c**, *dveṣo nirṛtiṁ ca*, and in  
**d** *asmāt*. The comm. explains *gayam* as *gṛhaṁ śarīraṁ vā*. ⌊We had  
**c, d** also above at vi. 97. 2; see also TS. i. 4. 45¹, which has  
*dvéṣo* like Ppp.⌋

## Translation
1. O rough one! thou of rough creepers! cut up yon woman, O rough  
one!—that thou mayest be hateful (?) to yon man of virile power.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *triṣṭ-* everywhere, and *triṣṭinandanā;* and its second  
half-verse is: *adhāgṛdṛṣṭayadyamas tam asmāi śepyāvataḥ*. The comm.  
gives, as one of his suggested synonyms for *tṛṣṭikā, dāhajanikā* or  
*bāṇāparṇyākhyāuṣadhi;* *vandanas* ⌊cf. below, 115. 2⌋ are, according to  
him, *latānāṁ vṛkṣānāṁ co ¥pari prarūḍhās tadīyaśākhām āveṣṭamānā  
vibhinnaparṇalatāviśeṣāḥ*. *Kṛtádviṣṭā* in **c** is literally 'having  
done what is hated' (*dveṣakāriṇī*, comm.). The second half-verse is  
plainly addressed to the rival. There is considerable discordance among  
the mss. in regard to the concluding word, *śeyyā-*, *śeṣyā-*, *śaṣyā-*  
being the variants, but evidently only inaccuracies of copyists; the  
comm. explains the word as = *prajananasāmarthyavate*. The verse is a  
good *anuṣṭubh*, not *virāj*.

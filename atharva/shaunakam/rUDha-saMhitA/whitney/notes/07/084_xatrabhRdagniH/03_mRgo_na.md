## Translation
3. Like a fearful wild beast, wandering, mountain-staying, from distant  
distance may he come hither; sharpening, O Indra, \[thy\] missile (?  
*sṛká*), \[thy\] keen rim, smite away the foes, push away the scorners.

## Notes
The first half-verse was read above as 26. 2 **b, c**. The verse is RV.  
x. 180. 2, TS. i. 6. 12⁴ (as noted under the preceding verse), and also  
SV. ii. 1223, MS. iv. 12. 3, VS. xviii. 71; their only variant is at  
*jagamyāt* in **b**, for which TS. has *jagāmā*, and all the rest  
*jaganthā*. The comm. takes *sṛka* as an adj., = *saraṇaśīla*. ⌊Cf.  
Knauer's *Index* to MGS., p. 153.⌋ ⌊For use by Kāuś., see under vs. 2.⌋  
Vāit. (29. 5) uses the verse in the *agnicayana*, in the covering of the  
first layers.

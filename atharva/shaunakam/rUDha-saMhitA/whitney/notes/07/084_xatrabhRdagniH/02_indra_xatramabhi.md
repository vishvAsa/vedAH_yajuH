## Translation
2. O Indra, unto dominion, \[unto\] pleasant force, wast thou born, thou  
bull of men (*carṣaṇí*); thou didst push away the inimical people; thou  
didst make wide room for the gods.

## Notes
This verse and the next are two verses, connected (but in inverted  
order), in RV. (x. 180. 3, 2), found also in TS. i. 6. 12⁴. Both these  
read in **c** *amitrayántam*, their only variant in this verse. In **d**  
*carṣaṇīnā́m* is most naturally made dependent on *vṛṣabha*, although, as  
such, it ought to be without accent; Henry takes it as governed by the  
nouns in **a**. The verse (doubtless with vs. 3) is used by Kāuś. (17.  
31) in the consecration of a king ⌊Weber, *Rājasūya*, p. 142⌋, and (140.  
17) in the *indramahotsava*, with libation to Indra, and service of  
Brahmans. ⌊RV.TS. accent *carṣaṇinā́m* and all of W's and SPP's mss. seem  
to do so. Perhaps, in spite of W's version, we have no right to correct  
our text by deleting the accent; but the accent can hardly be aught else  
than an old blunder.⌋

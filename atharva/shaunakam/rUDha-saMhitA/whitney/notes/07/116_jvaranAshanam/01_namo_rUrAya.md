## Translation
1. Homage to the hot, stirring, pushing, bold one; homage to the cold,  
former-desire-performing one.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The last epithet is extremely obscure and probably corrupt; the comm.  
makes *kṛtvan* from the root *kṛt*, and explains it as "cutting up or  
deferring the fruition of previous wishes"; Henry says "doing its will  
of old." Again SPP. changes the *códanāya* of five-sixths of his  
authorities and all of ours to *nódanāya*, because the comm. has the  
latter. The verse (9 + 7: 12 = 28) is no *uṣṇih* except in the sum of  
syllables.

## Translation
3 (71. 1). Be thou propitious, most wealful to us, very gracious, O  
Sarasvatī; let us not be separated from sight of thee.

## Notes
The verse occurs in TA. iv. 42. 1 and AA. i. 1. 1, with the variant, for  
**c**, *mā́ te vyòma saṁdṛ́śi;* and LśS. v. 3. 2 has the same, but with  
*saṁdaśas* (misprint for *-dṛś-*?) at the end. In i. 1. 3, TA. has  
another version, with the same ending, but with *bhava* in **a**  
expanded to *bhavantu divyā́ ā́pa óṣadhayaḥ*. ⌊Cf. also *Kaṭha-hss.*, p.  
115; MGS. i. 11. 18 and p. 156 under *sakhā*.⌋

## Comment
None of the verses are found in Pāipp. Here again the Anukr., the comm., and some mss. differ in division from our first mss., and make our third verse a separate hymn.* In Kāuś. (81. 39) the first two verses (= hymn 70) come in with other Sarasvatī verses in the pitṛmedha; the third verse (= hymn 71) not with them, in spite of its kindred character, but in both the bṛhat and laghuśānti gaṇas (9. 2, 4). Vāit. introduces the hymn (doubtless the two verses) twice (8. 2, 13), once with hymn 40, once with hymn 9 and other verses, in praise of Sarasvatī. *⌊So also SPP's text. The decad-division cuts the hymn between vss. 2 and 3: cf. p. 389.⌋

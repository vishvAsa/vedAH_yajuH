## Translation
1. I bridle (*abhi-dhā*) thee with my Manu-born garment, that thou  
mayest be wholly mine, mayest not make mention of other women.

## Notes
The comm. explains *manu-* alternatively by *mantreṇa*, and takes  
*kīrtayās* as = *uccares;* and he supplies *nāmadheyam* as the latter's  
direct object, governing *anyāsām*. "Manu-born" is a strange epithet for  
a garment; perhaps the woman's embrace is intended, or her hair—if this  
be not too poetic. The second half-verse is nearly identical with 38. 4  
**c, d**.

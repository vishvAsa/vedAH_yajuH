## Translation
1. What here the black bird, flying out upon \[it\], has made fall—let  
the waters protect me from all that difficulty, from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. reads thus: *yad asmān kṛṣṇaśakunir niṣpatann ānaśe: ā. m. t. enaso  
d. p. viśvataḥ*. The second half occurs also in LśS. ii. 2. 11, which  
(like Ppp.) has *viśvataḥ* at the end.\* Prāt. iv. 77 appears to require  
as *pada*-reading in **b** *abhi-niḥpátan;* but all the *pada*-mss. give  
*-niṣp-*, and SPP. also adopts that in his *pada*-text: *abhinipatan*  
would be a decidedly preferable reading. The second half-verse is found  
again as x. 5. 22 **c, d**. The comm. says that the bird is a crow.  
\*⌊And *enaso* in **c**.⌋

## Translation
1. I loosen off thy strap, off thy harness, off thy halter; be thou just  
here, unfailing, O Agni.

## Notes
TS. (i. 6.4³) and MS. (i. 4. 1) have a verse corresponding to the first  
part of this and the second half of the next following verse: the first  
half reads thus: *ví te muñcāmi raśanā́* (MS. *-nāṁ*) *ví raśmī́n ví  
yóktrā yā́ni paricártanāni* (MS. *yóktrāṇi par-*). ⌊Cf. MGS. i. 11. 23,  
and p. 155.⌋ Ppp. combines *ajasre ’dhi* in **c**. The comm. gives a  
double explanation, regarding the verse as addressed either to Agni or  
to one vexed with disease; and he adds at the end that the sacrificer's  
wife may also be regarded as addressed. The commentary to TS. views the  
sticks of *paridhi* as intended by the harness etc.

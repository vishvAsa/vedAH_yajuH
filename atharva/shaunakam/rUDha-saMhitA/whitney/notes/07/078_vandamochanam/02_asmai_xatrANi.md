## Translation
2. Thee, O Agni, maintaining dominions for this man, I harness (*yuj*)  
with the incantation of the gods; shine thou unto us here excellent  
property; mayest thou proclaim this man as oblation-giver among the  
deities.

## Notes
The second half-verse is given quite differently by TS. and MS. (as  
above): thus, *dhattā́d asmā́su* (MS. *asmábhyaṁ*) *dráviṇaṁ yác ca* (MS.  
*dráviṇe ’há*) *bhadrám prá ṇo* (MS. *mā*) *brūtād bhāgadhā́n* (MS.  
*-dā́ṁ*) *devátāsu*. Ppp. makes **a** and **b** change places. The  
*pada*-text analyzes in **c** *dráviṇā: ihá*, but probably the original  
value was *-viṇam*, and this the translation assumes.

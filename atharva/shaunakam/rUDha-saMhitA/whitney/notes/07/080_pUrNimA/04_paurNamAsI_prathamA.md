## Translation
4. She of the full moon was the first worshipful one in the depths (?)  
of days, of nights. They who, O worshipful one, gratify (*ardháya-*)  
thee with offerings, those well-doers are entered into thy firmament.

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** the reading *te*, given in our edition  
on the authority of part of our mss. (Bp.P.M.T.K.\*) and as decidedly  
better suiting the requirements of the sense ⌊than *té*⌋(a combination  
of *amī́ té* is hardly possible); SPP. reads *té*, with the great  
majority of his authorities. Ppp. has *uta śarvareṣu* for *atiś-* in  
**b**, and, in **d**, *nākaṁ sukṛtaṣ paretāḥ*. The comm. gives  
*ardayanti* in **c**. He explains *atiśarvarāṇi* to mean either *rātrim  
atītya vartamāneṣu somādihaviṣṣu* or else *tṛtīyasavanavyāpiṣu haviṣṣu:*  
thus akin in meaning with *atirātra;* and this is perhaps right. \*⌊I  
find no note of P.M.⌋

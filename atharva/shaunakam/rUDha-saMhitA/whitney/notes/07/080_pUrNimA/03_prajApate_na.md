## Translation
3. O Prajāpati, no other than thou, encompassing, gave birth to all  
these forms; what desiring we make libation to thee, be that ours; may  
we be lords of wealth.

## Notes
⌊Cf. vii. 79. 4.⌋ This verse is RV. x. 121. 10, and is repeated in  
various other collections: VS. (x. 20 et al.), TS. (i. 8. 14² et al.),  
TB. (ii. 8. 1³ et al.), MS. (ii. 6. 12; iv. 14. 1), MB. (ii. 5. 9). ⌊Cf.  
MP. ii. 22. 19.⌋ RV. reads, for **b**, *víśvā jātā́ni pári tā́ babhūva;*  
and TS.TB.MB. agree with it throughout; VS. differs by giving, with our  
text, *rūpā́ṇi;* MS. is more independent, having in the second occurrence  
*nahí tvát tā́ni* (for *ná tvád etā́ni*) in **a**, and in both occurrences  
*yásmāi káṁ* (for *yátkāmās te*) in **c**. The verse is variously  
employed by the *sūtras:* in Kāuś., in the *parvan* sacrifice (5. 9), by  
addition to iv. 39; and by special mention, beside vs. 1, with h. 17  
etc. (59. 19: see under 17); while it is added by a schol. to the  
ceremony of acceptance (56. 2, note) of a staff by the Vedic student;—in  
Vāit. (1. 3) as an introductory formula prescribed by Yuvan Kāuśika ⌊cf.  
note to Kāuś. i. 6⌋; also (2. 12), in the *parvan* sacrifice, with an  
offering of fat to Prajāpati; and it is to be had in mind (7. 12) as  
accompanying an offering in the *agnihotra*. The comm. quotes it further  
from the Nakṣatra Kalpa (18), as used in a *mahāśānti* called  
*mārudgaṇī*.

## Translation
2. Unite me, O Agni, with splendor, with progeny, with life-time; may  
the gods know me as such; may Indra know, together with the seers  
(*ṛ́ṣi*).

## Notes
The verse is repeated below as ix. i. 15 and x. 5. 47. It is RV. i. 23.  
24; RV. reads, in **c**, *asya* unaccented, as the comm. also defines  
our word to be; and one or two of our mss. (Bp.K.R.s.m.) so give it. The  
comm. explains *me asya* by *enam mām* (supplying *pūtam*), or,  
alternatively, *etādṛśasya me* (supplying *abhimataphalaṁ sādhayitum*).  
Ppp. reads, for **b**, *prajayā ca bahuṁ kṛdhi*, and combines in **d**  
*saharṣ-*. ⌊Perhaps the Anukr. scans **c, d** as 7 + 9.⌋

## Translation
1. The heavenly waters have I honored (*cāy*); with sap have we been  
mingled; with milk, O Agni, have I come; me here unite with splendor.

## Notes
The verse is, with differences, RV. i. 23. 23, and is found also in VS.  
(xx. 22), TS. (i. 4. 453), MS. (i. 3. 39), JB. (ii. 68), LśS. (ii. 12.  
13). RV. has, for **a**, *ā́po adyā́ ’nv acārisam;* the others nearly the  
same ⌊see also note to vs. 4, below⌋, only all give the more regular  
grammatical form *apás*, and TS. omits *adyá*, while JB. reads  
*acārṣam;* in **b**, RV. has at end *agasmahi*, LśS. *aganmahi*,  
VS.TS.MS. *asṛkṣmahi;* in **c**, TS. combines *páyasvāṅ ag-*, and RV.  
reads *gahi* for *agamam;* VS. adds a fifth pāda. The verse is repeated  
as x. 5. 46, and its second half is the last part of ix. 1. 14. Ppp.  
agrees in a with RV., and has *aganmahi* in **b**. The comm. glosses  
*acāyiṣam* with *pūjayāmi*.

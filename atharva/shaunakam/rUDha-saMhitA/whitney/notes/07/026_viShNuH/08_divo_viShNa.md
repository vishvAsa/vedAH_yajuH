## Translation
8. From the sky, O Vishṇu, or also from the earth; from the great wide  
atmosphere, O Vishṇu, fill thy hands abundantly with good things; reach  
forth hither from the right, hither also from the left.

## Notes
The verse is found also in VS. (v. 19), TS. (i. 2. 13²), and MS. (i. 2.  
9). VS.TS. insert *vā* after *divás* in **a** and *mahás* in **b**, and  
TS. reads *utá vā* for *urós* in **b**, while MS. has, for **b**, *urór  
vā viṣṇo bṛható antárikṣāt;* TS. combines both times *viṣṇav u-*; VS.  
has, for **c**, *ubhā́ hí hástā vásunā pṛṇásva;* TS.MS. accent  
*vasavyāìs*, which is decidedly more regular (but SV. i. 298 has  
*vasávye*); and all three accent *ā́ prá y-*, which is also more in  
accordance with usage (our *pada*-text *ā॰práyacha*). The first two  
pādas are of 10 syllables each; ⌊but the *vā*'s of VS.TS. make them good  
*triṣṭubh*⌋.

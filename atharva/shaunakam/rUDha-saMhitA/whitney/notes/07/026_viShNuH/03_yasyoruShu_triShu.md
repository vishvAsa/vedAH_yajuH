## Translation
3. Upon whose three wide out-stridings dwell all beings.

## Notes
Widely, O Vishnu, stride out; widely make us to dwell; drink the ghee, O  
thou ghee-wombed one; prolong the master of the sacrifice on and on.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Made up of the second half of a RV. etc. *triṣṭubh* verse (see above: no  
text shows in this half any various readings) and a whole *anuṣṭubh*  
verse, which also is found in a number of other texts (VS. v. 38; TS. 1.  
3. 4¹; MS. 1. 2. 13; ĀśS. v. 19. 3; śśS. viii. 4. 3), and almost without  
variants (only TS. combines *naḥ kṛdhi* in **b**, and MS. reads  
*ghṛtavane* in **c**). ⌊Ppp. ends with **b** (*víśvā*)⌋

## Translation
6. Behold ye the deeds of Vishṇu, from where he beholds \[your\] courses  
(*vratá*), \[he\] Indra's suitable companion.

## Notes
Or *yátas* in **b** may mean simply 'as.' Not only RV.SV., but also the  
other texts containing this verse (VS. vi. 4 et al.; TS. 1. 3. 6²; MS.  
i. 2. 14), have the same readings with ours. The comm. explains  
*paspaśe* as *spṛśati badhnāti vā!*  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The comm. strangely\* closes the hymn here, and treats its last two  
verses as ⌊belonging to the next: see p. 389⌋. \*⌊Because he has got to  
the end of his "spoiled decad"?⌋

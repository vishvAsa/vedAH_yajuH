## Comment
Verse 1 found also in Pāipp. xix.* In Kāuç. (48. 35, 36) the hymn is used in a rite of sorcery, against enemies; with the second verse the user goes and looks at them. The mention of the pratīka in the edition of Kāuç. as contained in 58. 11 appears to be an error. On the other hand, the comm. regards this hymn as intended in Kāuç. 39. 26 (not x. 1. 32, as in the edition), in a rite against sorcery. The comm. further quotes the pratīka from the Nakṣatra ⌊error for Çānti, Bl.⌋ Kalpa 15, in a rite against nirṛti. *⌊If I understand Roth's note, Ppp. has vs. 1 without variant, and for vs. 2 what is reported below.⌋

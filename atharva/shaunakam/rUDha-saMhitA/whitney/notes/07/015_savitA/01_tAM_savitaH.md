## Translation
1. This favor, O Savitar, of true impulse, very wondrous, having all  
choice things, do I choose for myself; which of him, full-fed,  
thousand-streamed, Kaṇva the bull (*mahiṣā*) milked for Bhaga.

## Notes
Or (at the end) 'for a portion,' as the comm. understands it  
(*bhāgyāya*). The reading (alike in all) of the other texts is very  
different: for **a**, *tā́ṁ savitúr váreṇyasya citrā́m;* in **b**,  
*viśvájanyām* at end; in **d** (for *mah-* etc.) *páyasā mahī́ṁ gā́m*.  
This gives a decidedly more intelligible meaning. Ppp. is still  
different: in **a**, *satyasavasya citrām;* for **b**, *vayaṁ devasya  
prasave manāmahe;* and, in **c**, *prapīnāṁ*.

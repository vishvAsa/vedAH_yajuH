## Translation
1. What Kshatriya, seeking betterment, shall lead us up out of this  
reproachful hate—who that desires sacrifice, or who that desires  
bestowal? who wins long life-time among the gods?

## Notes
This is apparently the appeal of a Brahman seeking employment (so Ludwig  
also). The comm. (also Ppp.) reads *vanate* in **d**; he gives  
alternative conjectural explanations, and tries, of course, on account  
of the repeated *ka*, to bring the verse into connection with Prajāpati  
(Ka). Ppp. further has *no ‘syā* in **a**, and *kaṣ pūr. ko yaj.* in  
**c**.

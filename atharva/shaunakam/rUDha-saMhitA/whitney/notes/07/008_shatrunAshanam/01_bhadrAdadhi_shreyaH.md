## Translation
1. Go thou forth from what is excellent to what is better; be Brihaspati  
thy forerunner. Then do thou make this man, on the width of this earth,  
remote from foes, with all his heroes.

## Notes
Literally (**d**) 'having his foes at a distance, having his heroes  
whole.' The verse occurs also in TS. (i. 2. 3³), śśS. (v. 6. 2), and  
AśS. (iv. 4. 2), with *abhí* for *ádhi* in **a**, and, as **c, d**,  
*áthe ’m áva sya vára ā́ pṛthivyā́ āré śátrūn kṛṇuhi sárvavīraḥ;* and its  
pratīka (with *abhi*) in KB. (vii. 10), and Āp. (x. 19. 8); and compare  
MB. ii. 1. 13. The comm. takes *āre* and *śatrum* as two independent  
words. Ppp. shows no variants. The first pāda lacks three syllables of  
being *triṣṭubh*.

## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. (as part of our hymn vi. 37). This verse has the same pratīka as vi. 37. 3; but the comm. ⌊on vi. 37, page 70, line 2⌋, doubtless with reason, regards vi. 37. 3 as intended at Kāuç. 48. 37 ⌊Bloomfield there gives both⌋; this hymn, then, is left without ritual use. ⌊In fact, the comm. on this hymn, at p. 418, line 4, does cite yo naḥ çapāt for use in the same rite for which he cited it in his comment on vi. 37.⌋

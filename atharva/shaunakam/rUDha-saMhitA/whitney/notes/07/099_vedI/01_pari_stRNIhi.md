## Translation
1. Strew thou around, enclose the sacrificial hearth (*védi*) do not rob  
the sister lying down yonder; the *hótar's* seat \[is\] yellow, golden;  
those \[are\] jewels (*niṣká*) in the sacrificer's world.

## Notes
The comm. regards the bunch of *darbha* grass as addressed. Ludwig  
conjectures the 'sister' to be the *uttaravedi;* and Henry also  
understands the same; it is perhaps rather the grass that lies about;  
the comm. gives several diverse guesses. A corresponding verse is found  
in TB. iii. 7. 5¹³ and Āp. iii. 13. 5: they read *abhí* for *pári* at  
beginning of **a**; *jāmím mā́ hiṅsir amuyā́ śáyānā* for **b**; *-danā  
háritāḥ suvárṇāḥ* in **c**, and, in **d**, *imé* for *eté* and *bradhné*  
for *loké*.

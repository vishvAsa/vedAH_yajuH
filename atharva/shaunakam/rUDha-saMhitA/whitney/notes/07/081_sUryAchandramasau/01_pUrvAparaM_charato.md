## Translation
1. These two move on one after the other by magic (*māyā́*); two playing  
young ones (*śíśu*), they go about the sea; the one looks abroad upon  
all beings; thou, the other, disposing the seasons art born new.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Said of the sun and moon. This and the next following verse are RV. x.  
85. 18, 19, and are also found in MS. iv. 12. 2; this one, further, in  
TB. ii. 7. 12² (repeated in ii. 8. 93): all read *adhvarám* (for  
*‘rṇavám*) at end of **b**; they have, for **c**, *víśvāny anyó bhúvanā  
’bhi-* (but MS. *vi-*) *cáṣṭe*, and, at end of **d**, *jāyate* (the  
comm. also has *jāyate*) *púnaḥ;* and TB. combines *ṛtū́n an-*. Repeated  
below as xiv. i. 23 and (**a, b, c**) xiii. 2. 11 ⌊on the latter verse  
Henry has an elaborate comment, *Les Hymnes Rohitas*, p. 38-40⌋. ⌊As for  
the thrice occurring haplography, *víśvānyó* for *víśvānyanyó*, cf. iv.  
5. 5, note.⌋ Too irregular (11 + 12: 9 + 12 = 44) to be passed simply as  
*triṣṭubh*. ⌊The other texts suggest the true rectification of the meter  
of **c**.⌋

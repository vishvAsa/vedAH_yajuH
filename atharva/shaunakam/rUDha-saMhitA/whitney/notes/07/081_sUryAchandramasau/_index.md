## Comment
⌊Partly prose—4 and 5.⌋ Wanting in Pāipp. The verses of this hymn are by Bloomfield regarded as intended by the name dārśībhis, and so directed by Kāuś. (24. 18) to be used ⌊to accompany the worship of the darśa (see vs. 3 and note)⌋; Keś. also says that some mutter the hymn at new moon on first sight of the moon, for the sake of prosperity: and this seems to be the true value of the hymn; but the comm. does not acknowledge it. The comm. regards vss. 1 and 2 as intended to be quoted at Kāuś. 75. 6, in the nuptial ceremonies, with xiv. 1. 1, but the verse intended must be rather xiv. 1. 23, as marked in the edition. The comm. further quotes a use of vss. 3-6 from the Nakṣatra Kalpa (15), in a planet-sacrifice, with an offering to Mercury (budha).

## Translation
5. He who hateth us, whom we hate—with his breath do thou fill thyself  
up; may we fill ourselves up with kine, with horses, with progeny, with  
cattle, with houses, with riches.

## Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The mss. read in **c** *pyāśiṣīmahi*, which SPP. accordingly  
adopts in his text, although it is an obvious and palpable misreading  
for *pyāsiṣīmahi* (which the comm. gives); *pyāsiṣīmahi* is found in  
many texts (VS.TA.śśS.śGS.HGS.), but also *pyāyiṣīmahi* (as *iṣ*-aorist  
from the secondary root-form *pyāy*) in ĀpśS. (iii. 4. 6). It is by an  
error that our printed text has *pyāyiṣ-* ⌊instead oi *pyāsiṣ-*: see  
*Gram.* §914 b⌋. These two prose "verses" are very ill described by the  
Anukr.

## Translation
1. Fly forth from here, O evil sign (*lakṣmī́*); disappear from here; fly  
forth from yonder; with a hook of metal (*ayasmáya*) we attach thee to  
him that hates \[us\].

## Notes
Ppp. reads in **a** *pāpa-* for *pāpi*, and, for **d**, *ya dviṣmas  
tasmin tvā sajjāmaḥ*. The comm. has at the end *sacāmasi*. He  
paraphrases *pāpi lakṣmi* by *pāparūpiṇy alakṣmi;* it might be rendered  
also by 'luck' or 'fortune'; the expression is found also in MB. i. 4.  
1, 5.

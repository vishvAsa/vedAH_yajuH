## Translation
2. The unenjoyable flying sign that hath mounted me, as a creeper a  
tree—that, O Savitar, mayest thou put hence elsewhere than on us, being  
golden-handed, granting good to us.

## Notes
Ppp. offers no variants. SPP. reports his *pada*-mss. as reading in  
**a** *pataya: lū́* or *pataya: lū́ḥ*, which is very strange, as ours have  
the true reading, *patayālū́ḥ*. All the pada-mss. give in **b**  
*vándanaḥ॰iva*, and Prāt. ii. 56 expressly recognizes this and  
prescribes the irregular combination to *vándane ’va;* but SPP., on the  
sole authority of the commentator, alters his *pada*-text to  
*vándanā॰iva!* The comm. explains *vandanā* simply as *latāviśeṣa*, and  
refers back to 113. 1 as another instance of the use of the word;  
*patayālūs* he paraphrases with *pātayitrī dāurgatyakāriṇī*.

## Translation
1. Both with one and with ten, O easily-invoked one (masc.); with two  
and with twenty, for \[our\] wish; both with three and with thirty  
separately yoked ones drivest thou, O Vayu—those do thou here release.

## Notes
All the other texts read *svabhūte* at end of **a**, and *niyúdbhis* at  
beginning of **d** (the Pet. Lex. proposes the latter by emendation  
here); VS.śB.śśS. have *viṇśatī́* for *viṅśatyā́* in **b**, and (as also  
AśS.) combine *vāyav ihá* in **d**. SPP. strangely reads *suhute* in  
**a**, against the meter, and against the great majority of his  
authorities, but with the comm. (who, however, explains it as if it were  
*suhūte*). The comm. explains *iṣṭáye* by *yāgāya*, then again by  
*icchāyāi;* Henry translates "for conquest." Ppp. has, corruptly, *cā  
bhūte* (probably intending the reading of the other texts); in **d** it  
gives *viyudbhir vāyuv iha tā vi m-*. The second pāda is only by  
violence *triṣṭubh*. ⌊"One," "three," and "those" are fem.: the comm.  
supplies "mares."⌋ ⌊Perhaps the force of the accent of *váhase* is, "If  
thou drivest with 11 or 22 or 33 (no matter how many),—here release thou  
them." See *Gram.* §595 d.⌋

## Translation
1. Let Anumati ('approval') approve ⌊*anu-man*⌋ today our sacrifice  
among the gods; and let Agni be oblation-carrier of me worshiping.

## Notes
Ppp's only variant is *yachatām* for *manyatām* at end of **b**. The  
verse is found in various other texts: VS. (xxxiv. 9), TS. (iii. 3.  
11³), MS. (iii. 16. 4), AśS. (iv. 12. 2), and śśS. (ix. 27. 2). In  
**a**, MS.śśS. preserve the *a* after *no;* the others put *no* before  
*adyá* (*‘dyá*); in **d**, all save TS. change *bhávatām* to *-tam*, and  
all have *máyaḥ* for *máma*. MB. (ii. 2. 19) also has *mayas*, but in  
**a** *iyam* for *adya*, and in **d** *sa no ‘dād dāś-*. The translation  
given implies emendation in **d** to *dāśúṣas;* the comm. regards it as  
a case of substitution of dative for genitive. The comm. takes  
*bhávatām* as 3d sing, middle; but it may perhaps better be viewed (like  
the *-tam* of the other texts) as dual active, with *anumati* and *agni*  
together as subject; the corruption of *máyas* to *máma* has rather  
spoiled the whole construction. The comm. explains Anumati as intending  
here also, as elsewhere, the goddess of the day of full moon; there is  
nothing in the hymn that demands or implies that character.

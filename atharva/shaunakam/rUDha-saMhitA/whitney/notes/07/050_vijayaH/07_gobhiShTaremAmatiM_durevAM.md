## Translation
7. By kine may we pass over ill-conditioned misery, or by barley over  
hunger, O much-invoked one, all of us; may we first among kings,  
unharmed, win riches by \[our\] stratagems.

## Notes
Or perhaps 'unharmed by \[others'\] stratagems.' The verse has no reason  
here; it is RV. x. 42. 10, with variants: RV. omits the meter-disturbing  
*vā* in **b** (the Anukr. ignores the irregularity), and reads *víśvām*  
at the end of the pāda; also *rā́jabhis* in **c**, and, in **d**,  
*asmā́kena vṛjánenā*. Ppp. has, for **c**, *vayaṁ rājānas prathamā  
dhamānām*. The comm., against the *pada*-text (*-māh;* RV. *pada* the  
same), understands *prathamā* as neut. pl., qualifying *dhanāni*. ⌊Cf.  
Geldner, *Ved. Stud.* i. 150; Foy, KZ. xxxiv. 251.⌋

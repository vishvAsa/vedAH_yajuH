## Translation
6. Also, a superior player, he wins the advance (?); he divides in time  
the winnings like a gambler; he who, a god-lover, obstructs not  
riches—him verily he unites with wealth at pleasure (?).

## Notes
The verse is full of technical gambling expressions, not understood by  
us. It is RV. x. 42. 9, with variants: RV. reads *atidī́vya jayāti* in  
**a**; in **b**, *yát* for *iva*, and hence *vicinóti;* in **c**, *dhánā  
ruṇaddhi;* in **d**, *rāyā́* (which the translation given above follows:  
the comm. reads it) and *svadhā́vān*. The comm. also has *jayāti*, as  
demanded by the meter, in **a**. He explains *prahām* by *akṣāiḥ  
prahantāram pratikitavam*, and *vi cinoti* this time by *mṛgayate*. With  
*ná dhánam ruṇáddhi* compare the gambler's vow, *ná dhánā ruṇadhmi*, in  
RV. x. 34. 12; the comm. says *dyūtalabdhaṁ dhanaṁ na vyarthaṁ  
sthāpayati kiṁ tu devatārthaṁ viniyun̄kte*. The Anukr. distinctly refuses  
the contraction to *kṛtaṁ ’va* in **b**.

## Translation
3. I praise Agni, who owns good things, with acts of homage; here,  
attached, may he divide (*vi-ci*) our winnings; I am borne forward as it  
were by booty-winning chariots; forward to the right may I further the  
praise of the Maruts.

## Notes
The verse is RV. v. 60. 1, found also in TB. (ii. 7. 12⁴) and MS. (iv.  
14. 11). All these texts give *sv-ávasam* in **a**, of which our reading  
seems an awkward corruption; in **b** they have *prasattás* (but TB.  
*prasaptás*); in **c** they accent *vājayádbhis;* in **d** they (also  
Ppp.) read *pradakṣiṇít;* at the end MS. has *aśyām*. Some of our mss.  
(Bp.R.T.) give *ṛndhyām*. The comm. explains *ví cayat* as simply =  
*karotu* ⌊*karotu* itself may be used technically; cf. *Ved. Stud.* i.  
119⌋. *Kṛtam* he understands throughout as the winning die  
(*kṛtaśabdavācyaṁ lābhahetumayam*). The verse is brought in here only on  
account of the comparison in **b**.

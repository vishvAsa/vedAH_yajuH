## Translation
1. As the thunderbolt always strikes the tree irresistibly, so may I  
today smite ⌊*badh*, *vadh*⌋ the gamblers irresistibly with the dice.

## Notes
Ppp. reads, in **b**, *viśvāhaṁ*, and, for **c**, *evā ’ham amuṁ  
kitavam*. The comm. has *vadhyāsam* in **d**. Compare vii. 109. 4,  
below. The Anukr. overlooks the deficiency in **a**.

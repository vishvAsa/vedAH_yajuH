## Translation
5. Let the heated *gharmá*, its own invoker (*hótar*), attain to you;  
let your offerer (*adhvaryú*) move forward, rich in milk; of the milked  
sweet, O Aśvins, of the offspring (?), eat (*vī*) ye, drink ye, of the  
milk of the ruddy \[cow\].

## Notes
The two Sūtras read *nakṣati* in **a**, and *carati prayasvān* at end of  
**b**; the comm. also has *pray-*, and explains it as  
*prīṇanakāripayoyuktaḥ; pray-* is doubtless the more genuine reading.  
The obscure *tanā́yās* in **c** (omitted in Ludwig's translation)\* is  
made by the comm. an adjective qualifying *usriyāyās*, and signifying  
*payodadhyājyarūpahaviḥpradānena yajñam vistārayantyāḥ*. Ppp. has in  
**a** *sma hotā;* the comm. takes *sváhotā* as possessive, which suits  
the accent better. Verses 4 and 5 the comm. declares to have the value  
of *yājñā* verses in the ceremony. \*⌊In fact Ludwig does render  
*tanā́yās* (accent!) by "this," and *tánā* and *tánāya* correspondingly.  
*Tanāya* is the Ppp. reading here for *tanā́yās*.

## Translation
11. Mayest thou ⌊verily⌋ be well-portioned, feeding in excellent  
meadows; so also may we be well-portioned; eat thou grass, O inviolable  
one, at all times; drink clear water, moving hither.

## Notes
The verse is RV. i. 164. 40 (hence repeated below, as ix. 10. 20), found  
also in ĀpśS. ix. 5. 4, and KśS. xxv. 1. 19; all these read *átho* for  
*ádhā* in **b**, and KśS. has *bhagavati* in **a** (if it be not a  
misprint).  
  
The sixth *anuvāka*, with 14 (or 16) hymns and 42 verses, finishes here.  
The quoted Anukr. says of the verses *dvir ekaviṅśatiḥ ṣaṣṭhaḥ*, and, of  
the hymns, *ṣaṣṭhaś caturdaśa*.

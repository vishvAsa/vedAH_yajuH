## Translation
8. Lowing (*hin̄-kṛ*), mistress of good things, seeking her calf with her  
mind, hath she come in; let this inviolable one (*aghnyā́*) yield (*duh*)  
milk for the Aśvins; let her increase unto great good-fortune.

## Notes
RV. (as above) reads *abhyā́gāt* (p. *abhí: ā́: agāt*) at end of **b**.  
The RV. *pada*-text divides *hin̄॰kṛṇvatī́* at the beginning, and SPP.  
gives the same reading; but our *pada*-mss. (with the doubtful  
exception of D.) read here *hin̄kṛ-*, without division; at ix. 10. 5 they  
agree with RV. The verse accompanies, says the comm., the coming up of  
the cow for milking.

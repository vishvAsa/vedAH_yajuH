## Comment
Not found in Pāipp. Used by Kāuś. (46. 49) in a ceremony of expiation, with a fire of apāmārgá; and vss. 1, 2 are reckoned (note to 39. 7) to the kṛtyā gaṇa. And the comm. regards vss. 2 and 3 as intended at 76. 1 in the nuptial ceremonies, instead of xiv. 2. 66 (both verses having the same pratīka); in this he is evidently wrong.

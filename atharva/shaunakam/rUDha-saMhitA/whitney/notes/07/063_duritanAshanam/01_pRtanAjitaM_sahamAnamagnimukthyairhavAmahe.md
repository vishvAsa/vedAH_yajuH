## Translation
1. The fight-conquering, overpowering Agni do we call with songs from  
the highest station; may he pass us across all difficult things; may  
divine Agni stride (?) across arduous things.

## Notes
The translation implies emendation of *kṣā́mat* to *krā́mat* in **d**, as  
suggested by BR. (and adopted also by Henry), since the former seems to  
give no good sense, and both form and composition with *ati* are  
elsewhere unknown for root *kṣam:* cf. also xii. 2. 28 **c**. But the  
parallel verse TA. x. 1. (68) has *kṣāmat* ⌊so both ed's, text and  
comm.⌋ and Ppp. reads *kṣāmād devo ‘dhi*. Our comm. explains *ati  
kṣāmat* as = *atyarthaṁ kṣāmāṇi dagdhāni karotu!* TA. further gives  
*ugrám agním* for *agnim ukthāis*, rectifies the meter of **b** by  
reading *huvema*, leaves the combination *devó áti* in **d**, and has  
*duritā́ ’ty* for *-tāni*. Our **c** is the same with RV. i. 99. 1 **c**.  
The verse has no *jagatī* character at all.

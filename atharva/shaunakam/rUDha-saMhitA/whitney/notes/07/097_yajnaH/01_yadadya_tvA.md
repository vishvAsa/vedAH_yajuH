## Translation
1. Since today, as this sacrifice goes forward, we chose thee here, O  
knowing *hótar*, mayest thou go fixedly, and, O mightiest one, do thou,  
foreknowing, go unto the fixed sacrifice, the soma.

## Notes
The translation follows our text, but this is, as the parallel texts  
plainly show, much corrupted in **c**. The verse is RV. iii. 29. 16,  
found also in VS. (viii. 20), TS. (i. 4. 44²), MS. (i. 3. 38). In **a**,  
VS. begins *vayáṁ hí tvā;* in **b**, RV. reads *cikitvo ‘vṛṇ-*, while  
the other texts have *ágne hótāram ávṛṇ-*. In **c**, RV. reads *ayās*  
and *utā́ ’śamiṣṭhās;* VS. has the same, and also *ṛ́dhak* both times for  
*dhruvám;* TS.MS. have *ṛ́dhak*, but *ayāṭ* between, and M.S. *-miṣṭa*,  
while TS. has *-miṣṭhās*. In **d**, RV. begins *prajānán vidvā́ṅ úp-*,  
VS.TS. begin *prajānán yaj-*, and have *vidvā́n* (for *sómam*) at the  
end; and MS. reads, for **d**, *vidvā́n prajānánn úpa yāhi yajñám*. The  
comm. apparently has *ayas* in **c**, but he explains it as = *ayākṣīs*  
= *yaja* (quoting the TS. version of the pāda), as if it were *ayās;*  
certainly, when it is reduced to *ayas*, all recognition of its  
connection with *yaj* must be lost. The comm. also reads *utā  
’śamiṣṭhās*, with the other texts. Ppp. has *ayas* in **c**, but  
otherwise agrees with RV.

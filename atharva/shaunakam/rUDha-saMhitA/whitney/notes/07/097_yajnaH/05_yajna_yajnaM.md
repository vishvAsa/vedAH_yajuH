## Translation
5. O sacrifice, go to the sacrifice; go to the lord of sacrifice; go to  
\[thine\] own source (*yóni*): hail!

## Notes
⌊Prose.⌋ The same formula is found, without variant, as VS. viii. 22 a,  
and in TS. i. 4. 44³\* and MS. i. 3. 38. The *saṁhitā*-mss. add a stroke  
of punctuation before *svā́ṁ* which is wanting in the other texts, and  
which our edition also omits; SPP. retains it. The comm. explains Vishṇu  
as intended by *yajñam*. \*⌊Also vi. 6. 22.⌋

## Translation
2. Lead us together, O Indra, with mind, with kine, together with  
patrons, thou of the bay horses, together with well-being, together with  
what of the prayers (*bráhman*) is pleasing (*-hitá*) to the gods,  
together with the favor of the worshipful gods.

## Notes
The verse is RV. v. 42. 4, and also occurs in VS. (viii. 15), TS. (i. 4.  
44¹), TB. (ii. 8. 2⁶), and MS. (i. 3. 38). All save MS. read *ṇo* after  
*indra* in **a** (also the comm., and one of SPP's mss.), and all (also  
Ppp.) *neṣi* for *neṣa;* in **b**, RV.MS. (also the comm.) have  
*harivas*, the others *maghavan* instead, and RV. at end *svastí;* in  
**c**, all (with Ppp.) *bráhmaṇā*, and all save RV. *devákṛtam* (so Ppp.  
also) after it; in **d**, RV.TS.TB. (also Ppp.) have the more proper  
*snmatyā́* (*-tāú* involves an anacoluthon which is disregarded in the  
translation). SPP. follows the comm. and a single one of his mss. in  
reading (with the other texts) *bráhmaṇā* in **c**.

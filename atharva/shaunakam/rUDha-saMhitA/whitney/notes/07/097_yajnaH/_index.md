## Comment
⌊Partly prose, 5-8.⌋ Found also in Pāipp. xx. Accompanies in Kāuç. (6. 3), in the parvan sacrifice, the offering of the so-called saṁsthitahomas; vs. 8 is then (6. 4) specified, with the direction ity uttamaṁ caturgṛhītena. Verse 2 is further found in the upanayana ceremony (55. 20), with vi. 53. 3, accompanying the release of a cow (the comm. says, with different reading and division, accompanying a contemplation of the water-pot). In Vāit. (4. 13), vss. 3-8 go with final offerings in the parvan sacrifice. ⌊The decad division cuts the hymn between vss. 2 and 3: cf. p. 389.⌋ *⌊The text reads anena yajñasampūrṇekāmo yajñe patiin iṣṭvā ’prārthayat!⌋

## Translation
3. The eager gods, O god, that thou didst bring—them, O Agni, send  
forward in \[thine\] own station (*sadhástha*); having eaten, having  
drunk sweet things, assign to this man good things, ye good ones  
(*vásu*).

## Notes
This and the following verse are given together in VS. (viii. 18, 19),  
TS. (i. 4. 44¹⁻³), MS. (i. 3. 38), but in different order and  
combination: namely, in VS., our 4 before 3,\* and in the others our 4  
**a, b** and 3 **c, d** as one verse, and our 3 **a, b** and 4 **c, d**  
as a following one. In our 3 **a**, VS. begins with *yā́ṅ ā́v-*, and TS.  
ends with *devā́n* (*t-*); in **c**, all end with *-saś ca víśve*, and  
after it VS. has *asmé*, and TS.MS. *‘sme*. Ppp. reads, in **b**,  
*preraya punar agne sve sadhasthe*. The fourth pāda is deficient. \*More  
precisely, our 4 **a-c** with 3 **d** before our 3 **a-c** with 4  
**d**.⌋

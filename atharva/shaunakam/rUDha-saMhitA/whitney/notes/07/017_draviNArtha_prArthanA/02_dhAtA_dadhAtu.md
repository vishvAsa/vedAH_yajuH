## Translation
2. Let Dhātar assign to his worshiper an unexhausted further life; may  
we obtain the favor of the all-bestowing god.

## Notes
TS. (iii. 3. 11³), MS. (iv. 12. 6), AśS. (vi. 14. 16)\*, śśS. (ix. 28.  
3), and śGS. (i. 22), have the same verse, with sundry differences: all†  
read *dadātu* in **a**, and TS.MS. have *no rayím* for *dāśúṣe* (thus  
substituting our 1 **a**); in **b**, śśS. and śGS. have *akṣitim* at  
end; in **d**, for *viśvárādhasas*, TS. has *satyárādhasas*, MS.śśS.śGS.  
*satyádharmaṇas*, and AśS. *vājinīvatas*. Ppp. is defective in this  
verse, but presents no variants. The comm. explains *dhīmahi* once by  
*dhārayema* and once by *dhyāyema*. \*⌊So also AGS. (transl.), p. 36,  
note, as in AśS.⌋ †⌊Save MS.⌋

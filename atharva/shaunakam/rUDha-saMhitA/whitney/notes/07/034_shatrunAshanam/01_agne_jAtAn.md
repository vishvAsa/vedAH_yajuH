## Translation
1. O Agni, thrust forth my rivals that are born; thrust back, O  
Jātavedas, those unborn; put underfoot those that want to fight \[me\];  
may we be guiltless for thee unto Aditi.

## Notes
The first half-verse (with a totally different second half) occurs also  
in VS. (xv. 1), TS. (iv. 3. 12¹), TA. (ii. 5. 2), and MS. (ii. 8. 7).  
⌊Cf. *Kaṭha-hss.*, p. 73.⌋ They all read *nas* instead of *me* in **a**;  
and VS. has *ṇuda* (not *ṇudā*) before it, and *nuda jātavedaḥ* at end  
of **b**. The comm. (backed up by two or three of SPP's authorities)  
understands *té* instead of *te* in **d**, and SPP. (unwisely) adopts  
that reading in his text. The meter is too irregular to be properly  
called simple *jagatī*. ⌊The excision from **d** of *vayám* and the  
worse than superfluous *te* would make all regular, 11 + 11: 12 + 11.⌋  
⌊Ppp. in **a** exchanges the place of *jātān* and *sapatnān* and omits  
*me;* has *śṛṇīhi* for *nudasva* in **b**; and omits **c, d**.⌋

## Comment
The first and third pādas are found in VS. iii. 41, as a second half-verse, and also in LÇS. iii. 3. 1, ĀpÇS. vi. 27. 5, ÇGS. iii. 7. For vasuvánis in a, all read vaḥ sumánās; in c, their reading gṛhā́n āí ’mi (LÇS. emi, ĀpÇS. ā ’gām) mánasā módamānaḥ (LÇS. dāivena). Ppp. has a very different text: gṛhān emi mánasā modamāno ”rjaṁ bibhrad vasumatis sumedhā ’ghoreṇa cakṣuṣā mitriyeṇa gṛhāṇāṁ paçyaṅ paya ut tarāmi. ⌊HGS. (i. 29. 1 a) and Āp. (vi. 27. 3) have a verse whose c is our a (but Āp. has vaḥ suvaniḥ), and whose d is Ppp's a (but Āp. has āi ’mi).⌋

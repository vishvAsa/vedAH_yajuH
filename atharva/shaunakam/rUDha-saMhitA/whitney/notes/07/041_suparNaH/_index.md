## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. (in inverted verse-order). Used by Kāuś. (43. 3) in the house-building ceremony (to purify the site, Keś., comm.): compare Bloomfield in JAOS. xvi. 12; further added by the schol. (note to 8. 23) to the vāstu gaṇa; moreover, the verses are called (40. 9) samprokṣanyāu, and are variously made to accompany rites involving sprinkling (Bloomfield, ib. p. 13). Verse 2 appears in Vāit. (22. 23) in the agniṣṭoma, with vi. 122 and 123.

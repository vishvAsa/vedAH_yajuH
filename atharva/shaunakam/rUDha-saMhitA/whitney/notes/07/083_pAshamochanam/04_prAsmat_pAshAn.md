## Translation
4. Release from us, O Varuṇa, all fetters, that are uppermost, lowest,  
that are Varuṇa's; remove from us evil-dreaming \[and\] difficulty; then  
may we go to the world of the well-done.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The last three pādas are identical with those of vi. 121. 1, above. Our  
text ought to read in **c**, as there, *níḥ ṣv-*. ⌊Pronounce, as there,  
*níṣ ṣuvāsmát.*⌋ There is no *bṛhatī* element in the verse.

## Translation
1. In the waters, O king Varuṇa, is built for thee a golden house;  
thence let the king of firm courses release all bonds (*dā́man*).

## Notes
All the authorities have *mithás* at end of **b**, and SPP. admits this  
in his text, although it is a palpable misreading for *mitás* ⌊c.f.  
Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 107⌋, which is given by Ppp. and by AśS. in the  
corresponding verse (iii. 6. 24); our text has by emendation *mitás;*  
the comm. makes for *mithas* the forced interpretation *ananyasādhāraṇaḥ  
pareṣām anabhigamyo vā*. Our text also makes the clearly called-for  
emendation of *dhā́māni* to *dā́māni* ⌊Roth, l.c., p. 108⌋ in **d** (the  
translation is made accordingly), and of *dhā́mno-dhāmnas* in 2 **a** to  
*dā́-*; yet not only all AV. authorities, but also Ppp. and AśS., are  
opposed to it in both verses and a whole series of texts in vs. 2; it is  
not without sufficient reason, then, that SPP. retains *dhā-*, although  
we can only wonder at the wide-spread corruption of the text. The comm.  
explains *dhāmāni muñcatu* by *sthānāny asmadīyāni tyajatu*. The AśS.  
version of the verse reads: *dvīpe rājño varuṇasya gṛho mito hiraṇyayaḥ:  
sa no dhṛtavrato rājā dhāmno-dhāmna iha muñcatu*. Ppp. has its **b**  
like AśS.; in **d** it reads *dhāmā vi no suce*.

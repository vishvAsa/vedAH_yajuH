## Translation
2. From every bond, O king, here, O Varuṇa, release us; if "O waters,  
inviolable ones!" if "O Varuṇa!" we have said, from that, O Varuṇa,  
release us.

## Notes
The whole verse is found in many other texts: VS. vi. 22 **b, c**; TS.  
i. 3. 11¹; MS. i. 2. 18; AśS. iii. 6. 24; śśS. viii. 12. 11; LśS. v. 4.  
6: TB. 11. 6. 6² and VS. xx. 18 have pādas **c-e**; ⌊and MGS., ii. 1.  
11, has the *pratīka:* cf. p. 151, under *dhāmno*.⌋ All, including also  
Ppp., as noted above, begin with *dhā́mno-dhāmnaḥ* (so SPP.: the comm.  
explains by *sarvasmād rogasthānāt;* our text emends to *dā́-*: ⌊see note  
to vs. 1⌋); VS.śśS.LśS. have (in **a-b**) *rājaṅs táto;* all, as also  
Ppp., have *no muñca* in both **b** and **e**; VS. unaccountably gives  
*āhús* instead of *ā́pas* in **c** (but it has *ā́pas* in xx. 18);  
TS.MS.TB. accent *ághnyās* and, with LśS., omit the *iti* after it; for  
*yád ūcimá* in **d**, VS.TS.TB.AśS.śśS.LśS. read *śápāmahe* (printed  
*ṣayā-*, LśS.), while MS. has *śápāmahāi*. The accent *aghnyā́s* (as  
nom.) and the reading *váruṇa* (voc.) are inconsistent, and *ághnyās* of  
TS. etc. seems to be preferable; but all the AV. *pada*-mss. (except a  
single one of SPP's) read *váruṇaḥ*, though all the *saṁhitā*-mss.  
without exception combine *váruṇé ’ti*. Our translation implies  
*ághnyās* (or *aghnyās*); the comm. says *he aghnyāḥ*. Pādas **c, d**  
are repeated below as xix. 44. 9 **a, b**; they relate doubtless to  
adjurations made in support of what is false. ⌊The Anukr. seems to  
sanction our pronouncing the *āmreḍita* as six syllables.⌋

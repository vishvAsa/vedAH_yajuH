## Comment
The first two verses are found in Pāipp. xx. The hymn (the whole, says the comm.) is, according to Kāuç. (32. 14), to be repeated in a remedial rite for dropsy, in a hut amid flowing waters; also (127. 4) all the verses in a sacrifice to Varuṇa, after iv. 16. 3, in case of the portent of obscuration of the seven ṛṣis. Vāit. (10. 22) has vs. 1* at the end of the paçubandha, when the victim's heart has been set upon a spit; and vs. 3 in the agnicayana (28. 17), on loosening the cords by which the fire-dish has been carried. The comm. quotes the hymn from Nakṣatra Kalpa (14), with an offering to Varuna in a mahāçānti for portents. *⌊According to Garbe, the whole hymn.⌋

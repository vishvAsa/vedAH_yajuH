## Translation
2. The oblation \[is\] cooked; hither, O Indra, please come forward; the  
sun hath gone to the mid-point of his way; \[thy\] companions wait upon  
(*pari-ās*) thee with treasures (*nidhí*), as heads of families on a  
chieftain (*vrājapatí*) as he goes about.

## Notes
RV. reads in **b** *vímadhyam*, for which our text is only a corruption,  
and accents ⌊cf. *Gram*. § 1267 a⌋ *vrājápatim* in **d**. The comm.  
explains *vimadhyam* as *vikalam madhyam, īṣadūnam madhyabhāgam;* he  
calls the offering referred to the *dadhigharma* (as Vāit.).

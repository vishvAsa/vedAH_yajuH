## Translation
1. Up have flown his two dark-brown (*śyāvá*) quiverers (? *vithurá*),  
as two vultures to the sky—up-heater-and-forth-heater, up-heaters of his  
heart.

## Notes
The comm. renders *vithurāú* by *saṁtataṁ calanaśīlāu* (also  
*vyathanaśīlāu bhayavantāu*), and understands by them (through the hymn)  
either the two lips or the breath and expiration of the enemy who is  
represented by the frog (*maṇḍūkātmanā bhāvitasya*)—which is very  
unsatisfactory. To the vultures he applies the epithet *tārkṣyāu*. Roth  
suggests, as intended in the second half-verse, the heat and passion of  
love, which are to be expelled from some woman's heart.

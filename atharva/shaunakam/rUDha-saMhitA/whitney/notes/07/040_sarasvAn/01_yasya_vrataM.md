## Translation
1. \[He\] whose \[established\] course all the cattle go, in whose  
course stand the waters, in whose course the lord of prosperity is  
entered—him, Sarasvant, we call to aid.

## Notes
The verse is found in several other texts: TS. (iii. 1. 11³), MS. (iv.  
10. 1), AśS. (iii. 8. 1), śśS. (vi. 11. 8); and it is a supplement  
(Aufrecht,² p. 678) to RV. vii. 96. All these agree in reading *vratám*  
in **b**, *puṣṭipátis* (the comm. also has this) in **c**, and *huvema*  
at the end. Ppp. has *vrate* in **a** and *vratam* in **b**, and  
*juhuvema* at the end.

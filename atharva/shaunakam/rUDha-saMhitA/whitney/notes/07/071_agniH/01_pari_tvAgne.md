## Translation
1. Thee, the devout ⌊*vípra*⌋, O Agni, powerful one, would we fain put  
about us \[as\] a stronghold, \[thee\] of daring color, day by day,  
slayer of the destructive one.

## Notes
The verse is RV. x. 87. 22, which has at the end the plural (*-vatām*);  
further found in VS. (xi. 26) and MS. (ii. 7. 2), both of which agree  
with RV., and in TS. (i. 5. 6⁴ et al.), which has for **d** *bhettā́ram  
bhan̄gurāvataḥ*. Emendation in **b** to *vápram* 'rampart' seems called  
for; moreover, *dṛṣádv-* in **c** would be acceptable ⌊see Roth, ZDMG.  
xlviii. 108⌋. Ppp. has at the end *-vataḥ*, and *sahasva* in **b**.\*  
The verse is also found in our text as viii. 3. 22. ⌊Winternitz,  
*Hochzeitsrituell*, p. 57, cites it from Bāudh. i. 6.⌋ ⌊W. interlines a  
mark of doubt as to his version of *bhan̄g-* and gives Henry's *trompeur*  
in the margin.⌋ \*⌊Roth's Collation says simply "71 ebd. citiert." That  
means 'Found in Pāipp. xix., cited' \[from its previous occurrence in  
xvi., where, according to R's Collation for viii. 3. 22, the variants  
are *sahasva* and *bhan̄gurāvatām*\]. R. in his Notes says expressly that  
Ppp. too "has *vipram* for the correct *vapram*."⌋

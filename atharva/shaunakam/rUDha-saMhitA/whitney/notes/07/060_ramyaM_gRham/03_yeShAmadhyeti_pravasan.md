## Translation
3. On whom the absent one thinks (*adhi-i*), in whom is abundant  
well-willing—the houses we call on; let them recognize us coming.

## Notes
The verse is VS. iii. 42, and also found in ĀpśS. vi. 27. 3, śGS. iii. 7  
(both these agreeing in text with VS.), LśS. iii. 3. 1, HGS. i. 29. 1.  
VS. reads at the end *jānatás* for *āyatás* (like Ppp. in 2 **d**; but  
Ppp. in this verse has *āyatas*); LśS. has *eṣu* for *yeṣu* in **b**,  
*hūyāmahe* in **c**, and *jāna* (misprint?) at the end; HGS. has *eti*  
for *yesu, babhus* for *bahus* in **b**, and *jānatas* at the end. ⌊Cf.  
also MGS. i. 14. 5 and p. 155, under *yeṣv a-*.⌋ The comm. glosses  
*adhyeti* with *smarati*.

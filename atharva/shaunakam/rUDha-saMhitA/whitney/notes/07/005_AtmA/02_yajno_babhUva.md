## Translation
2. The sacrifice came to be; it came to be here; it was propagated; it  
increased again; it became over-lord of the gods; let it assign wealth  
to us.

## Notes
This verse is found also in TS. (i. 6. 6³⁻⁴ et al.) and śśS. (iv. 12.  
15); TS. omits *u* and *punaḥ* in **b**, and both have, for **d**, *só  
asmā́ṅ ádhipatīn karotu* (śśS. *kṛṇotu*), TS. adding further *vayáṁ syāma  
pátayo rayīṇā́m*. Ppp. combines *sa ”babhūva* in **a**, and inserts after  
it *saṣ pṛthivyā adhipatir babhūva:* omitting later the pāda *sa devānām  
a. b.;* it omits *u* before *vāvṛdhe*, and combines *so ‘smāsu* in the  
last pāda. The Anukr. overlooks the metrical deficiency of **a**.

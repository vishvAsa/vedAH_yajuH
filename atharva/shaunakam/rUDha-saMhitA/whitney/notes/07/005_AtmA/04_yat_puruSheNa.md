## Translation
4. When, with man (*púruṣa*) for oblation, the gods extended the  
sacrifice—even than that is it of more force that they sacrificed with  
the *vihávya*.

## Notes
Nearly all the mss. read *atanvata*, without accent, in **b** (our Bp.  
and O. have *á-*, and both editions give it); in **c** they have *ásthi*  
instead of *ásti*, which latter is read in both editions, SPP. having  
the comm. and one of his many authorities in its favor. The first  
half-verse is RV. x. 90. 6 **a, b** (also VS. xxxi. 14; TA. iii. 12. 3,  
and our xix. 6. 10). The comm. explains *vihavya* as meaning an offering  
without oblation, an offering of knowledge (*jñānayajña*); and this is  
perhaps acceptable; or the half-verse is perhaps to be understood as a  
question.

## Translation
1. Let Brihaspati protect us round about from behind, also from above,  
from below, against the malignant one; let Indra from in front and from  
midway make wide space for us, a companion for companions.

## Notes
The directions admit also of being understood as from west, north,  
south, and east. RV. (and TS.) reads *várivas* in **d**, and so does  
Ppp. (*varivaṣ kṛṇotu*).  
  
The fourth *anuvāka* ends here; it has, according to our division, 13  
hymns and 30 verses; the other division counts 14 hymns; the quoted  
Anukr. is to this effect: *dvāu pañcarcāu saṁniviṣṭāu caturthe;* and,  
for the hymns: *caturthe trayodaśa sūktāḥ*—thus sanctioning our  
division.

## Comment
The third and fourth verses are found in Pāipp. xx. The first and second form together one long verse in SV. (i. 464), VS. (iv. 25), MS. (i. 2. 5), and AśS. (iv. 6. 3), and two, as in our text, in śśS. (v. 9. 11). In Kāuś. (24. 3) the hymn appears only in a general rite for prosperity; in accordance with which, it is included (note to 19. 1) among the puṣṭika mantras. Vāit. (13. 7) uses it in a more specific office, to accompany the winnowing of the soma, in the agniṣṭoma ceremony.

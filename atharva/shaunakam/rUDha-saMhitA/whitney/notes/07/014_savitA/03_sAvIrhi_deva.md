## Translation
3. For thou didst impel, O god, for the first father—height for him,  
width for him; then unto us, O Savitar (impeller), do thou day by day  
impel desirable things, abundance of cattle.

## Notes
The verse is found also in TB. (ii. 7. 15¹), AśS. (iv. 10. 1), and śśS.  
(v. 14. 8); all read, in **c, d**, *savitaḥ sarvátātā divé-diva ā́;* and  
in **a** TB. has *prasavā́ya* instead of *prathamā́ya*. With **d** compare  
also RV. iii. 56. 6 (quoted here by the comm.). Ppp. shows no variants.

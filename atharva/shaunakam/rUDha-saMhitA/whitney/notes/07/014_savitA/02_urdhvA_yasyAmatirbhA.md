## Translation
2. He whose lofty light (*amáti*), gleam, shone brightly in his  
impelling—he, gold-handed, of good insight, fashioned the heaven with  
beauty.

## Notes
The translation assumes at the end the emended reading *kṛpā́*, which is  
that of all the other texts and of the comm., and is also given by one  
or two of the AV. mss. (including our O.\*); SPP. adopts *kṛpā́t*.  
śśS.AśS. curiously read at the end *kṛpā svas tṛpā svar iti vā*, taking  
as it were a variant into the text. All the *pada*-mss. have *ūrdhvā́ḥ*  
at the beginning, instead of -*vā́*, as the sense demands; SPP. emends to  
*-vā́* in his *pada*-text. The comm. paraphrases *amatis* by *amanaśīlā  
vyāpanaśīlā*. \*⌊Mistake for P.M.?—Note to Prāt. i. 65 may be compared.⌋

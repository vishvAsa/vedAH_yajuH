Found also in Pāipp. xx. Further, in TS. iii. 3. 115, MS. iv. 12. 6, K. xiii. 16, AśS. i. 10. 8, śśS. ix. 28. 3. This hymn, with the preceding (or also 48 and 49?) and hymn 6, makes up (Kāuś. 59. 18, note), according to the schol., a patnīvantagaṇa (not acknowledged nor used in the Kāuś. text). In Vāit. (i. 16), it and hymn 48, paired respectively with 79 and 80, are used on the days of new and full moon at the parvan sacrifices.

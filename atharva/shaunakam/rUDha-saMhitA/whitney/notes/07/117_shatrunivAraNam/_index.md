## Comment
Wanting in Pāipp. Used by Kāuś. (59. 14), with hymns 85 and 86, in a rite for welfare; and it is, with 118, reckoned (note to 25. 36) to the svastyayana gaṇa; while a schol. (note to 137. 4) adds it and 118 in the introduction to the ājyatantra; that another uses it with 116 was noted under that hymn. And Vāit. (23. 9) repeats it in the agniṣṭoma with the offering of the hāriyojanagraha.

## Translation
1. Having paid homage to heaven and earth, to the atmosphere, to Death,  
I will urinate standing erect; let not the lords (*īśvará*) harm me.

## Notes
All the authorities read *mekṣā́mi* in **c**, and SPP. retains it in his  
text, although it is a wholly impossible form, and the misreading of *ṣ*  
for *ṣy* is an easy and familiar one; even the meter demands *me-kṣi-*  
⌊rather *ūrdhuás?*⌋. The comm. has instead *māi ’ṣyāmi*, explaining it  
as = *mā gamiṣyami!* Virtually all the authorities, too, leave *tiṣṭhan*  
unaccented (two out of fourteen of SPP's and our R.s.m. *tíṣṭhan*); this  
both editions emend. ⌊The Anukr. seems to scan as 11 + 8: 7 + 8 = 34.⌋  
  
⌊The squatting posture in making water is, I believe, general with the  
natives of India to this day. So Hesiod, Works and Days, 727: μηδ'  
ἀντ΄ἠελίοιο τετραμμένος ὀρθὸς ὀμιχεῖν...ἑζόμενος κτλ. Cf. xiii. 1. 56  
and my note.⌋  
  
Here ends the ninth *anuvāka*, of 12 hymns and 21 verses: the old Anukr.  
says *navamo dvādaśa* and *ekaviṅśa*.

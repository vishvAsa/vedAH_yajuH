## Translation
1. Who, enjoying companionship with Brihaspati, shall shape \[its\] body  
at his will—the spotted milch-cow, well-milking, with constant calf,  
given by Varuṇa to Atharvan?

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** *tanvàm* as read by Ppp.; compare RV.  
x. 15. 14 **d** (AV. xviii. 3. 59 reads *tanvàs*, but with much better  
reason than here), also iii. 48.4 **b** and vii. 101. 3 **b**. The comm.  
refers to v. 11 as explaining the cow referred to. Some of the mss.  
(including our Bp.E.O.K.) accent *sakhyàm* in **c**, and SPP. adopts it  
in his text; ours has the correct *sakhyám*. Ppp. begins with *kaṁ*, and  
has in **b**, for *nítyavatsām*, *dhenum etām*, and in **c** *tāṁ  
bṛhaspatyā sakhyā.*

## Translation
1. Prajāpati generates these offspring (*prajā́s*); let Dhātar, with  
favoring mind, bestow (*dhā*) \[them\]; harmonious, like-minded, of like  
origin; let the lord of prosperity put (*dhā*) prosperity in me.

## Notes
The verse is to be compared with one in MS. (ii. 13. 23) and ĀpśS. (xiv.  
28. 4), of which the second pāda precisely agrees\* with ours, and the  
fourth nearly (but reading *puṣṭim puṣṭipatir*); while for **a** both  
have *ā́ naḥ prajā́ṁ janayatu prajā́patiḥ*, and, for **c**, *saṁvatsará  
ṛtúbhiḥ saṁvidānáḥ* (ĀpśS. *ṛtubhiś cākupānaḥ*†) and **d** is MB. ii. 4.  
7 **c**.‡ Our **c**, nom. plur. words, is left without any construction  
(but emendation to *sayonīs* would make them accus., helping both the  
construction and the meter); Ppp. has the same **c** as MS., and also  
gives *janayatu* (for *-ti*) in **a**, as does the comm.; it is  
doubtless the better reading. Two of the pādas are *triṣṭubh.* \*⌊But  
Āp. has *dadātu*.⌋ †⌊Intending *ca a-kupānaḥ*, as an isolated  
root-aorist pple? see *Gram.* §840 b.⌋ ‡⌊But with *puṣṭim puṣṭipatir*,  
like MS.Āp.⌋

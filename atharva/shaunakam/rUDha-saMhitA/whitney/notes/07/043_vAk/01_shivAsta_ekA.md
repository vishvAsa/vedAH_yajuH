## Translation
1. Propitious to thee \[are\] some; unpropitious to thee \[are\] some;  
all thou bearest, with well-willing mind. Three voices (*vā́c*) \[are\]  
deposited within him (it?); of these, one flew away after sound  
(*ghóṣa*).

## Notes
A mystical saying, of very doubtful interpretation; the comm. gives a  
long and worthless exposition. The 'some' and 'all' in **a, b** are  
feminine, like *vāc;* the 'thou' is masculine; the comm. (after Kāuś.)  
understands it of a 'man causelessly reproached.' Henry imagines the  
thunder to be intended, *asmin* signifying Parjanya, and renders **d**  
"one of them has gone to pieces with no other result than sound: i.e.,  
without rain."

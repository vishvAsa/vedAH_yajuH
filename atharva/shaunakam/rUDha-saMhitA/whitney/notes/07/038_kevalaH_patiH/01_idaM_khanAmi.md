## Translation
1. I dig this remedy, me-regarding, greatly wailing, the returner of one  
going away, greeter of one coming.

## Notes
Only the first half-verse is found in Ppp. The comm., after Kāuś.,  
understands the remedy to be that named *sāuvarcala*,\* "Sochal salt."  
*Māmpaśyam* he explains as either *mām eva nārīm paśyat* or *mām eva  
asādhāraṇyena patye pradarśayat;* there can properly be no causative  
force in *-paśya.* ⌊Weber suggests that *māmpaśyam* may be a misprint  
for *sā-*; but the mss. of SPP. and W. all appear to have *mā-*, except  
W's Bp., which has *sā-*.⌋ The other difficult epithet, *abhirorudam*,  
he makes no difficulty of explaining as if it contained the root *rudh*  
instead of *rud: patyuḥ anyanārīsaṁsargam abhito nirundhat!* That might  
be convenient, if admissible; the *abhi* with *roruda* is obscure:  
perhaps 'wailing at or after \[me\].'  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
\*⌊But Kāuś., Dārila and Keśava, and the comm. seem to intend by  
*sāuvarcala* a root or flower and not a salt decoction (cf. OB. vii.  
195) therefrom. See Bloomfield's note, p. 539. He observes that the  
Sūtra does not here inspire us with confidence in its exactness.—See  
further my addition to note on vs. 5.⌋

## Translation
1. I cover thy vitals with armor; let king Soma dress thee over with the  
immortal (*amṛ́ta*); let Varuṇa make for thee \[room\] wider than wide;  
after thee conquering let the gods revel.

## Notes
The verse is also RV. vi. 75. 18, found further as SV. ii. 1220, VS.  
xvii. 49, all these without variation from our text; but TS. (in iv. 6.  
4⁵) has *-vármabhis* in **a**, *abhí* (for *ánu*) in **b**, *várivas te  
astu* for *váruṇas te kṛṇotu* ⌊improving the meter⌋ in **c**, and, for  
**d**, *j. tvā́m ánu madantu devā́ḥ*. The third pāda has a redundant  
syllable.  
  
The last or tenth *anuvāka*, of 16 hymns and 32 verses, ends here; and  
the quoted Anukr. says ⌊*tṛtīyā*⌋ *’ntyāu ṣoḍaśa* ⌊cf. p. 413 end⌋, and  
*paro dvātriṅśaka ucyate*.  
  
Two of our mss. sum up the book as of 118 hymns, others note only the  
number of *vargas* or decads; none say 123.  
  
Here ends also the seventeenth *prapāṭhaka*.

## Translation
3. Just here, O Agni, do thou maintain wealth; let not the downputters,  
with previous intents, put thee down; by dominion, O Agni, be it of easy  
control for thee; let thine attendant increase, not laid low.

## Notes
The verse occurs also in VS. (xxvii. 4), TS. (iv. 1. 7²), MS. (ii. 12.  
5); all have the better reading *kṣatrám* at beginning of **c**; and,  
for the difficult and probably erroneous *pū́rvacittās* of **b**, VS.TS.  
read *pūrvacítas*, and MS. *pūrvácittāu* (the editor noting that K. and  
Kap. S. read with VS.). The word, in whatever form, probably refers to  
other worshipers who get the start of us and outdo our Agni by their  
own; the comm. says: *asmattaḥ pūrvaṁ tvadviṣayamanaskāḥ* or  
*tvadviṣayayāgakaraṇamanasaḥ*. All the *pada*-mss. read at the end  
*ániḥ-stṛtaḥ*, and this is required by Prāt. ii. 86; but SPP. alters to  
*áni-stṛtaḥ*—which, to be sure, better suits the sense. The RV.  
*pada*-text also has (viii. 33. 9) *ániḥ-stṛtaḥ;* TS. (and by inference  
MS., as the editor reports nothing), *ániṣṭṛtaḥ*, unchanged. The verse  
in Ppp. stands in the middle of our hymn ii. 6 (between vss. 3 and 4);  
⌊and it is important to remember that its position in the Yajus texts,  
VS.TS.MS., is similar: see note to ii. 6. 3⌋. Ppp. reads *dabhan* for  
*ni kran* in **b**, and *kṣatram* ⌊and *sūyamam*⌋ in **c**. This  
*jagatī* has one *triṣṭubh* pāda.

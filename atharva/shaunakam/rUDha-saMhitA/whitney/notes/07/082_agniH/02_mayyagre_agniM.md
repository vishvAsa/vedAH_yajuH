## Translation
2. I seize in me Agni at first, together with dominion, splendor,  
strength; in me I put progeny, in me lifetime,—hail!—in me Agni.

## Notes
The first and third pādas are read in TS. v. 7. 9¹, and the first three  
in MS. i. 6. 1, with sundry variants: both put *gṛhṇāmi* in **a** before  
*ágre*, and MS. rectifies the meter by inserting *ahám* between the two;  
for **b**, MS. has *sahá prajáyā várcasā dhánena* (TS. entirely  
different, *rāyás póṣāya* etc.); in **c**, MS. puts *kṣatrám* in place  
of *prajā́m*, and, for *ā́yus*, MS. gives *rā́yas* and TS. *várcas* (**d**  
is different in each text). Ppp. reads at the end *agniḥ*. The meter (8  
+ 11: 11 + 6 = 36) is imperfectly described by the Anukr.

## Translation
4. Agni hath looked after the apex of the dawns, after the days, \[he\]  
first, Jātavedas, a sun, after the dawns, after the rays, after  
heaven-and-earth he entered.

## Notes
*Anu* 'after' seems here to have a distributive force: Agni is ever  
present to meet the first dawn etc. with his brightness; or it is the  
opposite of *prati* in vs. 5: *anu* 'from behind,' as *prati* 'from in  
front.' The verse is found as VS. xi. 17, and in TS. iv. i. 2², TB. 1.  
2. 1²³, and MS. i. 8. 9. All these have in **c** *ánu sū́ryasya purutrā́  
ca raśmī́n* (an easier and better reading), and, at the end, VS. MS. give  
*ā́ tatantha*, and TS.TB. *ā́ tatāna*. This verse and the next are  
repeated as xviii. i. 27, 28.

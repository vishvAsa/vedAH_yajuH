## Translation
4. Turned away \[are\] both thine arms; I fasten up thy mouth; with the  
fury of divine Agni—therewith have I smitten thine oblation.

## Notes
The comm. understands *bāhū* in **a** also as object of *nahyāmi*, and  
understands the arms as fastened behind (*pṛṣṭhabhāgasambaddhāu*). ⌊TB.  
(ii. 4. 2²) has our **a, b** (with *ápa* for the *ápi* of our **b**) as  
the **c, d** of a vs. which is immediately followed by our next vs.⌋

## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. (in the verse-order 1-3, 6, 5, 4, 7, and after our hymn 23). The Black Yajur-Veda texts (see under hymn 23) put their passages corresponding to our hymn 29 (to Mitra and Varuṇa) between those corresponding to our 24 and 25. For the use of the hymn as one of the mṛgāra hymns in Kāuç., see under hymn 23; the comm. further quotes it as employed by Nakṣ. K. 18, in a çānti ceremony named vāyavyā. The metrical irregularities are not worth the trouble of detailing.

## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iv. (in a somewhat different verse-order*), after our hymn 27. The other texts (see under hymn 23) have but one verse that represents the hymn, made up of parts of our vss. 1 and 7. As to the use of the mṛgāra hymns by Kāuç., see under h. 23. In Vait. (15. 13), this hymn (or vs. 1) accompanies the offering to the udumbara twig in the agniṣṭoma. *⌊Order, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 7.⌋

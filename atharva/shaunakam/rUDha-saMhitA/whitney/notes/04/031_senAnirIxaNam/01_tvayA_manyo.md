## Translation
1. In alliance (*sarátham*) with thee, O fury, battering, feeling  
excitement, excited, O companion of the Maruts, having keen arrows,  
sharpening up their weapons, let \[our\] men go forward unto \[the  
foe\], having forms of fire.

## Notes
This verse is found further in TB. (in ii. 4. 1¹⁰). RV. and TB. read for  
**b** *hárṣamāṇāso dhṛṣitā́*\* *marutvaḥ;* at beginning of **d**, RV. has  
the decidedly preferable *abhí* for *úpa;* TB. gives in **d** *yanti*,  
and this is also the reading of Ppp.—which moreover separates *tīkṣṇā  
iṣ-* in **c**, and combines *-śāno ’pa* in **c-d**. Three of our mss.  
(O.Op.K.) so far agree with RV. as to read *dhṛṣitāsas* in **b**; the  
comm. has instead *ruṣitāsas*. The comm. explains *manyús* as  
*krodhābhimānī devaḥ* 'wrath personified as a god.' \*⌊In both ed's, TB.  
has the adverb *dhṛṣatā́*.⌋

## Translation
4. Thou art the one praised (?) of many, O fury; sharpen up clan on clan  
(*víś*) unto fighting; with thee as ally (*yuj*), O thou of undivided  
brightness (?), we make a clear noise unto victory.

## Notes
RV. has at the end *kṛṇmahe*, as has also Ppp. The translation follows  
in **a** the RV. reading *īḻitás*, given also by the comm., and by one  
of SPP's authorities that follows him; *īḍitā́* would have to be  
something like 'inciter, persuader to the conflict.' RV. further reads  
*yudháye* for *yuddhā́ya* in **b**, and in **a** combines *manyav īḻ-*;  
our *manya īḍ-* is quoted in the comment to Prāt. i. 81 as the AV.  
reading. The obscure *ákṛttaruk* in **c** is explained by the comm. as  
*acchinnadīpti*. Besides being *bhurij*, the verse (12 + 11: 10 + 12 =  
45) is quite irregular.

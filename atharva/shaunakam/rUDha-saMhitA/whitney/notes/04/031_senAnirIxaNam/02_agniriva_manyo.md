## Translation
2. Like fire, O fury, do thou, made brilliant, overpower; invoked, O  
powerful one, do thou be our army-leader; having slain the foes, share  
out their possession (*védas*); making (*mā*) force, thrust away the  
scorners (*mṛ́dh*).

## Notes
Many of our mss. (P.M.W.E.I.H.p.m.K.), with some of SPP's, accent  
*sáhasva* in **a**; and in **b** some mss. (including our P.M.W.) read  
*-nī́r ṇaḥ*. Ppp. has *jitvāya* for *hatvāya* in **c**. The abbreviation  
of *iva* to *’va* in **a** would remove the *bhurij* character of the  
verse. The comm. explains *tviṣita* in **a** by *pradīpta*.

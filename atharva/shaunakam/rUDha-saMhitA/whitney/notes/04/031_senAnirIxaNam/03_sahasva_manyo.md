## Translation
3. Overpower for us (?), O fury, the hostile plotter; go forward  
breaking, killing, slaughtering the foes; thy formidable rush (?  
*pā́jas*) surely they have not impeded; thou, controlling, shalt bring  
them under control, O sole-born one.

## Notes
The translation given follows in **a** the RV. reading *asmé*, which was  
also received by emendation into our text; all the mss. and the comm.  
have instead *asmāí*, which SPP. retains. ⌊Ppp. has *abhimātim asmahe;*  
our mss. R.T., *asmāi.*⌋ Our P.M.W. give in **c** *rarudhre* (or the  
equivalent *-ddhre*, which is assumed under Prāt. i. 94); and SPP.  
asserts that all his authorities have it, and therefore receives it into  
his text, in spite of its evidently blundering character; the comm.  
reads *rur-*. Several of our mss. (P.M.W.E.H.) read in **d** *vaśán;*  
for *nayāsāi*, after it, RV. has *nayase*. The comm. explains *pā́jas* in  
**c** by *balam*.

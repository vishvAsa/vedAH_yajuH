## Translation
3. Born an Indra among human beings (*manuṣyà*), he goes about (*car*)  
shining brightly, a heated hot-drink (*gharmá*); he, being one of good  
offspring, shall not go in mist (? *udārá*) who, understanding \[it\],  
shall not partake of (*aś*) the draft-ox.

## Notes
The verse is obscure, and the translation in various points very  
doubtful. The second pāda is apparently a beginning of the  
identification of the ox with the *gharma*, a sacrificial draught of  
heated milk, which we find further in vss. 5, 6; he is, since his kind  
yield warm milk, as it were an incorporation of that sacrifice. And the  
second half-verse is then a promise to whoever shall abstain from using  
the ox as food. Ppp. reads *eṣa* instead of *jātas* in **a**, and  
*saṁśiśānas* at end of **b**. In **c, d** the comm. reads *sam* for  
*san*, *ud āre* as two words, and *no ’ śnīyāt*, and of course makes  
very bad work of its explanation, finding metempsychosis in  
*sam...sarṣat* (*na saṁsarati punaḥ saṁsāradharmān na prāpnoti*).  
*Gharma* he takes first as "blazing sun," and then, alternatively, in  
its true sense. There is no other occurrence of an *s*-aorist from *sṛ*;  
and it is altogether against rule and usage to employ a subjunctive and  
an optative (*aśnīyāt*) in two coördinate clauses ⌊this seems to me to  
be a slip—see *Skt. Gram.* §575 b; and the clauses are hardly  
coördinate⌋; so that the reading is very suspicious. A few of our mss.  
(P.M.W.E.) read *ṇá* after *udāré*. ⌊Ludwig conjectures *suprayā́s* for  
*-jā́s*.⌋

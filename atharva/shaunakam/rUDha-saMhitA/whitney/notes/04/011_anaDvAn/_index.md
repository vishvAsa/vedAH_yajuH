## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii. (in the verse-order 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 11, 12, 9, 8, 10, 7). Used by Kāuś. (66. 12) in a sava sacrifice, with the draft-ox as sava. The hymn offers an example of that characteristic Hindu extollation, without any measure or limit, of the immediate object of reverence, which, when applied to a divinity, has led to the setting up of the baseless doctrine of "henotheism."

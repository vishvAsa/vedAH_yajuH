## Translation
9. Whoso knows the milkings of the draft-ox, seven, unfailing, both  
progeny and world he obtains: so the seven seers know.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *anapadasyatas* both here (**b**) and at 12 **d**; it also  
combines *saptarṣ-* in **d**, as does the comm., and a couple of SPP's  
authorities. For consistency, our text ought to combine in **a-b**  
*dóhānt s-*; SPP. also leaves out here the connecting *t*. The comm.  
explains the seven milkings or yields of milk alternatively as "the  
seven cultivated plants, rice etc." or "the seven worlds and oceans"—not  
happening, apparently, to think of any other heptad at the moment. He  
quotes the names of the seven seers from Āśvalāyana. ⌊The number of this  
vs. is misprinted.⌋

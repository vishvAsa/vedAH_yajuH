## Translation
1. The same light with the sun—night possesses the same with the day; I  
make what is effective (*satyá*) for aid; sapless be the makers (f.)  
\[of witchcraft\].

## Notes
*Kṛ́tvarīs* at the end borrows a special sense from its relationship with  
*kṛtyā* ⌊a case of "reflected meaning"—see note to iii. 11. 8⌋. The  
construction in the first half-verse (if here rightly understood) is  
peculiarly intricate: *samám jyótis* is, as it were, coördinate with the  
*samá* of *samā́vatī*, as if it were *samajyotiṣmatī:* i.e. "night has  
its light as good as the sun's or the day's." Or else *jyótis* (R.) is  
to be taken outright as "moonlight" (= later *jyotsnā*). Ppp. begins  
with *samā bhūmis sū-*, and has in **c** *sabhya* for *satyam*. One of  
our *pada*-mss. (Op.), like one of SPP's, divides in **b** *sam॰ā́vatī;*  
the comm. defines the word by "of equal length" (*samānāyāmā*); and  
*kṛtvarīs* by *kartanaśīlās* (taking it from *kṛt* 'cut'). In our text,  
the *ṛ*-sign has dropped out from under the *k*-sign in this word.

## Translation
1. I reverence you, O Mitra-and-Varuṇa, increasers of right; who,  
accordant, thrust \[away\] the malicious (*drúhvan*); \[who\] favor the  
truthful one in conflicts (*bhára*): do ye free us from distress.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Ppp. has for **b** *satyojasāu dṛhyāṇī yo nirete* (cf. its version of 2  
**a**); in **c**, *yāu* for *pra*, and *haveṣu* (better) for *bhareṣu*  
(= *saṁgrāmeṣu*, comm.). TS.MS. read in **a** *-ruṇā tásya vittam* (as  
in our 28. 1 **a**; and MS. accents *-tám*); then, in **b**,  
*sátyāujasā* (MS. *satyāú-*) *dṛṅhaṇā* (MS. *duhṛṇā*) *yáṁ nudéthe;*  
their **c** is wholly different: *yā́ rā́jānaṁ* (MS. *-nā*) *saráthaṁ  
yāthá* (MS. *-tá*) *ugrā;* and they end the refrain with *ā́gasas.*\* MS.  
further accents *mitrā́váruṇā* in **a**; the comm. reads *-ruṇā  
ṛtāvṛdhā*. *Satyāvan* in **c** is perhaps rather a proper name (so the  
Pet. Lex.); the comm. takes it as appellative (= *satyayuktam puruṣam*).  
In our edition, the *e* of *manvé* at the beginning is broken off.  
\*⌊Both reading *tā́* for *tāú*.⌋

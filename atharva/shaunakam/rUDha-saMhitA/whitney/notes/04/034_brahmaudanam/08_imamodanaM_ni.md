## Translation
8. This rice-mess I deposit in the Brāhmans, the *viṣṭārín*,  
world-conquering, heaven-going (*svargá*); let it not be destroyed  
(*kṣi*) for me, swelling with *svadhā́;* be it a cow of all forms,  
milking my desire.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
Several of our mss. (P.M.W.E.) combine in **d** *dhenúṣ kām-*. Ppp. has  
for **a** *imam odanam pacasi miśraddhadhāno;* in **b**, *lokajitiyaṁ  
svargyam* (the comm. also has the better reading *svargyam*); in **c**,  
*kṣeṣṭa sadasiṣyamāṇā;* for **d**, *viśvarūpā kāmadughā dhenur astu me.*  
The verse is irregular in meter: 12 + 11: 12 + 13 = 48.

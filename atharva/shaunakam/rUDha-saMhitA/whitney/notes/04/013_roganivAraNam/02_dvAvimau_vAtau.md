## Translation
2. These two winds blow from the river as far as the distance; let the  
one blow hither dexterity for thee; let the other blow away what  
complaint (*rápas*) \[thou hast\].

## Notes
Besides RV. (vs. 2), TB. (ii. 4. 1⁷) and TA. (iv. 42. 1, vs. 6) have  
this verse. Both accent in **c** *āvā́tu*, as does SPP's text, and as  
ours ought to do, since all the mss. so read, and the accent is fully  
justified as an antithetical one; our text was altered to agree with the  
*ā́ vātu* of RV., which is less observant of the antithetical accent than  
AV., as both alike are far less observant of it than the Brāhmaṇas. All  
the three other texts have *párā* for *ví* at beginning of d; and TB.TA.  
give *me* instead of *te* in **c**. The second pāda is translated in  
attempted adaptation to the third and fourth; of course, the two  
ablatives with *a* might properly be rendered coordinately, and either  
'hither from' or 'hence as far as'; the comm. takes both in the latter  
sense.

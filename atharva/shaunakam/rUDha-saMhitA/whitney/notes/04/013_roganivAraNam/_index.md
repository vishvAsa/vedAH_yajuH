## Comment
Found in Pāipp. v. (in the verse-order 1, 5, 2-4, 6, 7). Vss. 1-5, 7 are in RV. x. 137, and vs. 6 occurs elsewhere in RV. x. Only vss. 1-3 have representatives in Yajur-Veda texts. The hymn is called çaṁtātīya in Kāuç. (9. 4), in the list of the laghuçānti gaṇa hymns; and our comm. to i. 4 counts it also to the bṛhachānti gaṇa (reading in Kāuç. 9. 1 uta devās for the tad eva of the edited text), but he makes no mention of it here; he further declares it to belong among the aṅholin̄gās (for which see Kāuç. 32. 27, note); the schol., on the other hand, put it in the āyuṣyagaṇa (54. 11, note). It is used (58. 3, 11) in the ceremonies for long life that follow the initiation of a Vedic student. In Vāit. (38. 1) it appears, with ii. 33 and iii. 11 etc., in a healing ceremony for a sacrificer ⌊see comm.⌋ who falls ill.

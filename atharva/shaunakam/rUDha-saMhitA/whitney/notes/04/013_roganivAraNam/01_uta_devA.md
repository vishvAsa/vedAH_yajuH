## Translation
1. Both, O ye gods, him that is put down, O ye gods, ye lead up again,  
and him that hath done evil (*ā́gas*), O ye gods, O ye gods, ye make to  
live again.

## Notes
Found without variant as RV. x. 137. 1, and also in MS. (iv. 14. 2.) But  
Ppp. reads *uddharatā* for *ún nayathā* in **b**, and its second  
half-verse is *tato manuṣyaṁ taṁ devā devăṣ kṛṇuta jīvase*. The comm.  
explains *avahitam* as *dharmaviṣaye sāvadhānam, apramattam*, or  
alternatively, *avasthāpitam;* supplying to it *kuruta*, and making of  
**b** an independent sentence, with double interpretation; and he says  
something in excuse of the four-fold repetition of the vocative.

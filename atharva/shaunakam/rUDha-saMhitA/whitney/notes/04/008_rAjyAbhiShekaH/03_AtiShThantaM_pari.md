## Translation
3. Him approaching all waited upon (*pari-bhūṣ*); clothing himself in  
fortune, he goes about (*car*), having own brightness; great is that  
name of the virile (*vṛ́ṣan*) Asura; having all forms, he approached  
immortal things.

## Notes
This is a RV. verse (iii. 38. 4: repeated without variant as VS. xxxiii.  
22), transferred from Indra to the king; RV. reads, as does Ppp.,  
*śṛíyas* in **b**. TB. (as above) has *svárocās* at end of **b**, and  
*asyá* for *vṛ́ṣṇas* in **c**. At the beginning of **c**, the comm. has  
*mahas* (but explains it as = *mahat*) *tad viṣṇo*, and a couple of  
SPP's mss. support him. He renders *pári abhūṣan* either *alaṁkurvantu*  
or *sevantām:* that the form is imperative is the point he is sure of;  
and as alternative value of *asurasya* he gives *śatrūṇām nirasituḥ!*  
⌊Is not *ásurasya nā́ma* a simple periphrasis of *asuryàm*, 'the  
divinity' that "doth hedge a king," in which gods are said to clothe  
themselves at RV. iii. 38. 7? *Nā́ma* might then be construed with  
*vásānas*, or else as above.⌋

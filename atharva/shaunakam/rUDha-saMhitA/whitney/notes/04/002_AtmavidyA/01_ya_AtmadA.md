## Translation
1. He who is soul-giving, strength-giving; of whom all, of whom \[even\]  
the gods, wait upon the instruction; who is lord (*īś*) of these bipeds,  
who of quadrupeds—to what god may we pay worship (*vidh*) with oblation?

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
In the parallel texts, our vs. 7 stands at the beginning of the hymn.  
They also combine differently the material of our vss. 1 and 2, making  
one verse of our 1 **a, b** and 2 **c, d**, and another of our 2 **a,  
b** and 1 **c, d**; and in this Ppp. agrees with them. RV. and VS.  
(xxiii. 3) read in **c** *ī́śe asyá*. The comm. renders *ātmadās* "who  
gives their soul (or self) to all animals"; of course, with the native  
authorities everywhere, he explains *kásmāi* in **d** as "to Prajāpati."  
The Anukr. ignores the *jagatī*-character of **c**. ⌊RV.TS.MS.VS. omit  
the second *yás* of our **c**. MS. has *ī́śe yó asyá;* TS. has *yá ī́śe  
asya* at iv. 1. 8, but *asyá* at vii. 5. 16. Pādas **a-c** recur at  
xiii. 3. 24.—In view of the history of this hymn in Hindu ritual and  
speculation (cf. SBE. xxxii. 12; AB. iii. 21), it might be better to  
phrase the refrain thus: 'Who is the god that we are to worship with  
oblation?'⌋

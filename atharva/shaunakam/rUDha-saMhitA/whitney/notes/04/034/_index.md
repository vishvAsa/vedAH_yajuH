title = "34. Extolling a certain rice-mess offering."

+++
## Comment
Found in Pāipp. vi. Used in Kāuç. (66. 6), in the sava sacrifices, with the brahmāsyāudana sava, to accompany the making of pools and channels in the rice-mess, filling them with juices (rasa), and setting on the ground, with surā and water, knob-bearing plants as specified in the text. Doubtless it is on account of this treatment that the rice-mess in question is called viṣṭārin 'out-strewn, expanded.'

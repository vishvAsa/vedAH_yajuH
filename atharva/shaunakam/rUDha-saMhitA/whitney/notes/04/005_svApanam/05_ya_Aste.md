## Translation
5. Whoso sits, whoso goes about, and whoso standing looks out—of them we  
put together the eyes, just like this habitation (*harmyá*).

## Notes
RV. (vii. 55. 6) rectifies the meter of **a** by adding *ca* before  
*cárati* (the Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in  
our version); its **b** is *yáś ca páśyati no jánaḥ;* and in **c** it  
has *hanmas* for *dadhmas*, and (as also Ppp.) *akṣā́ṇi*. The comm. gives  
no explanation of the obscure comparison in **d**, nor of the word  
*harmyá*, but simply says "as this *harmya* that we see is deprived of  
the faculty of sight." ⌊Is not the *tertium comparationis* simply the  
closing? We close their eyes as we close this house. The comm. renders  
*sáṁ dadhmas* by *nimīlitāni kurmas.*—For the loss of *ca* before  
*cárati*, cf. iv. 18. 6 **a** = v. 31. 11 **a** (*sá* before *śaśā́ka?*),  
and vi. 91. 2 **a** (*’va* before *vāti?*). Other cases (vii. 81. 1  
**c**, etc.) cited by Bloomfield, AJP. xvii. 418.⌋

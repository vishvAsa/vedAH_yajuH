## Translation
1. The thousand-horned bull that came up from the ocean—with him, the  
powerful one, do we put the people to sleep.

## Notes
The verse is RV. vii. 55. 7, without variant. Ppp. reads at the  
beginning *hiraṇyaśṛn̄gas*. The comm. takes the "bull" to be the sun with  
his thousand rays—but that is nothing to make people sleep; the moon is  
more likely, but even that only as typifying the night.

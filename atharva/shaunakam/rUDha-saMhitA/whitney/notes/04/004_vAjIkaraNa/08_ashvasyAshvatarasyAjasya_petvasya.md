## Translation
8. Of the horse, of the mule, of the he-goat and of the ram, also of the  
bull what vigors there are—them do thou put in him, O self-controller.

## Notes
The omission of *tā́n* would rectify the meter of **d**, and also make  
more suitable the accentuation *asmín*. The great majority of mss. favor  
in **c** the reading *átha ṛṣ-*, which SPP. has accordingly adopted (our  
edition has *átha ṛṣ-*). The comm. again (as in 4 **d**) has at the end  
*tanūvaśam*, understanding it adverbially (*śarīrasya vaśo yathā bhavati  
tathā*).

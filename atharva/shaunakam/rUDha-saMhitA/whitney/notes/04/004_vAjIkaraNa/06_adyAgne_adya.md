## Translation
6. Now, Agni! now, Savitar! now, goddess Sarasvatī! now, Brahmaṇaspati,  
make his member taut like a bow.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *me* instead of *asya* in **c**. The verse is *bhurij* only  
if we do not abbreviate *iva* to *’va* in **d**. ⌊Our **c, d** is nearly  
vi. 101. 2 **c, d**.⌋  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
7. I make thy member taut, like a bowstring on a bow; mount (  
  
  
*kram*  
  
  
), as it were a stag a doe, unrelaxingly always (?).  
  
  
  
  
The verse is repeated below as vi. 101. 3. It is wanting (as noted  
above) in Ppp. All our *pada*-mss. make in **c** the absurd division  
*kráma: svárśaḥ॰iva*, instead of *krámasva: ṛ́śyaḥ॰iva;* but SPP.  
strangely reports no such blunder from his mss. All the mss. agree in  
*rśa* instead of *rśya* ⌊both editions should read *rśya*⌋; the comm.  
has again *ṛṣa* (cf. 5 **d**), and declares it equivalent to *vṛṣabha!*  
The Pet. Lex. takes *sádā* at the end as instr. of *sád* "position in  
*coitus*" and the connection strongly favors this; but the accent and  
the gender oppose it so decidedly that the translation does not venture  
to adopt it. The comm. takes *sádā* as "always," and reads before it  
*anu valgūyatā* (for *ánavaglāyatā*), supplying *manasā* for it to agree  
with. The verse is *bhurij* only if we refuse to make the common  
contraction *-rśye ’va* in **c**.

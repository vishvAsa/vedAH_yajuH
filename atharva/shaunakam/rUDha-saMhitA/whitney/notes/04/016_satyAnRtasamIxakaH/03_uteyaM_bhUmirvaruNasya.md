## Translation
3. Both this earth is king Varuṇa's, and yonder great sky with distant  
margins (*-ánta*); also the two oceans are Varuṇa's paunches; also in  
this petty water is he hidden.

## Notes
Ppp. has, for **a, b**, *ute ’yam asya pṛthivī samīcī dyāur bṛhatīr  
antarikṣam;* and, at end of **d**, *udakena maktāḥ*. The comm. declares  
that the epithets in **b** belong to "earth" as well as to "sky";  
*kukṣī* he paraphrases by *dakṣiṇottarapārśvabhedenā ’vasthite dve  
udare*.

## Translation
7. With a hundred fetters, O Varuṇa, do thou bridle (*abhi-dhā*) him;  
let not the speaker of untruth escape thee, O men-watcher; let the  
villain sit letting his belly fall \[apart\], like a hoopless vessel,  
being cut round about.

## Notes
The two editions read in **c** *śraṅśayitvā́*, with the majority of the  
mss.; but nearly half (including our P.M.W.H.Op.) have *śraṅsay-*, and  
two of ours (K.Kp.) *sraṅśay* all of them misreadings for *sraṅsay-*,  
which the comm. gives (= *jalodararogeṇa srastaṁ kṛtvā*). ⌊The disease  
called "water-belly," to which **c** and **d** refer, is dropsy,  
Varuṇa's punishment for sin.⌋ In **d**, SPP. reads *abandhás* with the  
comm., but against all his mss. and the majority of ours  
(P.p.m.M.W.O.Op. have *-dhas*), which have *-dhrás*; *bandhra* (i.e.  
*banddhra*, from *bandh* + *tra*) is so regular a formation that we have  
no right to reject it, even if it does not occur elsewhere. Ppp. puts  
*varuṇa* in **a** before *abhi*, omitting *enam*, thus rectifying the  
meter (which might also be done by omitting the superfluous *varuṇa*)  
and it omits the *n̄* of *-vān̄* in **b**. There is not a *jagatī* pāda in  
the verse, and **d** becomes regularly *triṣṭubh* by combining *kóśe  
’vā-*.

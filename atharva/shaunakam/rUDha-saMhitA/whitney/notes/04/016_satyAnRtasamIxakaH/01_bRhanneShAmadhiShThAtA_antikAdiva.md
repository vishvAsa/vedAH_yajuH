## Translation
1. The great superintendent of them sees, as it were, from close by;  
whoever thinks to be going on in secret, all this the gods know.

## Notes
The verse is altogether wanting in Ppp. All the mss. read in **a-b**  
*-tā́ ant-* (p. *-tā́: ant-*), with irregular absence of combination  
across the cesura; the case might be one of those contemplated by Prāt.  
iii. 34, although not quoted in the comment on that rule; SPP. reads  
with the mss., and our edition might perhaps better have done the same  
(it is emended to *-tā́ ’nt-*). But SPP. also reads in **c** *yás tāyát*,  
instead of *yá* (i.e. *yáḥ*) *stāyát*\*, while nearly all his  
*pada*-mss. (with all of ours) require the latter; his wholly  
insufficient reason seems to be that the comm. adopts *tāyat;* the comm.  
also has, as part of the same version, *carat*, and views the two words  
as contrasted, "stable" (*sāṁtatyena vartamānaṁ sthiravastu*) and  
"transient" (*caraṇaśīlaṁ naśvaraṁ ca vastu*), which is absurd: "he is  
great, because he knows (*manyate*=*jānāti!*) all varieties of being."  
The comm. understands *eṣām* as meaning "of our evil-minded enemies,"  
and keeps up the implication throughout, showing no manner of  
comprehension of the meaning of the hymn. \*⌊See Prāt. ii. 40, note, p.  
426 near end.⌋

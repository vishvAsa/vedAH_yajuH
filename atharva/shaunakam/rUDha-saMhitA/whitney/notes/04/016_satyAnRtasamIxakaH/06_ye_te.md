## Translation
6. What fetters (*pā́śa*) of thine, O Varuṇa, seven by seven, stand  
triply relaxed (*vi-si*), shining—let them all bind him that speaks  
untruth; whoso is truth-speaking, let them let him go.

## Notes
Our *sinántu*, at beginning of **c**, is our emendation, obviously  
necessary; a few mss. (including our Bp.E.H.) have *śinántu*, and the  
rest *chin-* (our P.M. *dhin-*, doubtless meant for *chin-*), which  
SPP. accordingly retains; the comm. has *chinattu*, explaining it as for  
*chindantu*. Ppp's version of the verse is found with that of the half  
of vs. 4; it reads *chinadya;* it also has *saptasaptatīs* in **a**, and  
*ruṣatā ruṣantaḥ* at end of **b**; and its **d** is *yas sabhyavāg ati  
taṁ sṛjāmi*. The comm. also reads in **b** *ruṣantas*, which is, as at  
iii. 28. 1, an acceptable substitute for the inept *ruś-*; in **b** he  
apparently has *visitās*, and takes it as *tatra tatra baddhās*, while  
the true sense obviously is "laid open ready for use"; the "triply" he  
regards as alluding to the three kinds of fetter specified in vii. 83. 3  
**a, b**.

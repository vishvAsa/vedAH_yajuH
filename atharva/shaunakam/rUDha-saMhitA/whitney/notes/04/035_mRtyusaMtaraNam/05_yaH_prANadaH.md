## Translation
5. That which became breath-giving, possessing breath-giving ones (?);  
for which worlds rich in ghee flow; whose are all the light-filled  
directions—by that rice-mess let me overpass death.

## Notes
The *pada*-text does not divide *prāṇadáḥ*, and it makes the division  
*prāṇadá॰vān*, which the translation follows; our text (either by a  
misprint or by an unsuccessful  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
attempt at emendation) reads  
  
  
*-dā́vān;*  
  
  
  
  
  
*-dā́vā*  
  
  
, as nom. of  
  
  
*-dā́van*  
  
  
, might be an improvement; the comm. reads  
  
  
*-davām*  
  
  
, viewing it as gen. pl. of  
  
  
*prāṇa-dū*  
  
  
, from  
  
  
*dū*  
  
  
'burn,' and he explains it as "moribund" (  
  
  
*mumūrṣu: prāṇāir jigamiṣubhiḥ paritāpyante*  
  
  
)!

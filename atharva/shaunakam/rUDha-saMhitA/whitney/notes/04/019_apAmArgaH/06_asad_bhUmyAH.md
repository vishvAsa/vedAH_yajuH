## Translation
6. The non-existent came into being (*sam-bhū*) from the earth; that   
goes to the sky, the great expanse (*vyácas*); let that, verily, fuming  
abroad, come back thence on the maker.

## Notes
The translation implies the obvious emendation, made in our text, of  
*tád dyā́m* for *tád yā́m*, which is read by all the mss. and by the  
comm., and retained in SPP's text, though in a note he approves our  
alteration; it is only another example of mistaking an abbreviated for a  
full reading (*dy* for its grammatical equivalent *ddy*: compare ⌊i. 22.  
1, and Roth, ZDMG. xlviii. 104⌋). Ppp. reads in **b** *bṛhat vacas;* and  
it has for **c** *ud it vaco vyadhūmayat*. The comm. gives *bhūmyām* for  
*-yās* in **a**, and *tvat* for *tat* at beginning of **b**. He renders  
*asat* by *asatkalpaṁ kṛtyārūpam*, or, alternatively, by *aśobhanaṁ  
kṛtyārūpam*. The accent *-dhūpā́yat* is contrary to all rule, and  
doubtless false; MS. (i. 10. 20; p. 160. l) has *-pāyát*, which is  
correct. The general sense of the verse is obscure; but it appears to  
parallel the return of the charm upon its producer with the action of  
water in exhaling from the earth and coming back as rain.

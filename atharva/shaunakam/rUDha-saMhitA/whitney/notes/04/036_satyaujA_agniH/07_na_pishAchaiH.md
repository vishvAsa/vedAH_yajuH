## Translation
7. I cannot \[bear\] with *piśācás*, nor with thieves, nor with savages  
(? *vanargú*); the *piśācás* disappear from that village which I enter.

## Notes
Our P.M.W. read *-viveśá* for *-viśé* the end. The comm. has *naśyantu*  
in **c**. He paraphrases *saṁ śaknomi* by *saṁśakto ‘nupraviṣṭo  
bhavāmi*, or by *saṁgato bhavāmi;* and *vanargu* by *vanagāmin*.

## Translation
3. They who hunt in assent (? *āgará*), in counter-clamor (?  
*pratikrośá*), on new-moon \[day\], the flesh-eating ones, seeking to  
harm others—all those I overpower with power.

## Notes
The obscure words *āgará* and *pratikrośá* are here translated  
mechanically, according to their surface etymology. The comm. gets the  
former from *gṛ* or *gir* 'swallow,' and defines it as *yuddharan̄ga*,  
because *samantād bhajyate māṅsaśoṇitādikam atra;* the latter is  
*pratikūlāiḥ śatrubhiḥ kṛta ākrośe;* while *mṛgayante* means "desire to  
injure us," and *amāvāsye* "at midnight of a day of new moon"; he has  
no suspicion of any connection with the doings at an eclipse, as half  
suggested by Grill. The line is quite unintelligible, and very probably  
of corrupt text. Most of the *pada-*mss. have the false accent  
*prati॰krośè*. The comm. reads in **c** *dipsanti* for *-tas*.

## Translation
9. They who anger me, making a noise, as flies an elephant—them I think  
ill off, like mites (?) on a man (*jána*).

## Notes
The comm. (followed by a couple of SPP's authorities) has *lipitās* (=  
*upadigdhāḥ saṁkrāntāḥ*) at end of **a**; the *pada*-mss. read *lapitā́*,  
which SPP. in his *pada*-text emends to *-tā́ḥ*; but, as the participle  
in *ta* from such a root can hardly have an active sense, *lapitvā́*  
would doubtless be a better alteration; the redundancy of a syllable, to  
be sure, would suggest deeper changes. *Álpaśayūn* in **d**, literally  
'petty liers,' is conjecturally rendered, in accordance with the comm.  
(*parimāṇato ‘lpakāyāḥ śayanasvabhāvāḥ saṁcārākṣamāḥ kīṭāḥ*). SPP. reads  
*dúrhitān j-* (instead of *-tāṅ* or *-tāñ* ⌊see note to i. 19. 4⌋),  
against the great majority of his mss. as well as all of ours; instead  
of it the comm. has *durhatān*.

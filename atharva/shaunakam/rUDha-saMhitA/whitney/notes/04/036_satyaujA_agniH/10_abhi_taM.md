## Translation
10. Let perdition halter him, as a horse with a horse-halter  
(*-abhi-dhā́nī*); the fool (*malvá*) that is angry at me, he is not  
loosed from the fetter.

## Notes
The comm. (with one of SPP's mss.) has at the end *mucyase*, but  
explains it as a 3d sing. impv.: *mukto na bhavatu;* an imperative would  
be welcome, if honestly come by. *Malva* he glosses with *śatru*. ⌊As to  
*abhi-dhā*, cf. iii. 11. 8 and note.⌋

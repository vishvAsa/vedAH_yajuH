## Translation
1. Since the goat has been born from the heat of Agni (the fire), it saw  
\[its\] generator in the beginning; by it the gods in the beginnings  
attained (*i*) \[their\] godhead; by (with?) it the sacrificial ones  
(*médhya*) ascended the ascents (*róha*).

## Notes
Found also in VS. (xiii. 51), MS. (ii. 7. 17; like VS. throughout), and  
TS. (iv. 2. 10⁴). VS. and MS. have in **c, d** *devátām ágram āyaṅs téna  
róham āyann úpa médh-*. TS. has at the beginning *ajā́*, and,  
correspondingly, *sā́* (with *vāí* added) in **b**, and *táyā* in **c**  
and **d**; it also reverses the order of **c** and **d**, agreeing  
otherwise with VS. MS. in **d**, but having *ágre*, like AV., in **c**;  
it also replaces *śókāt* by *gárbhāt* in **a**. We have **a** again  
below as ix. 5. 13 **a**; and **c** is nearly equivalent to iii. 22. 3  
**c**: moreover the *pada*-mss., here as there, misinterpret *āyaṅ*  
before *téna* as *āyam*, which SPP. properly corrects to *āyan* in his  
*pada*-text; all our *saṁhitā*-mss. read *āyaṅ*. The comm. declares *hí*  
in **a** to be intended to intimate that the same statement was made in  
another text also; and he quotes TS. ii. 1. 1⁴; *róha* he explains by  
*svargādiloka; téna* he takes both times as designating the means. The  
Anukr. takes no notice of the deficiency of a syllable in **b**. ⌊As to  
*ajá*, see Weber, *Berliner Sb.*, 1895, p. 847 n.⌋

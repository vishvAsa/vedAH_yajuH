## Translation
6. With milk, with ghee, I anoint the goat, the heavenly eagle, milky,  
great; by it may we go to the world of the well-done, ascending the  
heaven (*svàr*), unto the highest firmament (*nā́ka*).

## Notes
TS. (iv. 7. 13) and MS. (ii. 12. 3) have a parallel verse, with which  
Ppp. also corresponds in the first half: *agníṁ* (Ppp. *-nīṁ*) *yunajmi  
śávasā ghṛténa divyáṁ suparṇáṁ* (Ppp. *samudraṁ*) *váyasā* (MS.  
*vayasám;* but Ppp. *payasaṁ*) *bṛhántam* (Ppp. *ruhantam*); as second  
half, they read: *téna vayám patema bradhnásya viṣṭápaṁ súvo* (MS.  
*svò*) *rúhāṇā ádhi nā́ka uttamé*, while Ppp. differs from our text only  
by having at beginning of **d** *saruhāṇā adhi*. The second half-verse  
is repeated below as xi. 1. 37 **c, d**. The comm. reads in **b**  
*payasam*, but regards it as *vayasam* with Vedic substitution of *p*  
for *v*; *svàr* this time is either *svarga* or *sūryātmakam paramaṁ  
jyotiḥ*. The *triṣṭubh* is irregular in its last two pādas. ⌊Pronounce  
*gā-iṣma* in **c** (? in spite of *Gram.* §894 c, end). Pāda **d** is  
simply acatalectic. Ought we perhaps to read *súāróh-*, i.e. *súar róh-*  
(root *ruh* without *ā*, as at x. 2. 8; xii. 3. 42; xix. 6. 2)?⌋

## Translation
3. From the back of earth I have ascended to the atmosphere; from the  
atmosphere I have ascended to the sky; from the back of the sky, of the  
firmament (*nā́ka*), I have gone to heaven (*svàr*), to light.

## Notes
The other three texts (VS. xvii. 67; TS. and MS. as above) agree in  
omitting *pṛṣṭhā́t* in **a** and adding *úd* after *ahám* before  
*antárikṣam*. In this verse, the comm. takes *svàr* as the sun (in vs.  
2, as the *svarga loka*). It is too irregular (14 + 9: 7 + 8 = 38) to be  
so simply defined as it is by the Anukr. ⌊If we omit the first *ahám*,  
and combine *dívā́ruham* in **b** and resolve *-aāt suar* in **cd**, we  
get an orderly *purastādbṛhatī*.⌋

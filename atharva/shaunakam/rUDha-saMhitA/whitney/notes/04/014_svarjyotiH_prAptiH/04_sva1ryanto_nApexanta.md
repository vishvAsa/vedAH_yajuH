## Translation
4. Going to heaven (*svàr*) they look not away; they ascend to the sky,  
the two firmaments (*ródasī*)—they who, well-knowing, have extended the  
everywhere-streaming sacrifice.

## Notes
The other texts (VS. xvii. 68; TS. and MS. as above) have no variants;  
but Ppp. ends **b** with *rohantu rādhasaḥ*. The comm. again takes  
*svar* as *svarga;* and *viśvatodhāram* as either *sarvato dhārakam* or  
else *sarvato ‘vicchinnaphalaprāptyupāyā yasmin*.

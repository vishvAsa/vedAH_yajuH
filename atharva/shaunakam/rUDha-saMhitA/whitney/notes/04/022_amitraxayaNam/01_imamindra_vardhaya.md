## Translation
1. Increase, O Indra, this Kshatriya for me; make thou this man sole  
chief of the clans (*víś*); unman (*nis-akṣ*) all his enemies; make them  
subject to him in the contests for preeminence.

## Notes
The comm. (with one of SPP's mss.) has in **b** the strange reading  
*vṛṣām* for *viśām;* and it treats *aham* and *uttareṣu* in **d** as two  
separate words. He takes *akṣṇuhi* as from *akṣ* 'attain' (*akṣū  
vyāptāu*), and so explains it (*nirgatavyāptikān kuru*). ⌊See Delbrück's  
discussion, *Gurupūjākāumudī*, p. 48-9.⌋ TB. combines **a** of this  
verse (reading *kṣatríyāṇām* for *-yam me*) with **b, c, d** of our vs.  
3. In our edition, an *anusvāra* is substituted for an accent-mark over  
the syllable *-nra-* in **d**.

## Translation
2. Portion thou this man in village, in horses, in kine; unportion that  
man who is his enemy; let this king be the summit of authorities  
(*kṣatrá*); O Indra, make every foe subject to him.

## Notes
Ppp. elides the *a* of *amitras* in **b**, and in **c** has the better  
reading *varṣman* 'at the summit,' which is also offered by the comm.,  
and by three of SPP's mss. TB. has *várṣman*, but as first word of a  
very different half-verse, our iii. 4. 2 **c, d**, which it adds to our  
first half-verse here to make a complete verse; in **a** it has *imám ā́*  
instead of *é ’mám*, and in **b** *nír amúm* instead of *níṣ ṭám*, thus  
rectifying the meter (the Anukr. takes no notice of the metrical  
irregularity of our **b**); and it leaves *asya* without accent at the  
end. Nearly half the mss. (including our P.M.W.I.K.) have in **d**  
*śátrūṅ*, and the comm. seems to understand *śatrūn*. ⌊TB. combines *yò  
’mítro*, against the meter.⌋

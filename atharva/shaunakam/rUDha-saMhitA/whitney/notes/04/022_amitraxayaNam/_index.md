## Comment
Found in Pāipp. iii. (with vs. 3 before vs. 2), and most of it also in TB. (ii. 4. 77-8). Used by Kāuś. (14. 24) in a rite for victory in battle (the editor of Kāuś. regards the next hymn also as included, but evidently by an error), and also in the ceremony of consecration of a king (17. 28) ⌊Weber, Rājasūya, p. 142⌋; and the comm. mistakenly regards it as quoted at 72. 7, giving the pratīka as imam indra, instead of imam indram, as Kāuś. really reads (xii. 2. 47, evidently the verse intended). The Anukr. spreads itself at very unusual length over the character of the hymn: imam indra vardhaye ’ti vasiṣṭha āindraṁ trāiṣṭubhaṁ so ‘tharvā kṣatriyāya rājñe candramase prathamābhiḥ pañcabhir niramitrīkaraṇamukhyene ’ndram aprārthayad grāmagavāśvādi sarvaṁ rājyopakaraṇaṁ ca tataḥ parābhyām antyābhyām indrarūpeṇa svayam eva kṣatriyaṁ rājānaṁ candramasain āśiṣā prāṇudad iti. Probably Vasiṣṭha is the intended ṛṣi-name, and so ‘tharvā (one ms. sāuth-) a misreading for something else.

## Translation
6. Superior \[art\] thou, inferior thy rivals, whosoever, O king, are  
thine opposing foes; sole chief, having Indra as companion, having  
conquered, bring thou in the enjoyments (*bhójana*) of them that play  
the foe.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *adhare santv anye*. TB. puts together **a** and **c**  
as first half of a verse to the other half of which our text has nothing  
corresponding; and it reads *ékavṛṣā* for *ehavṛṣás*. The comm. takes  
*prati* and *śatravas* in **b** as two independent words; he paraphrases  
*bhójanāni* by *bhogasādhanāni dhanāni*.

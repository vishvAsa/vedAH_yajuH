## Translation
3. He who was born forth the knowing relative of it speaks all the  
births (*jániman*) of the gods; he bore up the *bráhman* from the midst  
of the *bráhman;* downward, upward, he set forth unto the *svadhā́s*.

## Notes
This is found elsewhere only in TS. (ii. 3. 14⁶), which, in **a, b**,  
has the less unmanageable *asyá bándhuṁ víśvāni devó ján-;* and, in  
**d**, *nīcā́d uccā́ svadháyā ’bhi*. Ppp. seems to aim at nearly the same  
readings with its *bandhuṁ viśvāṁ devā jan-*, and *nīcād uccā svadhayā  
’ti*. Most of the mss. (including our P.M.W.E.l.K.Kp.) read *yajñé* for  
*jajñé* in **a**; our O. omits the *ḥ* of *uccāiḥ*, and Op. omits that  
of *svadhā́ḥ*. The comm. gives alternative explanations of various of the  
parts of the verse, trying *prá jajñé* both from *jan* and from *jñā*  
(the translation takes it from *jan*, as no middle form from *pra-jñā*  
occurs elsewhere in the text); and *svadhā́s* as either object or subject  
of *pra tasthāu* (in the latter case *tasthāu* being for *tasthire* by  
the usual equivalence of all verbal forms), and at any rate signifying  
some kind of sacrificial food.

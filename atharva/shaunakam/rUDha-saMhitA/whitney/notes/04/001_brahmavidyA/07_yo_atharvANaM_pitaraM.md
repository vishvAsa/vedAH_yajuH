## Translation
7. Whoso shall approach (? *ava-gam*) with homage father Atharvan,  
relative of the gods, Brihaspati—in order that thou mayest be generator  
of all, poet, god, not to be harmed, self-ruling (? *svadhā́vant*).

## Notes
The translation implies in **d** emendation of *dábhāyat* to *dábhāya;*  
both editions have the former, with all the mss. and the comm. (who  
comfortably explains it by *dabhnoti* or *hinasti*). The comm. also  
reads in **b** *bṛhaspatis;* and this is supported by the Ppp. version:  
*yathā vā ’tharvā pitaraṁ viśvadevaṁ bṛhaspatir manasā vo datsva:* and  
so on (**c, d** defaced). The comm. takes *ava gachāt* as = *jānīyāt*,  
and *svadhāvān* as 'joined with food in the form of oblation."

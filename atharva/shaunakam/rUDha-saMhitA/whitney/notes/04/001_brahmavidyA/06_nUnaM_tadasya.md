## Translation
6. Verily doth the *kāvyá* further (*hi*) that of him—the abode (?  
*dhā́man*) of the great god of old (*pūrvyá*); he was born together with  
many thus, sleeping now in the loosened (*vi-si*) eastern half.

## Notes
No other text has this verse—save Ppp., which has for **d** *pūrvādarād  
aviduraś ca sahruḥ*. The comm. reads in **b** *pūrvasya,* and two or  
three mss. (including our P.) agree with him. Some mss. (including our  
O.Op.) have at the end *sasáṁ nú;* and the comm. also so reads,  
explaining *sasa* as an *annanāman;* the true reading is possibly  
*sasánn u* (but the *pada*-text divides *sasán: nú*). The comm. explains  
*kāvya* as *yajña* (from *kavi* = *ṛtvij*), *dhāman* as *tejorūpam  
maṇḍalātmakaṁ sthānam*, *eṣa* in **c** as the sun, and the "many" his  
thousand rays, and *viṣita* as *viśeṣeṇa sambaddha*. The last pāda lacks  
a syllable, unless we resolve *pū́-ru-e*.

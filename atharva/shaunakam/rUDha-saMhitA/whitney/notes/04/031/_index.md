## Comment
This verse is found further in TB. (in ii. 4. 110). RV. and TB. read for b hárṣamāṇāso dhṛṣitā́* marutvaḥ; at beginning of d, RV. has the decidedly preferable abhí for úpa; TB. gives in d yanti, and this is also the reading of Ppp.—which moreover separates tīkṣṇā iṣ- in c, and combines -çāno ’pa in c-d. Three of our mss. (O.Op.K.) so far agree with RV. as to read dhṛṣitāsas in b; the comm. has instead ruṣitāsas. The comm. explains manyús as krodhābhimānī devaḥ 'wrath personified as a god.' *⌊In both ed's, TB. has the adverb dhṛṣatā́.⌋

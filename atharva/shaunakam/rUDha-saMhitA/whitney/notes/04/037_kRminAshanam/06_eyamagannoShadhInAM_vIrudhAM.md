## Translation
6. Hither hath come this mighty one (*vīryàvant*) of the herbs, of the  
plants; let the goat-horned *arāṭakī́*, the sharp-horned, push out.

## Notes
⌊Put a simple *avasāna*-mark in place of the number 5.⌋ *Arāṭakī* seems  
to be used here as specific name of the herb in question; but the comm.  
takes it as epithet, deriving it from *a-rā* 'non-giving' with a  
derivative from *aṭ* 'go,' and meaning *hiṅsakān uccāṭayati!* Ppp. adds  
two more pādas: *ape ’te ’to ‘psaraso gandharvā yatra vo gṛhāḥ.*

## Translation
5. Where \[are\] your swings, green and whitish; where cymbals \[and\]  
lutes sound together—thither go away, ye Apsarases; ye have been  
recognized.

## Notes
⌊Change the number 4 to 5 at the end of the first line of p. 74 of the  
edition.⌋ The accent *karkaryás* as nom. plur. is false, and must be  
emended to *-ryàs*, as read by SPP. with half of his mss., and a part  
(O.Op.D.) of ours (our P.M.W. give *karkayás*). Again nearly all our  
mss., with some of SPP's, accent *apsarásas* in the refrain. Ppp. is  
quite corrupt: *yatra vokhsā haritārjunā ghātāṣ karkarī asaṁvadanti*.  
The first half-verse (13 + 11: 8 + 8) is irregular.

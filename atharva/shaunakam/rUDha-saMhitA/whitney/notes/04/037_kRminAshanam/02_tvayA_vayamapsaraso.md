## Translation
2. By thee do we expel (*cat*) the Apsarases, the Gandharvas; O  
goat-horned one, drive the demon; make all disappear by \[thy\] smell.

## Notes
'Drive' (*aja*) in **c** is a play upon the name goat (*aja-*) in  
'goat-horned.' The comm. declares the epithet to be equivalent to  
*viṣāṇin* (*Odina pinnata*), and to be given on account of the shape of  
the fruit. ⌊Dhanvantari, p. 23, Poona ed., gives *meṣaśṛn̄gī* and  
*viṣāṇikā* as synonyms of *ajaśṛn̄gī*.⌋ Ppp. has in **b** *cātayāmasi*  
instead of *-mahe*.

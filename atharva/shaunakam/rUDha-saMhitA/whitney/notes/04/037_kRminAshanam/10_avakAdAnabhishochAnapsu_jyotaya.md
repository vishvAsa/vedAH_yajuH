## Translation
10. The *ávakā*-eating ones, scorching, making light (?) in the  
waters—all the *piśācás*, O herb, do thou slaughter and overpower.

## Notes
All our *pada*—mss. read in **b** *jyotaya॰māmakā́n* as a compound, and  
it seems very strange that SPP. gives in both forms of text *jyotaya  
māmakā́n*, as two independent words, and reports nothing different as  
found in any of his authorities; it is perhaps an oversight on his part.  
Either reading being plainly untranslatable, the rendering given implies  
emendation to *jyotayamānakā́n*, as the simplest and most probable  
alteration; several cases of such expansions of a participle in *māna*  
by an added *-ka* occur ⌊*Skt. Gram.* §1222 g, f; cf. Bloomfield's  
note⌋, one of them (*pravartamānaká*) even in RV. Ppp. reads as follows:  
*avakāśaṁ abhiśāco bicchi dyātayamānakāṁ: gandharvān sarvān oṣadhe kṛṇu  
tasvaparāyaṇaḥ;* this supports the proposed reading in its most  
essential feature, *-māna-* for *-māma-*, and further favors the version  
of the comm., *dyot-* for *jyot-*. R., in the *Festgruss an Böhtlingk*  
(p. 97), had ingeniously conjectured the word as a name for the  
will-o'-the-wisp, deriving it from *jyotaya mām* 'give me light,' by an  
added suffix *-aka*. The comm. paraphrases by *matsambandhino gandharvān  
udakeṣu prakāśaya*. ⌊Cf. Whitney, *Festgruss an Roth*, p. 91; also note  
to ii. 3. 1.⌋

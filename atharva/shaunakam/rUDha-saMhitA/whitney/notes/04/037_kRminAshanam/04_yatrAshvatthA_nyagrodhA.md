## Translation
4. Where \[are\] the *aśvatthás*, the *nyagródhas*, great trees, with  
crests: thither go away, ye Apsarases; ye have been recognized.

## Notes
The division and numbering in our edition of this verse and the two next  
following is faulty, owing to the unclearness of the mss. first used;  
the correct division, agreeing with the Anukr., is given by SPP., and  
our translation follows it ⌊and makes clear what it is⌋; vss. 3-5 all  
end with the refrain *tát páre ’tā-* etc., and this, with the number 4,  
needs to be added in our text after *śikhaṇḍínaḥ*. In Ppp., the place of  
this verse is taken by the addition reported above, under vs. 3. The  
comm. takes *śikhaṇḍin* as meaning "peacocks"; he quotes TS. iii. 4. 84  
to the effect that certain trees, including *aśvattha* and *nyagrodha*,  
are the houses of Gandharvas and Apsarases.

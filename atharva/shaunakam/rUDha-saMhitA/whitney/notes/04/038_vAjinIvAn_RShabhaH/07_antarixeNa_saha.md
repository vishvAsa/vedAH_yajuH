## Translation
7. Together with the atmosphere, O mighty one; defend thou here the  
*karkī́* calf, O vigorous one; this is fodder; this is the pen; here we  
bind (*ni-bandh*) the calf; according to name we master you: hail!

## Notes
The comm., with one of SPP's oral authorities, has again *vatsān* in  
**b**, and also *vatsān* in **d** (this time, with our P.M.W.E.). Kāuś.  
(21. 11) quotes **c** and **d**, with the direction to do "as directed  
in the text"; the comm. ⌊Keśava⌋ explains that a rope is to be prepared  
with twelve ties (*dāman*); and that with **c** fodder is to be offered  
to the kine, and with **d** the calves are to be tied to the rope. If  
this is correct, the reading would seem to be properly *vatsān* in all  
cases, and perhaps *karkyā̀*(*ḥ*) *vatsā́n* in 6 **b** and 7 **b**  (thus  
filling out the meter). The mss. add (as directed by the Anukr.) a  
second *avasāna-*sign after *badhnīmaḥ*, and SPP. retains it. The verse  
(11 + 10: 8 + 8: 10 = 47) falls short of a full *jagatī* by the amount  
of the deficiency in **b**. ⌊I think *karkyā̀s*, as a genitive sing.  
fem., ought to be oxytone (JAOS. x. 385); but *karkyàs*, pronounced  
*karkío*, might be better.⌋

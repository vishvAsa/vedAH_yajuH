## Translation
3. She who dances about with the dice (? *áya*), taking to herself the  
winning from the pool—let her, trying to gain (?) for us the winnings,  
obtain the stake (? *prahā́*) by magic (*māyā́*); let her come to us rich  
in milk; let them not conquer from us this riches.

## Notes
The wholly anomalous *sīṣatī́* in **c** is here translated, in accordance  
with the current understanding of it, as somehow coming from the root  
*san* or *sā* ⌊i.e., as if it were for the normal *sí-ṣā-s-atī:*  
considering that the consonant of the root sd happens to coincide with  
the sibilant which is characteristic of the desiderative, we might be  
tempted to put *sīṣánt: sā:: sī́kṣant: sah* (*Skt. Gram.* §1030 a), but  
for the accent⌋; the comm. reads instead *śéṣantī* (= *avaśeṣayantī*).  
The comm. further has in **b** *ādadhānas* (explained as = *ādadhānā:*  
so SPP's K. reads), and in **d** *prahān* (= *prahantavyān akṣān:* a  
false etymology and worthless interpretation). He explains *ayās* as  
*ekādayaḥ pañcasaṁkhyāntā akṣaviśeṣāḥ*. He divides our vss. 3-5 into  
four verses of four pādas each, without any regard to the connection of  
sense, thus giving the hymn eight verses; among our mss. also (SPP.  
reports nothing of the kind from his) there is more or less discordance  
in regard to the verse-division, and some of them agree with the comm.  
⌊Our *sīṣatī́* appears in W's *Index Verborum*, p. 382, at the very end  
of the "unclassified residuum" of AV. material.⌋

## Comment
Verses 1-6 are found as a hymn in Pāipp. v., and hymns 18 and 19 follow it there, with some mixture of the verses. Vs. 8 is found separately in ii. Hymns 17-19 are called by the comm. āvapanīya 'of strewing.' They are used together by Kāuś. (39. 7), with ii. 11 and iv. 40 and others, in the preparation of consecrated water to counteract hostile sorcery; and vs. 17. 5 is reckoned by the schol. (46. 9, note) to the duḥsvapnanāśana gaṇa.

## Translation
2. The truly-conquering, the curse-repelling, the overcoming, the  
reverted one (*punaḥsará*)—all the herbs have I called together, saying  
"may they (?) save us from this."

## Notes
The last pāda is translated in accordance with the better reading of  
Ppp.: *ato mā pārayān iti*. In **b**, Ppp. gives *punaścarā;* SPP.  
presents *punaḥs-*, in closer accordance with the mss. than our  
*punass-*. The comm. does not recognize the meaning 'reverted' (i.e.  
'having reverted leaves or fruit') as belonging to *punaḥsará*, but  
renders it as "repeatedly applied" (*ābhīkṣṇyena bahutaravyādhinivṛttaye  
sarati*). He reads in **a** *śapathayopanīm*, and in **c** *abhi* (for  
*ahvi*): and one or two of SPP's mss. support him each time; our O.Op.  
give *addhi*, by a recent copyist's blunder; the comm. supplies  
*gacchanti* for his *sam-abhi* to belong to. The Anukr. takes no notice  
of the excess of two syllables in **a**.

## Translation
4. What \[witchcraft\] they have made for thee in the raw vessel  
(*pā́tra*), what they have made in the blue-red one, in raw flesh what  
witchcraft they have made—with that do thou smite the witchcraft-makers.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The verse is nearly accordant with v. 31. 1 below. Ppp. reads in **b**  
*yā sūtre nīl-*. A raw vessel is one of unburnt clay (*apakve mṛtpātre*,  
comm.). The comm. defines "the blue-red one" as fire, blue with smoke,  
red with flame\*; and the "raw flesh" as that of a cock or other animal  
used for the purposes of the charm. The *kṛtyā* appears to be a concrete  
object into which an evil influence is conveyed by sorcery, and which  
then, by depositing or burying, becomes a source of harm to those  
against whom the sorcery is directed (*mantrāuṣadhādibhiḥ śatroḥ  
pīḍākarīm*, comm. to iv. 18. 2). The comm. reads *tvayā* in **d**, and  
first pronounces it used by substitution for *tvam*, then retains it in  
its proper sense and makes *jahi* mean *hantavyās:* both are examples of  
his ordinary grammatical principles. The Anukr. ignores the metrical  
irregularity of **c** ⌊reject *yā́ṁ*.⌋ \*⌊Bloomfield, on the basis of  
Kāuś., interprets it as a thread of blue and red; and this is confirmed  
by the Ppp. *sūtre.*⌋

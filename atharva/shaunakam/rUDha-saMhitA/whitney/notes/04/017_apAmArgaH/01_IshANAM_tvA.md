## Translation
1. Thee, the mistress of remedies, O conquering one (*ujjeṣá*), we take  
hold of; I have made thee a thing of thousand-fold energy (*-vīryà*) for  
every one, O herb.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **b** *nijeṣā ”gṛṇīmahe*. We should expect in **c**  
*-vīryām*, and three of SPP's mss. (none of ours) so read; but he has  
not ventured to admit it into his text; the comm. gives *-yam*, but  
explains as if *-yām* (*aparimitasāmarthyayuktām*). The comm. regards  
the plant *sahadevī* (name of various plants, including *Sida  
cordifolia* and *rhombifolia*, OB.) as addressed. He takes *ujjeṣe* in  
**b** as dative, = *ujjetum*.

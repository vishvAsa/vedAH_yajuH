## Translation
4. Away we make thine intoxication fly, like an arrow (*śará*), O  
intoxicating one (f.); we make thee with our spell (*vácas*) to stand  
forth, like a boiling pot.

## Notes
The comm. (with a pair of SPP's mss.) reads *śarúm* in **b**\*; it also  
(alone) has *jeṣantam* (= *prayatamānam*) in **c**; one of our mss.  
(Op.), with two or three of SPP's, give instead *péṣantam*. Ppp. has a  
peculiar **c**: *pari tvā varmi veśantam*. The verse is regular if we  
make the ordinary abbreviation of *iva* to *’va* in **b** and **c**.  
\*⌊The reciters K and V gave *śarúm:* comm. renders as if *śárum*  
'arrow.' BR. render the verb in **d** by 'wegstellen.' When you set the  
pot aside (take it off the fire), it stops boiling; and so the poison is  
to stop working. But see also Weber's note.⌋

## Comment
Found in Pāipp., but not all together; vs. 1 occurs in v., vss. 2-6 in ii., and vs. 7 in vi. Not used by Kāuś. unless it is properly regarded by the schol. and the comm. (see under h. 6) as included with h. 6 by the citation (28. 1) of the latter's pratīka (the comm. puts it on the ground of the paribhāṣā rule grahaṇam ā grahaṇāt, Kāuś. 8. 21).

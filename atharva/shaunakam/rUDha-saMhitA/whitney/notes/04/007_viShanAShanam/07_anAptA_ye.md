## Translation
7. Who of you did what first unattained deeds—let them not harm our  
heroes here; for that purpose I put you forward.

## Notes
This verse occurs again later, as v. 6. 2, and in Ppp. makes a part of  
that hymn alone. Its sense is very questionable, and its connection  
casts no light upon it, either here or there; and Grill is justified in  
omitting it as having apparently nothing to do with the rest of this  
hymn. All the *pada*-mss. save one of SPP's read *ánaptā* (not *-tāḥ*);  
and all save our Bp. read *prathamā́ḥ* (Bp. *-mā́*); SPP. gives in his  
*pada*-text *-tāḥ* and *-mā́h*; the translation here given implies *-tā*  
and *-mā́*, without intending to imply that the other readings may not be  
equally good; the comm. takes *ánāptāḥ* (= *ananukūlāḥ* ⌊'unkindly'⌋) as  
qualifying *śatravas* understood, and *prathamā́* as qualifying  
*kármāṇi*.

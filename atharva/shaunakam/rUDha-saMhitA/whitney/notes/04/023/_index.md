## Comment
Found,* with the six hymns that follow, all together (but in the order 23, 25, 27, 26, 28, 29, 24), in Pāipp. iv. The seven are known by Kāuç. (9. 1) as the mṛgāra hymns (also by the schol., as by the Anukr.; that the comm. to h. 21 gives the name to 21-30 was there remarked; here he speaks of "a heptad of hymns" as intended in 9. 1); they are reckoned (9. 1) to the bṛhachāntigaṇa, and also (32. 27, note) to the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa; and they are employed in a healing rite (27. 34). In Vāit. the hymn accompanies the kindling of the fire in the parvan sacrifices (2. 11), and vs. 4 is similarly used (5. 15) in the agnyādheya. It was noted under the preceding hymn that the editor of Kāuç. mistakenly regards this one as included in Kāuç. 14. 24. The first and last verses ⌊of each⌋ of the mṛgāra hymns are given also by TS. (iv. 7. 15), MS. (iii. 16. 5), and K. (xxii. 15); only the hymn to Bhava and Çarva (our 28) is omitted, and, on the other hand, those texts have similar invocations to the Açvins and to all the gods. And the comm. to our h. 24 quotes also TS. vii. 5. 22, where a mṛgāreṣṭi with ten oblations, to the divinities worshiped with the verses in question, is prescribed. ⌊See further, as to this litany, Weber's note, p. 95 f.—The mṛgāra-verses occur in TS. and MS. at the very end of the kāṇḍas (iv. and iii.) concerned.⌋ *⌊In the verse-order 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.⌋

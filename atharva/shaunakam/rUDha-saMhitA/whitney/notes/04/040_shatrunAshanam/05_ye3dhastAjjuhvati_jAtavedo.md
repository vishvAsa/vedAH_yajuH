## Translation
5. They who make offering from below, O Jātavedas, \[who\] from the  
fixed quarter vex us—having come upon Earth, let them etc. etc.

## Notes
Here, again, part of our mss. (E.I.H.), and nearly all SPP's, give the  
false accent *bhūmím;* both editions read *bhū́mim*. The other texts  
associate Aditi with "this quarter," or "the quarter here," as they  
style it.

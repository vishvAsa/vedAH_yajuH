## Translation
9. Agni moves (*car*), entered into the fire, son of the seers,  
protector against imprecation; with homage-paying, with homage, I make  
offering to thee; let us not make falsely the share of the gods.

## Notes
That is (**a**), 'Agni is continually to be found in the fire.' Three of  
SPP's authorities read *mánasā* in **c**, thus ridding the verse of an  
objectionable repetition; but both editions give *námasā*, which the  
comm. also has. In **d** our edition has *karmabhāgám*, following the  
*pada-*mss. (which read *karma॰bhāgám*); but SPP. has correctly, with  
his mss. and the comm. (= *mā kārṣma*), *karma bhāgám*. More or less of  
the verse is found in several other texts: thus, in VS. (v. 4) only **a,  
b**, ending **b** with *abhiśastipā́vā;* in MS. (i. 2. 7), with *adhirājá  
eṣáḥ* at end of **b**, a wholly different **c**, and, for **d**, *mā́  
devā́nāṁ yūyupāma bhāgadhéyam;* in MB. (ii. 2. 12), only **a, b**, with  
**b** ending as in MS.; in TS. (i. 3. 7²) the whole verse, **b** ending  
like MS., **c** beginning with *svāhākṛ́tya bráhmaṇā*, and **d** ending  
with *mithuyā́ kar bhāgadhéyam;* in TB. (ii. 7. 15¹), the whole,  
beginning with *vyāghrò ‘yám agnāú car-*, and ending **b** with *-pā́  
ayám*, its **c** and **d** agreeing throughout with ours; in AśS. (viii.  
14. 4), the whole, but ending **b**\* like MS. and TS., and having for  
**c, d** *tasmāi juhomi haviṣā ghṛtena mā devānām momuhad bhāgadheyam;*  
⌊in Ppp., the whole verse, just as in AśS., except that **a** ends with  
*praviṣṭā* and that **d** has *yūyavad* for *momuhad* and (unless *māṁ*  
is a slip of Roth's pen) *māṁ* for *mā*⌋. ⌊See Bloomfield's discussion  
of *mithuyā́ kṛ*, ZDMG. xlviii. 556.⌋ The meter (10 + 11: 12 + 11 = 44)  
is irregular, but the Anukr. takes no notice of it. \*⌊The Calcutta ed.  
has *avirāja eṣaḥ*, misprint for *adhi-*.⌋

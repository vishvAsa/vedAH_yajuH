## Translation
6. One of the golds art thou; out of soma wast thou born; thou art  
conspicuous on the chariot, lustrous (*rocaná*) on the quiver thou. May  
it prolong our lives!

## Notes
The last pāda, which occurs in four other places (ii. 4. 6 etc.), looks  
like a late addition here; as elsewhere, some of the mss. (five of  
SPP's) read *tārṣat*. Except our Op., all the *pada*-mss. blunderingly  
resolve *sómātvám* (as it would be permissibly and customarily read by  
abbreviation: see Whitney, *Skt. Gr.* §232) into *sómā: tvám* instead of  
*sómāt: tvám;* the comm. understands *sómāt*, and both editions give the  
full reading. Here one is strongly tempted to translate *soma* by  
"moon," and the comm. takes it so (*amṛtamayāt somamaṇḍalāt*); but Ppp.  
discourages it by reading *sa hoṣād* (for *-mād?*) *adhi*. The comm.  
glosses *rocana* by *rocamāna dīpyamāna*. For **c**, Ppp. has *ratheṣu  
darśatam*.

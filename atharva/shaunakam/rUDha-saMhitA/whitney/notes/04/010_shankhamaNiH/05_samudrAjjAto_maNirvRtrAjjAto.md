## Translation
5. The amulet born from the ocean, born from Vṛtra, making day—let it  
protect us on all sides from the missile of gods and Asuras.

## Notes
The comm. makes Vṛtra here signify either the demon Vṛtra or the cloud;  
doubtless the latter is intended; then he explains *divākara* as the  
sun, and *jāta* as "released," and renders "as brilliant as the sun  
freed from the clouds," which is extremely artificial; *divākara* need  
mean no more than 'flashing with light.' The comm. also foolishly  
understands in **d** *hetyā* instead of *-ās* (p. *hetyā́ḥ*). ⌊*Dev-*,  
ablative by attraction, from gen.—cf. *Skt. Gram.* §982 a.⌋ The first  
pāda is deficient by a syllable, unless we resolve *samudrā́t* into four  
syllables.

## Translation
7. Knowing this, O ointment, I shall speak truth, not falsehood; may I  
win (*san*) a horse, a cow, thy soul, O man (*púruṣa*).

## Notes
The latter half-verse is RV. x. 97. 4 **c, d** (which is also, without  
variant, VS. xii. 78 **c, d**), where we read *vā́sas* instead of *ahám;*  
Ppp., too, gives *vāsās*. All the mss. and the comm. have at the end the  
absurd form *puruṣas* (nom., but without accent); the comm. (whose text,  
as SPP. points out in more than one place, is unaccentuated) understands  
"I, thy man (retainer)." Both editions make the necessary emendation to  
*puruṣa* ⌊s. *pūruṣa*⌋. Ppp. gives *pāuruṣa*. SPP. makes a note that  
*sanéyam* is so accented by all his authorities—as if anything else were  
possible ⌊does he have in mind *sáneyam?* see Whitney, *Roots*, p. 183⌋.  
The first pāda is defective unless we resolve *vi-du-ā́n* ⌊or  
*ā-añjana*⌋.—⌊R's supplementary report of Ppp. readings ends **a** with  
*āñjanas* and has for **d** *āñjana taṁva pāuruṣaḥ*. As noted above,  
this vs. stands at the end in Ppp. and before it is inserted the vs.  
given under vi. 76. 4.⌋

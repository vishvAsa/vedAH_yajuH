## Translation
1. Come thou, rescuing the living one; of the mountain art thou for the  
eyes (?), given by all the gods, an enclosure (*paridhí*) in order to  
living.

## Notes
*Jīvám* in **a** might also be coördinate with *trā́yamāṇam;* the comm.  
understands it as translated. The meter indicates that the true reading  
at the end of **b** is *ákṣyam*, and this is read by SPP., with the  
alleged support of all his authorities save one, which follows the comm.  
in giving *ákṣam;* our Bp. has *ákṣam*, and our edition accepted that  
(our Op. has *akṣyàm*, our I. *ákṣyàm*); but *akṣya* is unknown  
elsewhere, and its meaning in this connection is quite obscure; perhaps  
allusion is intended to a legend reported in MS. iii. 6. 3 (p. 62. 8;  
cf. also TS. vi. 1. 1⁵ and śB. iii. 1. 3. 12): "Indra verily slew Vṛtra;  
his eye-ball flew away; it went to Trikakubh; that ointment of Trikakubh  
he spreads on." The ointment of this mountain is most efficacious for  
the eyes, and hence also for the other purposes here had in view. The  
comm. gives *cakṣus* as the value of his *akṣam*. Grill suggests  
emendation to *akṣayyam* or *akṣaram*. We have to make the harsh  
resolution *ví-śu-e-* in **c** or leave the pāda defective.

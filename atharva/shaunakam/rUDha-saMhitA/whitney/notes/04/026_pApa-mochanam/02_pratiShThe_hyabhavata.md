## Translation
2. Since ye became foundations of good things, ye much increased,  
divine, fortunate, wide-extended ones, O heaven-and-earth, be pleasant  
to me: do ye free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *babhūvathus* (for *ábhavatam*). The comm., with a  
couple of SPP's mss., reads *praviddhe* (= *sūtravat  
sarvajagadanupraviddhe*) in **b**. As noted under vs. 1, SV. has  
(omitting *me* in **c**) the second half-verse, here carried on as  
refrain through vss. 3-6. ⌊In **c**, scan *-pṛthvī...sioné*.⌋

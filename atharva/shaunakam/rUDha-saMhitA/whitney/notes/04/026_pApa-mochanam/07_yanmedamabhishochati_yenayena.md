## Translation
7. This that scorches (*abhi-śuc*) me, or by whomsoever done, from what  
is human, not divine—I praise heaven-and-earth, \[as\] a suppliant I  
call loudly on \[them\]: do ye free us from distress.

## Notes
The verse looks as if broken off in the middle, to allow addition of the  
regular close. Ppp. has at end of **b** the more manageable reading  
*pāuruṣeyaṁ na dāivyam*. TS.MS. have the second half-verse added to our  
1 **b, c**; but they have also our 7 **a, b** (in the form *yád idám mā  
’bhiśócati pāúruṣeyeṇa dāívyena*) as first half of a similar verse to  
"all the gods." The comm. understands *pāpāt* as to be supplied in  
**b**, and takes *na* as the particle of comparison.

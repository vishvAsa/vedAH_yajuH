## Translation
1. We reverence Indra; constantly do we reverence him; these  
praise-hymns (*stoma*) of the Vṛtra-slayer have come unto me; he who  
goes to the call of the worshiper (*dāśvā́ṅs*), of the well-doer—let him  
free us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **a** *indrasya manve śaśvad yasya manvire*, which is  
better, in both sense and meter. TS. and MS. (agreeing throughout) read  
*índrasya manve prathamásya prácetasaḥ* in **a**; in **b**, *úpa mā́m upā́  
’guḥ;* and, in **c**, *hávam úpa gántā*. The verse is properly enough  
*puraḥśakvarī*, but there is no reason why it should be called in  
addition *śakvarīgarbhā*.

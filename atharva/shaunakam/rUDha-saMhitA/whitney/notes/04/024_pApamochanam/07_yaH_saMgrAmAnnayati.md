## Translation
7. He who, controlling, leads together hosts (*saṁgrāmá*) for fighting;  
who mingles (*sam-sṛj*) the possessions (*puṣṭá*) of the two parties—I  
praise Indra, \[as a\] suppliant I call loudly on \[him\]: let him free  
us from distress.

## Notes
Ppp. has in **b** *puṣṭyā nas*. TS. and MS. read in **a** (as does also  
the comm.) the sing. *saṁgrānám*, and they put *yudhé* after *vaśī́;* at  
end of **b** they give *trayā́ṇi* instead of *dvayā́ni*. The comm. thinks  
*dvayāni* to be *strīpuṁsātmakāni mithunāni*.

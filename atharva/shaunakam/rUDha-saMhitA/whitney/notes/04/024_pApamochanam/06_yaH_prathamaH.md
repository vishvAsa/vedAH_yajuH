## Translation
6. He who was born first for the doing of deeds; of whom first the  
heroism was noted; by whom brandished (*ud-yam*) the thunderbolt went at  
(*abhi-i*) the dragon—let him free us from distress.

## Notes
As in one or two other cases,\* the mss. have in **a** *yajñé* instead  
of *jajñé;* but one or two of SPP's follow the comm., who reads *jajñé*,  
as does also Ppp.; and both of the editions give this. In **b** the  
comm., with three of SPP's authorities, gives *ánubaddham;* in **c** he  
derives *āyata* from root *yam*, and renders it by *ahiṅsīt;* we might  
emend to *abhyā́yató ‘him* and get a form from that root, which would  
yield a preferable sense. ⌊For the use of *abhi-i* with *vajra* as  
subject and with acc., Whitney has noted the excellent parallel, RV. i.  
80. 12.⌋ \*⌊So x. 10. 18.⌋

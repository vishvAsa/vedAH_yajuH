title = "०३ सहस्राक्षौ वृत्रहना"

## Translation
3. I call on the (two) thousand-eyed Vṛtra-slayers; I go praising the  
(two) formidable ones, having pastures afar: who lord it etc. etc.

## Notes
One of the oddest *pada*-text blunders of the whole work is made in  
**b**; *stuvánnemi* is resolved into *stuván: nemi* instead of *stuván:  
emi;* and then one or two of the mss. (including our Op.) corrupt  
further to *stuvát*, and the comm. to *nemī* (manufacturing for it two  
different, but equally absurd, explanations after his manner ⌊cf.  
*Festgruss an Roth*, p. 91⌋). Ppp. has in **a, b** *huve vā dūrehetī  
sunemi ugrāu*. ⌊Add *avasāna*-mark after *ugrāu*.⌋

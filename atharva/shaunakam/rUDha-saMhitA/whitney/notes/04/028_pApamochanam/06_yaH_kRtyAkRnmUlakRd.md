## Translation
6. Whoso is witchcraft-maker, root-cutter (?), sorcerer, down on him put  
\[your\] thunderbolt, O formidable ones; who lord it etc. etc.

## Notes
Ppp. is defaced in this verse, and omits *mūlakṛt*. The comm. takes  
*-kṛ́t* in a both times as from *kṛt* 'cut,' and *mūla-* as "offspring,  
the root of increase of a family"; the Pet. Lex. conjectures "preparing  
roots for purposes of witchcraft" ⌊see Bloomfield's note, p. 407⌋; one  
might also guess *mūrakṛ́t* ⌊see Weber's comment, p. 114⌋. Most of our  
mss. (all save H.p.m.K.D.), and the majority of SPP's, have the false  
reading *dhattām* in **b**; both editions give *-tam*.

## Translation
2. Fury \[was\] Indra, fury indeed was a god; fury \[was\] priest  
(*hótar*), Varuṇa, Jātavedas; the clans (*víś*) which are descended from  
Manu (*mā́nuṣa*) praise fury; protect us, O fury, in accord with fervor  
(*tápas*).

## Notes
The translation assumes in **c** the reading *manyúm* (instead of  
*-yús*), which is given by RV., the comm. (with one of SPP's mss.), and  
TB. (ii. 4. 1¹¹) and MS. (iv. 12. 3); the nomin. here appears to be a  
plain corruption, though Ppp. also has it. TB. gives in **a** *bhágas*  
for *índras*, and *devayántīs* for *mā́nuṣīr yā́ḥ* in **c**, and *śrámeṇa*  
for *sajóṣās* at the end; MS. has *ávā* for *pāhí* at beginning of  
**d**; both have *viśvávedās* at end of **b**. Ppp. reads *yaṣ* for  
*yāḥ* before *pāhi*.

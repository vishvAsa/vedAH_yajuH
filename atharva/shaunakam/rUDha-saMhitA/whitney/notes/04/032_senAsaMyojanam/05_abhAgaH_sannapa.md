## Translation
5. Being portionless, I am gone far away, by the action (? *krátu*) of  
thee that art mighty, O forethoughtful one; so at thee, O fury, I,  
actionless, was wrathful; come to us, thine own self (*tanū́*), giving  
strength.

## Notes
RV. has at the end *baladéyāya mé ’hi* (p. *mā: ā́: ihi*). In **c** it  
reads *jihīḍā ’hám*, and both the editions follow it (Ppp. and the comm.  
have the same), although the AV. *saṁhitā* reading is unquestionably  
*jī́hīḍ-*; the *saṁhitā* mss. have this almost without exception (all  
ours save O.), the *pada*-mss. put after the word their sign which shows  
a difference between *pada* and *saṁhitā* reading, and *jīh-* is twice  
distinctly prescribed by the Prāt. (iii. 14; iv. 87). The comm.  
understands the obscure first pāda of going away from battle; *akratu*  
he paraphrases by *tvattoṣakarakarmavarjita.*

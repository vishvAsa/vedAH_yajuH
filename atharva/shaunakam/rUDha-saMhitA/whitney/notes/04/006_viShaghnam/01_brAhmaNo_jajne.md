title = "०१ ब्राह्मणो जज्ञे"

## Translation
1. The Brahman was born first, with ten heads, with ten mouths; he first  
drank the soma; he made the poison sapless.

## Notes
The absence of this verse in Ppp., and the normal length of the hymn  
without it, together with its own senselessness, suggest strongly the  
suspicion of its unoriginality. To put meaning into it, the comm.  
maintains that the serpents have castes, as men have; and that their  
primal Brahman was Takṣaka.

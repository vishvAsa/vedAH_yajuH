## Translation
4. He of five fingers that hurled at thee from some crooked bow—from the  
tip (*śalyá*) of the *apaskambhá* have I exorcised (*nir-vac*) the  
poison.

## Notes
*Apaskambhá* is very obscure; the Pet. Lex. suggests "perhaps the  
fastening of the arrow-head to the shaft"; Ludwig guesses "barb," but  
that we have in vs. 5—as we also have *śalya*, which seems therefore  
premature here; and, in fact, Ppp. reads instead of it *bāhvos;* and, as  
it has elsewhere *apaskantasya bāhvos*, we might conjecture *apa  
skandhasya* etc., 'from shoulder and arms': i.e. from wounds in them.  
Or, for *apaskambha* as a part of the body might be compared *Suśruta*  
i. 349. 20—unless *apastambe* (which at least one good manuscript  
reads) is the true text there ⌊Calcutta ed. reads *apastambhāu*⌋. The  
comm. has no idea what *apaskambha* means, but makes a couple of wild  
guesses: it is the betel-nut (*kramuka*)-tree, or it is an arrow (both  
based on senseless etymologies). In **a**, Ppp. reads *-gulis*.

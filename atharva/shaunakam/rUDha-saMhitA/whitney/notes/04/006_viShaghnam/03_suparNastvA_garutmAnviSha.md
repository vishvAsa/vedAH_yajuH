## Translation
3. The winged (*garutmant*) eagle consumed (*av*) thee first, O poison;  
thou hast not intoxicated (*mad*), thou hast not racked (*rup*) \[him\];  
and thou becamest drink for him.

## Notes
At beginning of **b**, *víṣa* is read only ⌊by Ppp. and⌋ by the comm.  
and by one of SPP's mss. that follows him; all the rest have the gross  
blunder *víṣaḥ* (both editions emend to *víṣa*). Ppp. gives *ādayat* in  
**b**, and its second half-verse reads *nā ’ropayo nā ’mādayo tāsmā  
bhavan pituḥ*, thus removing the objectionable confusion of tenses made  
by our text. Our *arūrupas* is quoted as counter-example by the comment  
to Prāt. iv. 86. The first pāda might be rendered also 'the well-winged  
Garutmant,' and the comm. so understands it, adding the epithet  
*vāinateya* to show that *garutmant* = Garuḍa. He also takes the two  
aorists and the imperfect in **c-d** alike as imperatives (*nā ’rūrupas*  
= *vimūḍham mā kārṣīḥ*). The Anukr. does not note **a** as irregular.

## Translation
9. Waters, lightning, cloud, rain—let the liberal ones favor you, also  
the fountains, great serpents; let the clouds, started forward by the  
Maruts, show favor (*pra-av*) along the earth.

## Notes
Ppp. begins with *vātas* instead of *āpas*, and omits (as in 7 **a**)  
*vas* in **b**; and, for the last two pādas, it reads *prā pyāyasva pra  
pitṛsva saṁ bhūmiṁ payasā sṛja*. The comm. again takes *sudānavas* as  
vocative, and makes the elements mentioned in **a** subjects of *sam  
avantu;* in **d** he reads *plāvantu* but regards it as for *prā ’vantu*  
⌊parallel with *palāyate* etc. (W's *Gram.* §1087 c), for which he cites  
Pāṇini viii. 2. 19⌋.

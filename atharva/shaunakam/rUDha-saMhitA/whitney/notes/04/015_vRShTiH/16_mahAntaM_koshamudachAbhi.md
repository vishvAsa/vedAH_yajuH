## Translation
16. The great vessel (*kóśa*) do thou draw up (*ud-ac*); pour on; let   
there be lightnings; let the wind blow; let them extend the sacrifice,  
being manifoldly let loose; let the herbs become full of delight.

## Notes
Ppp. reads *mahantam* at beginning of **a**, and *visṛṣṭam* at end of  
**c**. The first pāda is nearly RV. v. 83. 8 **a**, which, however,  
reads *úd acā ní ṣiñca*. Our P.M.W. read *tanvántām* in **c**. The  
comm., doubtless correctly, understands the waters as the "them" of  
**c**; *úd aca* he explains as *samudrād udakapūrṇam uddhara;* he  
supplies *antarikṣam* to *savidyutam;* the expression is better  
understood as an impersonal one. ⌊With **b, d**, cf. RV. v. 83. 4 **a,  
b**.⌋  
  
Here ends the third *anuvāka*, having 5 hymns and 51 verses; the quoted  
Anukr. says *ekaviṅśatiḥ*.

title = "१४ उपप्रवद मण्डूकि"

## Translation
14. Speak forth unto \[it\], O she-frog; speak to the rain, O *tādurī;*  
swim in the midst of the pool, spreading thy four feet.

## Notes
Many of our mss. (P.M.E.I.H.K.) accent *úpa* ⌊cf. Prāt. iv. 3⌋ at the  
beginning. Ppp. reads *māṇḍūki* in **a**, and *tāṁdhuri* in **b**. The  
comm. defines *tādurī* as "she-offspring of the *tadura*," but gives no  
explanation of *tadura*. The verse is also found in a *khila* to RV.  
vii. 103, reading in **a** *upaplávada*, and in **c** *plavásva*. ⌊For  
14, 15, see Weber, *Berliner Sb.*, 1896, p. 257. As to metrical  
definition of 14, see vs. 8 n.⌋

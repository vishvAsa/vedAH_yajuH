title = "१३ संवत्सरं शशयाना"

## Translation
13. Having lain for a year, \[like\] Brahmans performing a vow, the  
frogs have spoken forth a voice quickened by Parjanya.

## Notes
The mss. (except one of SPP's, which follows the comm.) absurdly read  
*vā́tam* at beginning of **c**; both editions emend to *vā́cam*, which the  
comm. gives, and which is also read in the corresponding RV. verse, vii.  
103. 1. Ppp. has *māṇḍūkā* in **d**. In our edition, correct two  
printer's errors, reading *saṁvatsaráṁ* and *brāhmaṇā́*. ⌊Bloomfield  
discusses this vs. and the following, JAOS. xvii. 174, 179.⌋

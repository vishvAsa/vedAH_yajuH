## Translation
6. Roar on, thunder, excite (*ard*) the water-holder; anoint the earth,  
O Parjanya, with milk; by thee poured out, let abundant rain come; let  
him of lean kine, seeking refuge, go home.

## Notes
That is, let the herdsman whose animals have been thinned by the  
drought, now be even driven to shelter by the abundance of rain. Ppp.  
makes *sṛṣṭam* and *varṣam* change places, and is defaced at the end.  
The first three words are those of RV. v. 83. 7. The comm. (with two or  
three of SPP's mss. that follow him) reads in **d** *āsārāiṣī*, and  
renders it "seeking concurrence of streams"; our O.Op. have *-rāiśī́*.  
The comm. makes *kṛśagus* signify "the sun, with his rays made slender"!  
and, of course, he is to "set" (*astam i*), or be made invisible by the  
clouds. The Anukr. makes no account of the fact that **a** is *jagatī*.  
⌊For *āśāra*, see Lanman, *Trans. American Philological Association*,  
xv. (1884), p. vii.⌋

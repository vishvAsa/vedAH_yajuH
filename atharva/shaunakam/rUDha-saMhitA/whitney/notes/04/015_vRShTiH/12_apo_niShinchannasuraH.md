## Translation
12. Pouring down waters, our Asura father.

## Notes
Let the gurgles of the waters puff, O Varuṇa; let down the descending  
waters; let the speckled-armed frogs croak (*vad*) along the  
water-courses (*íriṇa*).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
What is left of the verse after transferring its first *triṣṭubh* pāda  
to vs. 11, where it belongs, is (but for the intruded word *varuṇa*,  
which is wanting in Ppp.) a regular *anuṣṭubh*, having its *avasāna*  
division after *sṛja;* and this is the division actually made in all  
the mss., and in SPP's text. Ppp. combines *gargarā ’pām*. The comm.  
declares *gargara* an imitative word (*īdṛgdhvaniyuktāḥ pravāhāḥ*), and  
the translation so renders it; as second pāda of the *anuṣṭubh* he reads  
*avanīcīr* (*avanim añcanti*, i.e. *bhūmiṁ gacchanti!*) *apa sṛja;* his  
first account of *asura* is as from *as* 'throw' (*meghānāṁ kṣeptā*).  
⌊Discussed and translated, apropos of *íriṇa*, by Pischel, *Ved. Stud.*  
ii. 223.⌋

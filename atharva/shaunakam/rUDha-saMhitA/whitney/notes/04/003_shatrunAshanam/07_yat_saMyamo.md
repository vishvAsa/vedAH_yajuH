## Translation
7. What thou contractest (*sam-yam*) mayest thou not protract  
(*vi-yam*); mayest thou protract what thou dost not contract;  
Indra-born, soma-born art thou, an Atharvan tiger-crusher (*-jámbhana*).

## Notes
The sense of **a, b** is obscure; the comm. takes *viyamas* and  
*saṁyamas* as two nouns. Ppp. makes one verse of our 7 **a, b** and 6  
**a, b** (omitting the other half-verses), and puts it next after our  
vs. 3; its version of 7 **a, b** is *yat saṁ naso vi yan naso na saṁ  
nasa*. The verse is scanned by the Anukr. as 8 + 8: 6 + 12 = 34  
syllables. ⌊Read *indrajā́ asi?*—For **a, b**, see Griffith.⌋

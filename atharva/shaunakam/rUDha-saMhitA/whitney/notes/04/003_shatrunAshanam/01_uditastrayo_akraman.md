## Translation
1. Up from here have stridden three—tiger, man (*púruṣa*), wolf; since  
hey! go the rivers, hey! the divine forest-tree, hey! let the foes bow.

## Notes
Ppp. reads for **a** *ud ity akramaṅs trayo;* in **c-d** it gives *hṛk*  
each time for *híruk*, and for **c** has *hṛg deva sūryas*. The comm.  
understands *híruk* to mean "in secret, out of sight," and *hírun̄  
namantu* as *antarhitāḥ santaḥ prahvā bhavantu* or *antaritān kurvantu*.  
The forest-tree is doubtless some implement of wood used in the rite,  
perhaps thrown in to float away with the river-current; it can hardly be  
the "stake of *khadira*" which Kāuś. (51. 1) mentions, which is to be  
taken up and buried as one follows the kine.

## Translation
3. Let thy marrow come together with marrow, and thy joint together with  
joint; together let what of thy flesh has fallen apart, together let thy  
bone grow over.

## Notes
Ppp. rectifies the meter of **a** by omitting *te*, and has for **d** ⌊?  
**b**?⌋ *saṁstrāvam asu parva te*. A few of the mss. (including our  
H.O.Op.) give *viśrastam* in **c**. The comm. reads *śam* instead of  
*sam* in every pāda. A couple of SPP's mss., by a substitution found  
also elsewhere ⌊see ii. 12. 7, note⌋, have *manyā́* for *majjñā́* in  
**a**. The Anukr. ignores the redundant syllable in the first pāda.

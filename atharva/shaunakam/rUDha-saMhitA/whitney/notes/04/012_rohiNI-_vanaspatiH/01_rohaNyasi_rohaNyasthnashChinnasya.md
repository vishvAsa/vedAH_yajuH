## Translation
1. Grower art thou, grower; grower of severed bone; make this grow, O  
*arundhatī́*.

## Notes
*Arundhatī́*, lit. 'non-obstructing,' appears to be the name of a  
climbing plant having healing properties; it is mentioned more than once  
elsewhere, and in v. 5 (vss. 5 and 9) along with *lākṣā* (vs. 7) 'lac';  
and the comm. to the present hymn repeatedly declares *lākṣā* to be the  
healing substance referred to in it; probably it is a product of the  
*arundhatī*. Ppp. has every time *rohiṇī* instead of *rohaṇī*, and so  
the comm. also reads; the manuscripts of Kāuś., too, give *rohiṇī* in  
the pratīka, as does the schol. under 28. 14. There is evident punning  
upon the name and the causative *rohaya-* 'make grow'; perhaps the true  
reading of **a** is *róhaṇy asi rohiṇī* 'thou art a grower, O red one,'  
bringing in the color of the lac as part of the word-play; the comm.  
assumes *rohiṇi*, voc., at end of **a** (*he lohitavarṇe lākṣe*). Ppp.  
further reads *śīrṇasya* instead of *chinnásya;* and has, in place of  
our **c**, *rohiṇyām arha ātā ’si rohiṇyā ’sy oṣadhe*, making the verse  
an *anuṣṭubh*. The comm. gives *asnas* for *asthnas* in **b**.

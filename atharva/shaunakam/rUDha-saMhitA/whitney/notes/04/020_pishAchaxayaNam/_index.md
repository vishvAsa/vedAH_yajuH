## Comment
Found in Pāipp. viii. (in the verse-order 1-4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 5). Reckoned by Kāuç. (8. 25) to the cātanāni; and by the schol. (8. 24, note) added to the mātṛnāmāni: with good reason, if we may trust the Anukr. (which adds to what is given above: anena mātṛnāmāu ’ṣadhim evā ’stāut); but the comm. says nothing about it. The hymn is used by itself (28. 7) to accompany the binding on of an amulet of sadampuṣpā 'ever-flowering' (or, as the comm. and schol. say, trisandhyā) in a healing ceremony (the comm. says, against brahmagraha and the like).

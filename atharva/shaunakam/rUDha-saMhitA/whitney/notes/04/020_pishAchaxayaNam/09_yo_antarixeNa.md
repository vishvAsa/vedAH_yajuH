## Translation
9. Whichever flies through the atmosphere, and whichever creeps across  
the sky; whichever thinks the earth a refuge (*nāthá*)—that *piśācá* do  
thou show forth.

## Notes
Ppp. has for **b** *bhomīś co ’pasarpati*, and in **c** *divam* for  
*bhūmim;* and its **d** is *tvaṁ piśācaṁ dṛśe kuru*. The comm. (with a  
couple of SPP's mss.) has *adhi-* instead of *ati-* in **b**; he glosses  
*nātham* with *svāminam*. The verse is not *bhurij* if we combine *yò  
‘ntár-* in **a**. ⌊Correct the misprinted verse-number.⌋  
  
Here, at the end of the fourth *anuvāka*, with 5 hymns and 42 verses,  
the old Anukr. says *atha kuryād dvādaśa*.  
  
Here ends also the seventh *prapāṭhaka*.

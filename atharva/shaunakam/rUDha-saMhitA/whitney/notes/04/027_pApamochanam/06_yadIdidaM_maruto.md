## Translation
6. If now indeed, O Maruts, by what relates to the Maruts—if, O gods, by  
what relates to the gods, I have fallen into such a plight: ye, O Vasus,  
are masters (*īś*) of the removal of that: let them free us from  
distress.

## Notes
That is (**a, b**), apparently, "by reason of what offense"  
(*aparādhena*, comm.); perhaps "if such a \[mishap\] hath befallen  
\[us\]" (so the comm.); but MS. iii. 8. 4, *īdṛ́g u sá ā́riṣyati*,  
supports the translation as given, and also indicates that *ā́ra* is here  
*ā-ā́ra;* but the *pada*-text gives *ā́ra* simply. ⌊See also Weber's  
citation from PB. xiii. 3. 12.⌋ Several mss. (including our Op.) have  
*īśadhve* in **c**, as the comm. reads. *Mā́nuṣeṇa* for *mā́rutena* in  
**a** would be an acceptable emendation.

## Translation
4. By me doth he eat food who looks abroad, who breathes, who indeed  
hears what is spoken; unknowing (? *amantú*) they dwell upon me; hear  
thou, heard-of one; I say to thee what is to be credited.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
RV. leaves the *a* of *ánnam* in **a** unelided (making the pāda a  
regular *jagatī:* our Anukr. takes no notice of it as such, but it would  
be an extremely bad *triṣṭubh*), has (as has also the comm.) the regular  
*prā́ṇiti* in **b**, and reads *śraddhivám* for *śraddhéyam* in **d**.  
One of our mss. (Op.) accents *śrutá*. The comm. understands **a, b** to  
mean "it is by me that any one eats, sees," etc., and takes *īm* as =  
*idam;* *amantavas* as *ajānānā madviṣayajñānarahitāḥ;* and *upa  
kṣiyanti* as *saṁsāreṇa nihīnā bhavanti*—as if *kṣiyanti* came from  
*kṣi* 'destroy'!

## Translation
1. We have conquered today, we have won today; we have become  
guiltless.

## Notes
The verse corresponds to the first two pādas of RV. viii. 47. 18, which  
differ only by reading *ca* in place of the second *adyá*. It and its  
two successors (or also vs. 4) are really metrical, half *anuṣṭubhs*.  
The verse, or the paryāya, is used in Kāuś. 49. 19, nearly at the end of  
the *abhicāra* or witchcraft chapter, with xiii. 1. 28 and 3. 1, to  
accompany the putting on of *adhipāśas* (conjectured 'gag' in the minor  
Pet. Lex.).

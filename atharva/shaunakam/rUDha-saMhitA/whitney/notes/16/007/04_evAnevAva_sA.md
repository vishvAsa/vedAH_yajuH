## Translation
4. So, not so, may she swallow down.

## Notes
The *pada*-text reads *evá: áneva: áva*, and the translation follows it.  
The text is probably corrupt; the 'she' (*sā́*) seems unmotived. Neither  
Pet. Lex. contains *áneva* ⌊in its main part; but the word is given in a  
supplement to the minor Lex., iii. 250 c⌋.

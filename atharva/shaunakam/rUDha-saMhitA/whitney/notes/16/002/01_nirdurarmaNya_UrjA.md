## Translation
1. Out of evil-eating (?) with refreshment \[comes\] speech rich in  
honey.

## Notes
The translation implies the change of *durarmaṇyàts* to *duradmanyàs*,  
as proposed by the Pet. Lexx. (add TB. iii. 3. 9⁹ as a reference for  
*duradmanī́*). The reading of the mss. is, however, assured by its  
quotation in the Prāt. (4. 11. 16 ⌊i.e. Add'l Note, p. 592⌋), and three  
times in the Kāuś.: namely, in 49. 27, at the very end of the chapter of  
witchcraft ceremonies, after use of x. 5. 6, 7 and xiii. 1. 56, with the  
direction *iti saṁdhāvyā ’bhimṛśati;* and again, twice (58. 6, 12) in  
the ceremony for long life after initiation to Vedic study, once with  
the direction *iti saṁdhāvya*, and once with a smearing with fragrant  
powders. The word *ūrjā́* in our text might also be nominative, and  
'comes' is of course doubtful. The metrical definition implies the  
resolution *-ṇí-a*.

## Translation
6. Spread (*prastará*) of the seers art thou; homage be to the spread of  
the divine ones (*dāíva*).

## Notes
The verse is used twice in Kāuś. (2. 18; 137. 33), and once in Vāit. (2.  
9). In the former, it accompanies the taking up of part of the  
*darbha*-grass provided, and making a seat for the *brahman*—priest  
south of the fire, once at the *parvan* sacrifice and once in the  
*ājyatantra* ceremony. In the latter, it accompanies the making of such  
a spread in the *parvan* ceremonies. In all the three cases, it is  
evidently taken because of its specific meaning, and not because of any  
connection of those ceremonies with the one implied here.

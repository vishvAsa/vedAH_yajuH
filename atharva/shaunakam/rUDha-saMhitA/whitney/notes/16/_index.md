Book XVI.

⌊**Unity of subject not apparent.**⌋

⌊This is the fourth book of the third grand division (books
xiii.-xviii.) of the Atharvan collection. By what warrant it has found a
place among the books whose distinctive feature is their unity of
subject it is hard to say; and the same is in a measure true of the next
book, book xvii.: but see Whitney's General Introduction; also
Bloomfield's contribution to the Bühler-Kielhorn *Grundriss*, p. 94. The
study of the ritual applications of the book distinctly fails, in my
opinion, to reveal any pervading concinnity of purpose or of use.⌋

  

⌊In the *Indische Studien*, xiii. 185, Weber has suggested that parts of
the book are evening prayers, to be recited before going to rest, and
especially for the warding off of evil dreams (see i. 11; 5; 6; 7.
8-11); and 9. 3-4, at the end of the book, may well be taken as the
words of them "that watch \[have watched\] for the morning" and as
expressing the "joy" that "cometh in the morning," and are accordingly
placed, as is usual and appropriate, at the end of the *mantras*
concerned, in order to indicate the successful accomplishment of the
purpose of those *mantras*. One is half tempted to give to the book the
title "Against the 'terror by night'?"⌋

  
⌊Laying apart book vi., which has received great attention from the
translators (see p. 281), it may be noted that this is the first book of
the Atharvan *saṁhitā* of which no translation has as yet been published
by the translators of single books. Here again the *bhāṣya* is lacking.⌋

⌊☞ For "Paritta" as title of book, see p. 1045.⌋

  

The ⌊Major⌋ Anukr. calls the whole book *prājāpatya: prājāpatyasya nava
paryāyāḥ;* and both of its two *anuvākas* are evidently called by the
same name ⌊*prājāpatyābhyām*⌋ in xix. 23. 26; whether this means to
ascribe the authorship of the book to Prājāpati is not certain.—⌊On the
other hand, the Old Anukr. seems rather to imply by its

*prājāpatyo ha catuṣkaḥ; pañcaparyāya uttaraḥ*

that the name *prājāpatya* pertains only to the first *anuvāka*, 'the
one of four paryāyas.' It may, however, be added that the
*prājāpatyasya* in the first line of the printed extract below may mean
the whole book or else only the first *anuvāka*.⌋

⌊Quotations from the Old Anukr. are given piecemeal through the mss. of
the book. They may here be given in connected form as printed by SPP. in
his Critical Notice, p. 23—Line 1 refers to the 'prior' and the 'last'
(that is the 'latter') of the two *anuvākas* of the ' prājāpatyan' book:
unless indeed the relation of the first two words is appositive ('of
the prior, the prājāpatyan' \[*anuvāka*\]: see the preceding
paragraph).—At the end of the first *anuvāka*, 8 of W's mss. say
*prājāpatyo ha catuṣkaḥ;* and at the end of the second is read
*pañcaparyāya uttaraḥ:* the two quotations make a half-śloka which we
may expect to find in the text of the Old Anukr., standing between lines
1 and 2 of our extract.—Line 2 refers to the *paryāyas* of the first
*anuvāka;* and lines 3-6 refer to those of the second.—The numbers in
parentheses refer to the *paryāyas* as counted from the beginning of the
*anuvāka;* and those in brackets refer to the *paryāyas* as counted from
the beginning of the book.

prājāpatyasya pūrvasya paramasya punaḥ śṛṇu:  
trayodaśā ”dyaṁ (i. 1) vijānīyād, dvāu (i. 2, 3) ṣaṭkāu, saptakaḥ paraḥ
(1.4).

  

⁠ādyaṁ (ii. 1) daśakaṁ, hy (?) ekādaśakaṁ (ii. 2) \[5, 6\]  
⁠tasmāc ca paraṁ (ii. 3) dvyadhikaṁ vihitam: \[7\]  
⁠ekādaśa vāi triguṇāny aparaś (ii.4) \[8\]  
⁠catvāri vāi vacanāni paraḥ (ii. 5). \[9\]

  
The quoted bit of the Old Anukr. at the end of *paryāya* 6 (or ii. 2) is
*hyekādaśakam* (or *hyāu-*): the fact that the verse is so divided by
piecemeal quotation as to bring *hi* at the beginning of its fragment
seems to oppugn the correctness of the reading *hi;* and the word, as
noted below, is not incorporated into the Major Anukr., the Berlin ms.
of which, moreover, boggles at this point.—A comparison of the text of
the Old Anukr. (above) with that of the Major Anukr. shows that the
later text has quoted every word of lines 2-6 of the older, excepting
*tasmāc ca param* and *aparaḥ* and the questionable *hi*.⌋

⌊A conspectus of the divisions of the book in tabular form follows. The
explanations given on page 771 (which see: in book xv.), apply for the
most part also to this table.

Note that the "ten" (6 + 4) and the "thrice eleven" (8 + 25) assigned by
the Old Anukr. to *paryāyas* 5 (or ii. 1) and 8 (or ii. 4) represent
non-coördinate divisions, as noticed and explained above, p. 771, and p.
772, ¶4.—Some mss. sum up the *avasānarcas* of the first *anuvāka* as 32
(correctly). Those of the second are summed up as follows:
*paryāya-avasānarcas*, 53 (correctly); *gaṇa-avasānarcas*, 14
(correctly); *avasānarcas* "of both kinds," 68 (! but by D. correctly as
67). The 67 with the 4 *vacanas* make 71 (so Bs. correctly). And 71 + 32
make 103 for the whole book, and so one ms. at least sums them up.⌋

⌊Since the book consists wholly of *paryāya-sūktas*, there is no
difference between the two editions in respect to the hymn-numbers:
compare pages 611 and 770.—The division into decads is wanting.⌋ ⌊See
pp. clxi, cxxx end, cxxxvii top, clx.⌋

⌊**Differences between the two editions in the division of the
paryāyas.** The differences occur (as above, p. 771) only in the
*gaṇa-paryāyas* 5 (or ii. 1) and 8 (or ii. 4). In these, SPP. has, as
the Old Anukr. requires, 10 and 33 divisions respectively (as against 6
and 27 of the Berlin edition). The explanation is as on pages 628-629
and on page 772: namely, that, in a sequence of refrains, the refrain is
given in full and counted as a separate *avasāna* only for its first and
last occurrence in that sequence.—In *paryāya* 5 there are properly 6
*gaṇas*, each with 3 subdivisions: therefore we have 2 *gaṇas* (the
first and last), each with 3 subdivisions, making 6; while in each of
the remaining 4, the refrains (**b, c**) are counted as one with **a**
(thus **a-b-c**), making 4; and so, in all, we have 10.—In like manner,
in *paryāya* 8, there are properly 27 *gaṇas*, each with 4 subdivisions:
therefore we have 2 *gaṇas* (the first and last), each with 4
subdivisions, making 8; and (27-2=) 25, each counted as one
(**a-b-c-d**), making 25; and so, in all, we have 33.⌋

  
\[The book is mainly prose: Whitney, *Index*, p. 5, excepts verses 1.
10, 12, 13; 4. 2, 6; 6. 1-4, 11; 9. 1, 2.⌋

In Pāipp. (xviii.) are found only fragments of the book, namely 1. 1-3;
4. 7 (beginning with *mo ’pa*), the first words of 5. 1, then 8. 1, and
finally 9. 4, the concluding verse. This looks as if the whole book were
acknowledged as part of the text, but its complete presentation
deliberately declined for some reason. ⌊The fragments in question follow
immediately the fragment of book xv. cited in the note to xv. 2. 1.⌋ ⌊☞

⌊In the Vāit, the book is noticed only twice: see under 2. 6 and 9. 3.
And in the Kāuś., it is noticed only about a dozen times: see under 1.

## Translation
3. Let not breath quit me; nor let expiration, deserting me, go away.

## Notes
⌊For 'deserting me' one might perhaps say 'leaving me low.' For the  
combination with *párā gā*, cf. TS. v. 7. 9¹. Most of our mss. (all  
except D.R.) leave *mā́m* unaccented; ⌊the curious blunder is made also  
by nine of SPP's mss., as against five mss. and two reciters that gave  
*mā́m*⌋. All our mss. save one (R.) combine *apānó ‘va* ⌊instead of  
*-nò*⌋. The verse is ⌊almost⌋ identical with vii. 53. 4 **a, b** ⌊which  
has *me ’mám* for *mā́ mā́m*⌋.

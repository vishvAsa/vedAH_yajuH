title = "०४ सूर्यो माह्नः"

## Translation
4. Let the sun protect me from the sky, Agni from the earth, Vāyu from  
the atmosphere, Yama from men (*manuṣyà*), Sarasvatī from them of the  
earth.

## Notes
The verse can be read into 32 syllables, but the metrical definition of  
the Anukr. is altogether absurd. ⌊Griffith gives *ahnás* its usual  
meaning: possibly W's "sky" is not intentional, but a mere slip. Cf.,  
however, 7. 6, below.⌋

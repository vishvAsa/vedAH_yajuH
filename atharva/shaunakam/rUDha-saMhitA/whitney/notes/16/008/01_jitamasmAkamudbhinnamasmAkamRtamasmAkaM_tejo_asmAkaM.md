## Translation
1. ⌊1.⌋ Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up, ours right  
(*ṛtá*), ours brilliancy, ours *bráhman*, ours heaven (*svàr*), ours the  
sacrifice, ours cattle, ours progeny, ours heroes. ⌊2.⌋ From that we  
disportion him yonder: so-and-so, of such-and-such lineage, son of  
such-and-such mother, who is yonder; ⌊3.⌋ let him not be released from  
the fetter of seizure. ⌊4.⌋ Of him now (*idám*) I involve the splendor,  
brilliancy, breath, lifetime; now I make him fall downward.

## Notes
Here is again a partial correspondence with x. 5. 36. Compare also  
Āpast. iv. 15. 3. The addition *yajus* to the name *brāhmy anuṣṭubh* (48  
syllables) in the Anukr. seems, ⌊in the light of the corresponding  
expression at xvii. 1. 22, 23, intended to inform us that subdivision  
**a** is a *yajus;* but it is not apparent why the author should give  
this bit of information, which is (of its kind) so isolated: cf. third  
note to xv. 5. 7⌋.

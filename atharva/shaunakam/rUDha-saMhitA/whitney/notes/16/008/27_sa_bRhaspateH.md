## Translation
27. ⌊30.⌋ Ours \[is\] what is conquered, ours what has shot up, ours  
right, ours brilliancy, ours *bráhman*, ours heaven, ours the sacrifice,  
ours cattle, ours progeny, ours heroes. ⌊31.⌋ From that we disportion  
him yonder: so-and-so, of such-and-such lineage, son of such-and-such  
mother, who is yonder; ⌊32.⌋ let him not be released from the fetter,  
the shackle of death. ⌊33.⌋ Of him now I involve the splendor,  
brilliancy, breath, life-time; now I make him fall downward.

## Notes
Some of the mss. read *pádviṅśat* or *páḍvīṅśat*. ⌊There should be an  
*avasāna*-mark in vs. 26 of the Berlin ed. after the second circle  
indicating omission.⌋

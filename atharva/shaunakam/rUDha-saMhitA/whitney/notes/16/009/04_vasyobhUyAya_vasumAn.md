## Translation
4. In order to becoming better (*vásyas-*). Rich in good (*vásu-*)  
\[is\] the sacrifice; good may I win (*van*); rich in good may I be;  
good put thou in me.

## Notes
  
  
  
  
  
The first word seems to belong in sense rather to the preceding verse;  
⌊see note thereon⌋. All the mss. read *vaṅśiṣīya*, and the edition  
follows them; but we ought unquestionably to have emended to  
*vinṣiṣīya*. There is even probably a play on words intended between  
*vásu* and *vaṅs-*. ⌊Yet SPP. reads *vaṅśiṣīya* without note of variant:  
as to the form, see *Gram.* § 914 b.⌋ ⌊For use by Kāuś., see under vs.  
3.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the second *anuvāka*, with 5 *paryāyas* and 71 *avasānarcas:*  
but see the summations at p. 793 and cf. p. 798 and p. 801. The piece  
here quoted from the Old Anukr. is *pañcaparyāya uttaraḥ:* see p. 792.⌋  
  
⌊Here ends the thirty-first *prapāṭhaka*.⌋

6. He who has slain a man belonging to the two (first-mentioned castes) who has studied the Veda, or had been initiated for the performance of a Soma-sacrifice, becomes an Abhiśasta. [^4] 


[^4]:  Manu XI, 87. Abhiśasta means literally 'accused, accursed,' and corresponds in Āpastamba's terminology to the mahāpātakin of Manu and Yājñavalkya, instead of which latter word Manu uses it occasionally, e.g. II, 185.

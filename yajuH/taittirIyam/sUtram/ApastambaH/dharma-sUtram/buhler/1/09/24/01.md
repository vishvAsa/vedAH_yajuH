1. He who has killed a Kṣatriya shall give a thousand cows (to Brāhmaṇas) for the expiation of his sin. [^1] 


[^1]:  24. Manu XI, 128; Yājñ. III, 266. Others explain the phrase vairayātanārtham, 'for the expiation of his sin,' thus: 'He, who is p. 79 slain by anybody, becomes, in dying, an enemy of his slayer (and thinks), "O that I might slay him in another life," for the removal of this enmity!'--Haradatta. I am strongly inclined to agree with the other commentator, and to translate vairayātanārtham, 'in order to remove the enmity.' I recognise in this fine a remnant of the law permitting compositions for murder which was in force in ancient Greece and among the Teutonic nations. With the explanation adopted by Haradatta, it is impossible to find a reasonable interpretation for prāyaścittirthaḥ, Sūtra 4. Haradatta, seduced by the parallel passage of Manu, takes it to be identical with vairayātanārtham. I propose to translate our Sūtra thus: 'He who has killed a Kṣatriya shall give a thousand cows (to the relations of the murdered man) in order to remove the enmity.' According to Baudhāyana I, 10. 19. 1 (compare Zeitschr. d. D. Morg. Ges., vol. 41, pp. 672-76; Festgruss an Roth, pp. 44-52), the cows are to be given to the king.

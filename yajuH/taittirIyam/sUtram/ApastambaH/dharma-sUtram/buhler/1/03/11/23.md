23. Before taking his morning-meal, he shall go to the water-side, and having purified himself, he shall recite aloud (a portion of the Veda) in a pure [^12]  place, leaving out according to (the order of the) texts (what he has read the day before).


[^12]:  See Taittirīya Āraṇyaka II, 11, 1 and 11; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. III, 2, 1-2. In our days this rule is usually not observed. Brāhmaṇas mostly recite at the daily Brahmayajña, 'Veda-offering,' one particular formula, which symbolically comprises the whole Veda. A few learned Brāhmaṇa friends, however, have assured me, that they still recite the whole of their Śākhā every year according to this rule of Āpastamba.

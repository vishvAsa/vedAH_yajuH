13. If he, who is about to study the Veda, wishes to talk to a woman during her courses, he shall first speak to a Brāhmaṇa and then to her, then again speak to a Brāhmaṇa, and afterwards study. Thereby the children (of that woman) will be blessed. [^8] 


[^8]:  The last part of the Sūtra may also be interpreted: 'Thus she will be blessed with children.'--Haradatta.

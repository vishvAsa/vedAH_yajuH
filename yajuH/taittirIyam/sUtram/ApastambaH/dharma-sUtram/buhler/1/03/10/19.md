19. The barking of (many) dogs, the braying of (many) asses, the cry of a wolf or of a solitary jackal or of an owl, all sounds of musical instruments, of weeping, and of the Sāman melodies (are reasons for discontinuing the study of the Veda). [^13] 


[^13]:  The ekasṛka, 'solitary jackal,' is now called Bālu or Pheough, and is considered to be the constant companion of a tiger or panther. Its unharmonious cry is, in the present day also, considered to be an evil omen. Yājñ. I, 148; Manu IV, 108, 115 and 123.

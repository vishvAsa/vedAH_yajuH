11. If (he hears of) the death of a learned Brāhmaṇa (Śrotriya) before a full year (since the death) has elapsed, (he shall interrupt his reading) for one night (and day). [^9] 


[^9]:  'Because the word "death "is used here, death only is the reason (for stopping, the reading), in the case of Gurus and the rest (i.e. the word "died" must be understood in Sūtra 2 and the following ones).' --Haradatta.

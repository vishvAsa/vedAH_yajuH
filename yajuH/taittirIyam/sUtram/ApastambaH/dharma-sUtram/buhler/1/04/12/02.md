[^2]:  Regarding the proper position at the 'Veda-offering,' or daily recitation, see above, I, 3, 11, 2 3, and Taitt. Ār. II, 11, 3. Passages similar to the first part of the sentence quoted in this Sūtra occur Taitt. Ār II, 12, 3, and 15, 3. It ought to be observed that the Taitt. Ār. in both places has the word 'vrajan,' which is also read in the P. and P. U. MSS. The second part is taken apparently from the same work, II, 14, 2.

9. And in common life, at the occasion of ceremonies performed for the sake of welfare, the sentences shall be headed by this word, as, for instance, '(Om) an auspicious day,' '(Om) welfare,' '(Om) prosperity.' [^5] 


[^5]:  The example given in the Sūtra is that of the Puṇyāhavācana, which precedes every Gṛhya ceremony, and at which the sacrificer requests a number of invited Brāhmaṇas to wish him success. The complete sentences are, The sacrificer: Oṃ karmaṇaḥ puṇyāham bhavanto bruvantviti, 'Om, wish that the day may be auspicious for the performance of the ceremony.' The Brāhmaṇas: Om puṇyāhaṃ karmaṇa itī, 'Om, may the day be auspicious for the ceremony.' In the same manner the Brāhmaṇas afterwards wish 'welfare,' svasti, 'prosperity,' vṛddhi, to the sacrificer.

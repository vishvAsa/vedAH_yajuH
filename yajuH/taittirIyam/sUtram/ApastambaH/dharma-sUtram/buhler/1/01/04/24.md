24. Having served (his teacher during the day in this manner, he shall say when going to bed): I have protected the protector of the law (my teacher). [^13] 


[^13]:  Another explanation of the words spoken by the student is, 'O law, I have protected him; protect thou me.' See also Gopatha-brāhmaṇa, 1, 2, 4.

30. Let him not sport in the water whilst bathing; let him swim (motionless) like a stick. [^15] 


[^15]:  Another version of the first portion of this Sūtra, proposed by Haradatta, is, 'Let him not, whilst bathing, clean himself (with bathing powder or the like).' Another commentator takes Sūtra 28 as a prohibition of the daily bath or washing generally ordained for Brāhmaṇas, and refers Sūtra 29. to the naimittika snāna or 'bathing on certain occasions,' and takes Sūtra 30 as a restriction of the latter.

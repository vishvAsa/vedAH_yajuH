16. A Brāhmaṇa. shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a level with his ear, a Kṣatriya holding it on a level with the breast, a Vaiśya holding it on a level with the waist, a Śūdra holding it low, (and) stretching forward the joined hands. [^12] 


[^12]:  'A Vaiśya shall salute stretching forth his arm on a level with his middle, i.e. the stomach; others say, on a level with his thigh; the Śūdra stretching it forth low, i.e. on a level with his feet.'--Haradatta.

20. Nor shall he blow on fire with his breath. [^13] 


[^13]:  Manu IV, 53. Haradatta mentions other explanations of this Sūtra. Some say, that the Śrauta fire may be kindled by blowing, because that is ordained particularly in the Vājasaneyaka, but that the domestic fire is not to be treated so. Others again consider the rule absolute, and say, that a hollow reed or bellows must be used for kindling the fire, lest drops of saliva should fall upon it.

4. All living creatures are the dwelling of him who lies enveloped in matter, who is immortal and who is spotless. Those become immortal who worship him who is immovable and lives in a movable dwelling. [^4] 


[^4]:  The spotless one &c. is the Paramātman. The spots are merit and demerit which, residing in the Manas, the internal organ of perception, are only falsely attributed to the Ātman, 'the soul.' To become immortal means 'to obtain final liberation.'

4. He is called a Śrotriya who, observing the law (of studentship), has learned one recension of the Veda (which may be current in his family). [^3] 


[^3]:  The object of this Sūtra is to complete the definition of the term 'guest' to be given in the following Sūtra. In my translation I have followed Haradatta's gloss. The literal sense of Āpastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing the law, has studied one recension of each (of the four) Vedas, becomes a Śrotriya.' Haradatta says this definition would be contrary to the current acceptation of the term. That argument proves, however, nothing for Āpastamba's times.

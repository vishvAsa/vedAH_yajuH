15. He shall not give his daughter to a man belonging to the same family (Gotra), [^8] 


[^8]:  The term Gotra corresponds to the Latin Gens. It may be of two kinds, Vaidika for Brāhmaṇas and Laukika, 'worldly', for men of other castes. In the first case it denotes 'persons descended from the same Ṛṣi;' in the second, 'persons distinguished by the same family name, or known to be descended from the same ancestor.' In our days Brāhmaṇas also have Laukika Gotras, which form subdivisions of the very large Vedic Gotras. Regarding the Vaidika Gotras, see Max Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp. 379-390, and particularly p. 387. Manu III, 5; Yājñ. I, 33; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 75 seq.

15. Some enjoin (that he shall prepare) two sets of utensils for cooking and eating, (and) of choppers, hatchets, sickles, and mallets. [^7] 


[^7]:  According to Haradatta, the word kāja appears to designate a 'mallet;' in the passage from the Rāmāyaṇa quoted in the Petersburg Dict. the commentator explains it by peṭaka, 'basket.'

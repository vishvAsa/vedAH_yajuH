[^4]:  The meaning of the Sūtra is, that the studentship is a necessary preliminary for the Saṃnyāsin. If a man considers sufficiently purified by his life in that order, he may become a Saṃnyāsin immediately after its completion. Otherwise he may first become a householder, or a hermit, and enter the last p. 154 order, when his passions are entirely extinct. See also Manu VI, 36; Yājñ. III, 56-57.

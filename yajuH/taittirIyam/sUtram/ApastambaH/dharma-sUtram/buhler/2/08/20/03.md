3. He who desires prosperity shall fast in the half of the year when the sun goes to the north, under the constellation Tiṣya, in the first half of the month, for (a day and) a night at least, prepare a Sthālīpāka-offering, offer burnt-oblations to Kubera (the god of riches), feed a Brāhmaṇa with that (food prepared for the Sthālīpāka) mixed with clarified butter, and make him wish prosperity with (a Mantra) implying prosperity. [^2] 


[^2]:  The reason why the constellation Tiṣya has been chosen for this rite seems to be that Tiṣya has another name, Puṣya, i.e. 'prosperous'. This sacrifice is to begin on the Tiṣya-day of the month called Taiṣa or Pauṣa (December-January), and to continue for one year.

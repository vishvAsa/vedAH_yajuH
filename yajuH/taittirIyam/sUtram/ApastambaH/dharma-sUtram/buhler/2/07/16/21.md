21. (If he performs it) on the fourteenth day (its reward is) success in battle. [^9] 


[^9]:  Manu III, 276, and Yājñ. I, 263, declare the fourteenth day to be unfit for a Śrāddha, and the latter adds that Śrāddhas for men killed in battle may be offered on that day. This latter statement explains why Āpastamba declares its reward to be 'success in battle.' The nature of the reward shows that on that day Kṣatriyas, not Brāhmaṇas, should offer their Śrāddhas.

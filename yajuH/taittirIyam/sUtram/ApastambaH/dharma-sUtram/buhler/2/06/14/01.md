1. He should, during his lifetime, divide his wealth equally amongst his sons, excepting the eunuch, the mad man, and the outcast. [^1] 


[^1]:  14. The last Sūtra of Khaṇḍa 13 and the first of Khaṇḍa 14 are quoted by Colebrooke, Digest, Book V, Text xlii, and Mitākṣarā, Chap. I, Sect. iii, Par. 6. Colebrooke translates jīvan, 'during his lifetime,' by 'who makes a partition during his lifetime.' I think that this is not quite correct, and that Āpastamba intends to exhort householders to make a division during their lifetime, as later they ought to become ascetics or hermits. Haradatta introduces into his commentary on this Sūtra the whole chapter on the division of a father's estate amongst his sons, supplementing Āpastamba's short rule by the texts of other lawyers. No doubt, Āpastamba means to lay down, in these and the following Sūtras, only the leading principles of the law of inheritance, and he intends that the remaining particulars should be supplied from the law of custom or other Smṛtis.

12. It is declared in the Veda that at the time of marriage a gift, for (the fulfilment of) his wishes, should be made (by the bridegroom) to the father [^6]  of the bride, in order to fulfil the law. 'Therefore he should give a hundred (cows) besides a chariot; that (gift) he should make bootless (by returning it to the giver).' In reference to those (marriage-rites), the word 'sale' (which occurs in some Smṛtis is only used as) a metaphorical expression; for the union (of the husband and wife) is effected through the law.


[^6]:  This Sūtra seems to be directed against Vasiṣṭha I, 36.

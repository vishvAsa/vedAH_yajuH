Repetition takes place in the case of the Havishkṛt, Adhrigu, Puronuvākyā, and Manotā hymns, (because they have to be used) at different times.

## Commentary

Havishkṛt-adhrigu-puronuvākyā-manotam is to be taken as a Dvandva compound.

The Havishkṛt hymn is an invocation when the havis is made. The Adhrigu hymn is 'Daivyāḥ śamitāraḥ,' &c. The Puronuvākyā hymn is that which precedes the Yājyā, immediately after the Sampraiṣa. The Manotā hymn is 'Tvaṃ hy agne prathamo manotā,' &c. These hymns are to be repeated, if the act which they accompany has to be repeated after a certain interval.

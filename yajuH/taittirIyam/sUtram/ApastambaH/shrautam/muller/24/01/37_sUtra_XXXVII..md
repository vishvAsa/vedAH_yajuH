The prohibition of reciting Mantras in the Svādhyāya does not apply to the sacrifice, because there is then a different object.

## Commentary

Svādhyāya, i.e. self-reading, is the name given to the study of the Veda, both in first learning and in afterwards repeating it. This study is under several restrictions, but these restrictions cease when the Veda is used for sacrificial purposes.

The Anvārambhaṇīyā or initiatory ceremony does not take place in a Vikṛti, because the Vikṛtis would fall within the time of the Prakṛti, and the Anvārambhaṇīyā has but one object, namely (the initiation of) the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice.

## Commentary

The Anvārambhaṇīyā ceremony has to be performed by those who begin the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice. It has thus one object only, and is never enjoined for any other cause. It is not therefore transferred to any Vikṛti, such as the Saurya ceremony, &c. The Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice having to be performed during the whole of life, or during thirty years, the Vikṛtis would necessarily fall within the same space of time. The initiatory ceremony has reference to the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice only, and thus serves as an introduction to all the Vikṛtis, without having to be repeated for each.

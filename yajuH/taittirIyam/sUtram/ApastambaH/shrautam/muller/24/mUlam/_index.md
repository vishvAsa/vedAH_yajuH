## SŪTRA I.

We shall explain the sacrifice.

### Commentary

Yajña, sacrifice, is an act by which we surrender something for the sake of the gods. Such an act must rest on a sacred authority (āgama), and serve for man's salvation (śreyo^(ऽ)rtha). The nature of the gift is of less importance. It may be puroḍāśa, cake; karu, pulse; sāṃnāyya, mixed milk; paśu, an animal; soma, the juice of the Soma-plant, &c.; nay, the smallest offerings of butter, flour, and milk may serve for the purpose of a sacrifice.

Yajña, yāga, yajana, and iṣṭi are considered as synonymes.



## SŪTRA II.

The sacrifice is for the three colours or castes (varṇa), for Brāhmaṇas and Rājanyas, also for the Vaiśya.

### Commentary

Though the sacrifice is meant for the three castes, here called varṇa, i.e. colour, the third caste, that of the Vaiśya or citizen, is mentioned by itself, while the two castes, the Brāhmaṇas and Rājanyas (the Kṣatriyas or nobles), are mentioned together. This is done because there are certain sacrifices (bahuyajamāna), performed by Brāhmaṇas and Rājanyas together, in which Vaiśyas take no part. In the Śāṅkhāyana-sūtras, I, 1, 3, also the Vaiśya is mentioned by himself. In Kātyāyana's Sūtras, however, no such distinction is made. and we read, I, 6, Brāhmaṇa-rājanya-vaiśyānāṃ śruteḥ. Women, if properly married, are allowed to participate in sacrifices, but no one is allowed to be accompanied by a Sūdrā woman, even though she be his wife. Properly a Brāhmaṇa should marry a wife of his own caste only. A Kṣatriya may marry a woman of his own or of the Brāhmaṇa caste. A Vaiśya's proper wife should be taken from his own caste. See, however, Manu III, 12 seq.

The four castes, with the Śūdra as the fourth, are mentioned once in the Ṛg-veda, X, yo, 12. The opposition between Āryas and Śūdras occurs in the Atharva-veda, XIX, 62, &c., and in most of the Brāhmaṇas. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa we read of the four castes, Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra, and we are told that none of them vomits the Soma. Kātyāyana excludes from the sacrifice the aṅgahīna, cripple, shaṇḍa, eunuch, and all aśrotriyas, persons ignorant of the Veda, which would bar, of course, the whole class of the Śūdras, but they are also specially excluded. Concessions, however, had to be made at an early time, for instance, in the case of the Rathakāra, who is admitted to the Agnyādhāna, &c. This name means chariot-maker, but Āpadeva, in his Mīmāṃsā-nyāya-prakāśa, remarks that, though rathakāra means a chariot-maker etymologically, it should be taken here as the name of a clan, namely that of the Saudhanvanas (MS. Mill 46, p. 13^(b)). Deva, in his commentary on the Kātyāyana-sūtras, makes the same remark. See also Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 12 seq. These Saudhanvanas, often identified with the Ṛbhus, are evidently the followers of Bṛbu, mentioned RV. VI, 45, 31; 33, and wrongly called Bṛdhu in Manu X, 107; see M.M., Hist. of A.S.L., p. 494. In the Śāṅkhāyana-Śrauta-sūtras, XVI, 11, 11 (ed. Hillebrandt), he is rightly called Bṛbu. In later times Rathakāra is the name of a caste, and its members are supposed to be the offspring of a marriage between a Māhiṣya and a Karaṇī. A Māhiṣya is the son of a Kṣatriya and a Vaiśyā, a Karaṇī the daughter of a Vaiśya and a Śūdrā. Sudhanvan also is used in Manu X, 23, as the name of a caste, namely the offspring of fallen (vrātya) Vaiśyas.

Another exception is made in favour of a Niṣādasthapati, a Niṣāda chieftain. If it meant a chieftain of Niṣādas, it might be meant for a Kṣatriya who happens to be a chieftain of Niṣādas. Here it is meant for a chieftain who is himself a Niṣāda, a native settler. He is admitted to the Gavedhuka sacrifice.

Again, although, as a rule, the sacrificer must have finished his study of the Veda and be married, a sacrifice is mentioned which a Brahmacārin, a student, may perform. The case thus provided for is, yo brahmacārī striyam upeyāt, sa gardabham paśum ālabheta. As these sacrificers are not upanīta, and therefore without the sacred fires, their sacrifices have to be performed with ordinary fires, and the sacrificial offerings, the puroḍāśas, are not cooked in kapālas, jars, but on the earth, while the avadānas (cuttings), heart, tongue, &c., are sacrificed in water, and not in fire. The Niṣāda chieftain has to learn the necessary Vedic verses by heart, without having passed through a regular course of Vedic study. The same applies to women, who have to recite certain verses during the sacrifice.

That certain women are admitted to the sacrifice, is distinctly stated by Kātyāyana, I, 1, 7, strī kāviśeṣāt.



## SŪTRA III.

The sacrifice is prescribed by the three Vedas.

### Commentary

In order to know the whole of the sacrifice, one Veda is not sufficient, still less one sākhā (recension) only. The sacrifice is conceived as a whole, and its members (aṅgas) are described in different parts of the three Vedas.



## SŪTRA IV.

By the Ṛg-veda, the Yajur-veda, the Sāma-veda (is the sacrifice prescribed).

## SŪTRA V.

The Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, the new and full-moon sacrifices, are prescribed by the Ṛg-veda and the Yajur-veda.



## SŪTRA VI.

The Agnihotra is prescribed by the Yajur-veda.



## SŪTRA VII.

The Agniṣṭoma is prescribed by all.

### Commentary

By saying all, the Atharva-veda is supposed to be included, at least according to one commentator.

The Agniṣṭoma requires sixteen priests, the Paśu sacrifices six, the Cāturmāsyas five, the Darśa-pūrṇamāsas four.



## SŪTRA VIII.

With the Ṛg-veda and Sāma-veda the performance takes place with a loud voice (uccaiḥ).

### Commentary

Even lines of the Yajur-veda, if they are contained in the Ṛg-veda and Sāma-veda, would have to be pronounced with a loud voice. Certain mantras, however, are excepted, viz. the japa, abhimantraṇa, and anumantraṇa-mantras.



## SŪTRA IX.

With the Yajur-veda the performance takes place by murmuring (upāṃśu).

### Commentary

This murmuring, upāṃśu, is described as a mere opus operatum, the words being repeated without voice and without thought. One may see the movements of the vocal organs in murmuring, but one should not hear them at a distance. If verses from the Ṛg-veda or Sāma-veda occur in the Yajur-veda, they also have to be murmured. See Kāty. I, 3, 10.



## SŪTRA X.

With the exception of addresses, replies, choosing of priests (pravara), dialogues, and commands.

### Commentary

As all these are meant to be understood by others, they have therefore to be pronounced in a loud voice. The address (āśruta) is oṃ śrāvaya; the reply (pratyāśruta) is astu śrauṣaṭ[^1]; the choosing of priests (pravara) is agnir devo hotā; a dialogue (saṃvāda) is brahman prokṣishyāmi, om prokṣa; a command (sampreṣa) is prokṣaṇīr āsādaya.


[^1]: See Hillebrandt, Das Altind. Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 94.


## SŪTRA XI.

In the Sāmidhenī hymns the recitation is to be between (the high and the low tone).

### Commentary

The Sāmidhenīs are the hymns used for lighting the fire. One commentator explains antarā, between, as between high tone (kruṣṭa) and the murmuring (upāṃśu). Another distinguishes three high tones, the kruṣṭa (also called tāra or krauñca), the madhyama, and the mandra, and assigns the madhyama to the Sāmidhenī hymns. The mandra notes come from the chest, the madhyama notes from the throat, the uttama notes from the head.



## SŪTRA XII.

Before the Ājyabhāgas (such as the Ājya-portions at the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa), and at the morning Savana (oblation of Soma), the recitation is to be with the soft (mandra) voice.

### Commentary

The pronunciation is loud, uccaiḥ, but soft, mandra. Satyavrata restricts this rule to the passages mentioned in Sūtra X. He also treats the second part of Sūtras XII, XIII, and XIV as separate Sūtras.



## SŪTRA XIII.

Before the Sviṣṭakṛt (at the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa) sacrifice, and at the midday Savana, the recitation is to be with the middle voice.



## SŪTRA XIV.

In the remainder and at the third Savana with the sharp (kruṣṭa) voice[^2].


[^2]: See on this, Ṛg-veda Prātiśākhya 13, 17; Āśval. I, 5, 27; Sāṅkh. I, 14; Hillebrandt, l.c. p. 103.

### Commentary

The remainder refers to the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice, the three Savanas to the Soma sacrifice. Satyavrata takes all these rules as referring to the cases mentioned in Sūtra X.



## SŪTRA XV.

The movement of the voice is the same.

### Commentary

In the three cases mentioned before, the voice moves quickly, when the words are to be pronounced high; slowly, when low; and measuredly, when neither loud nor low.



## SŪTRA XVI.

The Hotṛ-priest performs with the Ṛg-veda.



## SŪTRA XVII.

The Udgātṛ-priest with the Sāma-veda.



## SŪTRA XVIII.

The Adhvaryu-priest with the Yajur-veda.



## SŪTRA XIX.

The Brahma-priest with all.

### Commentary

'With all' means with the three Vedas, because the Brahma-priest, or superintendent of the whole sacrifice, must be acquainted with the three Vedas. Others would include the Atharva-veda.



## SŪTRA XX.

When it is expressly said, or when it is rendered impossible, another priest also may act.

### Commentary

Vipratishedha is explained by asambhava and aśakti.



## SŪTRA XXI.

The priestly office (ārtvijya) belongs to the Brāhmaṇas.

### Commentary

Sacrifices may be performed for Kṣatriyas, Vaiśyas, and, in certain cases, even for others, but never by any but Brāhmaṇas. The reason given for this is curious,—because Brāhmaṇas only are able to eat the remains of a sacrifice. See Śatap. Br. II, 3, 1, 39; Kātyāyana IV, 14, 11; also I, 2, 8, cont.



## SŪTRA XXII.

For all sacrifices the fires are laid once.

### Commentary

The sacrificial fires have to be arranged for the first time by a peculiar ceremony, called the Agnyādhāna. They are generally three (Tretā), the Gārhapatya, the father; the Dakṣiṇa, the son; and the Āhavanīya, the grandson. The first laying of the Gārhapatya fire-altar takes place in spring for a Brāhmaṇa, in summer for a Rājanya, in winter for a Vaiśya.



## SŪTRA XXIII.

If it is said, juhoti, 'he sacrifices,' it should be known that sarpir ājya, melted butter, is meant.

### Commentary

Sarpis is here taken as an adjective, running; yad asarpat tat sarpir abhavat. Ājya is explained as navanītavikāradravyajātīyavacanaḥ sabdaḥ, i.e. a word signifying any kind of substance made of fresh butter.

In the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa I, 3, we read ājyaṃ vai devānāṃ surabhi, ghṛtam manuṣyāṇām, ayutam pitṝṇām, navanītaṃ garbhāṇām, 'Ājya is sweet or fragrant to the gods, ghṛta to men, ayuta to the manes, navanīta to children.' Here the commentator explains that ājya is butter, when melted (vilīnaṃ sarpis), ghṛta, when hardened. Ayuta, sometimes called astu, is butter, when slightly melted, niṣpakva, when thoroughly melted. According to Kātyāyana I, 8, 37, ājya is of different kinds. It may be simple ghṛta, which, as a rule, should be made of the milk of cows. But in the absence of ājya, the milk of buffaloes (māhiṣa), or oil (taila), or sesam-oil (jārtila), or linseed oil (atasīsneha), &c., may be taken.



## SŪTRA XXIV.

If it is said, juhoti, it should be known that the Adhvaryu is meant as performer.

### Commentary

Though there is a man who offers the sacrifice, yet the actual homa, the throwing of butter &c. into the fire, has to be performed by the Adhvaryu priest.



## SŪTRA XXV.

Likewise, the spoon (juhū) as the vessel.






## SŪTRA XXVI.

If the juhū has been elsewhere employed, let it be done with a ladle (sruva).

### Commentary

The juhū is a sruc, a spoon, the sruva, a ladle.



## SŪTRA XXVII.

The offering is made in the Āhavanīya fire.



## SŪTRA XXVIII.

The sacrificial vessels are kept from the first laying of the fires (ādhāna) for the whole life.

### Commentary

All sacrificial vessels and instruments are to be kept, and most of them are burnt with the sacrificer at his death.



## SŪTRA XXIX.

At every sacrifice these vessels are to be purified.



## SŪTRA XXX.

The rule for the sacrifice are the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas.



## SŪTRA XXXI.

The name Veda belongs both to the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas.



## SŪTRA XXXII.

The Brāhmaṇas are the precepts for the sacrifice.



## SŪTRA XXXIII.

The rest of the Brāhmaṇa, that which does not contain precepts, consists of explanations, i.e. reproof, praise, stories, and traditions.

### Commentary

It is difficult to find words corresponding to technical terms in Sanskrit. Arthavāda, which I have translated by explanation, means not only the telling of the meaning, but likewise the telling of the object; parakṛti, story, means literally the action of another; purākalpa, traditions, means the former state. The difference between the two is stated to be that parakṛti refers to the act of one person, purākalpa to that of several. This subject is fully treated in the Pūrva-mīmāṃsā. Satyavrata begins a new Sūtra with 'reproof' (nindā).



## SŪTRA XXXIV.

All the rest are Mantras.



## SŪTRA XXXV.

But passages which are not handed down, are not to be classed as Mantras, as, for instance, the pravara, the words used in choosing priests, divine or human; ūha, substitution of one word for another; and nāmadheya-grahaṇa, the mentioning of the names of particular sacrificers.

### Commentary

The reason why such passages are not to be treated as Mantras is that they should not be subject to some of the preceding rules, as, for instance, the murmuring, enjoined in Sūtra IX. Those passages naturally vary in each sacrifice. With regard to the names a distinction is made between the gārhyam nāma, the domestic name of a person, such as Yajñaśarman, and the astrological name, such as Rauhiṇa, derived from the star Rohiṇī.



## SŪTRA XXXVI.

Likewise the sound of a carriage and the sound of a drum.

### Commentary

These sounds, though serving for the sacrifice, are not to be considered as liable to the rules given for the recitation of Mantras.



## SŪTRA XXXVII.

The prohibition of reciting Mantras in the Svādhyāya does not apply to the sacrifice, because there is then a different object.

### Commentary

Svādhyāya, i.e. self-reading, is the name given to the study of the Veda, both in first learning and in afterwards repeating it. This study is under several restrictions, but these restrictions cease when the Veda is used for sacrificial purposes.



## SŪTRA XXXVIII.

Sacrificial acts are accompanied by one Mantra.

### Commentary

If it is said that the priest cuts the plants with fourteen verses, that means that there are fourteen plants to be cut and that one verse is used for each plant.



## SŪTRA XXXIX.

This applies also to sacrificial acts which have a number and are to be carried out by separate (repeated) acts.

### Commentary

If a rule is given, such as triḥ prokṣati, he sprinkles thrice, the mantra which accompanies the act, is recited once only. Again in the case of acts that require repetitions, such as rubbing, pounding, &c., the hymns are recited once only.



## SŪTRA XL.

The same applies to rubbing, sleeping, crossing a river, down-pours of rain, the conjuring of unlucky omens, unless they happened some time ago.

### Commentary

If several members of the body are to be rubbed, the verses required for the purpose are recited once only. A prayer is enjoined if one wakes during the night. If one wakes more than once that prayer is. not to be repeated. In crossing a river the necessary verse is not to be repeated at every wave, nor during a down-pour, at every drop of rain. If some unlucky sight has to be conjured, the conjuring verse is spoken once and not repeated, unless some time has elapsed and a new unlucky sight presents itself.



## SŪTRA XLI.

In case of a journey, however, one hymn is used till the object (of the journey) has been accomplished.

### Commentary

I read prayāṇe tu-ā-arthanirvṛtteḥ. Another reading is arthani*v*rittiḥ.



## SŪTRA XLII.

It is the same also with regard to acts which do not produce an immediate effect.

### Commentary

The commentators distinguish between acts which produce a visible effect, such as pounding or sprinkling, and acts which do not, such as addressing, approaching, looking. The latter are called asaṃnipātin. Thus when the stones used for the preparation of Soma are addressed, the hymn which is used for addressing them, is not repeated for each single stone, the same as in Sūtra XL. Sūtras XLI and XLII are sometimes joined.



## SŪTRA XLIII.

Repetition takes place in the case of the Havishkṛt, Adhrigu, Puronuvākyā, and Manotā hymns, (because they have to be used) at different times.

### Commentary

Havishkṛt-adhrigu-puronuvākyā-manotam is to be taken as a Dvandva compound.

The Havishkṛt hymn is an invocation when the havis is made. The Adhrigu hymn is 'Daivyāḥ śamitāraḥ,' &c. The Puronuvākyā hymn is that which precedes the Yājyā, immediately after the Sampraiṣa. The Manotā hymn is 'Tvaṃ hy agne prathamo manotā,' &c. These hymns are to be repeated, if the act which they accompany has to be repeated after a certain interval.



## SŪTRA XLIV.

When it is expressly stated, one sacrificial act may be accompanied by many hymns.

### Commentary

Thus we read, 'He takes the Abhri, the hoe, with four Mantras.'



## SŪTRA XLV.

One ought to let the beginnings of a sacrificial act coincide with the end of the Mantras.

### Commentary

The mantra which indicates the nature and purpose of a sacrificial act should come first, and as soon as it has been finished the act should follow. See Katy. I, 3, 5.



## SŪTRA XLVI.

In the case of the āghāra, sprinkling of clarified butter, and of dhārā, pouring out of Soma, the beginning of the mantra and the act takes place at the same time.



## SŪTRA XLVII.

Mantras are indicated by their first words.

### Commentary

These first words are often called Pratīkas, and rules are given in Āśvalāyana's Śrauta-sūtras I, 1, 17-19, as to the number of words that should form such a pratīka, if it is meant for one verse, for three verses, or for a whole hymn. According to Āśvalāyana, if one foot is quoted, it is meant for a verse; if an imperfect foot of an initial verse is quoted, it is meant for a whole hymn; if more than a foot is quoted, it is meant for three verses.



## SŪTRA XLVIII.

One should know that with the beginning of a following mantra, the former mantra is finished.



## SŪTRA XLIX.

In the case of Hotrā and Yājamāna-mantras, an aggregation takes place.

### Commentary

Hotrās are mantras recited by the Hotṛ-priest. Yājamānās are mantras recited by the sacrificer himself. They are hymns which accompany, but do not enjoin any sacrificial act.



## SŪTRA L.

In the case of the Yājyās and Anuvākyās this (the aggregation) is optional.



## SŪTRA LI.

It is the same with numbers.

### Commentary

If we read that, as in the case of fees to be given to priests, two, seven, eleven, twelve, twenty-one, sixty, or a hundred, this means that either one or the other, not that all should be given at the same time.



## SŪTRA LII.

But accumulation is meant in the buying (of Soma), in the redemption, and in initiation.

### Commentary

When it is said that Soma is bought for a goat, gold, &c., that it is re-bought from the priests by means of a fee, or that at the time of the Dīkṣā, the purification and initiation of a sacrificer, clothes, gold, grain, &c., should be given, these are cases not of aut-aut but of et-et.

The Soma-plant, which is supposed to be bought from northern barbarians, is botanically described in an Āyur-vedic extract, quoted in the Dhūrtasvāmi-bhāṣyaṭīkā (MS. E.I.H. 531, p. 3^(b)), as

śyāmālāmlā ca niṣpatrā kṣīriṇī tvaci māṃsalā, śleshmalā vamanī vallī somākhyā chāgabhojanam. 'The creeper called Soma is dark, sour, without leaves, milky, fleshy on the surface, producing phlegm and vomiting, food for goats.'

This passage, quoted from some Āyur-vedic text, is still the only one which gives an approximative description of the Soma-plant. Dr. Hooker says that the predicates 'sour and milky' point to Sarcostemma, but the question is not decided yet. For further information see George Watt, The Soma Plant, an extract from the third volume of the Dictionary of Economic Products of India, and Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, pp. 14 seq.



## SŪTRA LIII.

If one has performed an offering to Rudra, to the Rākṣasas, to Nirṛti, or to the Pitṛs, if one has cut or broken or thrown away anything, or rubbed oneself, &c., one should touch water.

### Commentary

The touching of water is for the sake of purification. Nirasana is left out in some MSS. The ca, inserted after abhimarśanāni, is explained, as usual, as including other acts also, corresponding to our etc.



## SŪTRA LIV.

All priestly performances take place on the northern side of the Vihāra.

### Commentary

Uttarata-upacāraḥ has to be taken as a compound. Vihāra is explained as vihriyante^(ऽ)gnayaḥ pātrāṇi ca yasmin deśe, i.e. the sacrificial ground. Upacāra is explained as adhvaryvādīnāṃ saṃcaraḥ, and this saṃcara, according to Kātyāyana I, 3, 42, is the path between the Cātvāla and Utkara, the Utkara being on the west, the praṇītās on the east of the Vihāra. Kātyāyana I, 8, 26, expresses the same rule by uttarata-upacāro yajñaḥ, the vihāra being the place where the yajña takes place.



## SŪTRA LV.

The priest should never turn away from the fire, i.e. should never turn his back on the altar.



## SŪTRA LVI.

Nor from the Vihāra.

#### 

## SŪTRA LVII.

Sacrificial utensils should be turned inside, the performers being outside.

### Commentary

The meaning is that the priest should carry such things is spoons, vessels, &c., holding them towards the altar. The sacrificer and his wife should likewise be on the inside of the priest, and the priests should take precedence sideways according to their rank.



## SŪTRA LVIII.

After a sacrificial object has been hallowed by a Mantra, the priest should not toss it about.



## SŪTRA LIX.

Sacrificial acts intended for the gods, should be performed by the priest towards the east or towards the north, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord over the left and under the right arm (yajñopavītin), and turning towards the right.



## SŪTRA LX.

Sacrificial acts intended for the Fathers should be performed by the priest towards the south, after he has placed the Brahmanic cord over the right and under the left arm (prācīnāvītin), and turning towards the left.



## SŪTRA LXI.

Ropes which have to be joined, should be joined by the priest from left to right, after having tied them from right to left.



## SŪTRA LXII.

Ropes which are not joined (single ropes), should be tied by the priest from left to right.

### Commentary

The exact process here intended is not quite clear. The ropes seem to have been made of vegetable fibres. See Katy. I, 3,15-17.



## SŪTRA LXIII.

Let a man sacrifice with the Amāvāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Amāvāsyā, new moon.

### Commentary

Amā-vāsyā is the dwelling together, i.e. the conjunction, of sun and moon, an astronomical expression which was adopted in the common language of the people at a very early time. It does not occur, however, in the Ṛg-veda. In our Sūtra amāvāsyā is used in the sense both of new moon and new-moon sacrifice.



## SŪTRA LXIV.

And let a man sacrifice with the Paurṇamāsyā sacrifice at the time of the Paurṇamāsī, full moon, thus it is said.

### Commentary

Here the full moon is called paurṇamāsī, the sacrifice paurṇamāsyā. Satyavrata joins the two Sūtras in one, and leaves out yajeteti, which may have belonged to the commentary.



## SŪTRA LXV.

Let a man observe that full-moon day as a day of abstinence on which the moon comes out full before.

### Commentary

The full moon (paurṇamāsī) is really the very moment on which the moon is full and therefore begins to decrease. That moment on which sun and moon are, as the Hindus said, at the greatest distance from each other, is called the parva-sandhi, the juncture of the two phases of the moon. Thus the name of paurṇamāsī belongs to the last day of the one and to the first day (pratipad) of the other phase, and both days might be called paurṇamāsī. If therefore the moon is full on the afternoon, the evening, or the twilight of one day, that day should be observed as a fast-day, and the next day should be the day of sacrifice.

The meaning of purastād, which I have translated by before, is doubtful. One commentator says it has no object, and should be dropped, purastād ity etat padam asmin sūtra idānīm anvayaṃ na labhate prayojanābhāvāt. Purastād, before, may, however, mean before the second day, on which the real sacrifice takes place, and the commentator mentions purastāt-paurṇamāsī as a name of the caturdaśī-yuktā, i.e. the full moon beginning on the fourteenth day. The same kind of full moon is also called Anumati, Pūrvā-paurṇamāsī, and Sandhyā-paurṇamāsī, while that which takes place on the pratipad, the first day of the lunar phase, is called Rākā, Uttarā-paurṇamāsī, Astamitoditā, and Śvaḥpūritā.

Corresponding to these two kinds of Paurṇamāsī there are also two kinds of Amāvāsyā. That which falls on the fourteenth day is called Pūrvā-amāvāsyā, or Sinīvālī, the ἕνη καὶ νέα; that which falls on the pratipad, the first day of the new phase, is called Kuhū, Uttarā-amāvāsyā. Śvoyuktā. See also Ait.-Brāhm. II, 4; Nir. XI, 31-32.



## SŪTRA LXVI.

Or the day when one says, To-morrow it will be full.

### Commentary

In that case the day before should be observed as a day of abstinence. The real full moon would then take place in the fore-noon, pūrvāhṇe, of the next day. Abstinence, upavāsa, consists in abstaining from meat and from maithuna, in shaving beard and head, cutting the nails, and, what seems a curious provision, in speaking the truth. See Kāty.-Śrauta-sūtras II, I, 8-12.



## SŪTRA LXVII.

The Vājasaneyins mention a third, the Kharvikā full moon.

### Commentary

Kharva means small. If one divides the night into twelve parts, and if in a portion of the twelfth part the greatest distance of sun and moon takes place, then the full moon is called kharvikā, also kṣīṇā. Or, if on the sixteenth day, the full moon takes place before noon, that also is called kharvikā paurṇamāsī. In that case abstinence or fasting takes place on the sixteenth day (tasyāṃ ṣoḍaśe^(ऽ)hany upavāsaḥ). Both paurṇamāsīs are also called sadyaskālā.



## SŪTRA LXVIII.

Let a man observe that new-moon day (amāvāsyā) as a day of abstinence, on which the moon is not seen.

### Commentary

This Sūtra has to be connected with Sūtra LXV. The abstinence takes place on the day, if the actual new moon, the nearest approach of sun and moon, falls on the afternoon, at night, or at twilight. And this new moon, the junction of the fifteenth day and the pratipad, is called Kuhū. We should read amāvāsyām.



## SŪTRA LXIX.

Or the day when one says, To-morrow they will not see it.

### Commentary

In that case, when the real new moon takes place in the fore-noon, abstinence is observed on the day before, and the new moon is called Sinīvālī. Satyavrata reads śvo yukta iti vā instead of śvo na draṣṭāra iti vā. Draṣṭāraḥ should be explained as īkṣitāraḥ, 'they will not see it.' There is much difference of opinion on this subject among different Śākhās, Sūtrakāras, and their commentators; see Taitt. Saṃh. III, 4, 9; Weber, Ind. Stud., V, p. 228.



## SŪTRA LXX.

The principal acts (pradhāna), prescribed in one (typical) performance, follow the same special rules (vidhāna).

### Commentary

This Sūtra is variously explained: Satyavrata's commentary, which I have followed in the translation, explains pradhānāni as āgneyādīni, i.e. the chief parts of such a sacrifice as the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa; vidhānāni as aṅgāni. Kapardisvāmin's commentary also explains vidhānāni as the aṅgāni of a pradhānam; pradhānam as pūrṇamāsa, &c. It would therefore mean that such ceremonies as the āgneya (aṣṭa-kapāla), āgnīṣomīya (ekādaśa-kapāla), and upāṃśu, which form the pradhānas of the Darśapūrṇamāsa, retain throughout the same vidhānas or aṅgas as prescribed in one Prakaraṇa, viz. the Darśapūrṇamāsa. The Aṅgas or members are all the things used for sacrificial purposes, milk, butter, grains, animals, &c.



## SŪTRA LXXI.

The special rules are limited by (the purpose of) the (typical) performance (prakaraṇa).

### Commentary

Here the rules (vidhis) are again the Aṅgas, which belong to a sacrifice, as the members belong to the body.



## SŪTRA LXXII.

If no special instruction is given (in the Śruti), the acts are general.



## SŪTRA LXXIII.

If a special instruction is given, they are restricted.

### Commentary

Nirdeśa is explained as viśeṣa-śruti, and the meaning is supposed to be that unless such a special rule is given, the Aṅgas of all the Pradhāna acts remain the same, as, for instance, the Paryagnikaraṇa, the Prayājas, &c. Special instructions are when it is said: payasā maitravaruṇaṃ srīṇāti, sruveṇa puroḍāśam anakti, he cooks the Maitravaruṇa with milk, he anoints the Puroḍāśa with the spoon, &c.



## SŪTRA LXXIV.

The Aṣṭā-kapāla for Agni, the Ekādaśa-kapāla for Agnī-Shomau, and the Upāṃśuyāga (the muttered offering of butter), form the principal acts at the Paurṇamāsī, the full moon.

### Commentary

The Aṣṭā-kapāla is the cake baked in eight cups, the Ekādaśa-kapāla that baked in eleven cups, and respectively destined for Agni and Soma. What is meant are the sacrificial acts for which these cakes are used.



## SŪTRA LXXV.

The other Homas are Aṅga.



## SŪTRA LXXVI.

The Aṣṭā-kapāla for Agni, the Ekādaśa-kapāla or Dvādaśa-kapāla for Indra-Agnī, form the principal acts at the Amāvāsyā, the new moon, in the case of one who does not sacrifice with Soma.



## SŪTRA LXXVII.

In the case of one who sacrifices with Soma, the second principal act is the Sāṃnāyya (both at the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices).

### Commentary

The Sāṃnāyya is a mixture of dadhi and payas, sour and sweet milk, and is intended for Indra or Mahendra[^1]. It takes the place of the second Puroḍāśa at the new-moon sacrifice.



## SŪTRA LXXVIII.

In the case of a Brāhmaṇa, who does not sacrifice with Soma, the Agnīṣomīya cake is omitted.

### Commentary

This rule does not seem to be accepted by all schools. It is not found in Kātyāyana, and Hiraṇyakeśin observes: Nāsomayājino brāhmaṇasyāgnīṣomīyaḥ puroḍāśo vidyata ity ekeṣām. See Hillebrandt, l.c. p. iii.



## SŪTRA LXXIX.

Without distinction of caste, the Aindrāgna offering is omitted for one who offers the Sāṃnāyya.

### Commentary

Even though he be not a Somayājin, says the commentary.

This whole matter is summed up in Kapardin's commentary: Amāvāsyāyām asomayājina aindrāgna-sāṃnāyyayor vikalpaḥ. Paurṇamāsyāṃ tv asomayājino brāhmaṇasyāgnīṣomīyayāgābhāvaḥ. Tadrahitāpi paurṇamāsī puruṣārthaṃ sādhayati. Tatra dvayor eva hi yāgayoḥ paurṇamāsīśabdavācyatvam asti, pratyekaṃ nāmayogāt. Tasmād agnīṣomīyayāgarahitāv evetarau puruṣārthaṃ sādhayataḥ.



## SŪTRA LXXX.

The Pitṛ-yajña, the sacrifice to the fathers, is not Aṅga (auxiliary) because its own time is prescribed.

### Commentary

The text should be pitṛyajñaḥ svakālavidhānād anaṅgaḥ syāt. This sacrifice for the Manes, called also the Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña, falls under the new-moon sacrifice, but is to be considered as a pradhāna, a primary sacrifice, not as an aṅga, a member of the Darśa.



## SŪTRA LXXXI.

Also, because it is enumerated like the Darśapūrṇamāsa sacrifice.

### Commentary

This refers to such passages from the Brāhmaṇas as: There are four great sacrifices, the Agnihotram, the Darśapūrṇamāsau, the Cāturmāsyāni, and the Piṇḍa-pitṛyajñaḥ.



## SŪTRA LXXXII.

Also, because, when the Amāvāsyā sacrifice is barred, the Pitṛyajña is seen to take place.



## SŪTRA LXXXIII.

A principal act (pradhāna) is accompanied by auxiliary acts (aṅga).

### Commentary

This Sūtra forms sometimes part of the preceding Sūtra, and would then refer to the Pitṛyajña only.



## SŪTRA LXXXIV.

A principal act is what has its own name, and is prescribed with special reference to place, time, and performer.

### Commentary

This Sūtra is sometimes divided into two; the first, dese kāle kartarīti nirdiśyate, the second, asvaśabdaṃ yat. The following are given as illustrations. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vaiśvadeva on a slope inclined to the East,' we have the locality. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vājapeya in autumn,' we have the time. If it is said that 'the sacrificer himself should offer the Agnihotra on a parvan (change of the moon),' we have the performer. In each of these cases, therefore, the prescribed sacrificial act is a pradhāna sāṅgam, a principal act with auxiliary members.



## SŪTRA LXXXV.

The Darvi-homa (libation from a ladle) stands by itself.

### Commentary

Apūrva is explained by the commentator, not in its usual sense of miraculous, but as not being subject to the former regulations.



## SŪTRA LXXXVI.

They are ordered by the word juhoti, he pours out.



## SŪTRA LXXXVII.

They are offered with the word Svāhā.

### Commentary

According to Kātyāyana I, 2, 6-7, the juhotis are offered sitting, the yajatis standing. See Sūtra XCII. The juhoti acts consist in pouring melted butter into the fire of the Āhavanīya altar, which is so called because 'āhūyante^(ऽ)sminn āhutayaḥ kṣipyanta iti.'



## SŪTRA LXXXVIII.

Taking (the butter) once.



## SŪTRA LXXXIX.

Or, if there are several Āhutis, taking (the butter) for each Āhuti.



## SŪTRA XC.

Or, doing as he likes in dividing (the butter).

### Commentary

These three Sūtras belong together. They teach that one slice (avadāna) of butter should be taken, melted, and poured on the Āhavanīya fire; or, if there are more than one āhuti, then one slice should be taken for each. This, however, is made optional again by the last Sūtra.



## SŪTRA XCI.

There is no fuel (in the Darvi-homa), except at the Agnihotra.

### Commentary

In the case of the Agnihotra it is distinctly stated, dve samidhāv ādadhyāt, let him lay down two sticks.



## SŪTRA XCII.

One pours out (juhoti) the Darvi-homas, sitting west of the Āhavanīya fire, and bending the right knee, or not bending it.



## SŪTRA XCIII.

If it is distinctly stated, it is done in a different way.

### Commentary

The vidhi, contained in Sūtra XCII, is therefore called autsargika, general, and liable to exceptions, as when it is said, that he turns to the east.



## SŪTRA XCIV.

One pours out (juhoti) all āhutis, west of the Āhavanīya fire, passing (the altar) southward, and then turning to the north.



## SŪTRA XCV.

The Āśruta and Pratyāśruta, the Yājyā and Anuvākyā, the Upastaraṇa and Abhighāraṇa, with the slicings, the Caturgṛhīta also, and the Vaṣaṭkāra constitute the Darvi-homas.

### Commentary

The Āśruta is ā śrāvaya; the Pratyāśruta, astu śrauṣaṭ; Anuvākyā and Yājyā are verses, the first inviting the deity, the second accompanying the sacrifice. Whenever vegetable, animal, or sāṃnāyya offerings have to be. sliced, upastaraṇa, spreading, and abhighāraṇa, sprinkling with fat, take place. With ājya offerings there is Caturgṛhīta (taking four times), and the Vaṣaṭkāra.



## SŪTRA XCVI.

With āhutis one should let the act (the pouring out) take place after the Vaṣaṭkāra has been made, or while it is being made.

### Commentary

The Vaṣaṭkāra consists in the word Vaṣaṭ, to be uttered by the Hotṛ-priest. The five sacrificial interjections are, svāhā, srauṣaṭ, vauṣaṭ, vaṣaṭ, and svadhā.



## SŪTRA XCVII.

With the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayāma.

### Commentary

Grahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which the Soma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words upayāma-gṛhīto^(ऽ)si, and while these words are being uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhārāṃ srāvayet).



## SŪTRA XCVIII.

With the Iṣṭakās, the act should be made to coincide with the words tayā deva tena.

### Commentary

When the different iṣṭakās or bricks are placed together for building an altar, &c., the act itself begins with the first and ends with the last words of the accompanying verse.



## SŪTRA XCIX.

When there is a number of Puroḍāśas, one should slice off one after another, saying for each portion vyāvartadhvam (separate)!

### Commentary

Puroḍāśa is a cake made of meal (pakvaḥ piṣṭapiṇḍaḥ), different from karu, which is more of a pulse consisting of grains of rice or barley, and clarified butter (ghṛtataṇḍulobhayātmakam). This puroḍāśa cake has to be divided for presentation to different deities. If there are more than two deities, the plural vyāvartadhvam, separate, has to be used.



## SŪTRA C.

When the two last are sliced off, he should say for each portion, vyāvartethām, separate ye two!

[^1]: Vaidya in his Dictionary explains it, however, as any substance mixed with clarified butter and offered as a burnt offering, which can hardly be right.




## SŪTRA CI.

For these two last portions he makes the indication of the deity.

### Commentary

With the earlier portions, there is a rule which of two gods should have the first or the second portion. With the last couple, however, the priest may himself assign whichever portion he likes to one or the other god. The commentary says, svayam eva idam asyā iti saṅkalpayet.



## SŪTRA CII.

When there is a number of Carus and Puroḍāśas, one separates what belongs to the Carus and what belongs to the Puroḍāśas, before the strewing.

### Commentary

Prāg adhivapanāt, before the strewing, is explained by prāg adhivapanārthakṛṣṇājinādānāt, before one takes the black skin which is used for the strewing.



## SŪTRA CIII.

One then marks the two (the materials for the Karus and the Puroḍāśas) according to the deities (for whom they are intended).



## SŪTRA CIV.

Let the word idam be the rule.

### Commentary

This means that the offering (havis) intended for each deity should be pointed out by the words idam, this, Agneḥ, is for Agni, &c. Thus we read with regard to the offerings intended for certain gods and goddesses: idaṃ Dhātur, idam Anumatyā, Rākāyāḥ Sinīvālyāḥ, Kuhvāḥ.



## SŪTRA CV.

All this applies also to Carus and Puroḍāśas which are separated.

### Commentary

The commentary explains vyatishikta by anyonyaṃ vyavahita, though it is difficult to see how it can have that meaning. It is said that in the Vaiśvadeva the Carus and Puroḍāśas are vyatishikta, but that they also have to be divided before the adhivapana, and to be marked for each deity. Thus we read: Idam Agneḥ, Savituḥ, Pūṣṇo, Marutāṃ, Dyāvāpṛthivyoḥ, &c.



## SŪTRA CVI.

At the time when the Kapālas are put on the fire, one puts on the karu with the first kapāla verse.

### Commentary

Karu is here used for the vessel for boiling the caru, the carusthālī. The first of these verses is dhṛṣṭir asi. Kapālas are the jars in which the rice is cooked.



## SŪTRA CVII.

The verse is adapted and changed to dhruvo'si.

### Commentary

Saṃnāma means the same as ūha, i.e. the modification of a verse so as to adapt it to the object for which it is used. In our case, caru, being a masculine, dhṛṣṭi, a feminine, is replaced by dhruva, a masculine.



## SŪTRA CVIII.

At the time when the meal is to be cleansed, one cleanses the grains.

### Commentary

This takes place after the caru-pot has been put on. The taṇḍulas are the unhusked grains, piṣṭa is the ground flour. In Sanskrit a distinction is made between śasya, the corn in the field, dhānya, corn with the husk, taṇḍula, grains without husks, anna, roasted grains.



## SŪTRA CIX.

At the time of cooking (adhiśrapaṇa) one throws the grains in with the cooking verse.

Commentary. This verse is gharmo'si.



## SŪTRA CX.

Without taking the caru (out of the sthālī) one puts it down.



## SŪTRA CXI.

At the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifices there are fifteen Sāmidhenīs.

### Commentary

Sāmidhenīs are particular verses recited while the fire is being kindled. The first and last verses are repeated thrice, so as to make fifteen in all.



## SŪTRA CII.

At the Iṣṭi and Paśubandha sacrifices there are seventeen Sāmidhenīs, when they are so handed down.



## SŪTRA CXIII.

When it is said that wishful iṣṭis are performed in a murmur, this means that the names of the chief deities are pronounced in a murmur (likewise the yājyā and anuvākyā).



## SŪTRA CXIV.

The Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice is the Prakṛti or norm for all iṣṭis.

### Commentary

The Sūtras, in describing the performance of certain sacrifices, treat some of them in full detail. These are called prakṛti. Prakṛyante'smin dharmā iti prakaraṇam prakṛtiḥ. They form the type of other sacrifices, which are therefore looked upon as mere modifications, vikṛti, and in describing them those points only are fully described in which they differ from their prakṛti. A sacrifice which is a vikṛti, may again become the prakṛti of another sacrifice. This system is no doubt compendious, but it is not free from difficulty, and, in some cases, from uncertainty. It shows how much system there is in the Indian sacrifices, and how fully and minutely that system must have been elaborated, before it assumed that form in which we find it in the Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras. It must not be supposed that the sacrifices which serve as prakṛti, are therefore historically the most ancient.



## SŪTRA CXV.

It is also the norm for the Agnīṣomīya Paśu, the animal sacrifice for Agnī-Shomau.



## SŪTRA CXVI.

And this is the norm for the Savanīya.



## SŪTRA CXVII.

And the Savanīya is the norm for the Aikādaśinas.



## SŪTRA CXVIII.

And the Aikādaśinas are the norm for the Paśugaṇas.

### Commentary

The rules for the Paśugaṇas are therefore to be taken over from the Aikādaśinas, the Savanīya, the Agnīṣomīya-paśu, and the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, so far as they have been modified in each particular case, and are finally determined by the rules of each Paśugaṇa, as, for instance, the Āditya-paśu.



## SŪTRA CXIX.

The Vaiśvadeva is the norm for the Varuṇa-praghāsa, Sākamedha, and Sīra.

### Commentary

The Vaiśvadeva, beginning, like the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, with an Āgneya aṣṭakapāla, takes certain rules from the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, and transfers these, together with its own, as, for instance, the nine prayājas, to the Varuṇa-praghāsa, &c.



## SŪTRA CXX.

The Vaiśvadevika Ekakapāla is the norm for all Ekakapālas.

### Commentary

The Ekakapāla is a puroḍāśa cake, baked in one kapāla. It is fully described in the Vaiśvadeva, and then becomes the norm of all Ekakapālas. An ekakapāla cake is not divided.



## SŪTRA CXXI.

The Vaiśvadevī Āmikṣā is the norm for the Āmikṣās (a preparation of milk).



## SŪTRA CXXII.

Here the Vikāra, the modification, is perceived from similarity.

### Commentary

If it has once been laid down that the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa is the prakṛti or norm for all iṣṭis, then similarity determines the modification in all details, such as the offerings and the gods to whom offerings are made. Thus Karu, being a vegetable offering, would rank as a vikāra of puroḍāśa, which occurs in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice, and is likewise vegetable. Honey and water would be looked upon as most like the Ājya in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa. Āmikṣā, a preparation of milk, would come nearest to the Sāṃnāyya, which is a mixture of sour and sweet milk.



## SŪTRA CXXIII.

Offerings for one deity are vikāras of the Āgneya.

### Commentary

In the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, which is the prakṛti of the iṣṭis, the puroḍāśa for Agni is meant for one deity. Hence all offerings to one deity in the vikṛtis follow the general rules of the Āgneya puroḍāśa, as described in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, for instance, the karu for Sūrya, the Dvādaśa-kapāla for Sāvitrī.



## SŪTRA CXXIV.

Offerings for two deities are vikāras of the Agnīṣomīya.

### Commentary

They must, however, be vegetable offerings, because the puroḍāśa for Agnī-Shomau is a vegetable offering. As an instance, the Āgnāvaiṣṇava Ekādaśakapāla is quoted. Agnīṣomīya has a short a, but the first a in āgnavaiṣṇava is long.



## SŪTRA CXXV.

Offerings for many deities are vikāras also of the Aindrāgna.



## SŪTRA CXXVI.

They are optionally vikāras of the Aindrāgna.

### Commentary

Sometimes these two Sūtras are combined into one. The commentator, however, sees in the vā of aindrāgnavikārā vā a deeper meaning. Agnī-Shomau, he says, consists of four, Indrāgnī of three syllables. Therefore if the name of more than one deity consists of four syllables, it should be treated as a vikāra of the Agnīṣomīya, if of less than four syllables, as a vikāra of the Aindrāgna.



## SŪTRA CXXVII.

An exception must be made in the case of the gods of the prakṛti, as, for instance, the Aindra puroḍāśa, the Saumya caru.

### Commentary

The exception applies to cases where the offering in a vikṛti sacrifice is meant for the same principal deities as those of the prakṛti offering. For instance, in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa Agni and Soma are the deities of the Agnīṣomīya, Indra and Agni of the Aindrāgna. If then in one of the secondary or vikṛti sacrifices there occurs an Aindra puroḍāśa, or a Saumya caru, then the Aindra puroḍāśa is treated as a vikāra of the Aindrāgna, the Saumya karu as a vikāra of the Agnīṣomīya. The Somendra caru also, as its principal deity is Soma, would follow the Agnīṣomīya, the Indrāsomīya puroḍāśa, as its principal deity is Indra, would follow the Aindrāgna.



## SŪTRA CXXVIII.

If there is sameness both in the offering and in the deity, then the offering prevails.

### Commentary

If a caru for Prajāpati occurs in a vikṛti sacrifice, it would follow that, being offered to Prajāpati, it should be offered with murmuring, but, as it is a vegetable offering, it follows the norm of the puroḍāśa, though the puroḍāśa is intended for Agni.



## SŪTRA CXXIX.

If there is contradiction with regard to the substance and the preparation of an offering, the substance prevails.

### Commentary

A puroḍāśa may be made of vrīhi, rice, or of nīvāra, wild growing rice. The wild rice has to be pounded, but not the good rice. The preparation, however, has to yield in a vikṛti, the important point being the substance.



## SŪTRA CXXX.

If there is contradiction with regard to the substance, the object prevails.

### Commentary

An example makes the meaning of this Sūtra quite clear. Generally the yūpa or sacrificial post for fastening sacrificial animals is made of Khadira wood. But if a post made of wood is not strong enough to hold the animal, then an iron post is to be used, the object being the fastening of the animal, while the material is of less consequence.



## SŪTRA CXXXI.

In a Prakṛti sacrifice there is no Ūha, modification of the mantras.

### Commentary

Certain mantras of the Veda have to be slightly altered, when their application varies. In the normal sacrifices, however, no such alteration takes place.



## SŪTRA CXXXII.

In a Vikṛti sacrifice modification takes place, according to the sense, but not in an arthavāda.

### Commentary

Some mantras remain the same in the Vikṛti as in the Prakṛti. Others have to be modified so as to be adapted to anything new that has to be. If, for instance, there is a Puroḍāśa for Agni in the Prakṛti, and in its place a Puroḍāśa for Sūrya in the Vikṛti, then we must place Sūrya instead of Agni in the dedicatory mantra.



## SŪTRA CXXXIII.

When we hear words referring to something else, that is arthavāda.

### Commentary

Arthavāda is generally explained as anything occurring in the Brāhmaṇas which is not vidhi or command. Here, however, it refers to Mantras or passages recited at the sacrifice. We saw how such passages, if they referred to some part of the sacrifice, had to be modified under certain circumstances according to the sense. Here we are told that passages which do not refer to anything special in the sacrifice, are arthavāda and remain unmodified. All this is expressed by the words paravākyaśravaṇāt. Vākya stands for padāni, words, such as are used in the nivāpamantra, &c. Some of these words are called samavetārthāni, because they tell of something connected with the performance of the sacrifice, as, for instance, Agnaye juṣṭaṃ nirvapāmi, I offer what is acceptable to Agni; others are asamavetārthāni, as, for instance, Devasya tvā Savituḥ prasave. When such passages which are not connected with some sacrificial act occur (śravaṇāt), they naturally remain unaltered.



## SŪTRA CXXXIV.

If what is prescribed is absent, a substitute is to be taken according to similarity.

### Commentary

Here we have no longer modification, but substitution (pratinidhi). In cases where anything special that has been prescribed is wanting, a substitute must be chosen, as similar as possible, and producing a similar effect.

According to Maṇḍana's Trikāṇḍa, the degrees of similarity are to be determined in the following order:

> Kāryai rūpais tathā parṇaiḥ kṣīraiḥ puṣpaiḥ phalair api,  
> Gandhai rasaiḥ sadṛg grāhyam pūrvālābhe paramparam. > > 'What is similar by effect, by shape, by leaves, by milk, by flowers, > and by fruit, By smell, or by taste is to be taken one after the > other, if the former cannot be found.'



## SŪTRA CXXXV.

If there is nothing very like, something a little like may be substituted, only it must not be prohibited.

### Commentary

If in a caru of mudgas, kidney-beans, phaseolus mungo, these kidney-beans should fail, a substitute may be taken, but that substitute must not be māṣas, phaseolus radiatus, because these māṣas are expressly forbidden; for it is said, Ayajñiyā vai māṣāḥ, 'Māṣas are not fit for sacrifice.'



## SŪTRA CXXXVI.

The substitute should take the nature of that for which it is substituted.

### Commentary

Taddharma, having the same qualities. If, for instance, nīvāra has been substituted for vrīhi, it should be treated as if it were vrīhi. The name vrīhi should remain, and should not be replaced by nīvāra, just as Soma, if replaced by pūtikā, is still called Soma. Thus, when in the course of a sacrifice vrīhi has once been replaced by nīvāra, and vrīhi can be procured afterwards, yet nīvāra is then to be retained to the end. If, however, the substituted nīvāra also come to an end, and afterwards both nīvāra and vrīhi are forthcoming, then vrīhi has the preference. If neither be forthcoming, then some substitute is to be taken that approaches nearest to the substitute, the nīvāra, not to the original vrīhi. Further, if a choice has been allowed between vrīhi, rice, and yava, barley, and vrīhi has been chosen, and afterwards, as substitute for vrīhi, nīvāra, then, if nīvāra come to an end, and in the absence of vrīhi, when a new supply of both nīvāra, and yava has been obtained, the yava is to be avoided, and the original substitute for vrīhi, the nīvāra, must be retained. In most of these cases, however, a certain penance also (prāyaścitta) is required.



## SŪTRA CXXXVII.

If something is wanting in the measure, let him finish with the rest.

### Commentary

If it is said that a puroḍāśa should be as large as a horse's hoof, and there is not quite so much left, yet whatever is left should be used to finish the offering.



## SŪTRA CXXXVIII.

Substitution does not apply to the master, the altar-fire, the deity, the word, the act, and a prohibition.

### Commentary

The master is meant for the sacrificer himself and his wife. Their place cannot, of course, be taken by anybody else. The altar-fire is supposed to have a supernatural power, and cannot be replaced by any other fire. Nothing can take the place of the invoked deities, nor of the words used in the mantras addressed to them, nor can the sacrifice itself be replaced by any other act. Lastly, when it is said that māṣas, varakas, kodravas are not fit for sacrifice, or that a man ought not to sacrifice with what should not be eaten by Āryas, nothing else can be substituted for what is thus prohibited.



## SŪTRA CXXXIX.

The Prakṛti stops from three causes, from a corollary, from a prohibition, and from loss of purpose.

### Commentary

A corollary (pratyāmnāna) occurs, when it is said, 'instead of Kuśa grass, let him make a barhis of reeds.' A prohibition (pratishedha) occurs, when it is said, 'he does not choose an Ārsheya.' Loss of purpose (arthalopa) occurs, when peṣaṇa, pounding, would refer to caru, a pulse, that cannot be pounded, while grains can be.



## SŪTRA CXL.

The Agniṣṭoma is the Prakṛti of the Ekāha sacrifices.

### Commentary

The Ekāha are sacrifices accomplished in one day.



## SŪTRA CXLI.

The Dvādaśāha is the Prakṛti of the Ahargaṇas.

### Commentary

The Dvādaśāha lasts twelve days and is a Soma sacrifice. It is either an Ahīna or a Sattra. An Ahargaṇa is a series of daily and nightly sacrifices. Those which last from two nights to eleven nights are called Ahīna. Those which last from thirteen to one hundred nights or more are called Sattras.



## SŪTRA CXLII.

The Gavāmayana is the Prakṛti of the Sāṃvatsarikas.

### Commentary

The Gavāmayana lasts three years, and it is the type of all Sāṃvatsarika sacrifices, whether they last one, two, three or more years. They all belong to the class of Sattras.



## SŪTRA CXLIII.

Of the Nikāyi sacrifices the first serves as Prakṛti.

### Commentary

Among the Nikāyi sacrifices, lit. those which consist of a number, all having the same name, but different rewards, the first is the prakṛti of the subsequent ones. The commentator calls them sādyaskra &c., and mentions as the first the Agniṣṭoma. See Sūtra CXLVI, and Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 218.



## SŪTRA CXLIV.

At the Agniṣṭoma there is the Uttara-vedi.

### Commentary

The commentator explains this by saying that at the Soma sacrifices, i.e. at the Agniṣṭoma, Ukthya, Ṣoḍaśin, and Atirātra, the fire is carried from the Āhavanīya to the Uttara-vedi, which is also called the Soma altar.



## SŪTRA CXLV.

The fire is valid for the successive sacrifices.

### Commentary

This fire refers to the fire on the Uttara-vedi, mentioned in the preceding Sūtra, and the object of the Sūtra seems to be to include the act of lighting the fire on the Uttara-vedi in the Prakṛti, though properly speaking it does not form part of the Agniṣṭoma. But I cannot quite understand the argument of the commentator.



## SŪTRA CXLVI.

This does not apply to the Sādyaskras, the Vājapeya, the Ṣoḍaśin, and the Sārasvata Sattra.

### Commentary

With regard to the Ṣoḍaśin and its vikāra, the Vājapeya, the laying of the fire is not mentioned. In the case of the Sādyaskras, it becomes impossible, because they have to be quickly finished. In the case of the Sārasvata Sattra, there is the same difficulty on account of not remaining in the same place (anavasthāpān nāgniś cīyate).



## SŪTRA CXLVII.

A sacrificer wishes the object of his sacrifice at the beginning of the sacrifice.

### Commentary

Some MSS. read kāmayeta, 'he should wish,' but the commentator explains that such a command (vidhi) is unnecessary, because it is natural to form a wish (svataḥ siddhatvāt).



## SŪTRA CXLVIII.

At the beginning of a special part of the sacrifice, one should wish the object of that part of the sacrifice.

### Commentary

The commentary, though objecting, and objecting rightly, to kāmayeta, 'he should wish,' in the preceding Sūtra, accepts kāmayeta as determining the present Sūtra, saying kāmayetety anuvartate. One should read yajñāṅgakāmam, not yajñakāmam, for the commentary explains it by yajñāṅgaphalasaṅkalpaḥ. Whether it was really intended that there should be a special wish for each part or subsidiary act of a sacrifice (yajñāṅga), is another question, but the commentator evidently thought so.

Kātyāyana, who treats the same subject (1, 2, 10 seq.), states that there should be this desire for a reward for certain sacrifices which are offered for a certain purpose, as, for instance, the Dvādaśāha, but that there are no such motives for other sacrifices, and parts of sacrifices. He mentions, first of all, a niyama, a precept for the sacrifice, such as 'Speak the truth.' Then a nimitta, a special cause, as when some accident has taken place that must be remedied, for instance, when the house has been burnt down, &c. Thirdly, the Agnihotra, the morning and evening Homa; fourthly, the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau; fifthly, the Dākṣāyaṇa, a vikṛti of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, the Āgrayaṇa; sixthly, the Nirūḍha-paśu, the animal sacrifice. All these have to be performed as a sacred duty, and without any view to special rewards. Thus we read in Vāsiṣṭha:

Avaśyam brāhmaṇo'gnīn ādadhīta, darśapūrṇamāsāgrayaṇeṣṭicāturmāsyapaśusomaiś ca yajeta, 'A Brāhmaṇa should without fail place his fires, and offer the Darśapūrṇamāsa, the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi, the Kāturmāsyas, the P a ś u, and the Soma sacrifices.'

Hārīta says: Pākayajñān yajen nityaṃ haviryajñāṃś ca nityaśaḥ, Somāṃś ca vidhipūrveṇa ya icched dharmam avyayam, 'Let a man offer the Pākayajñas always, always also the Haviryajñas, and the Soma sacrifices, according to rule, if he wishes for eternal merit.' The object of these sacrifices is aparimitaniḥśreyasarūpamokṣa, eternal happiness, and hence they have to be performed during life at certain seasons, without any special occasion (nimitta), and without any special object (kāma). According to most authorities, however, they have to be performed during thirty years only. After that the Agnihotra only has to be kept up. The proper seasons for these sacrifices are given by Manu, IV, 25-27:

A Brāhmaṇa shall always offer the Agnihotra at the beginning or at the end of the day and of the night, and the Darśa and Paurṇamāsa (iṣṭis) at the end of each half-month;

'When the old grain has been consumed the (Āgrayaṇa) Iṣṭi with new grain; at the end of the (three) seasons the (Cāturmāsya) sacrifices; at the solstices an animal (sacrifice); at the end of the year Soma offerings;

'A Brāhmaṇa, who keeps sacred fires, shall, if he desires to live long, not eat new grain or meat, without having offered the (Āgrayaṇa) Iṣṭi with new grain and an animal (sacrifice)[^1].'

These Pākayajñas, Haviryajñas or iṣṭis, and Soma sacrifices are enumerated by Gautama[^2], as follows:

| Seven Pākasaṃsthās: | Seven Haviryajñasaṃsthās: | Seven Somasaṃsthās: |
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| (1) Aṣṭakā,         | (1) Agnyādheyam,          | (1) Agniṣṭomaḥ,     |
| (2) Pārvaṇam,       | (2) Agnihotram,           | (2) Atyagniṣṭomaḥ,  |
| (3) Śrāddham,       | (3) Darśapūrṇamāsau,      | (3) Ukthyaḥ,        |
| (4) Śrāvaṇī,        | (4) Cāturmāsyāni[^3],      | (4) Ṣoḍaśī[^4],      |
| (5) Āgrahāyaṇī,     | (5) Āgrayaṇeṣṭiḥ,         | (5) Vājapeyaḥ,      |
| (6) Caitrī,         | (6) Nirūḍhapaśubandhaḥ,   | (6) Atirātraḥ,      |
| (7) Āśvayujī.       | (7) Sautrāmaṇī.           | (7) Aptoryāmaḥ.     |

  
In a commentary on Dhūrtasvāmin's Āpastambasūtrabhāṣya (MS. E.I.H. 137) another list is given:

| Pākayajñas:        | Haviryajñas:        | Somayajñas:    |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| (1) Aupāsanahomaḥ, | Agnihotram,         | Agniṣṭomaḥ,    |
| (2) Vaiśvadevam,   | Darśapūrṇamāsau,    | Atyagniṣṭomaḥ, |
| (3) Pārvaṇam,      | Āgrayaṇam,          | Ukthyaḥ,       |
| (4) Aṣṭakā,        | Cāturmāsyāni,       | Ṣoḍaśī,        |
| (5) Māsiśrāddham,  | Nirūḍhapaśubandhaḥ, | Vājapeyaḥ,     |
| (6) Sarpabaliḥ,    | Sautrāmaṇī,         | Atirātraḥ,     |
| (7) Īśānabaliḥ.    | Piṇḍapitṛyajñaḥ.    | Aptoryāmaḥ.    |

  
This list is nearly the same as one given by Satyavrata Sāmāśrami in the Uṣā. He gives, however, another list, which is:

| Seven Pākasaṃsthās: | Seven Haviḥsaṃsthās: | Seven Somasaṃsthās: |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| (1) Sāyaṃhomaḥ,     | Agnyādheyam,         | Agniṣṭomaḥ,         |
| (2) Prātarhomaḥ,    | Agnihotram,          | Atyagniṣṭomaḥ,      |
| (3) Sthālīpāka,     | Darśa-,              | Ukthyaḥ,            |
| (4) Navayajñaḥ,     | Paurṇamāsau,         | Ṣoḍaśī,             |
| (5) Vaiśvadevam,    | Āgrayaṇa,            | Vājapeyaḥ,          |
| (6) Pitṛyajñaḥ,     | Cāturmāsyāni,        | Atirātraḥ,          |
| (7) Aṣṭakā.         | Paśubandhaḥ.         | Aptoryāmaḥ.         |

  
According to the substances offered, sacrifices are sometimes divided into vegetable and animal sacrifices. The vegetable substances are, taṇḍulāḥ, piṣṭāni, phalīkaraṇāḥ, puroḍāśaḥ, odanaḥ, yavāgūḥ, pṛthukāḥ, lājāḥ, dhānāḥ, and aktavaḥ. The animal substances are, payaḥ, dadhi, ājyam, āmikṣā, vājinam, vapā, tvacaḥ, māṃsam, lohitam, and paśurasaḥ.

## SŪTRA CXLIX.

If there are fewer Mantras and more (sacrificial) acts, then after dividing them into equal parts, let him perform the former with the former, the latter with the latter.

### Commentary

It happens, for instance, in certain iṣṭis that a pair of Yājyā and Anuvākyā mantras is given, but six acts. In that case one half of the mantras is used for one half of the acts, and the other half of the mantras for the other half of the acts.



## SŪTRA CL.

If there are fewer acts and more Mantras, let him perform and act with one mantra, those which remain are optional, as the materials for the sacrificial post.


## SŪTRA CLI.

From the end there takes place omission or addition.

### Commentary

This refers again to the same subject, namely what has to be done if there are either more or less mantras than there are acts which they are to accompany. In that case it is here allowed to use as many mantras as there are acts, and to drop the rest of the mantras. Or, if there are less mantras than there are acts, then, after the mantras have been equally divided, the last verse is to be multiplied. For instance, in the Dvikapāla sacrifice for the two Aśvins, the placing of the two kapālas is accompanied by two mantras. The rest of the mantras enjoined in the prakṛti is left out. But if there are, for instance, twelve or more iṣṭakās, bricks, to be placed, while there are only ten mantras, then the mantras are equally divided, and the fifth and tenth to be repeated, as many times as is necessary to equal the number of the iṣṭakās.



## SŪTRA CLII.

As the Prakṛti has been told before, anything that has not been told before, should be at the end.

### Commentary

This seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vikṛti, and not mentioned in the Prakṛti, should come in at the end, that is, after those portions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prakṛti.



## SŪTRA CLIII.

The rule should stand on account of the fitness of the Kumbhi, a large pot, the Śūla, the spit for boiling the heart, and the two Vapāśrapaṇīs, the spits for roasting the vapā.

### Commentary

Kumbhī is explained by sroṇyādipākasamarthā

bṛhatī sthālī; Śūla by hṛdayapākārthā yaṣṭiḥ, and Vapāśrapaṇī by vapāśrapaṇārthe yaṣṭī dve. The exact object of the Sūtra is not quite clear. Prabhutva is explained by samarthatva, that is, fitness. This would mean, that on account of their fitness, or because they can be used for the object for which they are intended, or, so long as they can be used, the rule applying to them should remain. The commentary explains tantram by tantratā or ekatā. It may mean that the same pots and spits should be used, so long as they fulfil their purpose. The next Sūtra would then form a natural limitation.



## SŪTRA CLIV.

But if there is a different kind of animal, there is difference (in pots and spits), owing to the diversity of cooking.

### Commentary

If different animals are to be cooked, then there must be different pots for each (pratipaśum), because each requires a different kind of cooking. The commentary adds that, as the reason for using different pots is given, that reason applies also to young and old animals of the same kind (jāti), i, e. the young and small animal would require a different pot and a different kind of cooking.



## SŪTRA CLV.

At the Vanaspati sacrifice, which is a modification (vikāra) of the Sviṣṭakṛt, the addresses (nigama) of the deities should take place in the Yājyā, because they are included in the Prakṛti.

### Commentary

These nigamas of the deities are not mentioned in the rules of the Vanaspati sacrifice, but they are mentioned in the rules for the Sviṣṭakṛt sacrifice of the Darśapūrṇamāsa, which is the Prakṛti, and should therefore be taken over. Here again, because a reason is given, it is understood that the same reason would apply to other portions of Sviṣṭakṛt also, such as the Dvir abhighāraṇa, which is to be retained in the Vanaspati sacrifice.



## SŪTRA CLVI.

The Anvārambhaṇīyā or initiatory ceremony does not take place in a Vikṛti, because the Vikṛtis would fall within the time of the Prakṛti, and the Anvārambhaṇīyā has but one object, namely (the initiation of) the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice.

### Commentary

The Anvārambhaṇīyā ceremony has to be performed by those who begin the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice. It has thus one object only, and is never enjoined for any other cause. It is not therefore transferred to any Vikṛti, such as the Saurya ceremony, &c. The Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice having to be performed during the whole of life, or during thirty years, the Vikṛtis would necessarily fall within the same space of time. The initiatory ceremony has reference to the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice only, and thus serves as an introduction to all the Vikṛtis, without having to be repeated for each.



## SŪTRA CLVII.

Or (according to others) the Anvārambhaṇīyā should take place (in the Vikṛtis also), because the time (of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa) does not form an essential part.

### Commentary

This Sūtra is not quite clear. It shows clearly enough that, according to some authorities, the Anvārambhaṇīyā or initiatory ceremony of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice should take place in the Vikṛtis also; but why? Because the time has not the character of a śeṣa, which is said to be a synonym of aṅga, an essential part of a sacrifice.

When it is said that the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa should be performed during life, this is not meant as determining the time of the sacrifice. It only means that so long as there is life a man should perform these sacrifices, and that their non-performance would constitute a sin. The former argument, therefore, that the time of the Vikṛti sacrifices would fall within the time of the Prakṛti sacrifice is not tenable.



## SŪTRA CLVIII.

And again, because there is difference in the undertaking.

### Commentary

Ārambha, the beginning, is explained as the determination to perform a certain sacrifice (darśapūrṇamāsābhyāyṃ yakṣya iti niścayapuraḥsaraḥ saṅkalpaḥ). The object of the undertaking in the case of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice, as the Prakṛti, is simply svarga, in the Vikṛtis it may be any kind of desire. Therefore the Anvārambhaṇīyā ceremony of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsas should be transferred to its Vikṛtis. This seems to have been the opinion of the same authorities who are referred to in Sūtra CLVII. The final outcome of the whole controversy, however, is clearly that our Ācārya is in favour of omitting the Anvārambhaṇīyā in the Vikṛtis. Anayoḥ pakṣayor anvārambhaṇīyābhāvapakṣasyaiva balavattvam ācāryābhilaṣitam iti manyāmahe. The Anvārambhaṇīyā is not to be considered as an ordinary Aṅga, but as a special act to fit the sacrificer to perform the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa and to perform it through the whole of his life.



## SŪTRA CLIX.

For every object (new sacrifice) let him bring forward the fire (let him perform the Agnipraṇayana, the fetching of the Āhavanīya from the Gārhapatya fire). When the sacrifice is finished the fire becomes again ordinary fire, as when the (divine) fire has returned (to the firesticks).

+++

At the beginning of a special part of the sacrifice, one should wish the object of that part of the sacrifice.

## Commentary

The commentary, though objecting, and objecting rightly, to kāmayeta, 'he should wish,' in the preceding Sūtra, accepts kāmayeta as determining the present Sūtra, saying kāmayetety anuvartate. One should read yajñāṅgakāmam, not yajñakāmam, for the commentary explains it by yajñāṅgaphalasaṅkalpaḥ. Whether it was really intended that there should be a special wish for each part or subsidiary act of a sacrifice (yajñāṅga), is another question, but the commentator evidently thought so.

Kātyāyana, who treats the same subject (1, 2, 10 seq.), states that there should be this desire for a reward for certain sacrifices which are offered for a certain purpose, as, for instance, the Dvādaśāha, but that there are no such motives for other sacrifices, and parts of sacrifices. He mentions, first of all, a niyama, a precept for the sacrifice, such as 'Speak the truth.' Then a nimitta, a special cause, as when some accident has taken place that must be remedied, for instance, when the house has been burnt down, &c. Thirdly, the Agnihotra, the morning and evening Homa; fourthly, the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau; fifthly, the Dākṣāyaṇa, a vikṛti of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, the Āgrayaṇa; sixthly, the Nirūḍha-paśu, the animal sacrifice. All these have to be performed as a sacred duty, and without any view to special rewards. Thus we read in Vāsiṣṭha:

Avaśyam brāhmaṇo'gnīn ādadhīta, darśapūrṇamāsāgrayaṇeṣṭicāturmāsyapaśusomaiś ca yajeta, 'A Brāhmaṇa should without fail place his fires, and offer the Darśapūrṇamāsa, the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi, the Kāturmāsyas, the P a ś u, and the Soma sacrifices.'

Hārīta says: Pākayajñān yajen nityaṃ haviryajñāṃś ca nityaśaḥ, Somāṃś ca vidhipūrveṇa ya icched dharmam avyayam, 'Let a man offer the Pākayajñas always, always also the Haviryajñas, and the Soma sacrifices, according to rule, if he wishes for eternal merit.' The object of these sacrifices is aparimitaniḥśreyasarūpamokṣa, eternal happiness, and hence they have to be performed during life at certain seasons, without any special occasion (nimitta), and without any special object (kāma). According to most authorities, however, they have to be performed during thirty years only. After that the Agnihotra only has to be kept up. The proper seasons for these sacrifices are given by Manu, IV, 25-27:

A Brāhmaṇa shall always offer the Agnihotra at the beginning or at the end of the day and of the night, and the Darśa and Paurṇamāsa (iṣṭis) at the end of each half-month;

'When the old grain has been consumed the (Āgrayaṇa) Iṣṭi with new grain; at the end of the (three) seasons the (Cāturmāsya) sacrifices; at the solstices an animal (sacrifice); at the end of the year Soma offerings;

'A Brāhmaṇa, who keeps sacred fires, shall, if he desires to live long, not eat new grain or meat, without having offered the (Āgrayaṇa) Iṣṭi with new grain and an animal (sacrifice)[^1].'

These Pākayajñas, Haviryajñas or iṣṭis, and Soma sacrifices are enumerated by Gautama[^2], as follows:

| Seven Pākasaṃsthās: | Seven Haviryajñasaṃsthās: | Seven Somasaṃsthās: |
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| (1) Aṣṭakā,         | (1) Agnyādheyam,          | (1) Agniṣṭomaḥ,     |
| (2) Pārvaṇam,       | (2) Agnihotram,           | (2) Atyagniṣṭomaḥ,  |
| (3) Śrāddham,       | (3) Darśapūrṇamāsau,      | (3) Ukthyaḥ,        |
| (4) Śrāvaṇī,        | (4) Cāturmāsyāni[^3],      | (4) Ṣoḍaśī[^4],      |
| (5) Āgrahāyaṇī,     | (5) Āgrayaṇeṣṭiḥ,         | (5) Vājapeyaḥ,      |

| (7) Āśvayujī.       | (7) Sautrāmaṇī.           | (7) Aptoryāmaḥ.     |

  
In a commentary on Dhūrtasvāmin's Āpastambasūtrabhāṣya (MS. E.I.H. 137) another list is given:

| Pākayajñas:        | Haviryajñas:        | Somayajñas:    |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| (1) Aupāsanahomaḥ, | Agnihotram,         | Agniṣṭomaḥ,    |
| (2) Vaiśvadevam,   | Darśapūrṇamāsau,    | Atyagniṣṭomaḥ, |
| (3) Pārvaṇam,      | Āgrayaṇam,          | Ukthyaḥ,       |
| (4) Aṣṭakā,        | Cāturmāsyāni,       | Ṣoḍaśī,        |
| (5) Māsiśrāddham,  | Nirūḍhapaśubandhaḥ, | Vājapeyaḥ,     |
| (6) Sarpabaliḥ,    | Sautrāmaṇī,         | Atirātraḥ,     |
| (7) Īśānabaliḥ.    | Piṇḍapitṛyajñaḥ.    | Aptoryāmaḥ.    |

  
This list is nearly the same as one given by Satyavrata Sāmāśrami in the Uṣā. He gives, however, another list, which is:

| Seven Pākasaṃsthās: | Seven Haviḥsaṃsthās: | Seven Somasaṃsthās: |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| (1) Sāyaṃhomaḥ,     | Agnyādheyam,         | Agniṣṭomaḥ,         |
| (2) Prātarhomaḥ,    | Agnihotram,          | Atyagniṣṭomaḥ,      |
| (3) Sthālīpāka,     | Darśa-,              | Ukthyaḥ,            |
| (4) Navayajñaḥ,     | Paurṇamāsau,         | Ṣoḍaśī,             |
| (5) Vaiśvadevam,    | Āgrayaṇa,            | Vājapeyaḥ,          |
| (6) Pitṛyajñaḥ,     | Cāturmāsyāni,        | Atirātraḥ,          |
| (7) Aṣṭakā.         | Paśubandhaḥ.         | Aptoryāmaḥ.         |

  
According to the substances offered, sacrifices are sometimes divided into vegetable and animal sacrifices. The vegetable substances are, taṇḍulāḥ, piṣṭāni, phalīkaraṇāḥ, puroḍāśaḥ, odanaḥ, yavāgūḥ, pṛthukāḥ, lājāḥ, dhānāḥ, and aktavaḥ. The animal substances are, payaḥ, dadhi, ājyam, āmikṣā, vājinam, vapā, tvacaḥ, māṃsam, lohitam, and paśurasaḥ.

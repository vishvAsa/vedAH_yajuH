The Prakṛti stops from three causes, from a corollary, from a prohibition, and from loss of purpose.

## Commentary

A corollary (pratyāmnāna) occurs, when it is said, 'instead of Kuśa grass, let him make a barhis of reeds.' A prohibition (pratishedha) occurs, when it is said, 'he does not choose an Ārsheya.' Loss of purpose (arthalopa) occurs, when peṣaṇa, pounding, would refer to caru, a pulse, that cannot be pounded, while grains can be.

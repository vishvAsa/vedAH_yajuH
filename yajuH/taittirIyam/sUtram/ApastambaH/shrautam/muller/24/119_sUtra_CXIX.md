The Vaiśvadeva is the norm for the Varuṇa-praghāsa, Sākamedha, and Sīra.

## Commentary

The Vaiśvadeva, beginning, like the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, with an Āgneya aṣṭakapāla, takes certain rules from the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, and transfers these, together with its own, as, for instance, the nine prayājas, to the Varuṇa-praghāsa, &c.

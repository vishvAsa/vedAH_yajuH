They are optionally vikāras of the Aindrāgna.

## Commentary

Sometimes these two Sūtras are combined into one. The commentator, however, sees in the vā of aindrāgnavikārā vā a deeper meaning. Agnī-Shomau, he says, consists of four, Indrāgnī of three syllables. Therefore if the name of more than one deity consists of four syllables, it should be treated as a vikāra of the Agnīṣomīya, if of less than four syllables, as a vikāra of the Aindrāgna.

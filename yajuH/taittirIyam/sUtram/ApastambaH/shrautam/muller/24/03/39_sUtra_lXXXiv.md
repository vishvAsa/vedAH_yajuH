title = "३९ SŪTRA LXXXIV"

+++

A principal act is what has its own name, and is prescribed with special reference to place, time, and performer.

## Commentary

This Sūtra is sometimes divided into two; the first, dese kāle kartarīti nirdiśyate, the second, asvaśabdaṃ yat. The following are given as illustrations. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vaiśvadeva on a slope inclined to the East,' we have the locality. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vājapeya in autumn,' we have the time. If it is said that 'the sacrificer himself should offer the Agnihotra on a parvan (change of the moon),' we have the performer. In each of these cases, therefore, the prescribed sacrificial act is a pradhāna sāṅgam, a principal act with auxiliary members.

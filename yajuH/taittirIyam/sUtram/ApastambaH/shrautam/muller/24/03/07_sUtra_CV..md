All this applies also to Carus and Puroḍāśas which are separated.

## Commentary

The commentary explains vyatishikta by anyonyaṃ vyavahita, though it is difficult to see how it can have that meaning. It is said that in the Vaiśvadeva the Carus and Puroḍāśas are vyatishikta, but that they also have to be divided before the adhivapana, and to be marked for each deity. Thus we read: Idam Agneḥ, Savituḥ, Pūṣṇo, Marutāṃ, Dyāvāpṛthivyoḥ, &c.

With the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayāma.

## Commentary

Grahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which the Soma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words upayāma-gṛhīto^(ऽ)si, and while these words are being uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhārāṃ srāvayet).

If there is nothing very like, something a little like may be substituted, only it must not be prohibited.

## Commentary

If in a caru of mudgas, kidney-beans, phaseolus mungo, these kidney-beans should fail, a substitute may be taken, but that substitute must not be māṣas, phaseolus radiatus, because these māṣas are expressly forbidden; for it is said, Ayajñiyā vai māṣāḥ, 'Māṣas are not fit for sacrifice.'

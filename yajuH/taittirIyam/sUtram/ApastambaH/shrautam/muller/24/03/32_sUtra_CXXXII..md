title = "32 SŪTRA CXXXII"

+++

In a Vikṛti sacrifice modification takes place, according to the sense, but not in an arthavāda.

## Commentary

Some mantras remain the same in the Vikṛti as in the Prakṛti. Others have to be modified so as to be adapted to anything new that has to be. If, for instance, there is a Puroḍāśa for Agni in the Prakṛti, and in its place a Puroḍāśa for Sūrya in the Vikṛti, then we must place Sūrya instead of Agni in the dedicatory mantra.

The Āśruta and Pratyāśruta, the Yājyā and Anuvākyā, the Upastaraṇa and Abhighāraṇa, with the slicings, the Caturgṛhīta also, and the Vaṣaṭkāra constitute the Darvi-homas.

## Commentary

The Āśruta is ā śrāvaya; the Pratyāśruta, astu śrauṣaṭ; Anuvākyā and Yājyā are verses, the first inviting the deity, the second accompanying the sacrifice. Whenever vegetable, animal, or sāṃnāyya offerings have to be. sliced, upastaraṇa, spreading, and abhighāraṇa, sprinkling with fat, take place. With ājya offerings there is Caturgṛhīta (taking four times), and the Vaṣaṭkāra.

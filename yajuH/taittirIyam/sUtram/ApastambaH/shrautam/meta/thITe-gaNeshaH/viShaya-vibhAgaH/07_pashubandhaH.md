8. “The fires of the sacrificer who does not perform sac rifice desire flesh indeed; they think of the sacrificer; they plan (to eat) the sacrificer; on other fires people indeed cook pro fane flesh. But for these (sacred) fires there is no other hope of flesh; of him who has these (sacred fires) him without per forming an animal-sacrifice no year should pass: (The animal sacrifice) is helpful for him to get long life; it is a kind of self redemption" this is the view of the Vājasaneyins. 1.

1. The text reads 'ca'. Caland suggests va and compares XVIII.7.15. 
This suggestion appears to be plausible. 2. Sec III.16. 11-17.3. 3. For the details see the next Saira. 4. For this sec XXII.20.9-21.11. 5. For this Sotra cp. SB XIII.6.2.20. While translating these two 
Sotras Caland says that one should enter into the village after having performed Traidhataviya-offering, This does not appear to be correct. The text reads gramain và pravisya i.e. after having 
entered in the village. पञ्चयिलस्य चरोर्विज्ञायते। आज्य आग्नेयः पूर्वस्मिन्बिले। दधन्यैन्द्रो दक्षिणे। शृते प्रतिदुहि नीतमिश्रे वा वैश्वदेवः पश्चिमे। अप्सु मैत्रावरुण उत्तरे। पयसि ang paraat 11211

pap) in water pap) in milk for 
in water for Mitra-Varuṇa in the northern (cavity), (rice 
in milk for Brhaspati in the central (cavity) (should be cooked and then offered).' 
1. This five-holed rice-pap might have been taken from ŚB V.5.1.1.

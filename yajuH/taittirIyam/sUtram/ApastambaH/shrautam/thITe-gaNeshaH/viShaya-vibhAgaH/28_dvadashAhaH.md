DVĀDAŚĀHA (TWELVE-DAY-SACRIFICE) 
## 21.01
द्वादशाहेन प्रैव जायते ऽभि स्वर्ग लोकं जयत्येषु लोकेषु प्रतितिष्ठति॥१॥ 
1. One produces progeny, one wins the heaven, one es tablishes in these worlds by means of Dvādaśāha sacrifice. 
_1. See TS VII.2.9.1. साग्निचित्यो भवति॥२॥ 
2. This (sacrifice) is accompanied with a fire-altar-build ing-rite. 
सत्त्रमहीनश्च॥३॥ 3. (It can be) a Sattra and an Ahīna (type of sacrifice). दीक्षितमदीक्षिता याजयेयुरहीने। एत एवत्विजो यजमानश्च सत्ते॥४॥ 
4. In the Ahīna (type), the non-consecrated (priests) cause a consecrated (sacrificer) perform (the ritual).' In the Sattra (type) the same priests are also the sacrificers. 
1. CI. KS XXXIV.9. 2. Instead of the word yajamanaśca we should read yajamanasca 
(plur. Cf. Caland on this Sotra). तस्मादद्वादशाहेन न याज्यं पाप्मनो व्यावृत्त्या इति विज्ञायते॥५॥ 5. “Therefore one should not perform a twelve-day sacri 
1236 
fice for any one else, in order to avoid evil”-So is known for a Brahmana-text). 
1 See TS VII.2.10.4. From this it is implied that one should not 
work as a priest for Dvādaśaha-sacrifice which is performed as an ahina. On the other hand one may participate in Dvadasiha pro vided it is Sattra in which case one will have to be one of the 
sacrificers only. ऋध्नोति यो द्वादशाहेन यजते॥६॥ 6. He who performs the Dvādaśāla-sacrifice prospers. ऋध्नोति यः प्रतिगृह्णातीत्येके।७॥ 
7. Some (say) he who accepts (sacrificial gifts in a Dvādaśāha-sacrifice),' prospers. 
1. KS XXXIV.9. ऋत्विजो यजमानं चाधिकृत्य वदति॥८॥ 
8. (Here the Brāhmaṇa-text) speaks about the priests and the sacrificer. 
पीवा दीक्षते। कृशो यजतो यदस्याङ्गानां मीयते जुहोत्येव तदिति विज्ञायते॥९॥ 
9. It is known (from a Brāhmana-text that) being fat he is consecrated; thin he performs the sacrifice, whatever of his limbs reduces, he offers (to the Gods).' 
1. Cr. KS XXXIV.9; cp. also X.14.10. 
यो ऽतपस्वी स्यादसंश्लिष्टो ऽस्य यज्ञः स्यात्। तपस्वी स्यात्। यज्ञमेव तत्सं श्लेषयत इति विज्ञायते॥१०॥ 
10. His sacrifice will be unconnected who would be with out penance. He practises penance, thereby he causes the sac rifice to be connected-Thus is known from a Brahmana-text'. 
1. KS XXXIV.9. एको द्वादशाहेन यजेत। त्रयः षड् द्वादश त्रयोदश वा॥११॥ 
11. One may singly perform the Dvādaśäha; or three, six, twelve or thirteen (sacrificers) may perform it.'

1237 
तेषामुपसत्सु त्रयोदशं दीक्षयन्ति॥१२॥ 
12. They consecrate the thirteenth one of these on the Upasad days." 
1. Cf. KS XXXIV.13. तस्मादद्वादशाहे त्रयोदशेन न ब्रह्मणा भवितव्यमित्येके॥१३॥ 
13. Therefore according to some, a Brahmin should not be the thirteenth (sacrificer) in a Dvādaśāha.' 
1. Cf. KS XXXIV.9; cp. also TMB X.3.2. Thus it is implied that 
a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya can be the thirteenth sacrificer. पञ्चदश दीक्षेरन्नर्धमासायतनाः। सप्तदश प्रजाकामाः पशुकामा वा। एक विंशति प्रतिष्ठाकामा रुक्कामा वा। त्रिंशतं मासायतनाः। त्रयस्त्रिंशतमोजस्कामा वीर्यकामा वा। चत्वारिंशतं यज्ञकामाः। चतुश्वत्वारिंशतमिन्द्रियकामाः। अष्टा चत्वारिंशतं पशुकामाः॥१४॥

1. Cp. KS XXXIV.9; TMB X.3.3-4. अपरिमिता दीक्षेरन्नित्यन्ततो वदति॥१५॥ 
15. Finally they say that unlimited (number of persons) should get themselves consecrated.' 
1. KS XXXIV.9. ये ऽन्ये सप्तदशभ्यो वादा अहीन एव ते स्थानिनः॥१६॥ 
16. The words (referring to the number) other than seven teen find their place only in the (Dvādaśāha of the) Ahīna type. 
सप्तदशानामेव याथाकामी॥१७॥

18. All should have a place in the (duties to be carried out) by the sacrificer. 
सर्वे याजमानं कुर्युर्यत्किंचाविज्येनाविबाधकम्॥१९॥

विबाधमान आर्विज्यं बलीयः।।२०॥ 
20. When there will be conflict, the duty as a priest (should be considered) as stronger. 
## 21.02

सर्व इष्टप्रथमयज्ञाः। अपि वा गृहपतिरेव॥१॥ 
1. All (the performers of the sacrificial session) should be those who have already performed the first (Soma-sacrifice)'; or only the Gṣhapati? (leader of the Sattra) (should be one who has already performed the first sacrifice). 
1. Thus they should have atleast once performed either an Agniṣt 
oma or an Atirätra sacrifice. See X.2.3-4. 2. The word 'GȚhapati' literally means 'Lord of the house and he 
carries out the work of 'sacrificer' in a Sattra and is considered as the chief (mukhya) amongst the performers. Cp. ŚārkhāśS 
XIII.14.4. गृहपतेरेव परार्थानि यथा यूपाञ्जनमृतुयाज्येति॥२॥ 
2. Those duties which are for the sake of the other (per sons or things) are to be done by the Gṣhapati only. Thus for example, anointing the sacrificial post? or recitation of the of fering verse for the R̥tu-scoop.3

tion with his own person (ātmārtha). The dimartha activities e. 8. 
shaving, purification etc. are to be done by all the performers. 2. See VII. 10.2-3. 3. See XII.26.7.

possible". According to me there is no need to change the reading. The word avibhavinaḥ means “impossible". So those details which cannot be done collectively should be done individually in the 
case of each performer. नानागोत्रव्यवायादेव समानगोत्राणामायवरणमभ्यावर्तेतेत्येकम्। व्यवेते ऽपि तन्त्रमेवेत्यपरम्॥४॥

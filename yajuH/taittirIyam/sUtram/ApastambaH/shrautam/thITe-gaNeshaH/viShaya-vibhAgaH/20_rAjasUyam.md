1. Thus the Agniṣtoma is a one day sacrifice but before the Soma 
sacrificial day there is one dīkṣā day and three Upasad day. पञ्च सहस्त्राणि पवित्रे ददाति। त्रिंशतमभिषेचनीये। त्रिंशतं दशपेये। दश केशवपनीये। विंशतिं व्युष्टिद्विरात्रे। पञ्च क्षत्रस्य धृतौ॥४॥

शेषमनुदिशति॥९॥ 9. The remaining (cows) he assigns.1 
1. When a big number cows are to be given the procedure may take 
a long time. Therefore, only a few cow may bé "led” in their proper time i.e should be led (given) literally and others are to be simply assigned to the priests. Thus all the cows need not be 
ritually led. श्वोभूत आनुमतादिभिरष्टाभिरन्वहं यजते॥१०॥ 
10. From the following day' he performs everyday one by one the eight offerings beginning with one for Anumati.

12. From that part (of the grains) which falls to the west of the Samyā,' he prepares (a sacrificial bread) on one potsherd for Nirrti.2 
1. See I.23.3. 
2. Cp. TS I.8.1.1; TB I.6.1.1. य उदञ्चस्तानुदङ् परेत्य वल्मीकवपामुद्धत्येदमहममुष्यामुष्यायणस्य क्षेत्रि यमवयज इति शुक्तया वल्मीकवपायां हुत्वेममहममुष्यामुष्यायणस्य क्षेत्रियम पिदधामीति तयैव शुक्त्या वल्मीकवपामपिदध्यात्॥१३॥

1. Valmīkavapā = fossilized ant-hill. 
2. Cp. KS XV.1; MS II.6.1. वल्मीकवपया जुहोति वल्मीकवपयापिदधातीत्येके॥१४॥ 
14, According to some (ritualists) he offers by means of the fossilized ant-hill' and covers (the offered portion) by means of the fossilized ant-hill. 
1. Caland doubts the practicability of this action. Perhaps he has 
not clearly understood the difference between valmika (ant-hill) and valmikavapā (fossilized ant-hill). He understands the word valmikavapā simply in the sense of “ameisenhaufen” (ant-hill) and therefore he doubts the practicability. Here the word 
valmikavapā is used and not the word valmika (ant-hill). आनुमतमासाद्य नैर्ऋतेन प्रचरति॥१५॥ 
15. Having placed (the sacrificial bread) for Anumati (on the Vedi) he performs (the ritual of the sacrificial bread) for

17. Having gone to a region in the south-western direction, then having placed (the burning fire-brand) on a naturally formed pit' or cleft, he offers the complete (sacrificial bread)2 for Nirsti with eṣa te nirste bhāgaḥ...by means of both the thumbs or the two Visraṁsikā (index-finger) joints.

the word Visramsikā as the uprooted upgrowth of plants etc. on a place. He also quotes and discards the view of Tālavstaväsin who says that Visraṁsikā means the index-fingers I, however, 
support Tālavịntavāsin. कृष्णं वासः कृष्णतूषं दक्षिणा॥१८॥ 18. A black garment with black fringes! is a sacrificial 
gift. 
1. Cf. (krṣṇatūṣa) TS 1.8.1.1; TB 1.6.1.4. कृष्णं वासो भिन्नान्तमित्येके॥१९॥

1. Cf. KS XV.1; MS II 6.1. 2. bhinnänta. According to Caland this word means almost the same 
as “with black fringes”. But if it were the same there was no need 
of mentioning it as a view of “some" ritualists. अप्रतीक्षमायन्ति निर्ऋत्या अन्तर्हित्या इति विज्ञायते॥२०॥ 
20. It is known (from a Brāhmaṇa-text). “They return (to the sacrificial place without looking back in order to keep away Nirsti”.

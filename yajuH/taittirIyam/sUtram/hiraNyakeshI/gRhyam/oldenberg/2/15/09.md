9. When the food (for the Brāhmaṇas) is ready, he cuts off (the Avadānas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations thereof with the verses, 'Behold the Ekāṣṭakā, the giver of food with meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadhā. By the Brāhmaṇas that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessing) to me! Svadhā! Adoration!'

'The Ekāṣṭakā, devoting herself to austerities, the consort of the year, exuberant (with milk), has poured forth milk. May you live on that milk, O Fathers, all together. May this (food) be well offered and well sacrificed by me! Svadhā! Adoration!

'The image of the year' (Taitt. Saṃh. V, 7, 2, 1).

'May Indra give me insight; may Sarasvatī, the goddess, (give) insight; may both Aśvins, wreathed with lotus, bestow insight on me. Svāhā!

'The insight that dwells with the Apsaras, the mind that dwells with the Gandharvas, the divine insight and that which is born from men: may that insight, the fragrant one, rejoice in me! Svāhā!

'May insight, the fragrant one, that assumes all shapes, the gold-coloured, mobile one, come to me. Rich in sap, swelling with milk, may she, insight, the lovely-faced one, rejoice in me! Svāhā!'

2. [^1]  A bird (he addresses) with (the verse), 'Thou fliest, stretching out thy legs; the left eye . . .; may nothing here suffer harm (through thee);'


[^1]:  17, 2. The commentary explains śakuni (bird) by dhvāṅkṣa (crow). In the translation of the Mantra (Taitt. Ār. IV, 35) I have left out the unintelligible words nipepi ca. The way to correct the last Pāda is shown by Atharva-veda VI, 57, 3; X, 5, 23.

7. [^6]  'If a fruit has fallen down from the top of a tree, or from the air, it is Vāyu (who has made it fall). Where it has touched our bodies or the garment, (there) may the waters drive away destruction'this (verse) he should murmur, if a fruit unexpectedly falls down on him.


[^6]:  Atharva-veda VI, 124, 2. The Atharva-veda shows the way to correct the corrupt third Pāda.

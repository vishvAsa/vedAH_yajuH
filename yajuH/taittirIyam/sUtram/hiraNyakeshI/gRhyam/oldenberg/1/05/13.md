13. [^10]  After (the teacher) has recited over him (the formula),


[^10]:  The reading of the last Mantra is doubtful. Iṣṭatas should possibly be iṣṭas, but the genitive analasya, or, as some of the MSS. have, anaḷasya (read, analasasya?), points rather to a genitive like icchatas. If we write icchatas and analasasya, the translation would be: 'May I be dear to thee, who loves me, N.N.! May I be dear to thee, who art zealous, N.N.!' Comp. Śāṅkhāyana II, 3, 3.

'Bhūḥ! Bhuvaḥ! Suvaḥ! By offspring may I become rich in offspring! By valiant sons, rich in valiant sons! By splendour, rich in splendour! By wealth, rich in wealth! By wisdom, rich in wisdom! By pupils, rich in holy lustre!'

And (again the formulas),

'Bhūḥ! I place thee in the Ṛcas, in Agni, on the earth, in voice, in the Brahman, N.N.!

'Bhuvaḥ! I place thee in the Yajus, in Vāyu, in the air, in breath, in the Brahman, N.N.!

'Suvaḥ! I place thee in the Sāmans, in Sūrya, in heaven, in the eye, in the Brahman, N.N.!

'May I be beloved (?) and dear to thee, N.N.!

May I be dear to thee, the fire (?), N.N.! Let us dwell here! Let us dwell in breath and life! Dwell in breath and life, N.N.!'

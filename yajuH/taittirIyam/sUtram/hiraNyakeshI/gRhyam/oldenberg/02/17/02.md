[^2]  On the full-moon day of Mārgaśīrṣa he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the entire surface round the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with milk, sprinkles it (with Ājya), takes it from the fire, performs the rites down to the Vyāhṛti oblations, and sacrifices (four oblations) with (the following Mantras):


[^2]:  The first Mantra is very corrupt; comp. Atharva-veda III, 10, 6. Regarding the legend of Iḍā, who was procreated out of Manu's Pala-sacrifice, and 'came forth as if dripping, and clarified butter gathered on her step,' comp. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa I, 8, 1, 7 (M.M., India, what can it teach us? p. 136).

'This offering, the creeping of Iḍā, rich in ghee, moving and not moving, accept gladly, O Jātavedas.

What domestic animals there are, of all shapes, all seven kinds of them: may they gladly dwell here and may they prosper. Svāhā!

'The night which men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Svāhā!

'Bringing bliss to the cattle, to the wife, bringing bliss by night and by day, may this (night) which is the consort of the year, be auspicious to us. Svāhā!

'The full-moon night, bringing abundance, visiting one after another, dividing the months and fortnights: may this (night), the full one, protect us. Svāhā!'

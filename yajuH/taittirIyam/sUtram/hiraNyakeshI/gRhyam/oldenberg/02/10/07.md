7. [^4]  Having performed the rites down to the Vyāhṛti oblations with his sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, he suspends it over his right shoulder and sacrifices with (the following Mantras):


[^4]:  Comp. Śāṅkhāyana III, 13, 5. The translation there given of the words anyam antaḥ pitur dadhe ought to be changed accordingly.For ābhur anyopapadyatām read mātur anyo ऽvapadyatām as Śāṅkhāyana has.

'To Soma with the Fathers, svadhā! Adoration! 'To Yama with the Aṅgiras and with the Fathers, svadhā! Adoration!

'With the waters that spring in the east and those that come from the north: with the waters, the supporters of the whole world, I interpose another one between (myself and) my father. Svadhā! Adoration!

'I interpose (another one) through the mountains;

'I interpose through the wide earth; through the sky and the points of the horizon, through infinite bliss I interpose another one between (myself and) my grandfather. Svadhā! Adoration!

'I interpose (another one) through the seasons, through days and nights with the beautiful twilight. Through half-months and months I interpose another one between (myself and) my great-grandfather. Svadhā! Adoration!'

Then he sacrifices with their names: 'To N.N. svadhā! Adoration! To N.N. svadhā! Adoration!'

'Wherein my mother has done amiss, abandoning her duty (towards her husband), may my father take that sperm as his own; may another one fall off from the mother. Svadhā! Adoration!'

In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra, 'Wherein my grandmother,' 'Wherein my great-grandmother.'

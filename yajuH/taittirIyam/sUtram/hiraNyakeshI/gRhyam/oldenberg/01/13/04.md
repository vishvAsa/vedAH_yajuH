4. [^3]  'To the ocean I send you, the imperishable (waters); go back to your source. May I not suffer loss in my offspring. May my sap not be shed'this (verse the guest) recites over the remainder (of the Argha water), when it is poured out (by the person who had offered it to him).


[^3]:  Pāraskara I, 3, 14.

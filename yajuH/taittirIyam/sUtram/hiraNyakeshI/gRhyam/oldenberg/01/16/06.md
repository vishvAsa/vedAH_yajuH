6. [^5]  'From the sky, from the wide air a drop of water has fallen down on me, bringing luck. With my senses, with my mind I have united myself, protected by the prayer that is brought forth by the righteous ones'this (verse) he should murmur, if a drop of water unexpectedly falls down on him.


[^5]:  Atharva-veda VI, 124, 1. Read sukṛtāṃ kṛtena.

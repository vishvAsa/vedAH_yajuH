1 [^1]  Now henceforth the performance of the domestic sacrifices of cooked food (will be explained).


[^1]:  1, 1. Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 1; Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 1, &c. It seems to me that Professor Stenzler is not quite right in giving to the opening words of the text athātaḥ, which he translates 'nun also,' the explanation: 'das heisst, nach Beendigung des Śrauta-sūtra von Kātyāyana.' I think rather it can be shown that ataḥ does not contain a reference to something preceding; thus the Śrauta-sūtra, which forms the first part of the whole Sūtra collection, is opened in the same way by the words athātoऽdhikāraḥ.

5 [^3] . 'Men are both Mitra and Varuṇa; men are both the Aśvins; men are Indra and Sūrya. May a man be born in me! Again svāhā!'with (this verse) a wife who desires to conceive, (should offer) the first (oblation).


[^3]:  Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 17, 9, where the reading and the construction slightly differ. The words punaḥ svāhā at the end of the Mantra seem to be corrupt; the frequent repetition of pumāṃsam and pumān through the whole verse suggests the correction puṃse svāhā, or pumbhyaḥ svāhā, 'to the man svāhā!' or 'to the men svāhā!'

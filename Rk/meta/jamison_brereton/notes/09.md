Commentary IX.1-67
Since all hymns in this maṇḍala are dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, the dedicand will not be
identified for each hymn.
In both the publ. tr. and in the comm., I have tried to use lower case soma for the
substance and capped Soma for the god, but of course much of the point of the Soma
Maṇḍala is that the two cannot be separated. So this convention is not fully workable.

- 1-67 -All hymns in Gāyatrī meter.

## 001
### 01-02
After establishing the Soma Pavamāna theme in the 2nd pāda of the 1st vs., with the
command pávasva soma “purify yourself, Soma,” in the 2nd vs. the poet presents Soma in an
expansive role, as demon-smasher (rakṣohán-) and belonging to all domains (viśvácarṣani-),
while at the same time precisely locating him in his seat on the ritual ground. This
juxtaposition of hyper-local, ritually defined technical details and the grandiosely universal
is typical of the entire IXth Maṇḍala.

### 02
The adj. áyohata- ‘metal-hammered’ occurs twice in the RV (also IX.80.2), both
qualifying yóni- ‘womb’ and referring to something that contains soma. Old suggests that it
refers to a wooden vessel that has been hewn out by a metal blade.
What the instr. drúṇā is doing here is unclear to me. This instr. appears 5x in the RV;
in the two passages outside of the Soma maṇḍala (V.86.3, VIII.96.11) it appears to refer to
an implement with which one accomplishes something -- in the latter passage a paddle to
propel a boat to reach the far shore. Of the two other passages in IX, IX.65.6 drúṇā
sadhástham aśnuṣe is quite similar to this one: “you attain to your seat drúṇā,” and in 98.2  
índur abhí drúṇā hitáḥ, which lacks an overt ‘seat’, the interpr. depends on which
root hitáḥ is assigned to: √dhā ‘place’ or √hi ‘impel’. In all three soma passages I take
drúṇā as an implement (a wooden vessel or even a pusher, a paddle) that allows soma to
attain its place or (in 98.2, taking hitá- to √hi) to be impelled on its way. This is not the
standard interpr.; most (see, e.g., Old’s disc.) take it as referring to the wooden cup or vessel
that constitutes soma’s “seat” (e.g., Ge “an seinen Platz aus Holz”), but the instr. in such an
interpr. is troubling. Re remarks “Instr. un peu rude pour d° kṛtám” and renders (ad IX.1.2)  65.6  
as “placé (sur la cuve faite) en bois.” Though he further remarks “on ne peut parler
qu’avec réserve de l’Instr. de matière en véd.,” an instr. of material is essentially the
standard interpr. of drúṇā in this passage -- one that I would prefer to avoid, though perhaps
at the expense of inventing another implement in the soma ritual.

### 03
The aggrandizing of Soma’s role continues here, with 3 superlatives: varivodhā́tama- ‘best establisher of the wide realm’, máṃhistha- ‘most munificent’, and vṛtrahántama- ‘best smasher of obstacles’ -- the last of course borrowing Indra’s signature
epithet, while máṃhiṣṭha- also regularly characterizes Indra. Re suggests that the three
represent the three (Dumézilian) functions, but this does not seem particularly compelling.
Vs. 1 also began with two superlatives, svā́diṣṭha- ‘sweetest’ and mádiṣṭha- ‘most
exhilarating’, but these are restricted to soma’s ritual role, whereas the three in this vs.
attribute universal powers to him.
Pāda c is identical to VIII.103.7d, found in the very last hymn of Maṇḍala VIII, just
as this is found in the first hymn of Maṇḍala IX -- so they are adjacent in the Saṃhitā
arrangement. But I don’t know what, if anything, to make of this. If this is more than just
accident, it would suggest that the compilers selected this particular Gāyatrī hymn to begin
IX on the basis of this verbal correspondence.

### 06
As indicated in the publ. intro., the standard clichéś of the soma maṇḍala gave way
here to more novel material. The involvement of the Daughter of the Sun as purifier of soma
is puzzling. Ge suggests (n. 6b) that the Daughter of the Sun, also found in this maṇḍala at
IX.72.3, 113.3, is the “Dicht- oder Gesangeskunst,” on what seem to me slender grounds
(mostly III.53.15, which is not at all clear). Oberlies’s notion (Relig. RV I.241, 282; II.60)
that this locution indicates that Soma comes from heaven to earth at dawn is more plausible
-- though it should be kept in mind that Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, is not the same as
Uṣas, Dawn. I would rather suggest that the presence of this figure in this vs., which
immediately precedes two vss. metaphorically concerning ‘maidens’ (yóṣanaḥ) and ‘unwed
girls’ (agrúvaḥ), is meant to showcase the mythological marriageable maiden par
excellence: Sūryā exists essentially only to get married. Her appearance in this vs. serves as
a positive model for the maidens that follow. However, this interpr. does not fit well with
my interpr. of the other passages in which she appears in this maṇḍala; see esp. disc. ad
IX.72.3.
The referent of te has occasioned some discussion. In this hymn the 2nd ps. referent is
otherwise always soma, but the acc. sómam already appears in the vs. as obj. of punā́ti. The
solution adopted by most (see Old’s disc.), which I also subscribe to, is that te does refer to
soma, but to Soma the god, distinguishing him from soma the liquid, the ritual substance
represented by the acc. sómam. Ge (n. 6) cites other possibilities that have been suggested --
the ritual patron or Indra -- though he himself accepts the Soma the god hypothesis.

### 07
The adj. áṇu- ‘delicate, fine’, always in the fem., is used several times of the fingers
in their task of pressing soma. Because fingers are, of course, joined in the hand they are
also called sisters, as here.
The ‘clash’ (samaryé) presumably refers to the pounding of the pressing stones.

### 08
The ‘unwed girls’ are also the fingers alluded to in the preceding vs.: the pl. agrúvaḥ
is always so used.
In b they are clearly blowing into a musical instrument: bākurá- is a hapax, a vṛddhi
deriv. of bákura- also a hapax (I.117.21), used of a musical instrument one blows (√dham),
as here. Both show non-Indo-Aryan phonology. But what does this have to do with soma
preparation? and how can fingers “blow” into a pipe? Ge, ad I.117.21, suggests that the skin
pipe is the “bildlicher Ausdruck für die Somapflanze”; perhaps the reference is to the stalk,
and perhaps the fingers pressing on the stalk produce a noise similar to a pipe. Or -- perhaps
the poet has simply gotten carried away by a picture of festivity, with unmarried girls
celebrating at a gathering.
The next question is what to do with the acc. phrase in c. I find it unlikely that the
“wild honey” is in apposition to the bag-pipe of b, though Ge seems to take it that way. Re
supplies another verb “(elles traient),” whereas I take it as a return to the object of hinvanti
in pāda a, with b loosely parenthetical. It is “threefold” (tridhā́tu) perhaps in reference to the
three soma pressings, or to some other ritual triplet (see Ge’s suggestions n. 8c). For further
discussion of tridhā́tu … mádhu see comm. ad IX.70.8.

### 09
Note the openings of vss. 7-9: 7 tám īm / 8 tám īm / 9 abhī̀m(ám).
Pāda c is a slight variant on 1c and sketches a ring.

### 10  
As just noted, the last pāda of vs. 9 seems to bring the hymn to a conclusion with a
reprise of the end of the 1st vs., even though another vs. follows. Indeed vs. 10 does seem to
stand apart from the rest of the hymn, while picking up various elements from it. First, note
that though Indra was mentioned in the ring- compositional pādas, 1c índrāya pā́tave sutáḥ,
9c sómam índrāya pā́tave, he was absent from the rest of the hymn and his characteristics
and deeds assigned to Soma instead. But here he reasserts his role as vṛtrá-smasher (b víśvā
vṛtrā́ṇi jighnate), posited of Soma in 3b vṛtrahántamaḥ, and as giver of bounties (c maghā́
… maṃhate), also posited of Soma in 3b máṃhiṣṭhaḥ. The superlative mádiṣṭha- ‘most
exhilarating’, describing the stream of soma in the first pāda of the hymn (1a), returns as the
exhilarations of soma (asyá … mádeṣu)(10a) that spur Indra on to his exploits, the signature
root √mad having been absent for all the rest of the hymn. (This particular ringcompositional effect is obscured in the publ. tr. by my use of ‘raptures’ for mádeṣu in 10a.)
## 002
For the sequence of ideas and actions in this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn begins with the quintessential command of the
Soma maṇḍala: pávasva ‘purify yourself’, found in the previous hymn at the beginning of
the 2nd pāda (IX.1.1b).
The 2nd word devavī́ḥ ‘pursuing the gods’ also matches up with the previous hymn:
> 1.4  
devā́nāṃ vītím.

The expression “across the filter” is iconically split across the pāda break: áti,
pavítram.
The last pāda consists of a neat double figure índram indo vṛ́śā́viśa. The play
between índra- and índu- ‘drop’ is ubiquitous in the IXth Maṇḍala and is in fact reprised in
9a indav indrayúḥ.

### 02
The standard tr. of (ā́) vacyasva (√vañc) here is ‘gallop’ (Ge, Re), but the root itself
means something like ‘move crookedly’ (see comm. ad III.39.1 inter alia). Kulikov (Vedic -
ya-presents) devotes considerable space to this -yá-pres. (218-24), rather desperately
attempting to account for its apparent passive accentuation (vacyáte). He concludes that the
subject of this pres. “always refers to beings set in motion and directed by someone else, not
moving on its [sic] own,” and was originally the passive counterpart of a posited transitive
redupl. pres. **vívaṅkti [double star is Kulikov’s]. I find this over-elaborate -- and since the
subjects are generally horses, or entities configured as horses, and since RVic horses have
considerable agency of their own with regard to movement -- not terribly convincing. In this
particular case, the verb is in the imperative, and it is difficult to see how something
incapable of moving on its own could be commanded to do so. Four of the ten occurrences
of this pres. stem are imperatival, three of them 2nd sg. as here. (the fourth is 3rd pl.). As
discussed ad III.39.1, etc., I consider one of the nuances of this verb to be ‘coil, twist’, and
here I see the soma circling and twisting its way into the cup; the preverb pári ‘around’ is a
regular part of the description of soma’s movements around the filter and into the vessels.
I take the injunc. sadaḥ in the sense of an impv.; see KH (Injunk. 263) for this usage
of this particular form.
On the sa-aor. ádhukṣa-, here in 3rd sg. mid. adhukṣata, see Narten (Sig.Aor. 143-
44).
### 03-04
These two vss. introduce the trope of “clothing,” a metaphor for mixing the soma
juice with various substances: after the pressing proper the soma is mixed first with water
(vs. 3) and then with milk (vs. 4), the latter accounting for the ubiquitous “cows” of the IXth
Maṇḍala. Thus, though an expression “clothe himself with cows” initially strikes the
inexperienced reader as ludicrous, it makes perfect sense in the tightly constructed verbal
realm of the Soma hymns: clothing = mixing and cows = waters.

### 04
What I don’t quite understand is why we have the rather exotic form, a causative
future reflexive middle in 4c, vāsayiṣyáse (lit. ‘you will cause yourself to be clothed’), in
contrast to the straightforward -iṣ-aor. middle vasiṣṭa (‘he has clothed himself’) that
corresponds to it in 3c. The need or desire to use the future must have triggered the creation
of this baroque form. In this connection it is worth noting that √vas ‘clothe’ lacks a standard
future in Vedic and, acdg. to Wh Roots, has only one occurrence in ClSk. of a future
vatsyati -- so perhaps the causative allowed a transparent future to be built more easily. This
form (repeated in the identical pāda in IX.66.13) is also the only medial form of the caus. to
√vas ‘clothe’ in the RV. The question then arises - why is the future so desirable in this
context that such morphological shenanigans had to be performed? The clue to the usage
may lie in part in the sequencing of the verbs: both b and c are repeated in IX.66.13
(likewise as bc), and so the two clauses form a larger unit and must be evaluated together.
The b pāda contains a pres. indic., ā́po arṣanti síndhavaḥ “The waters, the rivers rush,”
while c contains the causative future under discussion. On the one hand, the future may be
signaling that the second action (clothing in milk) will follow the first (clothing in waters);
this is of course the normal ritual order. But we should also remember that the future, esp.
the finite future, is relatively rare in the RV, and, curiously, it tends to have a more
volitional nuance than the subjunctive, with which it competes. A good ex. of this is found
in the famous and well-trodden Agni hymn I.1, where in vs. 6 yád … dāśúṣe … bhadraṃ
kariṣyási should be rendered “what good thing you will do for the pious man,” indicating
Agni’s deliberate choice to favor that man. Here I would suggest that Soma is bound and
determined to clothe himself with milk at this point in the ritual proceedings; it is not just
the next event on the menu.

### 05
This vs. contains several striking paradoxes, once they have been “unpacked.” First,
“the sea has been groomed in the waters,” which seems to reverse volume relations: we
would expect “the sea” (samudrá-) to be more larger and more extensive than the waters,
but evidently the former can be contained and “groomed” (māmṛje) in the latter. The “sea”
is of course soma, which is presumably so called on the basis of the usual aggrandizement of
Soma’s cosmic associations.
Then, without transition, soma goes from being “the sea” to “the prop and buttress of
heaven” -- that is, from something fluid, unstable, and in constant motion to its exact
opposite: solid, fixed, steady enough to support heaven itself. Another paradox and another
indication that Soma’s cosmic ambitions cannot be contained.
It is tempting to supply “earth” in b, on the basis of IX.87.2 = 89.6 viṣtambhó divó
dharúṇaḥ pṛthivyā́ḥ: “the prop of heaven and buttress of the earth,” but perhaps it is better to
stick with the text as we have it.
After the two cosmic identifications in a and b, in c we return to the focused reality
of the ritual: the soma in the filter -- the usual toggling between the universal and the hyperparticular.

### 06
Another cosmic association: Soma shines along with the sun, implying that Soma is
just as bright -- though this may also be a reference to the timing of the morning pressing, at
sunrise.

### 07
Finite forms of the intens. -yá-pres. marmṛjyá- are ordinarily transitive, as in

### 03
etám tyám … marmṛjyánte apasyúvaḥ “This very one [=soma] do the industrious
(fingers) groom,” with the same adj. qualifying the subject as here. Though the transitivity
of the verb in 38.3 is quite clear, our passage is more ambiguous -- and has been discussed
at some length by Ge (n. 7), Bl (RReps ad loc.), and Re. If we wish the verb to be tr., we can
supply ‘you’, as Bl suggests (also Re as an alternative). Or we can take gíraḥ as acc., rather
than nom., and tr. “the industrious ones constantly groom the songs …” However, I prefer to
take the verb as passive (as two of the three forms of the pres. part. marmṛjyámāna- are) and
see the vs. as an expression of ritual reciprocity: the songs are groomed by the power of
Soma -- that is, the hymns recited at the Soma Sacrifice are refined and perfected by the
inspiration given to the poets by Soma -- while those perfected hymns in turn adorn and
beautify the soma offering.

### 08
The expression mádāya ghṛ́ṣvaya in the Saṃhitā text may be deliberately
ambiguous. The Pp. reads dat. ghṛ́ṣvaye, which is supported by IX.16.1 as well as
VIII.64.12, but IX.101.8 has ... mádāya ghṛ́ṣvayaḥ “(cows) avid for exhilaration,” which
would allow a tr. here “we, avid for exhilaration …” Although the publ. tr. follows the Pp.
(as do Ge and Re), I think both readings may be intended.
## 003
As discussed in the publ. intro., this hymn is unified by a simple device, the nom. sg.
m. prn/pronominal adj. eṣá ‘this (one)’ that opens each vs. The first three vss. (and vs. 5)
begin eṣá deváḥ; in a further two vss. (7, 8) the 2nd word divám is, of course, etymologically
related to devá- and a phonological variant (i for e in the initial syllable). Only vss. 4, 6, 9,
and 10 stand aside from this pattern -- and 6 and 9 have deváḥ in their 2nd pādas. The final
vs., 10, opens eṣá u syá “this one here, this very one,” producing an emphatic summary with
the addition of a 2nd prn.
As was also noted in the publ. intro., the maṇḍala’s signature word ‘purify oneself’ is
also omnipresent in this hymn, esp. the nom. sg. pres. part. pávamāna- ‘purifying himself’,
which opens the pāda in vss. 2(c), 3(b), 4(c), 5(b), 7(c), 8(c); pavítre is found (mid-pāda) in
9, and once again vs. 10 marks a change and a summary, by using the finite form pavate
(mid-c). Only vss. 1 and 6 lack a form of √pū. It might be worthy of note (if we understood
how this maṇḍala had been assembled) that this flurry of repetitions is the first appearance
of the part. pávamāna- in this maṇḍala. The over-abundance of forms of √pū may balance
the lack of any overt mention of sóma-.
It can also be noted that the hymn is entirely in the 3rd ps.

### 01
The non-literal tr. “bird on the wing” for parṇavī́- conceals the problematic analysis
of this hapax. Although Re (unconvincingly) suggests that -vī́- is a simple doublet suffix of -
yú-, the most likely (and generally accepted) analysis on formal grounds is as a root noun
cmpd. to √vī ‘pursue’, like deva-vī́- ‘pursuing the gods’ in the preceding hymn (IX.2.1,
itself recalling devā́nāṃ vītí- in IX.1.3). However, on the basis of well-attested deva-vī́- (cf.
also pada-vī́-), we expect the 1st member to express the object of pursuit -- and ‘pursuing
the/its wings/feathers’ makes little sense. The best we can construct is an instr. relationship,
‘pursuing with its wings’; see Scar 499. The situation is further muddied by the fact that the
2nd member bears a distinct resemblance to ví- ‘bird’, which finds textual expression
elsewhere: cf. I.183.1 adduced by Scar, tridhā́tunā patatho vír ná parṇaíḥ “You [=Aśvins]
fly with the tripartite (chariot) like a bird with its feathers.” Scar (499-500) sketches a
complex scenario whereby pada-vī́- ‘pursuing the track’ was reinterp. to an instr. *padā-vī́-
‘pursuing with the foot’, giving rise to our cmpd, with a different body part. But I think it’s
simpler to assume that our poet was pursuing an imperfect pun with ví- ‘bird’, perhaps
encouraged by deva-vī́- in the 1st vs. of the preceding hymn (though we have no know way
to know how these Gāyatrī hymns were ordered or by whom) and the extreme frequency of
that lexeme in the IXth Maṇḍala.

### 02
The expression vipā́kṛtáḥ ‘created by poetic inspiration’ may seem a bit extreme --
after all soma/Soma exists and previously existed independently of the poets. But the usual
RVic power attributed to the word is in play here: poetry brings to realization the gods and
divine forces on the ritual ground.
The s-stem hváras- belongs to the root √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, swerve’; in a soma
context it refers to the curls and tufts of the wool on the sheepskin that serves as the soma
filter, trapping the impurities in the just pressed juice. This physical reading seems
preferable to the “obstacle” interpr. of Ge, Re, etc. In this regard, I would point out that the
smooth, fluffy, brushed sheepskins available commercially are misleading: sheep on the
hoof, particularly the shaggy mountain breeds presumably familiar to the Vedic people,
have much more rugged and irregular wool.

### 03
Because of their position in the vs., the instr. vipanyúbhiḥ … ṛtāyúbhiḥ appear to be
construed with pávamānaḥ, which is nestled between them. However, with Ge and Re I take
them with pass. mṛjyate ‘is groomed’ at the end of pāda c. The medial them. pres. pávate is
always reflexive (‘purifies oneself’), not passive; when a pass. sense is required, the middle
of the IXth Cl. present is used, esp. the part. punāná-. Or, to put it another way, the pávate
stem, esp. part. pávamāna-, is syntactically inert; as Re says (ad vs. 2), “Le mot pávamāna
semble partout étranger à la syntaxe du v. et se distingue à cet égard de punāná, pūyámāna,
pūtá; les exceptions sont de pure apparence.”

### 04
As often, the simile particle iva is “late,” following the first two words: śū́ro yánn
iva sátvabhiḥ.
### 07-08
These two vss. are paired; their first two pādas are almost identical:
7ab eṣá dívaṃ ví dhāvati, tiró rájāṃsi dhā́rayā
8ab eṣá dívaṃ vy ā́sarat, tiró rájāṃsi áspṛtaḥ
I think this close match actually conceals an important difference in intent. Vs. 7 describes
the ritual journey of the just pressed soma in the standard grandiose cosmic style -- the
journey from filter to cup configured as a journey through the vast realms of heaven and the
midspace. The verb dhāvati is pres. indicative. The vs. picks up from vs. 6, which describes
the mixing of the pressed juice with water.
But vs. 8 has an augmented aorist ā́sarat (ā́asarat, so Pp; it could technically be an
injunc. ā́sarat). I do not think this simply indicates the endpoint of the journey depicted in
7. Instead it alludes to the origin myth of soma, the bold stealing of Soma from heaven
treated esp. in IV.26-27. The clue is the adj. áspṛta-. Although this stem is glossed as
‘invincible’ by Gr, reflected also in Re’s tr., √spṛ means rather ‘gain, win’ and even
‘recover, regain’. The other occurrence of this privative past part. is found in an Indra hymn
in VIII, in a pāda almost identical to our b (acc. áspṛtam, not nom. as here). There it also
concerns Soma’s journey, but in that passage it is clear that the Somaraub is referred to:
VIII.82.9 yáṃ te śyenáḥ padā́bharat tiró rájāṃsi áspṛtam “That which the falcon brought to
you [=Indra] with his foot across the airy realms -- the one that could not be recaptured …”
The adj. áspṛta- ‘not to be recaptured’ economically encapsulates Kṛśānu’s vain fight
against the robber śyená to keep the bird from making off with the Soma confined in
heaven. In our passage here the poet is identifying the (humdrum) ritual journey of soma the
juice in vs. 7 with the first journey of Soma from heaven in the foundational myth of the
Soma Sacrifice, making the two journeys seem as identical as possible by nearly verbatim
repetition and thus investing the ritual progress with the glamour and significance of myth.
Thus, although the nearly identical vss. 7 and 8 might seem evidence that the poet was
spinning his wheels, in fact the repetition is doing something quite different.

### 09
The mythic resonance in vs. 8 is echoed in pratnéna jánmanā “in the way of his
ancient birth.”

### 10  
An elementary passive / active figure: jajñānó janáyan “giving birth while he is
being born,” somewhat reminiscent of the reciprocal figure in IX.2.7.
## 004
On the formal constraints in this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
The double ca construction especially emphasizes the imperatival function of the -si
form jéṣi, conjoined as it is with a standard impv. sánā.

### 04
This vs. stands apart from the rest of the hymn, which is otherwise addressed in the
2nd ps. to Soma. Here we have a ref. to the (human) ritual participants (pávītāraḥ ‘purifiers’),
and though soma appears in the vs., it is as the substance not the god, and in the 3rd ps.
On pávītāraḥ see comm. ad IX.83.2. Note in passing that this is a voc. with retracted
accent; the form given by Gr for this passage, -ā́ras, is incorrect.
### 05-06
These two vss. share not only the refrain pāda (c) found throughout the hymn, but
another one (5b = 6a), as well as a common focus on the sun.

### 09
Loc. vídharman lit. ‘in spreading apart / in expansion’ is underspecified and its
application unclear -- deliberately so, in my opinion. Once again, the ambiguity allows a
blurring of the ritual and the cosmic. In ritual terms the expansion may refer to soma’s
spreading across the filter or, as Ge sees it (n. 9b), in the water with which it is mixed; in
cosmic terms, it would refer to the spreading of Soma across space (see, e.g., Ober [RR
II.152] and VI.71.1 rájaso vídharmaṇi), becoming as extensive as heaven. Re suggests
rather that it refers to Soma’s (transitive) spreading (that is, giving) of goods, but I find this
less likely. For further disc. see comm. ad IX.64.9.
## 005
Āprī
On the interaction of the genre of Āprī hymns with the Soma Pavamāna focus, see
the publ. intro.

### 01
The part. prīṇán may signal the Āprī theme, as Old suggests.

### 06
The placement of the simile marker ná seems to make náktoṣā́sā ‘Night and Dawn’
part of the simile itself, rather than the frame, but, esp. given the rigid structure of Āprī
hymns, where the pair Night and Dawn is one of the key words, this is not possible. We
must just assume that the tendency to put ná after the first word of the phrase has taken over
here.

### 07
My interpr. of this vs., esp. pāda c, differs from the standard. I assume that
pávamānaḥ and índro vṛ́ṣā are two separate entities: Soma Pavamāna and Indra the bull --
and that they are identified with the two divine Hotars (hótārā daívyā) of b. Old, Ge, and Re
all take c as an equational clause: Soma Pavamāna = Indra the bull; there is just one figure,
and it has nothing to do with the two Hotars. In their favor is the fact that pāda c has
reverted to nominative, whereas the duals are acc. in ab. However, I find it difficult to
assume that mentioning the two major divine figures in the Soma Maṇḍala, Soma and Indra,
in conjunction with a dual, is utterly unconnected with the dual divine figures in ab.
Otherwise pāda c is a non sequitur. (On 9c and IX.6.2 see below.) As for the reversion to the
nominative, I find this somewhat troubling, but it is enabled by the fact that in duals nom. =
acc.

### 09
The listing of figures in cd is puzzling. The publ. tr. follows Ge/Re, with Indra
identified as the drop in c and Prajāpati as the self-purifying one in d, but I now very much
doubt that this is correct. For one thing, Prajāpati as a separate god is found at best only in X
(3x); this is the only occurrence of the stem in IX, and in the only other occurrence outside
of X (IV.53.2) it is an epithet of Savitar. This two-pāda sequence (9cd), índur índro vṛ́ṣā
háriḥ, pávamānaḥ prajā́patiḥ is a variant and expansion of 7c pávamāna índro vṛ́ṣā, and as
in 7 I think it refers to two gods, Soma and Indra. As in 7c the two gods are first identified:
here the drop (rather than pávamāna-) and Indra. The next word vṛ́ṣā ‘bull’ appeared to
qualify Indra in 7c, but could (and often does) qualify either one, and here it’s placed
between Indra and hári- ‘tawny’, a soma descriptor, suggesting affiliation to both. The
opening of the next pāda, pávamānaḥ, reasserts the Soma figure. As for prajā́patiḥ, I think
it’s possible that it again refers to both, though I have no idea why this stem appears here.
As in vs. 7c I take these pādas as listing other gods to be summoned along with Tvaṣṭar here
(tváṣṭāram … ā́huve, like 7b hótārā … huve), with slippage into a free-standing nominative
phrase. It anticipates the somewhat random listing of even more gods in 11cd. I don’t find
any of this very satisfactory, but I resist the supposed identification of Indra and Soma, who
are the two poles of the Soma Maṇḍala.
## 006

### 02
Pāda b índav índra íti kṣara “o drop, flow as ‘Indra’” is the strongest piece of
evidence for the identification of Indra and Soma in the previous hymn (IX.5.7, 9) and is so
cited by Ge (n. 7c to IX.5). As noted ad locc., I do not believe that those vss. equate the two
gods; I do, however, believe that there is a (partial) equation here, on the basis of the
mystical phonological near-identity of the two stems ‘drop’ (índu-) and ‘Indra’ (índra-), a
similarity that is frequently exploited in this maṇḍala, as we have already noted. The
identification of the two here also depends on the ambiguity of the goal of kṣara ‘flow’,
namely mádam in pāda a. The stem máda- often refers to the ‘exhilarating drink’, namely
soma itself, as well as to the abstract state of exhilaration. With Soma flowing to mádam, the
former, concrete meaning is more or less excluded: S/soma can’t flow to itself. But the
concrete goal is certainly available to the god Indra; cf. III.42.2 tám indra mádam ā́gahi,
barhiṣṭhā́ṃ grā́vabhiḥ sutám “Come, Indra, to the exhilarating drink, stationed on the ritual
grass, pressed by stones,” where the second pāda makes it clear that the concrete substance,
not the abstract state, is meant. So if “Indra” substitutes for the drop here, mádam as
concrete goal is possible. See also 9b and comm. thereon.

### 04
As noted ad IX.3.3, in contrast to pávamāna- ‘purifying oneself’, I consider other
medial participles to √pū to be passive and have so tr. punāná- here, though there is no
overt sign of passive value and both Ge and Re tr. as reflexive (also in 9a).

### 05
This is a rel. cl. without a main cl., but it is easily attached to vs. 6 (relative /
correlative 5a yám … 6a tám …). So also Re.

### 07
This vs. reestablishes the line of demarcation between Soma and Indra that was
blurred in vs. 2, by means of the reciprocal figure devó devā́ya “the god for the god,” with
the dat. further specified as índrāya.
The stem pīpáya- is ambiguous; it can be both intrans. and trans. (and at least once
mixed: I.63.8; see comm. ad loc.). In this passage Ge takes it as intrans. (“wann seine Milch
quillt”). The ambiguity is in part the result of the partial coincidence of the pf. subjunctive
and the redupl. aor. injunctive (or subj.) (see Kü 301-3), and in this passage we appear to
have the trans. redupl. aor. (Kü 302). Partly on the basis of VIII.1.19, Old takes Indra as the
subj. of trans. pīpáyat. Re also considers the form “probably” transitive, though he does not
specify the subject.
### 08-09
As noted in the publ. intro., the theme of poetry appears in these last two vss., and
I think it likely that Soma’s “protecting poetic skill” and “making the hidden hymns his
own” refer to the inspiration Soma, and the soma sacrifice, provide to the poets. What it
means to “protect” kā́vya (8c) is not entirely clear to me, but the preverb ní with pāti may
suggest protection that involves hiding or depositing the thing in question, thus matching the
hidden hymns in 9c. (pāti may also pun on √pā ‘drink’, of much more common occurrence
in the Soma maṇḍala.) As I suggested in the publ. intro., I think the hymns are “hidden”
deep within the poets and are stimulated and evoked by Soma and the ritual in his honor.
Note also that in the next hymn (IX.7.4a) Soma the poet clothes himself (vásānaḥ) in (pl.)
kā́vyā.

### 09
This vs. picks up various expressions from the hymn: índrayúḥ (pāda a) matches up
with devayúḥ (1b) and asmayúḥ (1c), thus forming a slight ring. In b mádam … vītáye “(for
Indra) to pursue exhilaration / the exhilarating drink” “repairs” the slightly anomalous
mádam … kṣara in 2ab (see comm. there) and also echoes 6b mádāya devávītaye. I might
therefore alter the tr. to “for him to pursue the exhilarating drink.” See also punānáḥ in pāda
a, repeating the same part. in 4c.
## 007
As noted in the publ. intro., the word sóma- does not appear in this hymn. The word
is also absent from IX.3, though there the omnipresence of pávamāna- and other forms of
√pū takes up the slack. In this hymn pávamāna- is found only once, in vs. 5.

### 01
Lü (600-601) sees this vs. as representing the heavenly ascent of Soma, but those
not subscribing to all of Lü’s presuppositions will find it difficult to see that. My own
interpr. is far more earthbound: the filter is both the path of the soma and its foundation. The
referent of asya in c is probably the soma, esp. given the near match of 1c vidānā́asya
yójanam and 8c vidānā́asya śákmabhiḥ: the asya in 8c must be the soma. Even though in
both passages the subject of the sentence is plural and refers to drops bzw. waves of soma,
the sg. asya must be a constructio ad sensum.
On 3rd pl. mid. ending -ram see the extensive disc. by Old.

### 02
In keeping with his interpr. of vs. 1, Lü (238) sees the “great waters” (mahī́r apáḥ)
here as the celestial waters -- again not necessary, since the ritual soma is mixed with water
after it traverses the filter.
mádhvaḥ could in principle be construed either with dhā́rā (“stream of honey”) or
agriyáḥ, as in the publ. tr. Though both Ge and Re opt for the former, mádhvo agriyám in
VII.92.2 suggests the latter, as does the parallel expression vācó agriyáḥ in the next vs. (3a;
also IX.62.25). So Lü (238). Both Ge and Lü take dhā́rā as instr. sg. (Ge: “Mit dem Strome
…”). (Old hesitates but slightly favors instr.) This is certainly possible, though not
necessary: nom. dhā́rā and nom. agriyáḥ can have different genders because they belong to
two different NPs in apposition to each other. In any case, none of these minor differences
in interpr. have any real implications.
### 02-03
A verb of motion needs to be supplied with prá in the initial pādas of both vss.

### 03
The phrase satyó adhvaráḥ, which I take as a separate nominal cl., but which can
simply be another appositional nominative as most take it, must identify soma as, as it were,
the embodiment of the ritual, the substance that must be present for the adhvaráḥ to occur.

### 04
In principle, kā́vyā (and/or indeed nṛmṇā́) could be instr. sg. “… by his poetic skill
…”), though the standard renderings (incl. Lü 265) take it as acc. pl. . There is no real way
to tell, but in the similarly structured IX.94.3 pári yát kavíḥ kā́vyā bhárate (cf. our pári yát
kā́vyā kavíḥ) kā́vyā should be acc. pl. because it is the frame that matches a clear acc. pl.
simile in the next pāda. This is suggestive but hardly decisive.
On pāda c svàr vājī́siṣāsati “The race horse strives to win the sun,” see comm. ad
IX.74.1, 76.2. In these passages I think that the sun, with its gleaming light, represents the
milk towards which the soma is aiming.

### 06
On rebhá- see comm. ad VI.3.6.

### 07
Gr takes ráṇā as impv. to √ran (them. pres. ráṇati), on the basis of the Pp. reading
ráṇa, but it is better to interpr. it as instr. sg. to the root noun rán-, against the Pp. So
already Old ZDMG 63 [1909]: 289 = KlSch 305; see also Ge (n. 7c), Schindler (Rt. Nouns,
s.v. rán-). With Ge I take it as the referent of the rel. prn. yáḥ that immediately follows,
forming a nominal cl. (“with the joy that is …”). The drawback to this is that the new cl.
would not coincide with a metrical break -- but nominal, izafe-like clauses are not
infrequently so positioned. Re also takes ráṇā as an instr. sg., but because he expects such a
root noun to have fem. gender (see Schindler, who simply says that the gender of this noun
can’t be determined), he construes it as part of the rel. cl.: “(ivresse [referring back to
mádena in b]) qui est joyeusement [= ráṇā] (présente) dans ces comportements.” Although
this allows clause and metrical boundary to coincide, it otherwise seems too fussy to me.

### 08
As disc. in the publ. intro. and above ad vs. 1, the c pāda of this vs. forms a ring with
that of vs. 1; the final vs., 9, is addressed to the two world-halves and seems extra-hymnic.
As in vs. 1 the asya of c must refer to soma, although the subj. of the sentence is plural.
Medial forms of √pū when construed with ā́mean ‘attract / bring here through
purification’ and take the acc.; similar is ā́√yaj ‘win / attact by sacrifice’. ā́√pū is
extremely common in IX.
## 008

### 01
Pāda c, várdhanto asya vīryàm, is structured like 1c and 8c in the immediately
preceding hymn, IX.7, though here asya must refer to Indra, not Soma.

### 02
As noted in the publ. intro., the gods Vāyu and the Aśvins, along with Indra, who
was mentioned in the previous vs., are also the gods mentioned as the goal of the soma in
IX.7.7.

### 04
Why do the thoughts number seven (saptá dhītáyaḥ)? Ge (n. 4ab) links them with
the seven dhā́tars in nearby IX.10.3, while Re adds the seven dhā́man of IX.102.2. These
suggestions are reasonably plausible, though they simply displace the numerical problem.
We should also note that the seven thoughts recur in the next hymn (IX.9.4), and another,
unidentified, group of seven entities is found two vss. later (IX.9.6). IX.8-10 are attributed
to the same poet, Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa (responsible indeed for IX.5-24), and
he may simply have a penchant for the number seven; in our passage it would be a
complement to the ten fingers (a number that of course makes sense). For saptá dhītáyaḥ
and ten fingers in a hemistich almost identical to this one, see IX.15.8; for further
occurrences of “seven inspired thoughts” see IX.62.17 and possibly IX.66.8.

### 07
The “comrade” (sákhi-) whom the soma is urged to enter is most likely Indra. The
juxtaposition of the voc. índo with sákhāyam might be meant to evoke the phonological twin
índram.
## 009
On the structure and often puzzling content of this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
Some of the uncertainties in this vs. are illuminated by parallel passages, esp.

### 02
in the adjacent hymn. Note that Soma is identified as a poet both in pāda a, where he
is in fact “the poet of heaven” (diváḥ kavíḥ), and in c in the bahuvrīhi kaví-kratu- ‘having a
poet’s purpose’. See also below ad 6c.
The expression pári … váyāṃsi … yāti (split over 3 pādas) is reminiscent of

### 01
víśvā yád rūpā́pariyā́ti “when he makes the circuit of all his forms …,” as Ge
points out (n. 1b). The journey around the filter must be meant.
The two ‘granddaughters [/nieces]’ (loc. du. naptyòḥ) are, in the ritual context, most
likely either the two pressing boards (Sāy, Ge) or the two hands of the priest (Re). Because
of the similarity between this vs. and 10.2, I favor the latter because of the gábhastyoḥ ‘in
the two hands’ of 10.2b. In a cosmic context, the dual could refer to Heaven and Earth, who
are identified as Soma’s two mothers (by most interpr.) in 3. The kinship flip -- Soma and
his two granddaughters [/nieces] here, Soma and his two mothers in 3 -- would not doom
this identification, given the RVic poets’ love of paradox, esp. the paradox of generations.
The ppl. hitáḥ with which naptyòḥ is construed is ambiguous, between √hi ‘impel’
and √dhā ‘place’. Though both Ge and Re favor the latter, I opt for the former on the basis
of hitáḥ in 4a and hinvānā́saḥ in the parallel vs. 10.2a, both clearly belonging to ‘impel’.
Either is possible, however; ‘placed’ would weakly favor the ‘pressing boards’ interpr. of
naptyòḥ.

### 02
The parallel but oddly assorted dative phrases kṣáyāya pányase “to/for the
praiseworthy dwelling place’ and jánāya … adrúhe “to/for the race without deceit” I take as
a possible elaboration on the disjunctive pair “men and gods.” Although Re wants the latter
to refer to “l’être-humain,” he himself points out that adrúh- is generally an epithet of the
gods (though see adrúhaḥ with ‘rivers’ in 4b). By contrast to “the race without deceit [=
gods],” kṣáya- may refer to the ritual ground as the ‘dwelling place’ and by extension to the
humans who create and inhabit it.

### 03
The referent of the fem. du. here is generally taken as Heaven and Earth.
### 04-06
As noted in the publ. intro., I consider this an omphalos hymn, with vss. 4 and 6
with their repetition of “7” defining vs. 5 as the omphalos. The omphalos effect is muted
however, since the “message” of vs. 5 is hardly a deep mystery. For further on this sequence
of vss., see publ. intro.

### 04
On the “seven insightful thoughts” see also 8.4.
The subj. of vāvṛdhúḥ in c must be feminine, on the basis of yā́(ḥ), but the choice
between the “insightful thoughts” (dhītí-) of a and the rivers (nadī́-) of b is not clear.

### 05
This vs. presents the same problem as 4c: because of init. tā́ḥ, nom. pl. fem., the
subject of ā́dadhuḥ has to be feminine, and there are several pl. feminines in play: the
“insightful thoughts” (dhītí-) of 4a and the rivers (nadī́-) of 4b. But which one (or both)? In
any case, presumably the subjects of 4c and 5 are the same -- though Sāy opts for “fingers”
in this vs. but “rivers” in 4c.
The unspecified dat. (or with Re loc.) mahé ‘for/in great …” has too many
possibilities for its referent, and I have made no effort to choose one.

### 06
The problem of the fem. referent continues here. In ab Soma, as the draught-horse
(váhniḥ) “sees the seven” (saptá paśyati); we have just had “seven thoughts” (4a), and
“seven” is the canonical number of rivers, which we also encountered in vs. 4 -- so either
referent (or a conflation of both) is possible here. A fem. acc. pl. devī́ḥ ‘goddesses’ is the
obj. of the verb ‘satisfied’ (atarpayat) in the next pāda c. Unfortunately this does not clarify
the reference: the pl. of devī́- is frequently used of waters and at least once elsewhere
(VII.50.4) of rivers, but at least in the singular it is quite commonly used of dhī́- and similar
words.
On the hapax vā́vahi- see AiG II.2.292-93.
On the always ghastly krívi- see comm. ad I.30.1 and V.44.4. Esp. in the latter
passage I argue that the word often seems to be used of an equine and that it might be a
deformation or hyper-Sanskritization of kaví-. Both factors are present here: the first two
pādas of this vs. depict Soma as a draught horse drawing (váhniḥ … vā́vahiḥ), but we also
had occasion to note ad vs. 1 above that Soma was twice identified as a kaví- there. In the
publ. tr. I default to a PN, but I do in fact think that the word has richer semantics, derived
from both just mentioned uses, here. I do not see any way to convey that in a single tr. of the
word, however.

### 07
The voc. pumas ‘o male’ is rather stark. It is in fact the only occurrence of the voc.
of this stem in the RV and the only place where the stem is used of Soma. I ascribe its use
here to the contrast being drawn with the feminines in vss. 4-6 (as well, perhaps, as the two
mothers in 3) and to the martial content of the vs.
As I argued already in my dissertation and the -áya-monograph based upon it, I
consider the supposed root √kḷp to have been extracted from the -áya-transitive kalpáyati,
itself (in my view) a -p-formation to √kṛ with “popular” l. The early rarity of the thematic
noun kálpa-, very common later but found in the RV only here and in the privative form
akalpá- (I.102.6), supports this view. In the publ. tr. I followed the standard interpr. of
kálpa- in this passage as ‘ritual work’ (Ge “bei den heiligen Bräuchen,” Re “les rite”), based
in part on its later usage. I still think this is a possible reading. However, on the basis of my
interpr. of akalpá- in I.102.6 (see comm. ad loc.) and the rest of the vs. here, I wonder now
if they are not rather (or in addition) martial arrangements: the address to Soma as ‘male’
(pāda a), the statement that darkness must be fought (yódhyā)(b), and the intensive
subjunctive of √han, jaṅghanaḥ (c) all favor a more bellicose interpr.

### 08
The duplication of comparatives with slightly different shapes, introduced by the
particle nū́, produces a nice phonetic figure, nū́návyase návīyase.

### 09
As was noted in the publ. intro., ‘sun’ (svàḥ) is the last word of the hymn, resonating
with the themes of shining and brightness earlier in the hymn (see esp. 3ab and 8c, as well
as the darkness to be combatted in 7b).
## 010
For the poetic structure of the hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
svānā́saḥ can be both the nom. pl. masc. of the adj. svāná- ‘resounding’ (√svan)
and the med. rt. aor. part. to √su ‘press’, in passive usage as is usual for this part. I consider
the ambiguity intentional and render it twice (“while being pressed … resounding”), but
although both Ge (n. 1a) and Re (with more fuss) recognize the double identity, they render
only the ‘resound’ sense that is appropriate to the simile.

### 02
With Ge I take c as an independent nominal cl. Re takes c as a continuation of ab,
but as Ge points out (n. 2c) c is the Fortsetzung of the image in ab: in ab the chariots are
presumably competing for prizes; the prizes or “takings” (bhára-) in c are what these
chariots win. For the phrase in c see IX.16.5 mahé bhárāya kāríṇaḥ “for the great taking of
the decisive victor.”

### 03
The first hemistich contains a simile embedded, as it were, in a metaphor: kings are
only metaphorically “anointed” (that is, decorated, adorned) with praises; the soma juices
are somewhat less metaphorically “anointed,” since “the cows” are actually milk, which is
liquid enough to anoint.
In c the poet seems silently to switch instrumental functions, while holding the
structure constant: NOM. INSTR. añjate. In both a and b the INSTR. expresses the instrument of
anointment, either metaphorical or real, but in c the INSTR. expresses the agents who
perform the anointing. The “seven ordainers” (saptá dhātár-) are presumably the priests; the
priests reappear as Hotars in vs. 7 with “seven siblings,” probably their insightful thoughts
or else simply seven other priests. See below.
The relationship between kings and the genre of práśasti-, which I discuss in my RV
between Two Worlds (pp. 146-48), is very clear here.

### 04
The pun on svānā́saḥ in 1a recurs here; this time Ge and Re render it only as
‘pressed’.

### 05
On my view of the sense of this vs., see publ. intro. With Ge, I supply bhágam with
the gen. vivásvataḥ in a, as well as with gen. uṣásaḥ in b; unlike Ge I take bhága- to mean
‘portion’ (not “das Glück”) and interpr. it as referring to the radiance of the two divinities,
by which Soma transforms himself into the sun (or rather a set of suns -- the radiating
golden color on the sheep’s fleece filter). Re’s interpr. is quite different: he supplies “la
région” with vivásvataḥ, and takes uṣásaḥ as an acc. pl., parallel to bhágam and both as
names of divinities (“engendrant les Aurores (et) Bhaga”). For the former he must be
thinking of the common expression sádane vivásvataḥ “in the seat of V,” but that expression
is only in the loc. and never found in IX. As for the latter, even with his explanatory n. I
don’t how this improves the sense of the vs.

### 06
“The raging of the bull” must refer to the headlong journey of the soma as it is
being purified, which is set in motion and accompanied by the recitation of ritual poetry --
hence the violent opening of “the doors of poetic thoughts” (dvā́rā matīnā́m). The continuity
of the poetic tradition from the pratnā́ḥ (‘ancient’) bards to the current ones is suggested by
the use of the pres. ṛṇvanti. I do not think, with Ge (n. 6ab), that pratná- gives the present
tense verb a preterital sense, and indeed in IX.73.3 pítā … pratnó abhí rakṣati Ge tr. the
pres. rakṣati with the pres. “wacht,” not a preterite.

### 07
Ge and Re take the seven siblings here as the seven dhītí- of 8.4 and 9.4, which is
quite likely -- though the priests themselves are also a possibility. Ge adduces IX.66.8 sám u
tvā dhībhír asvaran … saptá jāmáyaḥ “Together the seven siblings cried out to you with
insightful thoughts,” which has both the 7 siblings and the thoughts -- but the referent of the
siblings in that vs. is not clear. Ge there takes it as the fingers, which seems somewhat
perverse, given that seven is not a canonical number for fingers -- and fingers don’t cry out.
I prefer rivers, since the “seven streams” were mentioned in the previous vs.

### 08
ā́dade belongs to √dā ‘bind’, not ‘give’; see, e.g., Kü 242. On the idiom see
comm. ad I.139.1, IX.79.4.
Ge, Re, and Kü all take b as a simile (“wie das Auge an die Sonne”), presumably
with cid as the simile particle. But, as I have stated elsewhere (see, e.g., comm. ad I.173.7), I
am not at all convinced that cid is ever so used. Here, the point is the real identification of
Soma, or his eye, with the sun, not a comparison to Soma’s kinship with me; see ékam ákṣi
in 9.4, the transformation of Soma into sun(s) in our vs. 5c, and esp. the transformation of
the sun’s eye into Soma’s eye in the next vs. (9c).
Gr identifies duhe in c as a 1st ps.; Ge and Re take it as 3rd sg. passive with ápatyam
as subj. (e.g., “Die Nachkommenschaft des Sehers wird herausgemolken”), interpr. kaví- as
a reference to Soma and ápatyam as the soma juice. But medial forms of √duh are generally
transitive, with the sense ‘give X as milk’, and I follow that interpr. here, with Soma the
unexpressed subject/agent. I suggest that c explains a: “binding his navel to our navel”
means that he makes himself our kin and indeed takes responsibility for providing us with
offspring. I take kavéḥ as referring to the (human) poet. Soma repays our devotion and care
(see esp. vs. 7) with the usual ritual rewards, including sons.

### 09
Ge takes priyā́as nom. sg. fem., with gapped “Daughter of the Sun” -- but it seems
unlikely that a new character would be introduced at this point, and it makes more sense for
Soma to be the one doing the looking. Better to interpr. priyā́as a neut. pl. with gapped
padā́(ni), as in nearby IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás padā́. Ge (n. 9a) also allows the possibility
of a neut. pl., but wants to construe it with sg. pádam, which he takes as a “collective
singular,” a concept that I think we can do without but that seems to be encouraged by Old’s
remarks. (See comm. ad VI.17.1 for another such ex. proposed by Ge.) I think rather that
there are two (sets of) padá- (sim. Re).
Ge also suggests that in this instance of INSTR. gúhā hitám, the phrase means “hidden
from,” not “hidden by.” Without a better sense of what this vs. is intended to tell us, I prefer
not to contravene the usual agentive value of the instr. For my own speculation on the
hidden track, see publ. intro., which may be supported by IX.102.2, where the hidden track
that soma follows seems to be in the filter.
## 011

### 01
asmai is only the second word in the hymn and is unaccented; therefore it should
technically refer to something already mentioned in the discourse. But since soma is the
topic of all discourse in this ritual context, no prior verbal mention is necessary. Sim.
IX.70.1; see also asya in IX.29.1a, IX.30.1a.

### 02
Pāda c consists entirely of a rudimentary etymological figure, deváṃ devā́ya
devayú. The acc. devám is of course Soma as god, coreferential with páyaḥ ‘milk’, a
metaphor for soma the substance, in pāda a; the dative devā́ya is Indra. I take devayú as an
adverb; so also Re. It is also possible (see, e.g., Re’s n.) to take it as a neut. modifying
páyaḥ, as Gr does -- and, it seems, Ge. In that case, devám would need to be a neut. adj.
‘divine’ (Ge’s “die göttliche”), but the number of clearly adjectival uses of devá- is very
low. See, however, IX.13.5 and VII.21.1.

### 04
DAT gāthám arcata can be seen as a paraphrase of úpa DAT gāyatā in 1a, with
etymological matching.
The epithet divispṛ́ś- ‘touching heaven’ is almost the only departure in this hymn
from the tight, earthbound focus on the ritual.

### 06
Pāda c índum índre paraphrases deváṃ devā́ya in 2c, though with a loc., not dat.

### 07
Pāda b is almost identical with 3a.

### 09
The índo- índra- figure appears yet again, in different cases (voc., instr.).
## 012
Lü tr. and comm. on vss. 1-6 of this hymn (706-7), with his usual, often overblown,
emphasis on the heavenly location of the elements and actions. By contrast, I tend to
attribute the heavenly references to the poet’s attempt to project a cosmic dimension on the
ritual confined to a small portion of the earth’s surface.

### 03
On madacyút- and vipaścít- see, e.g., Scar (128 and 122 respectively).
gaurī́is the loc. sg. to the vṛkī́-stem gaurī́-, not a dual (per Gr); see AiG III.170 and
comm. ad VII.103.2 (sarasī́) and I.135.9 (nadī́). As indicated in the publ. intro., of the
possible referents for this buffalo cow, with Ge and Re (see esp. Re’s n.) I favor the hide on
which the pressing apparatus is placed -- as opposed to Sāy’s ‘speech’, or Lü’s more
complex speech identified with the heavenly waters.

### 05
This vs. seems to posit a distinction between two somas: one, called sóma-, that is
in containers and on the filter and another, called índu- ‘drop’, that embraces / surrounds
(pári ṣasvaje) the first. What distinguishes them is difficult to discern; Ge suggests that the
“nachrinnende” Soma is taken in by the pressed juice, but this doesn’t seem to make ritual
sense, since the soma in the tubs and on the filter would already have been pressed as well.
Lü, predictably, thinks the heavenly soma incorporates the earthly soma. Say identifies
índu- as the god Soma (somo devaḥ). Of the various possibilities, Sāy’s seems the most
plausible -- that is, Soma the god encompasses all the forms that soma the substance takes in
the course of ritual processing, though physically that substance is somewhat different at
every stage. I also considered the possibility -- given the occasional identification and
frequent juxtaposition of índu- and índra- -- that índu- here refers to Indra, and “embrace” is
a metaphor for “drink, consume.” But I’d prefer to keep índu- separate from Indra.

### 06
The índu- here “sends forth his speech” (prá vā́cam … iṣyati), which supports an
animate reading of índu- in the previous vs. Needless to say, Lü has a heavenly interpr.:
índu is the heavenly soma, the sea is the heavenly sea, and the kóśa- is the “Urquell im
Himmel.” In the publ. intro. I interpr. the sea as the soma in the vessel or the mixing water.
And the speech is presumably the speech of the ritual participants, prompted by the action of
pressing the soma.

### 07
This vs. has no finite verb; I take it as a preamble to 8, in order to capture the play
between the two forms of hinvānáḥ (7c, 8b).
When vánaspáti- (lit. ‘lord of the forest’) does not mean simply ‘tree’, it generally
refers to the sacrificial post in the animal sacrifice, particularly when found in the Āprī
hymns. The word is not found elsewhere in IX, except in the Āprī hymn IX.5.10, where it
seems to have that reference. But here it must refer to soma. Since essentially all the plants
that have been suggested as the source of soma are fairly insignificant physically, the use of
vánaspáti- to refer to it must have seemed slightly comic (like calling a dandelion Lord of
the Forest), but also a way of capturing the towering importance of the apparently lowly
plant. The word is used of soma once elsewhere, I.91.6 (a soma hymn), in the phrase
priyástotro vánaspátiḥ, almost identical to nítyastotro vánaspátiḥ, esp. because nítya- ‘own’
and priyá- ‘dear, own’ are near synonyms in some usages. The point, I think, is that Soma
has first claim to praise.
On sabar- as ‘juice’, see EWA s.v. sabardúh- and Narten (YH 212). I construe the
gen. pl. dhīnā́m with the first member of the cmpd. sabar-dúgha-: “… juice of insights.” I
supply pavítre with antár on the basis of 5b antáḥ pavítre (cf. VIII.101.9). Ge’s “unter
Liedern” does not work because antár doesn’t take the gen., and though Re’s “Arbres des
intuitions” sounds imposing, it doesn’t make much sense. Old’s first interpr. of this pāda is
close to mine, with dhīnā́m dependent on sabar-, though he takes antár as an adverb.
However, he considers the obvious solution to be to take dhīnā́m with antár, since the gen.
is possible with antár in the later language. Since “within/amid the thoughts” isn’t a
particularly compelling addition to the passage, I prefer my own (and Old’s first) solution.
The common med. part. hinvāná- can be both transitive and passive, in approx. equal
numbers. In this vs. it is transitive, but in the next passive.

### 08
As noted just above, hinvāná- is used passively here, in contrast to the same form
in 7c -- here referring to the priestly impulsion given to the soma on its journey of
purification.
The “tracks of heaven” are, in my view, the traces of the soma on the filter; see 10.9.
Pāda c is identical to IX.44.2c, where I do not construe víprasya with dhā́rayā but
with something earlier in the vs. My reason there is that the dhā́rā- ‘stream’ is always
otherwise only Soma’s, and so should not belong to the/a vípra-. But in our passage there is
nowhere to construe víprasya but with dhā́rayā. I consider ad IX.44.2 the possibility that the
pāda was borrowed thoughtlessly here. But there are several ways to make sense of our
passage. If the dhā́rā- is Soma’s, the point may be that he is a kaví-, a sage, but he also has
the fluency of an inspired poet, who simply pours out verbal eloquence, thus identifying
Soma with both types of poet. This suggestion is supported by the next hymn, IX.13.2,
where Soma is explicitly identified as a vípra-, as well as his parallel identification as vípra
and kaví in IX.18.2. Or dhā́rā- can be used here metaphorically to refer to a stream of
words.

### 09
The impv. dhāraya is almost identical to the instr. dhā́rayā in 8c, though their
morphology is entirely different.
## 013
This hymn is dominated by forms of med. pávate (vss. 2-4, 8-9), with the first vs.
containing instead med. punānáḥ. Only vss. 6-7 lack such forms. Perhaps coincidentally,
these two vss. are the only ones containing similes.
The hymn is also constructed from bricolage and ready-made phrases, many found
verbatim in other hymns. There is a certain amount of chaining between vss.; it is difficult to
know if this is just a result of the assembly process (a word in one vs. suggests to the poet
another such phrase, which he then attaches) or was meant as a unifying poetic device.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., the mention of Vāyu and Indra identifies the occasion
as the Morning Pressing, since those two gods receive the first soma offering of the pressing
day.

### 02
The publ. tr. does not make this clear, but the addressees are pl., presumably the
priests.
The identification of Soma as a vípra- supports the suggestion ad IX.12.8 in the
preceding hymn that vípra- refers to Soma there as well.

### 03
Pāda c, with a medial part. characterizing the soma (gṛṇānā́ḥ), followed by the
infinitival dat. devávītaye, matches 2c suṣvāṇáṃ devávītaye. The pattern is reinforced by the
infinitival dat. vā́jasātaye ending pāda a.

### 04
The chaining continues, with vā́jasātaye likewise ending pāda a of this vs.; see also
6b.
√pū + ACC (here pávasva … íṣaḥ [etc.]) should rightly have the preverb ā́in the
idiom ‘bring through purification’; see esp. Re’s n. In tr. I have supplied it, partly on the
assumption that since this hymn is constructed of ready-made phrases, this pāda may have
been adapted from a context where the previous pāda contained the ā́in tmesis. Re also
points out that the construction here can be under the influence of pávantām ā́in 5b. I do not
follow Re in seeing √pū without preverb as becoming indiscrinimately transitive in IX, with
the sense ‘couler’.

### 05
It is difficult not to take devá- here as adjectival, modifying índavaḥ. See my
reluctance to so interpr. this stem in IX.11.2, and see comm. ad VII.21.1.

### 06
The inf. vā́jasātaye is found here a 3rd time (after 3a, 4a).
### 08-09
The impv. ápa … jahi of 8c is converted into the part. apaghnántaḥ in 9a. The
sg. subj. of 8 is also replaced by a pl., but sg. sómaḥ / indo and pl. sómāḥ / índavaḥ alternate
throughout the hymn.
## 014

### 01
The ‘decisive act’ (kārá-) in question is presumably the purification itself. See Re’s
n. on the need to preserve this sense here, rather than giving in to Ge’s convenient
“Kampfpreis” (presumably vā́ja-), which Re pronounces “un peu loin.”

### 02
As noted in the publ. intro., the subjects here are the fingers, troops of five (on each
hand).
The subord. yádī is best taken as an example of my yád ī -- hence “when him/it …,”
not “if.”

### 03
I am disturbed by the sequence of tense -- or lack of it: the augmented aor.
amatsata in the main, ā́d, clause does not fit well with the pres. pariṣkṛṇvánti in the
preceding yád clause (vs. 2) or the pres. vasāyáte in the following (3c). I am tempted to
make the ā́d clause the follow-up to vs. 1: “the poet flowed around and forth …; after that
the gods found exhilaration.” In that case, 3ab would interrupt the sequence of the
subordinated present clauses in vs. 2, 3c, but I don’t know of other examples of this kind of
alternating structure. Perhaps vss. 2 and 3 should be reversed: the ā́d clause of 3ab would
then follow directly after vs. 1, and the parallel subordinate clauses in 3c and vs. 2 would be
picked up by the main clause of 4ab, which also has a pres. tense verb.

### 05
As disc. in the publ. intro., in this hymn the poet provides several different
metaphorical versions of the same ritual act. This vs. contains two of those alternatives: in
ab Soma is groomed “by the granddaughters of Viviasvant,” a reference to the fingers,
which were characterized as “troops of five kinsment” in 2ab; in c Soma makes cows like a
garment (gā́ḥ kṛṇvānó ná nirṇíjam), a variant of 3c “clothes himself with cows” (góbhir
vasāyáte). For the exact phrase see IX.107.26 and for variants without the simile particle
IX.86.26, 95.1.

### 06
śrití- is a hapax, on which see Old. It is here an instr. sg. fem., referring to the fine
fleece filter, and echoing śritáḥ in 1b.
With Old and Ge I take gavyā́as instr. to gavyā́- ‘longing for cows’, rather than neut.
pl. with Gr and Lub. Re sits on the fence.
Although vidé is ordinarily passive, there are a few precedents for ‘know (as) one’s
own’; see VII.40.5, VIII.62.9.

### 07
Here the fingers (kṣípaḥ) are named directly, after the metaphors of 2ab and 5a; the
verb √mṛj ‘groom’ recurs from 5b.
## 015
On the structuring principle of the hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
Pāda c, gáchann índrasya niṣkṛtám, echoes IX.13.1c vāyór índrasya niṣkṛtám. It is
not clear to me whether a different ritual occasion is meant, or it’s simply a variant.

### 02
The phrase dhiyā́yāty (with non-vocalic -y in yāty) “drives with insight” in 1a is
echoed by the verb dhiyāyate “exercises his insight” in 2a, though in different metrical
positions. dhiyāyate also participates in another phonetic figure, with the final word of b:
(dhi)yāyate / (devá)tātaye, with the same vowel pattern, but crossed consonants (y y t / t t y).
Denom. dhiyāyáte is of odd formation, presumably built to the instr., which makes it seem
context-generated (from dhiyā́in 1a), but there is unfortunately another form to the stem
(dat. part. I.155.1 dhiyāyaté), as well as a related -yú-adjective, dhiyāyú- (I.8.6). Still I think
generation in this context is likely.
Pāda c contains another mirror-image phonetic figure: (amṛ́)tāsa āsat(e).

### 03
The ppl. hitá- is potentially a pun, both ‘propelled’ (√hi) and ‘placed’ (√dhā),
though in this case the former is dominant, given the journey theme of the rest of the vs.
(and hymn).
In c yádī is best read yád ī; see also IX.14.2.

### 05
The aṃśú- here is in the first instance the shoots of the soma plant, the usual sense
of this stem, but I think a possible secondary sense is the tufts of wool on the fleece filter,
which can resemble shoots of vegetation. In the former case the instr. expresses
accompaniment, in the latter instr. of path-along-which. See the instr. in 1a (áṇvyā), 2b
(pathā́), and 6b (páruṣā), which all refer to the fleece along which soma journeys.

### 06
In contrast to the relative simplicity of the rest of this hymn, this vs. presents a
number of lexical puzzles / unusual usages.
On pibdaná- see comm. ad VI.46.6. As indicated there, I take the underlying verb as
‘go step-by-step, plod, trudge’. In our passage I think pibdanā́vásūni, lit. “plodding goods,”
is a jocular way to refer to cattle -- the “cows” [=milk] that Soma is rushing towards. Others
(Ge, Re) simply see these as the material goods Soma is on his way to gain.
A párus- is a link(age), joint, or juncture; see EWA s.v. párvan- with considerable
lit. as well as comm. ad IV.22.2. In this instance I think it’s abstract ‘articulation’ and refers
to the 3-D patterns on the fleece filter. As indicated in the comm. to the preceding vs., I take
it as an instr. of the path here. Others (esp. Ge and Re) think it refers to the knots or nodules
of the soma plant that remain in the filter when the juice has flown out, but then both the
singular and the instrumental are hard to explain. Note that in IV.22.2 Indra wraps himself
in the párvāṇi of a river, which I take there as tufts of foam that resemble tufts of wool.
śā́da- is a hapax in the RV, but related words are found elsewhere, if rarely, in
Vedic: YV texts (VS, MS, KS, ŚB, etc; see Bloomfield Conc.) contain a mantra śādaṃ
[śā́dam in accented texts] dadbhiḥ “śād(a) with the teeth,” in a litany listing the disposition
of the parts of the sacrificed horse. There is no strong contextual evidence for its
identification with a plant, much less with grass or fresh grass. However, in later Skt.
śādvala- means ‘grassy’ and matches the fairly widespread MIA word saddala- ‘id.’ (Pāli
etc.), and ‘grass’ is certainly compatible here, since horses crop grass with their teeth. It is
also not possible to tell from the mantra whether the stem is thematic (as in our RVic
passage) or a root noun. The JB contains two occurrences in a single passage of what is
clearly a root noun and which is somewhat more helpful semantically than the YV exx. It is
in a passage that lists several plant substitutes to press in place of soma, of which śād is the
first: JB I.355 śuklāś śādo ‘bhiṣunuyuḥ / somo vai rājā yad imaṃ lokam ājagāma sa śātsv
eva tad uvāsa / sa evāsya saṃnyaṅgaḥ / tam eva tad abhiṣunvanti “They should press
white/bright śād-s. When Soma the king came to this world, he dwelled then in śād-s. That
is his mark. Thus they press him in this way.” On this basis Soma seems to have an affinity
with śā́d(a)-. However, it is not possible to tell whether the JB passage is an independent
witness to this association or was constructed on the basis of the RV passage. In any case, I
have no idea what aspect of the soma ritual śā́da- is meant to refer to. I assume the descent
here should be into some type of soma vessel (see dróṇeṣu in the next vs., 7b). I considered
the possibility that śā́da- is meant to evoke some noun meaning ‘seat’, to √sad, with the
MIA loss of distinction among sibilants enabling such a pun. But there is no appropriate
nominal counterpart belonging to √sad. Another possibility, starting with ‘in / among the
grasses’, is that the image is of a worn-out racehorse put out to pasture. But none of these
possibilities is particularly compelling, and I’m afraid the reference must remain a mystery.

### 08
The insights of b form a bit of a ring with the insight of 1a. Furthermore, ab with
ten fingers and seven dhītí- grooming Soma is almost identical to IX.8.4.
## 016

### 01
On oṇí- see comm. ad VI.20.4, where I am unsatisfied by the current consensus
that it means ‘arm’ (see EWA s.v.) but offer nothing to take its place. Here ‘arm’ works
perfectly well.
Etaśa is the sun’s horse, so he would be traveling through the air. On √tac as
referring generally to birds’ movements, see IX.32.4.

### 02
Ge and Re construe dákṣasya with preceding krátvā, which is certainly possible:
krátu- and dákṣa- are often associated, and Ge adduces several passages containing krátvā
dákṣasya (III.2.3, V.10.2 -- though in both cases JPB plausibly construed dákṣasya with
something else). But since rathī́- ‘charioteer’ is regularly construed with a gen. (incl.
dákṣasya IV.10.2, VI.51.6) and since krátvā appears without gen. in nearby 4c, I take
dákṣasya with rathī́-. Better might be the course suggested (but not followed) by Ge in his n.
2a: “dákṣasya wohl nach beiden Seiten zu verbinden.” This would yield the tr. “with the
resolve of skill we accompany the charioteer of skill …,” which seems a bit heavy.

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., the hapax ánapta- is difficult. Insofar as there is a
standard view, it is taken as ‘unwatered, undiluted’ (Gr ‘nicht wässerig’, Ge ‘nicht
verwässert’; EWA s.v. with lit.), while Re prefers ‘inaccessible’. Although the connection
with ‘water’ makes the most superficial sense, esp. given its juxtaposition with immediately
following apsú ‘in the waters’, it doesn’t make ritual sense, in that the soma is watered
during these steps in the sacrifice, and in this very pāda the soma is depicted as being “in the
waters.” My own desperate suggestion is not appreciably better, that it is formed to naptī́-
‘granddaughter, niece’, used of the fingers that prepare the soma. Two of the six forms of
this word are found in hymns by just this poet (Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa), IX.9.1,
14.5). The word would mean ‘without the granddaughters’ (for the accent, cf. words like
áprajā- ‘without offspring’ and AiG II.1.239-40), that is, without their ritual ministrations.
The point would be (if there is a point) that the soma speeds through the waters and would
do so, even if it had not received these ministrations. I do not, however, set much stock in
this suggestion, esp. since the morphology is dicey to say the least.
The phrase apsú duṣṭára- is found also in nearby IX.20.6, so this must be the
constituency here -- and apsú is not to be construed with ánaptam. As Re points out, Soma
is several time called ap-túr- ‘crossing the waters’ (e.g., IX.63.5, 21), and the expression
here redistributes the elements.

### 04
In the publ. tr. I construe punānásya with pavítre, not with adjacent cétasā, as Ge
and Re do. I would now emend my tr. to the standard: “with the attention of the one being
purified [that is, himself].” Ge comments (n. 4a), “Er weiss von selbst, was er zu tun hat,”
and although I’m not entirely sure that this is what the phrase means, my publ. tr. doesn’t
make much sense either and overlooks the fact that pāda b, which contains the noun, pavítre,
on which I hang the gen. punānásya, is found identically in the next hymn (17.3), as well as
in IX.37.1, both times without a gen.

### 05
The vs. begins prá tvā, reminiscent of the hymn opening prá te (1a), and the
audience would surely assume -- not least because 2nd ps. is generally restricted to Soma in
the IXth Maṇḍala (see Re’s comm. here) -- that tvā refers to Soma. But this expectation is
repaired (or dis-repaired) by the voc. índra that opens pāda b. See vs. 8 below.
I take the referent of gen. kāríṇaḥ in c to be Indra.

### 06
In c the loc. góṣu can be shared by simile and frame: in the frame it refers to the
milk into which the soma has entered, in the simile to the cows that a champion wins in the
raid or battle.

### 08
Soma is addressed here in the 2nd ps., the first time since the uninsistent te in the
first pāda of the hymn (1a prá te …) and thus sketches a sort of referential ring. Throughout
the rest of the hymn soma is always in the 3rd ps., and the only 2nd ps. reference is found in
vs. 5, where the referent is Indra (see comm. there).
Pāda a is troublingly incomplete, with a nom. subj. (tvám) and an acc. vipaścítam but
nothing to govern the acc. The pāda is identical to IX.64.25a, whose b pāda, punānó vā́cam 
iṣyasi, provides both a transitive verb and a referent for the acc., “being purified, you send
forth speech attentive to poetic inspiration.” Although supplying a full pāda is something I
would prefer not to do, I see no alternative to doing so (nor does Ge; see his n. 8a, where he
expresses his reluctance; Bl, RR ad loc., as well). It is made somewhat more plausible by the
appearance in nearby 12.6, by the same poet, of the relevant VP, vā́cam ... iṣyati. (See also
iṣṇán in the next hymn, 17.5, where I supply ‘speech’ as the obj. [contra Ge, but in
agreement with Re].) This is certainly a better solution than Re’s: he simply treats the acc.
as a nom. and uses it as a modifier of Soma (“Toi, ô soma, qui comprends les mots-inspirés
…”).
## 017

### 03
The hapax áty-ūrmi- must be modelled on áty-avi- ‘beyond the sheep(‘s fleece)’,
4x, including twice in the hymns of this poet: IX.6.5 and 13.1. I assume the image is,
roughly, of a wave breaking on the shore, with the liquid now beyond the wave-forms on the
body of water.

### 05
The áti- in cmpd. found in 3a here gives rise to a phrasal expression with cosmic
reach: áti trī́… rocanā́“beyond the three luminous realms.”
I supply ‘speech’ as the obj. of iṣṇán; see comm. ad 16.8.

### 08
Both Ge and Re take ánu kṣara as transitive (“Lass … fliessen,” “Laisse couler
…”), but forms of √kṣar are otherwise intransitive, and here the acc. dhā́rām must be
governed by the preverb ánu.
## 018
On the structure of this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 02
The identification of Soma as both vípra- and kaví- is quite explicit here; see disc.
ad 12.8.
In b Ge takes the prá as standing for the predicate “hat den Vorzug” and construes it
separately from the jātám, presumably because of its separate accent. I am sympathetic, but
still assume that it is loosely construed with jātám. The tr. should perhaps be slightly altered
to “born forth from …” On jātám ándhasaḥ see further ad IX.55.2.
### 03-04
Note the two occurrences of víśva- (3a, 4a), which contrast with the sarva- in the
refrain.
### 04-07
Vss. 4-6 all (save for the refrain pāda) consist of rel. clauses headed by yáḥ and
couched in the 3rd ps.; the main clause appears to be vs. 7, with the resumptive prn. sá and
3rd ps. verb.

### 05
Both Ge and Re take ródasī mahī́as acc. obj. of the frame, with mātárā as subj.
(Re) or obj. (Ge) in the simile: e.g., “qui trait ces Deux grands Mondes ensemble, comme
deux (vaches) mères.” In favor of this view is the fact that in VIII.6.17a, identical to our apāda, the dual is acc. (though in a very different context); furthermore, the position of iva in
b might suggest that the simile consists only of the preceding word mātárā. However, I
prefer to take both duals as part of the simile, parallel nominatives corresponding to the
unexpressed subj. of the frame, Soma. Cows (or their correspondants) are the standard
subjects of med. forms of √duh, with the obj. being the milk (or milk substitute), and
therefore the accusatives of Re and Ge would be semantically and functionally anomalous.
For Heaven and Earth (i.e., the two world-halves represented by ródasī here) as subject of
medial √duh, see VI.70.2 ghṛtáṃ duhāte “the two yield ghee as milk,” in a hymn to Heaven
and Earth, which are the default referent of the many duals in the hymn.

### 07
Because of the rel. cl. / main cl. structure of vss. 4-7 (see above), I would lightly
emend to the tr. to “he/that one, tempestuous in the tubs, kept roaring …,” to display this
structure more clearly.
## 019
On the imagery in the hymn, see publ. intro.

### 02
Note the reverse vāyav indraś ca construction, índraś ca soma.

### 03
With Ge (but not Re), I take the pres. part. sán as concessive, as the nom. forms of
this participle generally are -- although I’m not sure what the concession is. The most likely
possibility is that “sitting down on the womb” is an odd action for a horse. The most
common simile with “sit” is “like a falcon,” e.g., IX.82.1 śyenó ná yónim … ā́sadam, with
the same lexical material as here. Or perhaps horses don’t thunder.

### 04
I am not entirely certain of the force of ádhi: my ‘over’ does not parse very well in
Engl. tr. But the point is probably that the verbal part of the ritual, embodied by the fem.
dhītí- ‘insightful thought/speech’ and therefore conceived of as female, is produced at the
same time as the “semen” of Soma, namely the juice itself. This semen is attributed both to a
bull, Soma as hypervirile adult male animal, and, if we supply rétasi in c for the genitives to
depend on (so also Ge and Re), to a calf, presumably not yet sexually mature, who is further
the son of these mothers (the words, at least by my interpr.). Ge (n. 4) calls the verse “ein
Paradoxon,” though he doesn’t bother to explain what he thinks the paradox is. I assume that
it is the identification of Soma as both bull and calf.
I further assume that the “mothers” (mātáraḥ) of c are co-referential with the
dhītáyaḥ of a, though it might be possible to separate them -- with the mothers being the
milk-mixture or some other ritual substance. Lü (247) considers the mothers distinct from
the dhītáyaḥ and referring to the heavenly streams, but this is a predictable result of his idée
fixe.

### 05
As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. metaphorically expresses the complex
interaction between poetry, the thoughts (dhī́- 2c, dhītí- 4a, both fem.) recited at the Soma
pressing, and the Soma/soma him-/itself. The (female) thoughts “yearn for the/a bull”
(vṛṣaṇyá-) to swell (√pi 2c) and impregnate (gárbhaṃ √dhā 5b) them with his semen/juice,
while at the same time they are Soma’s mothers (4c) and themselves “give the gleaming
milk” (śukráṃ duhaté páyaḥ 5c) -- śukrám páyaḥ being often a kenning for both soma juice
and semen (see Gr, nos. 3 and 7 s.v. śukrá). So they both produce the soma/semen and
become pregnant by it.

### 06
The lexeme ápa √sthā is quite rare in the RV with a fairly late distribution: besides
this passage I have found only VIII.48.11 (a “popular” hymn acdg. to Arnold), X.106.2, and
X.124.8. It means ‘stay/keep away’; in this context, where those who ápa √sthā are to be
courted by Soma, in contrast to the śátru-, in whom he is urged to strike fear, it seems to
refer to potential allies or members of our group who are currently staying neutral, sitting on
the fence, as it were.
Re identifies this vs. as displaying the three functions -- an interpr. that utterly
escapes me.
I take vidā́as 2nd sg. impv., with lengthened ending, contra the standard interpr. (Pp,
Gr, Old, Lub) as 2nd sg. subj. vidā́s. (Ge and Re tr. as an impv. and do not comment, but it’s
quite possible that they are so tr. what they consider a subjunctive.) The form is parallel to 2
impvs. in the same vs., úpa śikṣa (a), ā́dhehi (b), which support an impv. reading; the pāda
is repeated twice (IX.43.4, 63.11), but those vss. lack other verb forms that would support
one reading or the other. Other occurrences of vidā́are generally better taken as impv.
(I.36.14, VI.48.9, VIII.61.7) or are syntactically and semantically indifferent (I.71.7). (I take
the form in V.45.1 as the instr. of a root noun.) The only clear ex. of a subj. is in IX.40.4,
where sandhi preserves the final cons.: vidā́ḥ sahasríṇīr … I assume the almost universal
embrace of the Pp subjunctive readings results from the fact that there are no unambiguous
imperative forms to this them. aor. stem -- that is, forms where the sandhi does not allow a -
ā́s reading -- whereas there are several other subjunctives (e.g., vidā́si IX.35.1). But I do not
see why an impv. would be excluded on principle; Macd (VedGr §512) gives several exx. of
a- aorist imperatives, though he states that the mood is “of rare occurrence” -- a statement
he also makes (§509) about the subjunctive to the same formation, however. It’s also worth
noting that KH (Injunk. 263) takes vidó ṣú … in X.113.10 as impv. vidá + u, a reading
supported by the sandhi of ṣú. On imperatival use of injunc. vidaḥ see comm. ad IX.20.3.
## 020

### 01
vā́rebhiḥ, lit. ‘along the hairs/fleece’ is an instr. of the path-along-which; see
comm. ad IX.15.5.

### 03
The sense of the injunc. vidaḥ here is uncertain, but my rendering in the publ. tr. as
if it were a subjunctive is almost surely wrong. In general, 2nd sg. injunctives to thematic
aorists have been taken as modal (see KH, Injunk. 263), and certainly Ge and Re both tr. this
form as an impv. The sá opening the pāda supports the interpr. as an imperative substitute,
since, by my rules (“Vedic ‘sá figé’: An Inherited Sentence Connective?,” Historische
Sprachforschung 105 [1992]: 213-39), sá (and other nominative forms of this pronoun) are
found with 2nd ps. ref. almost exclusively with imperatives. Hoffmann (loc. cit.), however,
says that modal use of the various occurrences of vidaḥ is “nicht durchweg sicher.”
Nonetheless I would now change the tr. to an imperatival “find fame for us,” because of the
sá. I do not think that this calls my interpr. of vidā́ as an impv. in the preceding hymn (19.8)
into question. See comm. there. For other occurrences of the form vidaḥ, see comm. ad
I.42.7-9.

### 05
Both Ge and Re take ab together, but I do not understand how the simile “like a
king” (rā́jeva) would work with the VP (“you have entered the songs” gíraḥ … viveśitha). I
have therefore taken the two pādas as separate clauses. The simile in pāda a then works
well, since it makes perfect sense that a king should “possess good commandments”
(suvratáḥ). The splitting of the two pādas gains further support from IX.57.3b, a pāda
closely corresponding to our pāda a: íbho rā́jeva suvratáḥ, where there is no question of
entering songs or any similar action and the shared quality of simile and frame must be
suvratá-.
For further on the expression “enter songs” in pāda b, see publ. intro.

### 06
On apsú duṣṭáraḥ see comm. ad 16.3.

### 07
On the double sense of makhá- see comm. ad I.18.9; in our passage the ‘bounteous’
sense prevails, though it could also be making a subtle ring with vs. 1. In 1c Soma conquers
all opponents, and here he could be secondarily called a battler as well as bounteous.
## 021

### 02
This vs. lacks a finite verb and can go either with vs. 1 or vs. 3 (or both): they all
have as subj. the plural soma juices.
The lexeme prá √vṛ is rare and generally means ‘cover [with INSTR.]’ (e.g., X.16.7).
However, here and in VII.82.6 it must mean ‘ward off’ (< ‘obstruct forward’?) vel sim.

### 04
As often in the Soma hymns (see, e.g., comm. ad IX.9.1), hitá- is ambiguous,
belonging either to √dhā, hence ‘placed’, or to √hi, hence ‘impelled’. Both Ge and Re opt
for ‘placed’, and I admit that this works better with the loc. ráthe. But if they are merely
“placed” at/on the chariot, we do not learn how they obtained the desirable things, and I
therefore think ‘propelled’ is a necessary part of the scenario. Of course, it might be meant
to be read both ways: “when placed at the chariot (and) propelled.”

### 05
On my interpr. of this vs., see publ. tr. Both Ge and Re have quite different views.
Ge takes the asmin to be the sacrificer (flg. Sāy.), with the piśáṅgam … venám (my “tawny
tracker,” his “den goldenen Seher”) “ein innerer Mahner” of this would-be stingy man. This
anticipation of an Upaniṣadic-type Inner Controller seems anachronistic to me. Re simply --
in my opinion over-simplistically -- takes all elements to be soma in one form or another:
the soma drops are urged to put “le (Soma) Veilleur à couleur-d’or” into the soma liquid.
This endless loop doesn’t seem to get us anywhere. I do agree with Re that soma/Soma is
represented by two of the elements: the drops that are addressed (indavaḥ) are soma the
substance and the “tawny tracker” is Soma the god. The drops are urged to put Soma the
god into Indra (my interpr. of the referent of asmin); cf., from the same poet, IX.11.6 índum
índre dadhātana.
The subj. of the infin. ādíśe is, in my view, the tawny tracker (i.e., Soma), though the
act of placing this Soma in Indra may be part of the instruction. On the constr. see comm. on
the almost identical expression in 6b.
Loc. asmin is unaccented and should therefore refer to something already present in
the discourse, but that does not eliminate any of the just-given interpr.: Ge’s sacrificer, in
the person of the ‘presser’ (súṣvi-), is found in 2, my Indra in 1, and Re’s soma is
ubiquitous. In fact even without the mentions in vss. 1 and 2, the sacrificer and Indra are
expected personnel on the scene in any Soma hymn.

### 06
The adj. ráthya- generally modifies either chariot horses or chariot wheels; here,
with the presence of a craftsman, the latter is most likely. So also Gr, Ge, and Re.
As was just noted, pāda b dádhātā kétam ādíśe is almost identical to 5b dádhātā
venám ādíśe. Nonetheless, Ge and Re unaccountably (at least to me) take the VP entirely
differently here from 5b: they take návaṃ, dádhātā as a phrasal verb “renew, make new,”
with ādíśe filling a different syntactic role. E.g., “Erneuet, um (ihn) zu mahnen, seinen
Vorsatz …” (Sim. Keydana, Inf., 318, who shows no awareness of the parallel in the immed.
preceding vs.) First, I know of no other exx. of náva- √dhā in the sense ‘make new’, a sense
expressed rather by náva- √kṛ (e.g., X.143.1). But, more important, the close parallelism
between 5b and 6b strongly suggests that they should be interpr. the same way, with the acc.
the subj. of the infinitive.
By the Ge/Re (/Keydana) interpr., in the simile the craftsman is “renewing” the
wheel; by mine, he is “setting/placing” it on the chariot, with a slightly different sense of
√dhā than in the frame.

### 07
satáḥ in c is somewhat puzzling. Both Ge and Re take it as adverbial: “in gleicher
Weise,” “pareillement.” Ge makes no comment; Re adduces sató-mahant-, -vīra-. For this
1st cmpd member see comm. ad VII.104.21. As I point out there, though I think the cmpds in
question contain this adverbial element, I do not think it exists as an independent word.
Supposed exx. of it belong instead to the pres. part. of √as, either gen./abl. sg. or acc. pl.
Here I take it as the gen. sg., dependent on matím. Genitives appearing with this stem
generally refer to the poet (e.g., IX.64.10 kavīnā́m matī́). Forms of √as, incl. the pres. part.,
can have the extended sense ‘be real / really present’, and that is how I take it here. Cf. for a
similar use in a nearby hymn IX.19.7 dūré vā sató ánti vā “whether he be in the distance or
nearby” (used of an enemy); also IX.31.6 (of Soma).
## 022
On the structure and thematics of this hymn, see publ. intro. Note also that the first 5
vss. begin eté, while the 2nd hemistichs of vss. 5 and 6 begin utédám. Further local chainings
are discussed below.

### 01
The preverb prá, which must be in tmesis from the verb aheṣata that ends the vs.,
is very oddly positioned -- in the middle of a pāda (one that doesn’t even contain the verb),
not adjoining a metrical boundary. I have no explanation, though it may be based on a pāda
like IX.64.4 ásṛkṣata prá vājínaḥ, also ending prá vājínaḥ, where the preverb immediately
follows its verb, a permitted position.

### 02
As in the immed. preceding hymn (21.2), this vs. lacks a finite verb and can be
attached either to vs. 1 or vs. 3 or both.
My supplied “(surging)” isn’t strictly necessary -- neither Ge nor Re supplies
anything at all -- but it seemed to me that something dynamic was needed here, for wind,
rain, and fire.
IX.22.3, 5: Note vy ànaśuḥ in both vss. (3c, 5b), implicitly connecting Soma’s pervasion of
poetry with his pervasion of cosmic space. This repetition could also define vs. 4, the middle
vs. of the hymn, as an omphalos, but that vs. doesn’t seem to do much if so. For further exx.
of √(n)aś see ad 4-6.

### 04
With Ge/Re I take ná as neg. with pf. śaśramuḥ. In contrast, Kü (524, 551) takes it
as the simile particle: “... sind wie [Rennpferde], die gelaufen sind, ermüdet ...” He cites
(551 n. 1141) Delbrück (Altind. Syn. 376) for this interpr., but Delbrück in fact takes the ná
as neg.: “… sind nicht müde geworden, obgleich sie gelaufen sind.” I assume that Kü so
interpr. because of the position of ná after the participle, but in a Gāyatrī pāda the position
before the verb is also the position after the NP -- there’s not a lot of space. I think it
unlikely that the poets would ever say that the ever-running soma could get tired. Moreover,
√śram almost always appears with neg.

### 05
See remarks ad vs. 3.
The part. viprayántaḥ presumably belongs to the lexeme ví-prá √i, but note that it
could also be interpr. as belonging to a denom. *vipra-yá- ‘behave like [/seek] an inspired
poet’, which would connect this vs. further with the poetic pervasion of vs. 3. The suggested
denom. stem is not attested but could of course be easily formed, and I’m tolerably sure this
pun was meant. Note vipāscítaḥ and vipā́, both in the matching vs. 3. I would now slightly
alter the tr. to “going forth widely [/behaving like inspired poets].”
### 04-06
More chaining: vss. 4 and 6 end with rájaḥ; the exact phrase in 5c is uttamáṃ
rájaḥ, whose uttamám is then picked up in 6a and augmented with uttamā́yyam in 6c.
Meanwhile, 3rd pl. pf. (vy) ā̀naśuḥ of 3c, 5b morphs into 3rd pl. root aor. āśata in 6b. As Old
points out, √(n)aś is also represented by the desid. íyakṣantaḥ in 4c.
My “that is to be higher still” is meant to capture the pseudo-gerundive form of the
nonce uttamā́yi
ya-.
### 06-07
As noted in the publ. intro., vs. 7 stands somewhat apart from the rest of the
hymn, but there is chaining here as well: 6a tántuṃ tanvānám … is echoed by 7c tatáṃ
tántum …

### 07
Both Ge and Re take acikradaḥ as transitive/causative (e.g., “tu l’as fait crier”), but
although (á)cikrada- looks like a typical redupl. aor. to an -áya-transitive, it is not so used.
On the problem of this redupl. aor., see my 1983 -áya- book (pp. 110-11)(though I would
now disavow a second √krand ‘race’, beside ‘roar’).
## 023

### 04
On the identification of the soma juices with the Āyus, see publ. intro. Both Ge and
Re take āyávaḥ here as adjectival (“lebengebend” and “vivaces” respectively), but this loses
the connection with the Āyus in vs. 2.
## 024
### 01-03
The first 3 vss. are united by the use of the (secondary) root √dhanv ‘run’, with
the 3rd pl. -iṣ-aor. adhanviṣuḥ (found only here in the RV) in vss. 1 and 2, with the
complementary subjects soma drops (1) and cows (2)(or so I think: see below), and the 2nd
sg. pres. dhanvasi in 3.

### 02
Old discusses this vs. at some length and disputes the cows as subject. The
problems he sees are that 1) it makes more sense for the soma drops to run than the cows
(though he admits that there are some undoubted passages with the latter); 2) the shared
verb would more naturally have the same subject than diff. subjects (this is not a stylistic
given in soma hymns, where substances swap identities all the time); 3) the part. punānā́ḥ
‘being purified’ is better applied to soma drops than cows (though again he recognizes at
least one passage in which the part. is so used). On the basis of these arguments he suggests
that gā́vaḥ here should be interpr. as accusative rather than as the nominative it
overwhelming is, with abhí gā́vaḥ substituted for abhí gā́ḥ on metrical grounds and the
soma drops again the subj. This seems both uncharacteristic and unworthy of Oldenberg.
Positing “metrical” motivation for RVic anomalies is rarely successful, because the poets
are flexible enough to avoid situations where they would be forced to use the wrong
grammatical form because of meter. Moreover, the construction of the a-pādas of the two
vss. -- PREVERB PL.NOUN adhanviṣuḥ -- imposes the subject role on the second noun (gā́vaḥ,
2a), which is in the same position as sómāsaḥ in 1a. The only of his arguments that seems at
all worth considering is the one about punānā́ḥ, though given the tendency to identify the
substances, esp. the liquid substances, in the soma ritual with each other, I do not find it
particularly cogent -- and as Old himself points out, c could be a separate clause with the
soma drops supplied as subj. there. (Another possible argument, not brought up by Old, is
that this is the only vs. in the hymn where soma [sg. or pl.] is not the subject, but I do not
think that is strong enough to contravene the grammar.) He cites another possible ex. of acc.
gā́vaḥ, in VIII.41.6, where the form is easily interpr. as nom. (see comm. ad loc.). Re
follows Old’s interpr; Ge does not, though in his n. 2b he suggests that the poet meant the
soma drops as subject, but reversed the construction (“… er hat aber die Konstruktion
umgekehrt,” whatever he means by that).

### 04
Although in the publ. tr. pāda c is unequivocally applied to Soma (“you who are
…”), the text is ambiguous: the rel. cl. of pāda c, sásnir yó anumā́dyaḥ, could have either
Soma or Indra (under the epithet carṣaṇīsáh-, which ends the preceding pāda) as antecedent.
In IX anumā́dya- is otherwise used of Soma, including two vss. later (24.6) as well as 76.1,
107.11, but it applies to Indra in VI.34.2. Since Indra was just called “conquerer of
territories,” the use of sásni- ‘winner’ for the subj. of anumā́dya- makes Indra a distinct
possibility. I think the ambiguity is meant; this is another ex. of the trade-off of identities
discussed ad vs. 2. See further below.

### 05
The tr. of this vs. needs to be emended: because paridhā́vasi has an accented verb,
it must belong to the yád clause, and pāda c must be the main clause. I would now add to the
tr. of c “(you are) fit …” Alternatively, the vs. could be entirely a subordinate clause and
dependent on either 4 or 6, hence, e.g., “purify yourself … (4), when pressed by the stones
you run around the filter, fit for the fundament of Indra (5),” with no alternation of the
transl. of 5, but a comma, not a period, at the end of 4.
What dhā́mane is meant to convey here is unclear, and numerous incompatible
suggestions have been made -- e.g., Ge “(Eigen)art,” Re “vocation” (and see his n.). I long
ago (Ged. Cowgill) suggested that this is a somewhat heavy-handed pun, with “fundament”
both referring to Indra’s fundamental being and to his physical foundation, his bottom.

### 06
As noted in the publ. intro., Indra’s most characteristic epithet, “Vṛtra/obstaclesmasher,” is here applied to Soma instead -- another ex. of identity trading. The gerundive
anumā́dya-, which was ambiguously used in 4c for either Soma or Indra or both, may signal
the blurring of identity between them here.

### 07
Because of the blurring of identity just discussed, I take the predicate of ucyate ‘is
called’ to be sómaḥ, a re-assertion of the name of the god being celebrated in this hymn after
the equation with Indra in vss. 4 and 6 (and with the cows in vs. 2). This re-assertion is esp.
appropriate in the final vs. of the hymn. Ge/Re take śúciḥ pāvakáḥ as the predicate instead,
but this pair of adjectives already characterized the substance identically in 6c. I think the
point is that “the gleaming and purified one” has the name / is called “Soma.” In favor of
their interpr. is the variant in VIII.13.19 śúciḥ pāvaká ucyate só ádbhutaḥ (which also
incorporates all 3 adjectives from our vs. 6c). In that passage the adjectives do seem to serve
as predicate with ucyate, but with a twist -- these soma-epithets are applied to the praiser
(stotár-) there. I therefore do not think that the two similar pādas need to be construed
identically -- rather that one poet (probably the one responsible for VIII.13.19) is playing
with the phrase.
## 025

### 02
hitáḥ here fairly clearly belongs to √hi ‘impel’, given the expressions of movement
and goal in the rest of the vs. But the ambiguity between hitá- ‘impelled’ and ‘placed’ is
common in this maṇḍala, as we’ve already seen (e.g., IX.1.2).
Both Ge and Re take dhármaṇā to be Soma’s: “nach deiner Bestimmung” and “selon
(ta) nature” respectively. However, I take it to refer to the statute or ordinance of the ritual,
in particular that which establishes Vāyu as the first recipient of the soma drink: dhármaṇā
is used in this exact sense here as well as in IX.63.22 and I.134.5; see disc. ad the latter
passage.

### 03
Soma is given Indra’s epithet vṛtrahán- as in vs. 6 of the preceding hymn (IX.24).

### 04
There is disagreement about what it means for Soma to “enter all forms” (víśvā
rūpā́ṇy āviśán): Ge thinks that it refers to the various stages of soma preparation, while Re
that it refers to the divine forms, that is the gods, whom Soma enters when he is drunk. I
slightly favor Ge’s explanation, since Soma only reaches the gods in the last pāda.

### 06
On ā́pavasva … pavítram see disc. ad IX.70.10.
## 026
On the rhetorical structure of this hymn, see publ. intro. The tr. replicates the
fronting of the acc. pronoun ‘him’ throughout, though in vs. 6 táṃ tvā is represented just by
“you,” not “that you.”

### 02
The phrase dhartár- diváḥ (also in opposite order) “supporter of heaven” is well
established and used elsewhere in IX of Soma (IX.76.1, 109.6); it is of course the default
interpr. here, shared by Gr, Ge, Re, and the publ. tr. inter alia. However, the ā́in the middle
of the phrase (dhartā́ram ā́diváḥ) is troubling. It should not be a preverb in tmesis, since it
is not adjacent to a metrical boundary and is not in a pāda with a finite verb (nor is there an
appropriate verb anywhere in the vs.). The standard use of ā́in such positions is as an
adposition, and in particular, in the position before an abl., with the meaning ‘all the way
to’. Cf. for this exact expression ā́diváḥ I.92.17 “all the way to heaven,” of a ślóka- ‘signal
call’ whose noise goes to heaven. I therefore think there is a syntactic and semantic pun in
this vs.: the first reading is “supporter of heaven” with a gen. diváḥ (and the ā́essentially
elided), but the second is “all the way to heaven” with an abl. diváḥ governed by ā́. This
latter reading indicates that the lowing of the cows found in pāda a (gā́vo abhy ànūṣata) goes
not only to Soma on the ritual ground but also to heaven, where the heavenly Soma is found
-- as is made clear in the next vs. That the material going to heaven is noise reminds us of
I.92.17 with the same expression.

### 03
On the anomalous acc. sg. vedhā́m to vedhás- see Old ad loc.; AiG II.2.225, 725,
III.283, 285. Re’s suggestion that it may recall “l’origine lointaine ví-dhā” is best ignored,
since Aves. vazdah- rules out a vṛddhi of -i- in the initial syllable of vedhás- (as Re surely
knew). Note that the correct pl. to the -as-stem, vedhásaḥ, is found in vs. 6.
For the relationship between ádhi dyávi here and ā́diváḥ in 2c, see immed. above.

### 04
On this vs., and esp. pāda b, see Old’s detailed and sensible disc.
The rare and curiously formed word bhuríj- (4x), without clear etymology, is always
dual, and the gloss ‘arm’ (flg. Sāy’s bāhu-), or perhaps better ‘hand’, works reasonably well
in the various contexts. In IV.2.14 it appears in a vs. with other body parts and in a context
where artisans are at work; in VIII.4.16 a razor is being sharpened; in IX.71.5 it qualifies the
fingers, which are assembling a chariot. Here the context is rather like IX.10.2, which has
du. gábhastyoḥ, belonging to a stem unambiguously meaning ‘hand’. In this passage it’s
important to note that bhurí(joḥ) is in the same metrical position as bhū́ri(-) in 3c and 5c and
that bhuríjor dhiyā́is close to a phonological approximation of bhū́ridhāyasam (3c).
There is some difference of opinion on how to construe vivásvataḥ. Re supplies
“(dans le domaine),” presumably on the basis of the fairly common phrase vivásvataḥ
sádane. Old’s interpr (flg. Pischel), that it depends on dhiyā́, is the one I adopt: it has the
merit of not requiring anything to be supplied, and vivásvataḥ depends on dhī́- in IX.99.2
vivásvato dhíyaḥ, where the thoughts themselves are impelling soma (hinvánti, like our
ahyan). Ge’s interpr. is more complex: he takes dhiyā́independently with ahyan in pāda a
(“Ihn haben sie … durch ihre Kunst zur Eile getrieben”), but with vivásvataḥ dependent on
it with saṃvásānam in b (“der sich (in die Dichtung) des Vivasvant kleidet”), thus reading
dhiyā́twice (see his n. 4b). I think this double reading is essentially correct -- though I see
no reason to put the second “in die Dichtung” in parens, nor do I think that the dhiyā́
construed with ahyan in pāda a should lack the dependent genitive.
Though Gr classifies saṃvásāna- (2x) with √vas ‘dwell’, the later consensus (in
addition to the usual, see Gotō, 1st Kl., 295 n. 698), patently correct in my view, is that it
belongs with √vas ‘wear’, which has a well-attested med. root pres., whose med. participle
is esp. common. On ‘hymns’ etc. as garments, see the passages cited by Old.

### 06
With Old I take girāvṛ́dh- as a pun, with the first member both instr. sg. of gír-
‘song’ and loc. sg. of girí- ‘mountain’ -- both meanings being entirely appropriate to soma.
Ge opts for the 1st in his tr. (though he recognizes the 2nd in n. 6b); Re for the 2nd. Scar (516-
17) tentatively accepts Old’s double interpr.
## 027
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn, like the immediately preceding one, is unified
by the simple device of a pronoun (here eṣá ‘this one’) repeated at the beginning of each vs.
and rendered as such in English. Unlike the preceding hymn there is no switch of person at
the end.

### 01
On the meaning of the root √tuś see comm. ad VIII.38.2.

### 03
The root-noun cmpd viśva-víd- is ambiguous, between ‘all-knowing’ and ‘allacquiring’ (see Scar 489). In this context, given svar-jít- ‘winning the sun’ (2b) and satrājít- ‘winning compeltely’ (4c), ‘acquiring all’ seems to work better; however, the very next
hymn contains two instances of the same cmpd (IX.28.1, 5), where ‘knowing all’ is favored.

### 05
This vs. rather subtly contrasts the cosmic Soma, who is in heaven (ádhi dyávi)(ab),
with the ritual substance in the filter (pavítre, c). See comm. ad IX.26.2, 3 in the preceding
hymn.
On the formation and sense of hāsate see Narten (Sig.Aor. 285-86).

### 06
The last vs. of the hymn splits the locational difference found in vs. 5: Soma here
flows in the midspace (antárikṣe), between the heavenly Soma and the soma on earth on the
ritual ground.
On śuṣmī́see comm. ad 29.6.
## 028
Like the last hymn, this one has eṣá beginning every vs. Although the hymns share
some vocabulary and themes (as which Soma hymns do not?), they are not twinned.

### 01
hitáḥ is taken by all standard interpr. (Gr, Ge, Re) to √hi ‘impel’, as also by me,
presumably because of the verb of motion, ví dhāvati, that provides the finite verb in the vs.
But it could, of course, belong to √dhā ‘place’. This alternative interpr. is almost
encouraged by vs. 4bc daśábhir jāmíbhir yatáḥ / abhí dróṇani dhāvati “(Soma,) held by the
ten siblings, runs to the wooden cups,” where a ppl. of static position (yatáḥ) precedes the
same verb of motion.
On viśva-víd- see comm. ad 27.3. Because of mánasas pátiḥ (note close sandhi) “lord
of mind,” I interpr. the cmpd as ‘all-knowing’ here.

### 02
For c víśvā dhā́māny āviśán Ge reasonably cfs. (n. 2c) IX.25.4a víśvā rūpāṇy
āviśán, but then goes the further step to “dhā́man = rūpá” and tr. our passage “alle seine
Formen annehmend,” for which I see little or no justification. Yes, the stems in the RV with
well-established distinct meanings, and I see no reason to erase that distinction. Ge’s interpr.
has implications for vs. 5, for which see below.

### 05
The c pāda, víśvā dhā́māni viśvavít, has the same neut. pl. acc. NP as 2c and the
third word is phonologically similar to 2c āviśán. There are in principle three ways to
construe víśvā dhā́māni: 1) as a 2nd object to arocayat in a (“made the sun shine (and) all the
domains”); 2) as the goal of āviśán, supplied from 2c (“entering all domains”); 3) as the
object of the root noun -víd- extracted the cmpd. viśva-víd- or as further specification of the
1st member of that cmpd. (so, either “all-knowing, (knowing) the domains” as in the publ.
tr., or “knowing all, (viz.) all the domains”). Like the publ. tr., Re chooses the first version
of 3), and this seems the most rhetorically satisfying, while Ge opts for a variant of the
second version of 3, while being forced to the further step of interpr. dhā́māni as “forms”
(“all Formen vollständig kennend”) on the basis of his interpr. of 2c.

### 06
On śuṣmī́see comm. ad 29.6.
## 029

### 01
The metrical structure encourages construing ójasā with sutásya -- so Ge “wenn
der Bull mit Kraft ausgepresst ist.” However, I think it likely that the ójas- expressions are
otherwise identical, but dhā́man- and rūpá- are both well-established
belongs to Soma, rather than the pressers, and have therefore taken it with the participial VP
in c. Re seems to take it with the verb of pāda a: “Ses jets ont coulé en avant … d’une forceformidable.”
Note the unaccented asya in the first pāda, allowable because the referent is
unmistakable. Cf. asmai in IX.11.1a and IX.70.1a.

### 03
The construction in pāda a is clarified by IX.94.5 víśvāni hí suṣáhā tā́ni túbhyam
“for all these things are easy to conquer for you,” with a full dative prn. rather than our
ambig. enclitic te. The tā́ni is clearly specified by víśvā vásūni in 4a, anticipated by the voc.
prabhū-vaso in our b.

### 05
áraruṣaḥ in pāda a can be gen. or abl. sg. Either of them can fit the syntax: as abl. it
can be construed directly with rákṣā (“protect from …”) and be parallel to svanā́t in b; as
gen., it can be dependent on svanā́t and part of the gen. NP samasya kásya cit. Ge follows
the 2nd path (“vor dem Schnauben eines jeden Geizhalses”), while Re (and I) the 1st
. I do so
partly because an abl. simply gives more oomph -- protection from a non-giver seems more
critical than simply from the sound of one -- but primarily because of the word order: the
audience hearing a form that could be abl. immediately after √rakṣ would naturally take it
as an abl. It’s possible that they would revise their opinion on encountering a 2nd abl.
followed by a gen. sg. to which áraruṣaḥ could belong, but it’s also possible (likely even)
that they would see no reason to reinterpr. áraruṣaḥ.
The subordinate cl. in c does not fit with the main cl. very well, as the awkwardness
of the publ. tr. shows. The problem is the verb: what is wanted in context is a modal in a
purpose-type clause (“so that we will/may become free of insult”); this would work well
with protection from the “sound” in pāda b. But mumucmáhe is resolutely pf. indicative (or
redupl. pres. indic.; see Kü 380 and nn. 677, 678). Both Ge and Re supply material to
smooth the transition, Re with a pres. part. attached to ab: “(nous plaçant) là où nous soyons
à l’abri de la nocivité” -- thus also sneaking in the desirable modality. Ge starts a new
sentence with c, supplying as main cl. “da wollen wir sein.” Kü avoids supplying anything,
but sneaks in futurity in parens: “da wir von der Schmach befreit (worden) sind.” I don’t
have a good solution and so stick with the awk. publ. tr.

### 06
This is the 3rd hymn in a row, all attributed to Āṅgirasa poets, with a form of
śuṣmín-, śúṣma- in the final vs. Also in the next hymn IX.30, also an Āṅgirasa hymn, vss. 1
(śuṣmín-) and 3 (śúṣma-). As noted in the publ. intro. to IX.30, the word is not characteristic
of Āṅgirasa poets elsewhere, even in the IXth Maṇḍala, although there are numerous hymns
attributed to them in this maṇḍala (besides our IX.27-30): IX.4, 35-36, 37-38, 39-40, 44-46,
50-52, 61, 67 [part], 69, 72, 73, 83, parts of 97 and 108, 112). Of these, only IX.50.1, 52.4,
attributed to Ucatha Āṅgirasa, contain members of this word family. In hymns attributed to
Āṅgirasa poets outside of IX, the words are found only in X.43.3 (Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa),
VIII.96.8 (Tiraṣci Āṅgirarsa), and -- most noteworthy -- VIII.98.12, 99.6, the only two
hymns outside of IX attributed exclusively to Nṛmedha Āṅgirasa, the poet of our IX.27, 29.
## 030
On śúṣma- (vs. 3) and śuṣmín- (vs. 1), see ad IX.39.6.

### 01
Unaccented asya in the first pāda of the hymn is exactly like that in IX.29.1a.

### 02
It is not clear how to interpr. indriyám in the phrase vagnúm indriyám, as also in
similar expressions: I.92.1 ślókam indriyám, VIII.52.7 hávanam ... indriyám. Most take it to
mean “Indra-like,” that is, presumably, loud, powerful (e.g., Ge “ein indrahaftes Geschrei”).
I think it more likely that it identifies the cry as “destined for Indra, appropriate to Indra.”
Indra is always the special target of invocation in the Soma maṇḍala and VIII.52 is an Indra
hymn. Of course, both senses could be meant.

### 03
The idiom ā́√pū ‘attract (X) through purification’ is found here in tmesis (see also
29.6). Here the ā́opening the first two pādas is immediately followed by the accusatives that
it, as it were, licenses, while the impv. pavasva appears in the 3rd pāda with dhā́rayā, which
is also appropriate in the intrans./reflex. usage of pávate without preverb (see 4ab).
Re points to the contrast (or at least juxtaposition) of nṛ́- (nṛ-sā́hyya-) and vīrá-
(vīrá-vant-) here, though I would not follow him in seeing them as expressions of two of the
Three Functions.
## 031

### 01
The phrasal verb cétanam √kṛ ‘make manifest’ may be a means of avoiding the
problematically ambiguous cetáyati.

### 03
Both Ge and Re (also Scar, 336) supply a verb (“blow”) for the winds in pāda a.
This seems unnec. to me: although √ṛṣ generally has liquids as subj., it can have a broader
sense ‘rush’, and even “flowing winds” would be well within the RVic metaphorical
domain. It might, however, better capture the word order to tr. “For you the favoring winds,
for you the rivers rush.”

### 05
The accent on the main verb duduhré results from the fact that it follows the voc.
bábhro that opens the pāda and is thus the first real word in the pāda.
## 032
### 02-03
The ā́d that begins both these vss. does not seem to have its usual “(just) after
that” sense.

### 02
On Trita as the archetypal soma-presser and his “maidens” (yóṣanaḥ) as the
fingers, see disc. ad IX.37.4.

### 03
This vs. contains two similes (ab and c respectively), each a bit trickily constructed.
In the first, the caus. redupl. aor. avīvaśat has two slightly different senses in simile and
frame: ‘makes bellow’ in the simile: it is the flock (gaṇám) that is making the noise,
stimulated by its lead goose (haṃsáḥ); ‘makes bellow(ed)’ in the frame: it is the
thought/prayer (matím) of someone else (víśvasya) that Soma causes to be heard. This
double sense is the counterpart to that of the caus. to √śru, both ‘make hear’ and ‘makes
heard’. My interpr. here is different from that of Re, who takes both acc. as goal of the
sound (“… vers (sa) troupe, … vers la prière …”); Ge’s is close to mine, though he doesn’t
seem to recognize the slight difference in the function of the object. On this aor. stem, see
my -áya-Formations, 111, 166. Another ex. with the same sense is found in nearby IX.34.6;
see comm. ad loc.
In the second simile, in c, it is not syntactic variation but a pun on the root of the
passive ajyate that is at issue: this form can belong either to √añj ‘anoint’ or to √aj ‘drive’,
and both are appropriate to the context. Soma can be “anointed” by cows’ milk or driven
together with the cows (that is, the milk). The ‘steed’ to which Soma is compared could
likewise be both anointed (/groomed) and driven.

### 04
Although mṛgá- generally refers to a wild beast in general in the RV and in later
Skt. comes to mean specifically ‘deer’, here it seems close to the meaning of Aves. mǝrǝγa-
‘(large) bird, bird of prey’. Cf. the almost identical pāda IX.67.15 śyenó ná taktó arṣati
“Like a falcon launched in flight, it rushes.” The participle avacā́kaśat ‘looking down’ also
fits a bird better than an earth-bound beast; cf. esp. X.136.4 antárikṣeṇa patati víśvā
rūpā́vacā́kaśat “He flies through the midspace, gazing down on all forms,” in the famous
Muni hymn. See also comm. on takva-vī́- ad I.134.5, 151.5. It must be admitted, however,
that it is not only birds that √tac; see X.28.4 kroṣṭā́varāháṃ nír atakta kákṣāt “The jackal
sprang on the boar from out of the underbrush.” However, there the attack is presumably an
airborne pounce, so bird-like. Images on the web of jackals pouncing support this notion.
As for what the mṛgá- is looking down on, it is surely the two worlds, a notion going
back to Sāy., which would fit the bird’s-eye view. Ge suggests other possibilities in n. 4a,
but not with great conviction.

### 05
Both Ge and Re seem to make heavier weather of hitám than seems called for. Ge
(n. 5c) suggests that the acc. is attraction from nom. *hitáḥ and tr. “Er ist wie ein
angesporntes (Rennpferd) in das Wettrennen gegangen.” Re allows it to be acc. but not to
modify ājím, requiring him to invent a second acc. phrase: “Elles sont allées [Re seems to
have nodded on the number of the verb ágan; it cannot be the 3rd pl. of the root aor. to √gā,
which is (á)gur, but must be 3rd sg. to the root aor. of √gam] dans l’arène comme (pour
rejoindre le soma) mis en branle (par les prières).” I don’t understand the fuss: ājí- is masc.
(the supposed fem. ex. in I.116.15 is not), so hitám is grammatically fine. And I see no
reason why a contest can’t be set, as a prize is. Perhaps it is their apparent conviction that
hitám has to belong to √hi ‘impel’ that impelled them to these unconvincing makeshifts, or
perhaps they believe that yáthā as a simile marker does not behave like ná and iva but
requires a pseudo-clausal structure. But see the exx. in Gr’s no. 4 s.v. yáthā (col. 1083).
## 033

### 01
vánāni must be read with both frame (wooden [cups]) and simile (woods / forest,
into which the buffalo go).

### 02
A different word for wooden vessel (dróṇa-) substitutes for vána- here.

### 04
On the three voices, see publ. intro.

### 05
Fem. bráhmī- is found only here (fortunately!). It is generally taken as a word play
based on yahvī́ḥ in the next pāda (see Old with lit.; AiG II.2.412), which is surely correct.
But it seems further assumed that it is derived from the adj. brahmán- and is adjectival (AiG
II.2.421; cf. Gr ‘heilig, andächtig’, Re ‘vouées à la Formule’; Ge’s ‘Beterstimmen’ is less
clear). Given its accent I think it’s more likely a nonce fem. form of the noun bráhman-
‘formulation’, in order to assimiliate its gender to the cows. It might even be based on a
putative *bráhmn-ī-, like rā́jan- / rā́jñī, with simplification of the impossible cluster *-hmn-.

### 06
See comm. ad IX.40.3 on the repeated pāda b. I might now consider tr. “for us all
around” rather than “for us … from every direction.”
## 034

### 02
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is almost identical to IX.33.3; the only
difference is that the soma is plural (sutā́ḥ … sómāḥ) in 33.3 and sg. (sutáḥ … sómaḥ) here,
which also necessitates a sg. verb (arṣati for the pl. arṣanti in 33.3).

### 03
Acc. vṛ́ṣāṇam is one of the two forms (also X.89.9) of this stem with suffixal -ā- in
the strong stem, against the overwhelming prevalence of -an-. See Old. Assimilation to the
dominant pattern of -n-stems (rā́jānam type) is not surprising; what is perhaps surprising is
how well vṛ́ṣan- resisted the analogic pressure.

### 04
On Trita, see comm. ad IX.37.4.
Ge interpr. the rūpaíḥ with which the soma is anointed as its colors (“mit seinen
Farben”). However, (sám) √añj is specialized in IX for cows (that is, their milk). Cf.

### 47  
yád góbhiḥ ... samajyáse, IX.72.1 sáṃ dhenúbhiḥ ... ajyate; without sám there are
multiple passages, e.g., góbhir añjānáḥ ... (IX.50.5, etc.), góbhir ajyase (IX.85.5), and, esp.,
nearby IX.32.3 átyo ná góbhir ajyate. I therefore think that our passage must refer to
“forms” of milk; so also Re in his n., though unusually for him he does not supply it in tr.
(“de formes-concrètes”). That this vs. is sandwiched between two vss. that contain the verb
‘milk’, 3c duhanti, 5b duhaté, further supports this interpr., though in both 3 and 5 the milk
is not literal milk, but soma itself.
The publ. tr. does not reflect the possible pun on sám … ajyate that was noted in

### 03
just cited, where ajyate could also belong to √aj ‘drive’, hence a 2nd reading “is
driven together with the forms (of milk).”
### 04-05
The final words of these two vss. are the phonologically similar háriḥ and havíḥ,
both referring to soma -- though one is masc. nom. and the other neut. acc.

### 05
On the sense of this vs., see publ. intro. Needless to say, this vs. is catnip for Lü;
see his disc. p. 606.

### 06
I take avīvaśat here as trans./caus, as in nearby IX.32.3 -- an interpr. shared by Ge
and Re (“… a fait mugir …”), though Re takes the same form in 32.3 as non-caus. with acc.
of goal. See comm. there.
## 035

### 02
Two heavy cmpds in the voc., each with a 2nd member apparently derived from an -
áya- trans./caus. governing the first member in the acc.: samudram-īṅkhaya ‘setting the sea
to swaying’, viśvam-ejaya ‘setting all in motion’. Of course the final -m- of the 1st member
also serves to break the hiatus between the vocalic stem-final of the 1st member and the
vowel-initial verb stem. It’s also notable that verbal forms of ejaya- are not found in the RV;
they first appear in KS (XI.6 [prose], XXXV.14 [mantra]). (My statement in the -áyamonograph, p. 108, that the first attestation is in ŚB is wrong, relying on the notation in
Whitney’s Roots.)

### 03
I take vā́ryam as an Inhaltsakk.

### 04
The first pāda contains a notable word play. Judging from the number of parallels,
the default obj. of √iṣ ‘send’ in IX is ‘speech’; cf. IX.30.1, 64.9, 25, 95.5, and esp. IX.12.6
prá vā́cam índur iṣyati, a pāda identical to ours, save for one consonant: vā́cam versus
vā́jam. Although an emendation to *vā́cam has been suggested here (see Old, who rejects it),
a word play is far more likely. The poet knew (and knew his audience knew) the idiom
vā́cam √iṣ, but substituted the nearly identical vā́jam, which is to be construed with síṣāsan
‘desiring to win’ later in the vs. -- vā́jam being a common obj. to forms of √san ‘win’ and in
fact found in the root noun cmpd vāja-sā́in b, immediately after the desid. part. This root
noun cmpd “repairs” the apparent vā́jam problem, and in the next vs. the poet provides the
expected vā́cam, 5a vācam-īṅkhayám, a 2nd repair strategy.
Ge assigns vidānáḥ to √vid ‘know’ (“der sich auf die Vorschriften, auf die Waffen
versteht”), while Re (though see his n.) and the publ. tr. take it to √vid ‘find’ (as a root aor.
part.). I now think either (or both) is/are possible, but that in either case vratā́and ā́yudhā
are not separate objects as Ge/Re take them, but an equational phrase (as in the publ. tr.).
That is, Soma’s commandments are his weapons. On the formidable nature of Soma’s
vratá-s, cf., e.g., IX.53.3 ásya vratā́ni nā́dhṛ́ṣe “The commandments of this one cannot be
ventured against.” As an alt. tr. here I would add “knowing his commandments to be his
weapons.”

### 05
Reprise of the -īṅkhayá- cmpd from 2a. vācam-īṅkhayá- occurs once elsewhere, in
IX.101.6, where it modifies samudráḥ, which is the first member of the cmpd in our vs. 2, a
small web of formulaic associations.

### 06
dādhā́ra here is the only intransitive form of this perfect; see Re’s n. and Kü (261).
The root √dhṛ is prominent here (see the immed. following phrase dhármṇas páteḥ ‘master
of support’) and echoes rāyó dhartā́in 2c.
The last word of the hymn, prabhū́vasoḥ (“of the one who brings outstanding gifts”)
is the gen. of the name of the supposed poet of this hymn, Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa, who is also
assigned the next hymn, IX.36. Of course the name in the Anukramaṇī could well have been
generated from the final word of this hymn.
## 036
As noted in the publ. intro., every vs. but the final one has a form of √pū ‘purify’
beginning a pāda (though, interestingly, never the vs.), with each one different: 1b pavítre,
2b pávasva, 3b pávamāna, 4c pávate, 5c pávatām. This pattern is reminiscent of the
“versified paradigm” of the first hymn in the RV, I.1. And the abrupt cessation of the pattern
in the last vs. is of course also typical of RVic style.
## 037
For the rhetorical structure of the hymn, see publ. intro.

### 03
Note the slight reversed phonetic figure: a ... diváḥ# b ... vi dhāv(ati).

### 04
On the sense of this vs., see publ. intro. As indicated there, there is much
disagreement about the referents. To my disc. there I will only add a few comments.
Relevant for the whole vs. is IX.26.5 tám sā́nāv ádhi jāmáyo, hárim hinvanti ádribhiḥ “Him
do the siblings [=fingers] impel with the stones on the back (of the filter),” which contains
both jāmáyaḥ and sā́nu- as here, with the ‘siblings’ being the fingers and the ‘back’ the
filter. The ‘back’ (sā́nu-) in soma hymns is basically always the filter, whatever else it may
cosmically represent. Moreover, Trita is an archetypal soma-preparer; for this role see, inter
alia, Ge’s n. to IX.34,4 and Ober I.197-98, esp. on the similar role that Θrita fulfills atq the
haoma pressing in the Hom Yašt. In at least two other places in IX his ‘maidens’ (yóṣanaḥ),
the fingers, are involved: see in the next hymn. IX.38.2 etáṃ trítasya yóṣaṇaḥ, háriṃ
hinvanti ádribhiḥ “This tawny one do the maidens of Trita [=fingers] impel with the stones”
and almost identical IX.32.2. That the b pāda in these vss. with “Trita’s maidens” as subj.
(in pāda a) is identical to the one in IX.26.5 just quoted with jāmáyaḥ as subj. (in pāda a)
imposes the chain of identifications “Trita’s maidens’ = “siblings” = “fingers.” Therefore,
though it may be Trita's back in some sense [he owns and deploys the filter] it's surely also
his fingers, here called jāmí-, not Soma's or anyone else's (as has been suggested by others),
and though they may stand for various things (Dawns, heavenly rivers, whatever -- again
based on various scholars’ suggestions), they start out as fingers.
## 038
Like IX.37 with sá opening every vs., every vs. in this hymn begins with a form of
the eṣá- pronoun. The pattern here is both more complex and more emphatic: there is case
variation (vss. 2 and 3 have acc. sg. etám, the rest nom. sg. eṣá), and in all vss. but vs. 2 the
initial pronoun is followed by the appropriate form of syá-/tyá-: eṣá (u) syá, etáṃ tyám, a
phrase that means ‘this very (one)’.

### 01
The two nominatives vṛ́ṣā ‘bull’ and ráthaḥ ‘chariot’ are juxtaposed, each
qualifying Soma. I consider them separate characterizations, with Soma as both bull and
chariot; so also Oberlies (RelRV II.71, 229). Ge takes vṛṣā́as modifying ráthaḥ (“Dieser
bullenhafte Wagen”), while Re sneaks in a parenthesis to avoid identifying Soma with a
chariot: “le-célèbre (soma), taureau, (cheval attelé au) char.” If taking them as independent
seems too radical, Ge’s solution takes fewer liberties with the text than Re’s.

### 02
As noted above, this is the only vs. where the initial pronoun is not followed by a
form of syá-/tyá-, though tritásya starts promisingly, with tR, and ends with -sya. See
further on this vs. ad IX.37.4.

### 03
The phrase “ten tawny ones” (haríto dáśa) helps define the “maidens of Trita”
(tritásya yóṣanaḥ) in the previous vs. as the fingers: “ten” is the giveaway.

### 04
It may be that the adj. mā́nuṣa- here should be rendered more restrictively as
“stemming from Manu,” referring to only those clans that participate in Ārya sacrificial
culture.

### 05
It is tempting to read diváḥ as abl. with áva caṣṭe: “looks down from heaven”;
however, diváḥ śíśuḥ “child of heaven” is found elsewhere (IV.15.6, VI.49.2). It is certainly
possible, however, to read diváḥ with both: “the child of heaven looks down from heaven.”
The word is well positioned to look both left and right.
## 039

### 01
The hymn opens with a mirror-image phonetic figure: āśúr arṣa.
The voc. bṛhanmate ‘having lofty thought’ puns on the name of the poet given in the
Anukramaṇī, Bṛhanmati Āṅgirasa -- or more likely provides the name.
On the direct speech in pāda c of this vs., see publ. intro. The speech itself consists
only of the word devā́ḥ. The place identified by this speech is soma’s goal, where the gods
will partake of it.

### 02
The phrase pariṣkṛṇvánn ániṣkṛtam is not as much of an etymological figure as it
first appears: in the 1st word, the preverb pari is cmpded with the s-mobile form of √kṛ,
while the 2nd is the negated form of the somewhat enigmatic lexeme íṣ + √kṛ (the latter
without s-mobile), on which see comm. ad VII.76.2. As disc. there, the pseudo-preverb íṣ
may derive from the root noun íṣ- ‘refreshment’, and our passage here contains that noun.
The phrase yātáyann íṣaḥ “arranging refreshments” in b functions almost like a paraphrase,
or repair, of the putative phrase íṣ- √kṛ “prepare refreshment” à “put in order, set to
rights.”

### 03
The med. root pres. part. cákṣāṇa- cmpded with ví is found only here. By contrast
the bahuvrīhi vicakṣaṇá- ‘having a wide gaze, wide-gazing’ occurs nearly 20x in Maṇḍala
IX alone (including nearby IX.37.2). The two words are distinguished only by the length of
the penultimate syllable (and accent). The cmpd is found almost entirely pāda-final (either
in Gāyatrī or in Jāgatī), whereas the part. here opens the pāda. However, nothing would
prevent vicakṣaṇáḥ from taking that position, as it indeed does in IX.97.2 (Triṣṭubh), so the
distribution cannot be purely metrical. See also Re.

### 05
The suppressed object of āvívāsan is probably the gods (so already Sāy) or Indra in
particular (supported by pāda c), but there is no reason to supply this obj. in tr.

### 06
As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. forms a notional ring with vs. 1, with both
containing direct speech in a ritual setting in their respective pāda c’s. The speech is more
clearly marked in vs. 1, with íti brávan, than it is here. Both the speaker(s) and the
addressees are also unclear here. It is likely that the former are the officiating priests, the
subjects of the 3rd pl. hinvanti in b and quite possibly of anūṣata in a (so Ge, Lü 602), though
Re thinks rather of the soma drinks. As for the addressees of the 2nd pl. impv. sīdata, I think
the soma drinks are most likely, as in the identical pāda in IX.13.9, which is preceded by a
nom. pl. pávamānāḥ identifying the subject. However, the soma referent in our b pāda is sg.
(hárim) -- though this is not really problematic, given the ubiquitous variation between sg.
and pl. soma(s) in these hymns. However, it could also be addressed to the gods arriving at
the ritual ground (so Sāy), the gods whose location was specified in 1c.
## 040

### 02
Both Ge and Re treat ruhat as modal, parallel to the clear aor. subj. gámat in the
following pāda (e.g., “… soll … besteigen, … soll … gehen”). But ruhat belongs to a clear
them. aor. áruhat, and its zero-grade root syll. would preclude a subjunctive in any case;
formally it must be an injunc. I take the sequence of verbs as referring to different stages of
the ritual process, one that has just occurred, one that will now occur. KH (Injunk. 222) in
fact suggests that the transmitted injunc. ruhat might represents a redactional error
for ’ruhat, an augmented aor. in this sandhi context. Hoffmann’s suggestion of course
results from his idiosyncratic and restrictive views on the function of the injunctive; in my
opinion injunc. ruhat would work fine here as an immed. past, preceding soma’s departure
for Indra. (Maur’s tr. [84] is sim. to mine.)

### 03
The expression asmábhyam … víśvataḥ “for us all around” in b I take as a heavy
specification of enclitic naḥ in Wackernagel’s position in pāda a. Most take víśvataḥ as
qualifying “wealth.” The fact that this pāda (asmábhyaṃ soma víśvataḥ) appears 3x (also
IX.33.6, 65.21) suggests that víśvataḥ goes with ‘us’; on the other hand, that all three
occurrences involve the acquisition of wealth or other good things somewhat undercuts that
argument.
On mahā́m see AiG III.251.

### 04
On subj. 2nd sg. vidā́ḥ see comm. ad IX.19.6. As noted there, I think this is the only
actual example of vidā́ḥ. The other supposed exx. are actually 2nd sg. impv. vidā́with
lengthened final; their sandhi position is ambiguous and so the forms could represent -ā́ḥ as
well as -ā́, and the Pp. analyses them as the former. It is in fact not beyond the realm of
possibility that the original reading here was also *vidā́. An impv. would fit the context
better, with immediately preceding (4b) and following (5a) impv. ā́bhara. It is possible that
the original sequence *vidā́sahasríṇīḥ was interpr. as having a degeminated double -s s-
(*vidā́s s…), which was then restored. The meter would be unaffected. The almost identical
pāda, IX.61.3 kṣárā sahasríṇīr íṣaḥ, is transmitted with an impv. with lengthened final. Note
also impv. vardhayā in 5c. An alt. tr. here would then be “find refreshments …” Curiously,
both Ge and Re tr. as impv., though they register no discomfort with the subjunctive.
## 041
### 01-02
These two vss. are somewhat illuminated by IX.73.4-5, containing some very
similar expressions: 73.4d padé-pade pāśínaḥ santi sétavaḥ “At every step there are snares
that bind”; 73.5bcd … saṃdáhanto avratā́n / … ápa dhamanti … tvácam ásiknīm
“…burning up those who follow no commandment, they blow away … the black skin.” Cf.
also bhū́rṇayaḥ in 73.4b, corresponding to bhū́rṇayaḥ in our 1a, and note also that ápa
dhamanti in 73.5c with “black skin” as its obj. resembles ghnántaḥ … ápa in our 1c, also
with “black skin” as object.

### 01
This vs., consisting entirely of a rel. cl., is not resumed by a main cl. Vs. 2, which
might be configured as the main cl., is couched in the 1st pl., not the 3rd pl. like vs. 1, and it
also has a very different tone. There is no reason, with Re, to supply an anodyne
introductory cl. “(Je chante les soma)” to provide a main cl. -- in fact, the abruptness of the
expression and its incompleteness enhance the sense of violence.
As I indicated in the publ. intro., I think the
unexpressed subj. is the soma juices. Many soma hymns begin with
the soma rushing forth after its pressing, often compared to a horse or a
bull charging; here the soma drinks are also likened to cattle, but stampeding cattle, and this
uncontrollable mob tramples the enemy. So the poet has taken a standard opening trope and
“weaponized” it, as it were.
This enemy is identified as the “black skin” (kṛṣṇā́m … tvácam). For this phrase as a
designation of non-Ārya “without commandments” (avratá-) see I.130.8 and IX.73.5 (in the
latter tvácam ásiknīm; see above). The term avratá- is found in the next vs. (2c).

### 02
As was just noted, avratám in c suggests that this vs. belongs conceptually and
rhetorically with vs. 1, because avratá- elsewhere qualifies those “with black skin.”
However, as I also indicated ad vs. 1, I do not think vs. 2 is the main clause on which the rel.
cl. of vs. 1 is dependent: “we” are not likened to stampeding cattle in vs. 1, but rather the
soma juices are. HPS (Ved. vratá, 94 n. 193) rather trickily suggests taking 2ab as
parenthetic, with c returning to the soma juices of vs. 1, modified by the part. sāhvā́ṃsaḥ. I
see no reason for this: the victory of the soma juices in 1a is reconfigured as our victory.
With Old, Ge, Re I take the gen. suvitásya as the gen. obj. of manāmahe and construe
áti with sétum (contra Gr, who takes it with manāmahe). In IX áti regularly refers to the
journey of the soma “beyond” the filter, which here is represented by sétum. Re cites other
passages containing √man with gen., but it must be admitted that this particular form,
manāmahe, otherwise resolutely takes the acc.
sétu- is found 5x in the RV; its only two occurrences in IX are here and in IX.73.4
cited above. The word does not yet have its later meaning ‘bridge’, but a sense closer to its
root etym. to √sā / si ‘bind’ (with 2ndary full-grade se built to the zero-grade): ‘fetter, bond,
(or here) snare’. Ge and Re instead take it as a dyke or dam (Damm and digue respectively),
but these seem to be an attempt to split the difference between the root etymology and the
later sense ‘bridge’. Certainly in other RVic passages the sense ‘fetter’ vel sim. is
inescapable, e.g. VIII.67.8 mā́naḥ sétuḥ siṣed ayám “Let this fetter here not bind us,” with
cognate verb, where Ge tr. “Fessel.” As for what physical object the sétu- refers to here, I
think it is an image of the twisty curls of a sheep's fleece, which can be seen as fetters or
nooses.
durāvyàm, modifying sétum, is assigned to a stem dur-ā́vya / durā́via by Gr,
misrepresenting the accent, inter alia. As Old points out, however, the stem is really durāvī́-,
a root noun cmpd. (see now Scar 497), and it must mean ‘difficult to pursue / follow’. Since
sétu- here refers to the curls of the sheep’s fleece (in my view), these curls can be conceived
of as the tracks that the liquid would follow as it's being strained through the fleece, tracks
that can be difficult to pursue. So the acc. phrase sétuṃ durāvyàm jams two different but
evocative images into one. Note also that suvitásya … durāv(í)yam is something of a
phonetic figure, with the semantically contrastive adverbial prefixes su and dus, but
different verbal roots (√i and √vī) -- though internal sandhi provides √i with an apparent
initial v matching vī.

### 05
Old takes uṣā́ḥ as acc. pl. (so also AiG III.283) and the object of ā́… pṛṇa in the
simile (so presumably “as the sun [fills] the dawns with its rays”; cf Oberlies Rel.RV I.238).
Although an acc. pl. uṣā́ḥ is morphologically possible (like rare gen. sg. uṣáḥ), the simile
thus produced does not make sense to me, and despite the parade of citations of supposed
parallels that Old provides, no passage has anything remotely like that. I follow Ge in taking
uṣā́ḥ and sū́ryaḥ as parallel nom. sg., both participating in the simile. Re seems to take as
nom., but pl., for no obvious reason.

### 06
The last pāda begins with a mirror-image figure: sárā rasā́, though the last vowel is
obscured in sandhi: raséva.
## 042

### 01
Like the 1st vs. of the last hymn, also by Medhyātithi Kāṇva, this vs. is syntactically
incomplete -- unless we want to take the pres. participles (janáyan a, b; vásānaḥ c) as
predicated, which in this case I don’t. In this case, vs. 2 can easily pick up the participial vs.
1 and provide a predicate.

### 03
Acdg. to Kü (471), the medial part. of the pf. of √vṛdh is always presential, though
both Ge and Re tr. as preterital. My “ever-increasing” makes it sound like an inten., but of
course the heavy redupl. vā- simply belongs to the pf. of this root.
Note the v-alliteration in ab: vāvṛdhānā́ya tū́rvaye pávante vā́jasātaye.

### 04
The adj. pratná- ‘age-old’ is repeated here from 2a, linking the “age-old thought”
(= hymn) with soma’s “age-old milk.”
p-alliteration in ab: … pratnám ít páyaḥ pavítre pári …

### 05
Somewhat less insistent v-alliteration: víśvāni vā́ryā … devā́m̐ṛtāvṛ́dhaḥ.

### 06
This vs. contains almost the same elements as IX.41.4. Our desired rewards are
gómat, vīrávat, áśvāvat, vā́javat, which match 41.4 except that híraṇyavat substitutes for
vīrávat there. We also want bṛhatī́r íṣaḥ, like the mahī́m íṣam of 41.4. The soma is described
as sutáḥ in both, though the vocatives are different: indo versus soma. But the big difference
is that 41.4 has the preverb ā́with pavasva, which licenses the accusative complements,
while our passage does not. We must simply supply it here, I’m afraid.
## 043

### 01
The phonological near-identity of instr. pl. góbhiḥ and gīrbhíḥ allows them to be
conceptually assimilated to each other, and note that vāsáya- ‘clothe’ is frequently also used
with góbhiḥ: e.g., IX.8.5 sáṃ góbhir vāsayāmasi (also IX.2.4, 14.3, 66.13).

### 02
gíraḥ … pūrváthā “hymns in the ancient way” is reminiscent of 42.2 pratnéna
mánmanā “with the age-old thought.”

### 03
Medhyātithi’s signature. Mention of the poet’s name is a relative rarity in the
Gāyatrī hymns of IX, acdg. to Oberlies (Rel.RV I.549).

### 04
On vidā́versus vidā́(ḥ), see comm. ad IX.19.6.
## 044

### 01
mahé táne “for great extension” is found also in VIII.26.2, 46.25, where it appears
to refer to the extension of the family line. This is possible here, esp. if naḥ is construed
with it, as in the publ. tr. Ge suggests that it refers to the extension of lifetime (“zu grosser
Lebensdauer(?)”) and Re to the ritual continuum, but as Re points out in his n., it could also
simply describe, physically, the extension of the stream of soma. If that interpr. is chosen,
the tr. should de-couple naḥ from the phrase: “… rush forth for us for (your) great
extension.”
The referent of the simile ūrmíṃ ná bíbhrat is suggested by IX.96.7 ūrmíṃ ná
síndhuḥ.

### 02
The stem juṣtá- with expected ppl. accent occurs only here in the RV, beside wellattested júṣṭa- with unexpected root accent. The latter form is generally construed with the
dative of the beneficiary (“enjoyable to X”), save for the late X.125.5 (Vāc) júṣṭaṃ devébhir
utá mā́nuṣebhiḥ (though this phrase has a traditional ring), with instr. as here.
The usual uncertainty about the root affiliation of hitá- in IX: to √hi ‘impel’ or √dhā
‘place’? See disc. ad IX.1.2, etc. On the basis of finite hinve in the next pāda, undeniably
belonging to √hi, one could argue either way: as a root repetition or as a pun. Both Ge and
Re take it to √hi, the latter with some disc. in his n.; I concur, primarily because of phrases
like dhiyéṣitá- (I.3.5, III.12.1, 60.5, 62.12) ‘sent by the thought’, dhiyā́jūtá- (IX.64.16) ‘sped
by the thought’, even though the doubling of ‘impelled’ seems crude for a RVic poet.
Ge and Re also construe víprasya with dhā́rayā (e.g., “grâce à la coulée du (prêtre)-
inspiré”). In the publ. tr. I instead take it with the two types of speech in pāda a, matí- and
dhī́- and assume that it has been displaced to c in order to contrast with kavíḥ, referring to
Soma there. In favor of this interpr. is the fact that the very common instr. dhā́rayā
generally appears alone and refers to the physical stream of the soma liquid, not
metaphorically to words or the like. However, the identical pāda IX.12.8c gives me pause,
as in that vs. there is no alternative way of construing víprasya except with dhā́rayā. I think
it possible that IX.12.8 is a clumsy borrowing of this pāda, but see comm. ad loc., where I
consider the possibility that there is a way to interpret víprasya dhā́rayā phrasally.

### 04
In b I take the mid. part. cakrāṇáḥ with a self-beneficial / reflexive sense, contra Ge
and Re.
With Ge I take the subj. of c to be the priest, not Soma with Re.

### 05
The first hemistich has no finite verb. Ge somewhat arbitrarily supplies a verb
(“empfehlen”) with which to construe the two datives bhágāya vāyáve. If we are to supply a
verb, it seems best to be guided by the context in which pāda a is repeated, in IX.61.9a,
where the following pāda contains pavasva. Re’s “(qu’il se clarifie)” seems to reflect this,
though he does not mention the repeated pāda in his n., where he suggests other
possibilities. (That pavasva appears in the immediately preceding vs. 4 in our hymn might
also support supplying it here.) The publ. tr. simply takes ab as a nominal expression, with
the datives of pāda a construed with sadā́vṛdhaḥ ‘growing ever stronger’. The drawback to
my interpr. (and to Re’s) is that there’s no clear function for naḥ, which both Re and I fail to
tr. in its hemistich (Ge uses it as object of “empfehlen”). I take naḥ as the fronted
Wackernagel-position obj. of ā́yamat in c, assuming that the whole vs. is a single clause.
Ge’s rendering of vípravīra- as “der die Männer beredt macht” cavalierly ignores
both accent and the morphology of the first member. It must rather be a bahuvrīhi, as the
publ. tr. and Re’s “qui a pour hommes-utiles les orateurs” recognize.
## 045

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., nṛcákṣā in b may form a ring with vicákṣase in 6b, the
last vs. of the hymn. For similar phraseology within a single vs., cf. IX.86.23 tváṃ nr̥cákṣā
abhavo vicakṣaṇa. nṛcákṣā also resonates thematically with the following devávītaye, with
the nṛ- devá- contrast.

### 02
The word order in this vs. is quite jumbled, and there are several alternative ways
to try to fix it. The one taken by the publ. tr. follows Ge in taking pāda b as parenthetic.
Unlike Ge’s tr. (though it is the 2nd alt. in his n. 2c), the publ. tr. uses this strategy to allow
devā́n in c to be the goal of the verb in a (arṣā́bhí); cf. nearby IX.42.5 abhí viśvāni vā́ryā,
abhí devā́n ... arṣati and in the immed. preceding hymn IX.44.1bc ... arṣasi / abhí devā́n,
where the verb ends the hemistich and the preverb begins the next pāda, both reasonable
positions for those elements. The latter passage (by the same poet as ours) might help
explain the postposed preverb in the middle of the pāda here: sá no arṣābhí …, which is
otherwise odd.
However, taking devā́n as goal still leaves the rest of pāda c, … sákhibhya ā́váram,
unaccounted for. In the publ. tr. I take the sákhibhyaḥ as dat. doubling naḥ in a, with an
independent adverbial ā́váram “at will” (which, however, is usually in the opposite order
váram ā́). But this ignores the striking parallel cited by both Ge and Re, I.4.4 yás te
sákhibhya ā́váram (and cf. II.5.5 … tisrbhya ̥́ ā́váram), rendered in the publ. tr. as “who is
your choice from among your comrades.” Although it is always possible that the parallel is
a false one, I now think I cannot ignore it and I suggest that this phrase provides a second
goal to arṣā́bhí, with sákhibhya ā́váram to be construed together (as in I.4.4) referring to
Indra, who was mentioned in the parenthetic pāda b. (Indra is also the referent in I.4.4.)
Indra is of course soma’s particular target among the gods, the best drinker of soma. I would
now take this phrase as specifying soma’s goal of choice: the juice rushes to the gods, but
esp. to Indra - and would alter the tr. to “rush to the gods, to your choice [=Indra] from
among the comrades,” with sákhibhyaḥ referring to the gods in general. Although sákhi- in
IX generally refers to poets or hymans in general (cf., e.g., IX.97.43), the ABL ā́váram
idiom could overrule this. This interpr. unfortunately requires (or at least suggests) that
sákhāyaḥ in vs. 5 has a different referent.

### 04
I am not certain what the simile depicts, what it means for a horse to “step beyond
the chariot-pole (dhúr-).” Re suggests that the dhúr- is being used here as a pole to mark the
limit of the racecourse, but I do not know of another example of dhúr- in this sense. It’s
possible that the simile depicts the moment when, as a horse is starting to pull a chariot, it's
been hanging back from its tackle and now it pulls on it and pushes beyond it, but my
ignorance about the interaction between horses and their tackle makes this interpr.
uncertain. Note also that dhúram here phonetically echoes dúraḥ ‘doors’ in 3c.

### 05
As noted ad 2c, if we take sákhibhyaḥ there as referring to the gods, sákhāyaḥ here
is probably not picking up that referent, but likely refers to the human poets.

### 06
Both Ge and Re take vicákṣase as transitive ‘reveal’, but as Re notes, ví √cakṣ is
ordinarily intransitive, and I see no reason to willfully ignore this usage. As noted in the
publ. intro., the verb forms a ring with nṛcákṣāḥ in 1b.
## 046

### 01
Note the unusual position of iva after the full simile, not its first word.

### 02
The simile “adorned like a maiden with her patrimony” (páriṣkṛtāsaḥ … yóṣeva
pítryā́vatī) is presumably the first mention in Sanskrit of the major source of strīdhana or
‘women’s property’ listed in the dharma lit., namely what a bride receives at her wedding,
esp. from “mother, brother(s), and father” (see Manu IX.194, though there the wedding is
divided into two phases and the property from her three types of natal relatives is counted
separately, adding up to five of the six types of strīdhana). Since these gifts would take the
form of jewelry - and since the bride would be especially dressed up for her wedding -- the
simile here highlights the special sparkling appearance of the soma juices. Alternatively this
might be a reference to the institution of the putrikā or “appointed daughter,” who in the
absence of sons is made the virtual son and heir of her father, with any children she bears
owing their ancestral offerings to him rather than to their paternal grandfather. Oberlies
(Relig. RV I.522) calls the maiden in this passage an Erbtochter and seems to be thinking of
this institution, and Re may be as well, though his comment (“le *pitrya ou héritage paternal
pouvait donc revenir à la fille”) is vague and may reflect a lack of knowledge of the
standard sources on strīdhana. I think the “adorned bride” interpr. is far more likely and fits
the ritual situation better.

### 03
With Ge and Re, I take kármabhiḥ as referring to the various ritual acts at the Soma
Sacrifice. Oberlies (Relig.RV I.534) instead sees these as Indra’s deeds, after the weakened
god has been reinvigorated by soma: “… lassen den Indra mit [=zu] seinen Taten wachsen.”
This seems farfetched to me, given how frequently forms of √kṛ are used for ritual activity.

### 04
Old is inclined, flg. BR, to emend voc. suhasti
yaḥ to *suhasti
yāḥ, derived from the
stem suhásti
ya-, hence a masc. nom. pl. referring to the priestly officiants. Re follows him,
remarking rather scornfully “il est peu probable que l’auteur ait voulu désigner par ce Voc.
… des entités féminines, à la rigueur toutefois les « doigts ».” But see Ge’s quite sensible n.
suggesting that the fem. refers to the fingers, which are frequently assigned ritual agency in
the IXth Maṇḍala. Note that the ten fingers (dáśa kṣípaḥ) explicitly occur two vss. later (6b).
śukrā́… manthínā is a discontinuous dual dvandva. The phraseology matches
III.32.2 gávāśiram manthínam ... śukrám ... sómam; cf. góbhiḥ śrīṇīta in c.
## 047

### 01
Both Ge and Re take maháḥ as a nom. sg. masc. to them. mahá- (so also Gr),
referring to Soma. With immed. flg. cid the phrase is taken as “already great” (“schon so
grosse,” “si grand (fût-il déjà)”), as an implicit contrast with the verb, (abhy) ávardhata,
which indicates that he has grown (further) despite his already large size. This if of course
possible. By contrast I take maháḥ as acc. pl. m. to máh-. My reason for this is the preverb
abhí: in the few occurrences of abhí √vṛdh, the lexeme takes an acc. complement even in
the middle. Cf. II.17.4 víśvā bhúvanābhí … abhy ávardhata “he [=Indra] grew strong over
all the worlds.” As to who or what these great ones are, perhaps the gods, since the phrase
mahó devā́n is not uncommon. Given that Soma here is being assimilated to Indra - who is
the standard subject of both mandāná- (I.80.6, etc. etc.) and vṛṣāyáte (cf., e.g., IX.108.2) -
asserting his mastery over the (other) gods wouldn’t be surprising.

### 04
On the disputed interpr. of vidhartári, see comm. ad VIII.70.2. As I disc. there, I
interpr. the form not as an infinitive (with many), but as the loc. of the agent noun that it is
morphologically. Here I envisage Soma in the role of a facilitator: he wants the vípra
(presumably the human poet) to get a dakṣiṇā from the patron (/apportioner: vidhartár-),
and sets about making that happen.
In c yádī is much better read yád ī, with the enclitic acc. prn. ī doubling the obj.
dhíyaḥ. It is difficult to construct an “if” reading.
The subj. of marmrjyáte is unspecified and unclear; it could either be Soma as kaví or
the human vípra - or both.

### 05
This vs. has a number of difficulties, both morphologically and syntactically. The
most immediate is the first word siṣāsátū (Pp. rightly siṣāsátuḥ). Gr takes it as a nom. sg. m.
adj. built to the desid. (so already Sāy.; cf. AiG II.2.667), fld by Old, Re, and the publ tr.; the
alternative solution is to interpr. it as a 3rd dual perfect-like form built to the desid., as
suggested by Ludwig, fld. by Ge (see his n. 5a), Ober. (Relig. RV I.537), and Heenen
(Desid. 239 + n. 264). I would be more sympathetic to the du. pf. interpr. if there were a
clear way to get a dual subject. But the only indication of a subject in this vs. is contained in
the 2nd sg. asi at the end of the vs., and the attempt of Ge et al. to invent a dual subject is
exceptionally clumsy: by their interpr. Soma, the 2nd sg. referent in asi, is on one side or
faction, and there is another side that ought implicitly to contrast with Soma’s side, but
somehow doesn’t in his tr. Acdg to Ge, the two sides are racehorses (árvant- in b) and
“Beutemacher” (the victors in raids in c). Since the putative desiderative pf. is already
anomalous, the contextual melt-down and the multiplying of invisible actors make this an
unattractive solution. So, better to deal with the alternative morphological anomaly, a
desiderative adj. in -tu- apparently formed to the desid. verbal stem; this adj., as a singular,
can easily qualify the sg. subj. of asi. Debrunner (II.2.666-67) cites a few such forms in -tuthat could be associated with a them. pres. stem (though all with suffixal accent, i.e., -tú-).
He suggests that our form is an Ersatz for the -u-adj. siṣāsú- (1x I.102.6), and this seems to
me the right path to take, though the details aren’t clear. I would tentatively suggest that it is
a blend - or, perhaps better, a remarking - of the two verbal adj. suffixes available to
desiderative stems: the normal pres. part. act. in -ant-, well attested to this stem (síṣāsant-, -
at-), and the verbal adj. suffix -u- specific to the desid. (as in siṣāsú- just cited). It might be
possible to image the addition of the -u-suffix to the weak form of the pres. part. śiṣāsat-.
Unfortunately this founders on the accent, which cannot easily be explained; this is the only
advantage of the pf. du. explanation, which would have the correct accent.
Even assuming that siṣāsátuḥ is a desiderative adj., construed with gen. rayīṇā́m in
the same pāda, we are not out of the woods, and I am not satisfied with the publ. tr. or with
the suggested tr. of Old and Re. The three pādas of the vs. have an apparently parallel
structure, esp. the last two. All three contain a gen. pl. - rayīṇā́m ‘of riches’ (a), árvatām ‘of
chargers’ (b), and jigyúṣām ‘of winners’ (c); the last two pādas also contain loc. pls., vā́jeṣu
‘at prize contests’ (b) and bháreṣu ‘at raids’ (c). Pāda b is also marked as a simile, with the
simile marker iva following the whole simile, not the first word (as also in the last hymn,
IX.46.1b). Are all three pādas truly parallel - and in particular should siṣāsatúḥ be
understood in b and c, as in a, where it governs rayīṇā́m? Both Old and Re understand
siṣāsatúḥ with all three pādas, but take the genitives of b and c in datival function
(identifying the groups for which Soma wishes to win riches), not parallel to rayīṇā́m. Cf.
“Du bist der Erstreber von Reichtümern, wie für die Renner beim Gewinn der Preise, (so)
für die Sieger in den bhára.” This neatly solves the problem that the gen. pl.s of b and c
refer not to a substance (wealth) one might strive to win, but to animate beings that might be
striving to win it themselves, so the morphologically parallel forms do not seem to be
semantically or functionally parallel. My own solution in the publ. tr. is, I now see,
considerably inferior to the Old/Re one: I take b with a, but not c, making ‘chargers’ a
substance Soma seeks to win and also eliding the simile. I would now reject this interpr. For
c in the publ. tr. I made the gen. pl a partitive: “you are among those / (one) of those who are
victorious …” Although this interpr. seems a little artificial, I think it’s possible, and I
would now interpr. b in the same way - with the whole vs. meaning “Desirous of winning
riches, you are (one) of those who are victorious in the raids, as if (you were one) of the
chargers at prize-contents.” Alternatively, I would substitute a version of Old/Re: “You seek
to win riches for those who are victorious at raids, as if for coursers at prize-contests,”
though this seems more awkward.
In any case, the vs. is problematic on several counts and I doubt that any of the
suggested interpr. captures the poet’s intent.
.
## 048
As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 3-4 concern the stealing of Soma from heaven
(“Somaraub”), a story not otherwise characteristic of IX but treated in detail in IV.26-27. I
now think it possible that vss. 1-2 also allude to the same myth, though very obliquely.
Details in the comm. to the relevant vss. Our poet, Kavi Bhārgava, also treats this myth in
IX.77, one of his Jagatī hymns.

### 01
Ge and Re take cā́rum as referring to Soma, as it, admittedly, often does. I interpr.
it rather as a 2nd obj. of īmahe (√yā / ī ‘implore, beg for’. (Ge takes the verb to √yā ‘go’
[“nahen wir”], while Re takes it to ‘implore’, but with a single obj.) Either interpr. is
possible; I find myself more sympathetic to that of Ge/Re than I originally was, though I am
far from disavowing the publ. tr.
The possible allusion to the Somaraub in this vs. is quite muted, but I wonder if the
depiction of Soma “bearing his manly powers among the seats of great heaven”
(sadhástheṣu mahó diváḥ) could refer to Soma when he is being kept captive in heaven in
the myth. A very slight piece of evidence for this is that Kṛśānu, the archer in the Somaraub
story (see IV.27.3), is located sadhástha ā́“in the seat” in X.64.8, but I would put little or no
weight on this.

### 02
This vs. is couched in the acc. and entirely dependent on vs. 1, qualifying Soma.
Contra Gr, the cmpd sáṃvṛkta-dhṛṣṇu- must be a bahuvrīhi; cf. esp. Old and Scar
(504).
The cmpd mahā́mahivrata- is unusual in having three members, esp. since the first
two are etym. identical. With AiG II.1.236 it’s best to take mahā́as ‘very’ (cf. also Schmidt,
vrata p. 100).
There is somewhat stronger evidence for a Somaraub connection in this vs. than in
vs. 1. In particular Soma is said to be “eager to break a hundred strongholds” (śatám púro
rurukṣáṇim); in IV.27.1 these same (or similar) strongholds guarded him (śatám mā púra
ā́yasīr arakṣan) before he was rescued, and so he would be eager to break out of them. Note
the phonological similarity between arakṣan and rurukṣáṇim; the latter is a hapax, with in
fact no other desid. forms built to the root √ruj elsewhere in Skt., so the echo may have
been deliberately constructed.
If pāda c refers to Soma’s desire to break out of confinement, it’s possible that
sáṃvṛkta-dhṛṣṇu- also refers to this confinement: ‘having his bold(ness) encoiled’, with
dhrṣṇu a quality of Soma - rather than my original interpr., that Soma had encoiled the
dhṛṣṇú- of another. Note that Soma is qualifed by dhṛṣṇú- in the immediately preceding
hymn (IX.47.2). The use of the idiom sáṃvṛkta- ‘encoiled, encircled’ could reflect the
circular fortresses.
A connection between the 100 strongholds in this vs. and the explicit Somaraub
allusion in the next vs. was suggested by Hilldebrandt, but unfortunately rejected by Old—
too fastidiously I think.

### 03
The átaḥ ‘from there’ that begins this vs. was used by Hillebrandt as evidence for
the mythological connection between vss. 2 and 3, persuasively in my view, contra Old.
### 03-04
The phrases suparṇáḥ … bharat (3c) “the falcon brought” and vír bharat (4c)
“the bird brought” are directly reminiscent of IV.26, where the 3rd sg. (a)bharat occurs 4x
in 4 vss. (4-7), incl. 4cd suparṇáḥ … bhárat and 5a bhárat … víḥ, with the same subjects as
here.
## 049

### 01
The first pāda of this vs. (pávasva vṛṣṭím ā́sú naḥ) seems syntactically backward,
in that we might expect ā́sú naḥ to open the clause. A cursory glance through the sú
passages in Lub does not turn up a similarly egregious deviation from left periphery
behavior. The solution arises from reading the expression in light of 3c, asmábhyaṃ vṛṣṭím ā́
pava, which is an exact paraphrase with flipped word order. The full dative pronoun
asmábhyam takes initial position there, while its enclitic equivalent naḥ is final in our pāda;
the verbs occupy the opposite positions: initial in 1a, final in 3c. The obj. vṛṣṭím is
identically positioned in the center of the two verses. In 3c the preverb ā̇́is more normally
positioned than here, right before the verb (… ā́pava), but, on the other hand, the verb there
is morphologically quite anomalous. Thus both pādas have something wrong with them, but
their aberrancies can be understood with reference to each other.

### 02
The intent of this vs. is pretty clear, though the expression is a bit contorted:
presumably our offering of soma will bring cows as a reward, but how the cows will come
“by a stream” of purified soma is unclear. I imagine them in single file, but I don’t think
that’s what’s meant.
The adj. qualifying cows, jánya-, is generally interpr. as pregnantly ‘belonging to
other people’ (Ge “die Rinder anderer Leute,” Re “les vaches de l’étranger,” enshrined in
Gr’s gloss 2a ‘fremden Leuten ausgehend’), but as I disc. ad IV.55.5, in all clear passages
jánya- means ‘stemming from one’s own people’. Here it may be proleptic: cows will come
here that will by virtue of coming here belong to us.
Note that úpa naḥ is somewhat displaced, though not as much as ā́sú naḥ in 1a.

### 03
On c see the disc. ad vs. 1. The verb here, 2nd sg. impv. (ā́) pava, is the only act.
form to this extraordinarily well-attested Class 1 pres. stem and is obviously truncated from
pávasva, in order to fit this exact paraphrase of 1a (see comm. above) into the allotted
syllables (asmábhyam being a syllable-hog compared to naḥ). It may help that dhāva in 4b is
almost a rhyme. Like many morphological anomalies, pava can be accounted for through
sensitivity to the larger context.

### 05
rocáyan rúcaḥ is a nice cognate acc. construction.
## 050

### 01
The b pāda consists of a single simile; as in nearby IX.46.1b and IX.47.5b, the
simile particle iva occurs after the 2nd word in the simile, not the 1st - though here the
simile consists of 3 words and so iva is non-final.
The c pāda contains a bold image: “spur on the wheelrim of the music” (vāṇásya
codayā pavím). Perhaps not surprisingly, both Ge and Re flatten the image by redefining the
verb and one or both of the nouns. Ge’s “Schärfe die Spitze der Rede (des Pfeils)” takes
paví- as ‘point’, though in all clear cases it refers to a part of a chariot wheel (see EWA s.v.
and Sparreboom, Chariot p. 131 with lit.), the tire or wheel rim, while the verb codayā
means ‘impel, spur on’, not ‘sharpen’. His alternative ‘Pfeil’ assumes that vāṇá- is a variant
of bāṇá- ‘dart’. Re’s “Aiguisse la pointe de la parole-rhythmé” follows Ge; he justifies
‘sharpen’ with ref. to IX.17.5, but the verb there also means ‘spur on’ and has (in my view)
speech as obj. Old is having none of this: he sensibly and firmly says that √cud is esp.
common of the impelling of a chariot [this is not entirely true] and he sees no reason to take
paví- in anything but its usual sense. To explain the image he suggests that the operation
(that is, presumably the playing) of the vāṇá-, which he takes as a musical instrument, is
conceived of like the driving of a chariot, whose wheel is therefore being metaphorically
impelled. This seems correct in its main outlines. The image blends the concrete (the
chariot) and the metaphorical (music), both potential objects of √cud, in a phrase with the
latter as dependent genitive. For √cud + ‘chariot’, cf. X.29.8 rátham … yám .. codáyāse; the
substitution of paví- is simply part for the whole. As for √cud + ‘speech’ (vel sim.), cf., e.g.,
III.62.10 dhíyo yó naḥ pracodáyāt.

### 02
The first two pādas of this vs. vary and further specify the opening image in vs. 1 út
te śúṣmāsa īrate, with the same verbal lexeme though no longer in tmesis (prasavé ta úd
īrate#) and the identification of the sound that rises as “three voices” (tisró vā́caḥ). The loc.
prasavé ‘at your stimulus’ can also be seen as a semantic version of codayā ‘spur on’ in 1c.
The three voices, found also in this same context in IX.33.4, are either the voices of
the three priests, Hotar, Adhvaryu, and Udgātar, or their three types of ritual speech, ṛc,
yajus, and sāman.
Both Ge and Re take makhasyú- in the realm of gifts and bounty: “eine Gabe
heischend” and “généreuses” respectively. I consider it a pun, referring both to combat and
to bounty. Interestingly, for the most part within IX, derivatives of makhá- are associated
with vā́c-: besides this one, IX.64.26 vā́cam … makhasyúvam and IX.101.5 vācás pátir
makhasyate. Here it could refer to some sort of competition among the three voices/priests
in addition to the association of ritual activity with bounties.

### 03
Just as vs. 2 picks up and varies vs. 1, vs. 3 chains with vs. 2: the loc. “on the
sheep’s back” (ávye … sā́navi) of 2c is immediately followed by “on the sheep’s fleece”
(ávyo vā́re). Given the sandhi of the first ‘sheep’ (ávya éṣi) and the juxtaposition of the two
phrases, one might at first consider going against the Pp in 2c to read ávyaḥ, matching the
same apparent form in 3a, However, it is a curious fact of the morphology of these formulae
that the loc. phrase containing ‘back’ (sā́navi, sā́no) always has the loc. ávye to the ‘sheep’
adj. ávya-, while the phrase containing vā́ra- ‘fleece’ always has the gen. ávyaḥ to the
‘sheep’ noun ávi-. To capture this the tr. of the two phrases in vss. 2-3 should be switched:
“on the sheep’s back” and “on the fleece of the sheep” - though this is hardly a momentous
change.

### 04
It is possible to see 4 as chaining with 3: 3c pávamānam, 4a ā́pavasva, though the
ubiquity of the páva- stem makes this unremarkable even if true.
On ā́pavasva … pavítram see disc. ad IX.70.10.

### 05
The first pāda, sá pavasva madintama, is almost identical to 4a ā́pavasva
madintama. This is somewhat reminiscent of the near identity of 1a and 2a.
As noted in the publ. intro., I consider aktúbhiḥ a pun. The first reading would be as
etym. figure with añjānáḥ ‘being anointed’; cf. III.17.1 aktúbhir ajyate, VI.69.3 añjantv
aktúbhiḥ. But well-attested aktúbhiḥ is otherwise a temporal designation, ‘with/through the
nights’, e.g., I.50.7 áhā mímāno aktúbhiḥ “measuring the days with the nights.” In this case
perhaps it would refer to the Atirātra soma sacrifice.
## 051

### 02
The ritual impv. here, sunótā ‘press!’, is in the 2nd plural and therefore contrasts
with the singular punīhí ‘purify!’in 1c, though they occupy the same slot in the vs. The subj.
of the impv. in vs. 1 is the Adhvaryu (voc. ádhvaryo), while the priestly subjects here are
unspecified.

### 03
I assume the gods in b are a different and more inclusive group than the Maruts in
c, though devā́ḥ could just anticipate marútaḥ.

### 04
The publ. tr. takes the pres. part. vardháyan as the predicate of the vs., though it
might be possible to take sutáḥ instead (“You, the strengthening one, are pressed …”).
Although a predicated ppl. sutáḥ would better conform to RVic syntactic patterns,
predicating the pres. part. seems to produce better sense: it provides the reason why the gods
(and) the Maruts consume soma in vs. 3.
## 052

### 01
As was pointed out in the publ. intro., two parallel governing compounds, sanádrayiḥ 'gaining wealth' (1a) and maṃhayád-rayiḥ 'readying wealth' (5c), open and close the
hymn. The former also resonates with the adjacent expression across the pāda boundary,
bhárad vā́jam. This phrase cannot help but remind us of the personal name bharádvāja-,
which is of course in form also a governing cmpd. This stem is primarily confined to
Maṇḍala VI, which is attributed to this ṛṣi and his family, but it would surely be known
throughout RVic circles. Note also that some vss. and hymns in IX are attributed by the
Anukramaṇī to Bharadvāja or a Bhāradvāja: Bharadvāja IX.67.1-3, Vasu Bhāradvāja
IX.80-82, Ṛjiśvan Bhāradvāja IX.98 (jointly with Ambarīṣa Vārṣāṅgira), 108.6-7.
The grammatical identify of the bhárat part of this phrase can be questioned. The
standard view (Gr, Ge, Re, Lub, KH [Injunk. 123], Lowe [Partic. 281]) is that it is a 3rd sg.
injunc., with Soma as its subj. This requires a shift of ps. from 3rd (ab) to 2nd (c), given the
2nd sg. impv. arṣa in c. Of course such switches, even within a vs., are common. But it is
made somewhat more difficult by the preverb pári, which opens the vs. and would most
naturally be construed with arṣa, a point also made by Old. Of the numerous pári √ṛṣ
passages in IX, cf., e.g., IX.69.2 … pári vā́ram arṣati. By contrast pári is barely attested
with √bhṛ and then only with middle forms, as far as I can see. If pári (in a) is in tmesis
with arṣa (in c), a finite verb in between (that is, putative bhárat in b) would have to be
parenthetic at best. Re’s attempt to have it both ways (“pári porte sur arṣa … à travers
bhárat”) simply shows the desperation required. I therefore follow Old, as well as AiG
II.2.164, in taking bhárat as a form of the pres. part. bhárant-. Both Old and AiG consider it
a neut. sg. (which it is of course in form) used adverbially, but as Old acutely remarks, an
adverb taking an object is problematic. I would analyze it slightly differently: in order to
produce a phrase modeled on the cmpd bharád-vāja- (AiG also evokes the PN here), the
poet used the weak (neut.) form to stand for the nom. sg. masc. (expected *bháran). In this
he would be supported by the well-attested nom. sg. of the redupl. pres. bíbharti, namely
bíbhrat built to the weak stem of the participle, which serves for both masc. and neut.
Maṇḍala IX contains several occurrences of this form; cf. for the phraseology here IX.44.1
… bíbhrad arṣasi. I also find suggestive the two exx. of bíbhrad vájram (VI.20.9, 23.1)
“bearing the mace,” with vájram a phonological multiform of vā́jam; since these are both in
the Bharadvāja maṇḍala, they are likely meant to evoke that name. See comm. ad VI.20.9.

### 02
The apparent 2nd ps. / 3rd ps. switch recurs in more acute form here. The vs. opens
with 2nd ps. táva, which surely refers to Soma, but the finite verb in this single-clause vs. is
(apparently) yā̛t, a 3rd sg. One solution is to substitute a slightly different subj. in place of
Soma - so Ge, flg. Sāy., who suggests rásaḥ ‘sap’ (sim. Ober. II.231). Another is simply to
ignore the problem, as Re and the publ. tr. do. I don’t have a solution (beyond the just
mentioned avoidance of the issue), but I somehow think that the isolated and minimalist yāt,
the only supposed injunctive to this well-attested root pres., is perhaps the artificial result of
formulaic cut-and-paste. As Ge (2c) points out, our pāda sahásradhāro yāt tánā is
reminiscent of IX.34.1 (prá svānó) dhā́rayā tánā, and in fact tánā quite often follows -ā. If
our pāda was somehow based on one containing the very well-attested instr. dhāráyā, but
with the substitution of the nom. bahuvrīhi sahásra-dhāra-, the final -yā of the underlying
instr. would get detached: x x x *dhāráyā tánā à sahásradhāro *yā tánā, and then this
truncated form could have been given morphological identity by extruding (geminating) a t
from the initial of tánā (*yā tánā à yāt tánā), with no metrical implications. On geminations
and degeminations in the RV, see my several forthcoming articles. However, even I find this
explanation overly tricky, and it also deprives the vs. of a verb (though arṣa could be
supplied from the preceding vs.), so I do not push this possibility strongly.

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., the “pot” that is to be kicked is mostly likely an stingy
patron, as Ge suggests. The whole vs. has a slangy and informal feel.
The problematic pāda is b. On the one hand, if we take the voc. indo seriously, this
leaves ná badly positioned for a simile marker: it should follow dā́nam. But if dā́nam is
supposed to be a simile, the expression is pretty slack: if dā́nam is ‘gift’, we want Soma to
push the gift itself, not something compared to a gift. For both reasons Ge suggests that ná
marks not a standard simile but an Utprekṣā, and, even so, that ná is in the wrong position.
Re’s tr. seems to follow this view, though it’s somewhat hard to square with his comm. Old
suggests emending indo to índro, which allows ná to be properly positioned for a simile and
also produces a reasonable, if not particularly interesting simile, “give (him/it) a shove, as
Indra (does) a gift.” My solution is quite different and, once again, perhaps over-tricky, but I
think it captures the tone of the vs. better. I take dā́na- not as ‘gift’, but rather as the med.
root aor. participle to √dā ‘give’. The immediate problem with this is, of course, that that
form should rather be accented *dāná-. But given that the RV attests both dā́na- and dānámeaning ‘gift, giving’, sometimes in parallel formations (e.g., VI.53.3 dā́nāya codaya versus
VIII.99.4 dānā́ya codáyan), it would not be surprising if the accent had been changed
redactionally to match dā́na-, which stem accounts for most of the acc. sg. forms (cf. esp.
dā́nam ínvati I.128.5, dā́nam ínvan V.30.7). As for the sense, although medial forms of √dā
are rare outside of the idiom ā́√dā ‘take’, those that occur seem to mean ‘give of oneself /
one’s own store’; cf. V.33.9 sahásrā me cyávatāno dádānaḥ “(when) Cyavatāna was giving
a thousand of his own to me.” Taking dā́nam as a participle referring to the stingy patron of
pāda a allows ná to be a negative and therefore properly positioned.

### 04
The main cl. of ab lacks a finite verb; the preverb ní suggests several possibilities.
Ge supplies tira on the basis of IX.19.7 ní śúṣmam ... tira (his “halte,” my “undermine”),
which is certainly possible. However, on the basis of nijaghní- in the next hymn, IX.53.2, as
well as the two forms of √vadh in the immediately preceding vs. (52.3 vadhaír vadhasno), I
prefer a form of ní √han (/ √vadh). Nothing depends on the choice, as long as the intent is
hostile.
Ge construes jánānām in b with voc. púruhūta “du vielgerufener der Menschen,”
which may be correct, given IX.64.27 as well as the nom. phrase puruhūtó jánānām in
IX.87.6. (I therefore entertain the alt. tr. “o much invoked of the people.”) But on that basis
he should construe eṣām in a with the same voc., since IX.64.27 has the same phrase, …
eṣām, púruhūta jánānām, where there is no other obvious way to interpret it and Ge takes
the eṣām with jánānām. But here he construes eṣām separately, with śúṣmam. Both Re and I
take both genitives with that noun, IX.64.27 notwithstanding.
All of us must face the problem that the rel. cl. in c, which most naturally refers to
the blustering people of ab, is in the sg. (yáḥ … ādídeśati). This must simply be a
constructio ad sensum, or rather the picking out of a particular referent in the group of
hostile men mentioned in ab.

### 05
The two numbers in ab, śatám and sahásram, participate in meaningless syntactic
variation. Both must ultimately express an instrumental relationship to the verb; in the first
the instr. is directly expressed by ūtíbhiḥ, but in the 2nd the instr. must be assumed (“[with]
a thousand”) and the enumerated substance is expressed by a partitive genitive. It’s a clever
little slippage and barely noticeable. See Old’s disc.

### 53-60  
The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas
(IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them
contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a
unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.
IX.53-57. Old tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate,
but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.
## 053
On the rhetorical indirection in this hymn, see publ. intro. as well as more detailed
comments below.

### 01
The first pāda of this vs. lacks a syllable. It is also identical, save for the last word,
the verb, with nearby IX.50.1a út te śúṣmāso īrate (attributed to a different poet, Ucathya
Āṅgirasa) -- with the disyllabic asthuḥ here replacing the īrate of IX.50.1 and thus
responsible for the metrical truncation. The sense of the two verbs úd īrate and úd asthuḥ
are essentially identical: ‘arise/have arisen’. One can speculate that either Avatsāra Kāśyapa,
a tricky poet, is calling attention to the opening of his poem by the manipulation and
metrical truncation of the unimpeachable phrase found in IX.50.1, or that he wanted an
aorist and there is no aor. clearly related to the pres. ī́rte, ī́rate (though of course there are
aor. forms to its ultimate root √ṛ). Given the near identity of the two pādas, it might have
been better had the publ. tr. rendered śúṣmāsaḥ in the same way in both instances, although
the two different tr. work better contextually.
As was noted in the publ. intro. and as Ge also points out, this vs. might be more
appropriate to Indra, and in particular the voc. adrivaḥ ‘possessor of the stone’ in b is
otherwise used almost exclusively of Indra: there are nearly 50 occurrences, of which only
one, besides this one, is addressed to anyone but Indra (Varuṇa in VII.89.2). There is in fact
nothing in this vs. that imposes or even invites the identification of the 2nd ps. referent as
Soma; we only assume it (correctly in my view) because this is a soma hymn.
The syntax of c is slightly unusual, in that the obj. of nudásva is a nominal relative cl.
yā́ḥ parispṛ́dhaḥ “(those) who are the challengers all around,” with the main cl. referent
(*tā́ḥ ‘those’) gapped. (See also 3c below.) Generally the gapping of the antecedent to
nominal relative clauses is found in “X and which Y” constructions, not when the rel. cl. is
not conjoined. It’s worth noting that this pāda is very close semantically to IX.52.3a in the
immediately preceding hymn: carúr ná yás tám īṅkhaya “Who is like a pot, give him a
shove,” but there the nom. rel. clause carúr ná yáḥ that defines the obj. of the main verb
does have an expressed antecedent tám in the main cl. Note that, IX.52 is also attributed to
Ucathya, like IX.50, and both hymns contain expressions on which Avatsāra seems to be
ringing changes.
On parispṛ́dh- see Scar 666.

### 02
This vs. sits somewhat oddly in a soma hymn, and its subject, and indeed its
general aim, are not clear until the 3rd pāda.
It begins with a fem. instr. demonst. ayā́without expressed referent, and as Re points
out, a number of fem. referents are possible. However, the verb that begins c, stávai ‘I will
praise’, makes dhī́- ‘insightful thought’ (or some other reference to a verbal product) quite
likely, and the phrase ayā́dhiyā́is in fact fairly common (I.166.13, V.45.11 [2x] [in the
hymn adjacent to Avatsāra’s V.44 though V.45 is not attributed to him], VI.71.6, VIII.13.8,
93.17). The supplying of dhī́- here is supported by the contrastive cmpd dūḍhī́- ‘having bad
insight’ in the next vs. (3b). On the basis of the Avestan parallel, fem. instr. vācā́‘with
speech’ is also a possibility; see below.
Between ayā́and stávai, however, is an image of conflict and contest, with the nom.
verbal noun nijaghníḥ ‘slamming down’, the instr. ójasā ‘with strength’, and the loc. phrase
rathasaṃgé dháne hité “when chariots clash and a prize is set” - all contributing to a picture
of violence seemingly inappropriate to a ritual context. It would be most applicable to Indra,
who is the usual subj. of ní √han (e.g., VII.18.18 ní jahi vájram indra), or perhaps to a
militant Soma. So the 1st ps. verb stávai ‘I will praise’ that opens the next pāda is a surprise:
it is instead the inoffensive poet who has been assimilated to an aggressive warrior or
contestant, and it is his act of praising that is implicitly compared to smiting down a rival on
the field of conflict. Again Avastsāra seems to have deliberately misled us.
However, the situation is more complex. Ge (n. 2a) tellingly cites a strikingly similar
Avestan passage from the Hom Yašt, Y 10.2 uparǝmciṭ tē hauuanǝm / vaca upa.staomi
huxratuuō / yahmi niγne narš aojaŋha “The upper (part of the) mortar I praise with speech,
o you of good insight [=Haoma], in which it [=haoma] is pounded down with the strength of
a man.” This passage clearly refers to the pressing of the haoma, using the lexeme ni √gan,
exact cognate to our ní √han, and also contains the instr. aojaŋha ‘with strength’, identical
to our ójasā, as well as the 1st sg. verb ‘I praise’ (staomi to the same root as our 1st sg.
stávai) and an instr. of speech vaca (instead of our proposed *dhiyā́, though in fact fem.
instr. vācā́could fit in our passage just as well). This Avestan parallel must indirectly
provide the solution to our puzzle: why is the mild-mannered priest-poet depicted in a scene
of such violence? Because the pressing of soma is inherently an act of violence. Our b pāda
provides a metaphorical scenario of contest, but nijaghnír ójasā in pāda a simply describes,
with the same vocabulary as the Avestan passage, the powerful pounding of the soma stalks.
To enhance this interpr., ‘pounding down’ would be better than ‘slamming down’ for
nijaghníḥ.

### 03
Because ‘commandments’ (vratá-) are especially associated with Varuṇa and
Mitra, the beginning of this vs. might also direct the audience to the wrong referent for
initial ásya. However, commandments are the property of a number of gods, and nothing
else about the phraseology strongly suggests a referent other than Soma. In any case any
doubt about the referent is settled by the beginning of b, pávamānasya.
Pāda c is constructed almost exactly like 1c, with a rel. clause serving as obj. of the
main clause imperative, here rujá, without expressed antecedent in the main cl. In this case,
however, the rel. clause is not nominal but has a full SOV structure: yás tvā pṛtanyáti.

### 04
As indicated in the publ. intro., this final vs. is characterized by specifically somic
vocabulary (madacyútam, índum, matsarám), in contrast to the more equivocal vss. that
precede it.
## 054
On the riddling structure of this hymn, see publ. intro. Each of the first three vss.
begins with a form of ayám, with implicit reference to soma.

### 01
Unfortunately it is difficult to render in tr. the initial position of asyá, matching that
of ayám in vss. 2, 3, which therefore makes the overall structure of the hymn less clear in
English. Perhaps “Of this one - following his age-old brilliance …”
áhrayaḥ in b is assigned to a stem áhri- by Gr and taken as a nom. pl.; so also Ge
“die nicht Schlüchtern” as subj. of duduhre (referring to the fingers or the soma-pressing
priests). This stem is otherwise unattested, and the root from which it is presumably derived
is seṭ √hrī, which attests a root noun hrī́- (VS+), whose nom. pl. should properly be *-
hriyaḥ. AiG III.187 suggests that the form is an old error for *áhrayāḥ, nom. pl. to the wellestablished them. stem áhraya-, shortened to match páyaḥ, which immediately follows
across the hemistich boundary. I instead follow Re’s suggestion, that it actually belongs to
an s-stem áhrayas- (see also EWA s.v. HRAYI
) and, as a neut. acc. sg., modifies páyaḥ.
Although the underlying s-stem *hráyas- is not attested, neither is the supposed underlying
i-stem *hrí-, and as an s-stem neut. the form would be morphologically impeccable and
require no emendation (unlike Wackernagel’s suggestion). The accent would match that of
the likewise bahuvrīhi án-āgas-, though it must be admitted that such cmpds generally have
suffixal accent (e.g., a-cetás-, a-rādhás-); however, the existence of better attested áhrayaand áhrayāṇa- could have induced initial accent. Another ex. of áhrayas- may be found in
X.93.9, q.v. As for sense, √hrī means ‘be modest, shy’, and the negated áhraya-
‘unrestrained, immodest, immoderate’; the primary use of that adj. is with rā́dhas- ‘bounty’
(V.79.5, 6, VIII.8.13, 54.8, 56.1), to express a desire for large, that is immoderate, quantities
of it. Cf. also VII.67.6 réto áhrayam, also adduced by Re, with rétas- ‘seed, semen’, a
substance rather like páyas-. In our passage the point would be that a more than satisfying
abundance of (soma-)milk was milked. If áhrayaḥ is not a nom. pl., the subj. of duduhre is
not expressed, but priestly officiants would be the obvious subj., often not overtly expressed
in Soma hymns.

### 02
Ge takes dhāvati as transitive, with sárāṃsi and pravátaḥ as obj. (“dieser lässt
Seen, sieben Ströme zum Himmel fliessen”), but the thematic pres. to √dhāv ‘run’ (as
opposed to √dhāv ‘rinse’) is only a verb of motion with acc. of goal, not a causative. Ge’s
interpr. is not shared by others: besides Re, cf. Lü (153), Gotō (1st Kl. 183), Scar (229), all
of whose interpr. are very like mine.
## 055
The first three vss. of this hymn all contain a form of the stem ándhas- ‘stalk’. On
this word see comm. ad IV.1.19; the tr. of Ge (“Trank”) and Re (“jus”) are misleading.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is unusual in its reference to agriculture (see
Ober. RdR II.118), in particular to ‘grain, barley’ (yáva-) in pāda a. Perhaps the fact that
soma is a plant, and that its stalk (ándhas-) is prominent in this hymn, accounts for the
implication that Soma has the ability to provide us with grain and its accompanying
fruitfulness (puṣṭá-). It may also be an oblique ref. to the occasional mixing of soma with
grain; see the enigmatic expression in IX.68.4.

### 02
According to the opinio communis (Ge, Re, Lü 204 [of IX.61.10], Klein DGRV
I.402), jātám ándhasaḥ in pāda b (and the same expression in IX.61.10) contains a
substantivized neut. ppl. jātám ‘birth’ with dep. gen. (e.g., Ge “die Geburt deines Tranks”).
However, IX.18.2 mádhu prá jātám ándhasaḥ “the honey born from the stalk” suggests that
‘honey’ (vel sim.) should be supplied here as well, with ándhasaḥ an abl. of source, though
Re specifically rejects IX.18.2 as relevant for this passage.
The function of the two yáthā clauses is not altogether clear. I assume that they refer
to the two prerequisites for the soma sacrifice: the verbal portion with its praise of the god
Soma and the physical production of the ritual substance soma. With both accomplished, the
god Soma can take his place on the ritual ground.
On injunc. sadaḥ as a functional impv. see comm. ad IX.2.2 and KH (Injunk. 263).

### 04
As Re points out, jinā́ti must belong to √jyā, so jī́yate, which is ambig. between √ji
and √jyā, surely belongs to the latter as well. The tr. should be slightly emended to “who
overpowers but is not overpowered.”
The standard interpr. of the syntactic structure of the passage (Ge, Re, Ober RdR
II.168, as well as the publ. tr.) takes pādas a and b as all part of the rel. cl. introduced by
initial yáḥ, with c as the main cl. and Soma as the subject both of ab and of c. This involves
a shift in person, from 3rd (ab jinā́ti … jī́yate … hánti) to 2nd (c pavasva). Of course such
shifts are commonplace in the RV, and in this case the sá introducing c is used by most tr. as
a pivot (“as such”). However, the presence of sá is fully explained by its regular use with
2nd sg. impvs. (see my “sá figé” article) and need have nothing to do with the shift of
person. I do think the standard interpr. of the vs. is probably right (even without the sá
pivot), but I would point out that it’s not the only syntactically possible analysis: the rel. cl.
could encompass only pāda a, with b as the main cl. The accent on the verb in b, hánti,
would be accounted for by its initial position in the pāda. The vs. could then be rendered
“Who overpowers and is not overpowered, he smashes his rival on just confronting him.
Purify yourself …” The referent of the 3rd ps. in ab could still be Soma, but it could instead
be the person for whom Soma purifies himself, with the happy results on the battlefield that
arise from possessing the purified soma.
## 056

### 01
The problem in this vs. is how to construe neut. ṛtám bṛhát. Is it an acc., and if so,
is it a goal, like vā́jam in the next vs. (“rushes to the lofty truth”), or an expression of the
way loosely construed with pári (“rushes around the lofty truth”)? Or is it a nom. and
therefore appositional to sómaḥ. Ge (and to some extent Re) seem to follow the “way”
interpr., as does Lü (582) in his first rendering. But he then rejects this (on somewhat
contorted grounds) and, flg. Ludwig, goes for a nom. apposition (or nominal predicate). On
the basis of IX.107.17, 108.8 (see also 66.24), I also opt for the appositional interpr. Vs. 2
also contains a nominal apposition, dhā́rā apasyúvaḥ, at least by my analysis.

### 02
This vs. consists entirely of a dependent cl. and can most conveniently be attached
to the preceding vs.
As noted above I take pl. dhā́rā apasyúvaḥ as a nom. in apposition to sg. sómaḥ. Re
explicitly calls it an “Acc. interne,” tr. “(en) cent jets actifs,” but internal to what? Ge’s tr. is
similar to Re’s, but he doesn’t commit himself as to case. That dhā́rāḥ is definitely nom. in
the next hymn, IX.57.1, also with vā́jam as goal, gives some support to my interpr. here.
āviśán in c is most likely the nom. sg. pres. part. it is universally interpr. as (incl. in
the publ. tr.), modifying sómaḥ in a. However, it is technically possible that it is a 3rd pl.
injunc. ā-viśán with the pl. dhā́rāḥ of b as its subj. It would be accented on the verb stem
because it is still part of the yád clause. This would anchor dhā́rāḥ as nom. and produce a tr.
“When Soma rushes towards the prize (and) (his) hundred hardworking streams enter
fellowship with Indra.” I do not advocate for this interpr., which seems too fussy, but I do
point out that nothing in the grammar of the vs. precludes it.

### 03
Note that yóṣan- and kanyā̀- appear together in the same vs. and in fact the latter is
explicitly compared to the former. It is not clear to me whether they are meant here to refer
to different types or lifestages of a young girl / maiden.

### 04
An elementary type of variant ring composition, with pári srava responding to pári
… arṣati in vs. 1.
## 057

### 01
On the similarity of this vs. to IX.56.2 in the preceding hymn, see comm. ad loc.

### 02
The neut. pls. of ab, priyā́ṇi kā́vyā, víśvā offer several different possibilities for
construal. The publ. tr. takes priyā́ṇi kā́vyā in pāda a separately from víśvā in b, with the
former the goal of abhí … arṣati and the latter the obj. of cákṣāṇaḥ. The oft-repeated pāda
abhí víśvāni kā́vyā (IX.23.1, 62.25, 63.25, 66.1), identical to our pāda a with priyā́ṇi
substituting for víśvāni, supports my interpr. of the phrase in our pāda a as goal. As for the
interpr. of víśvā in b as obj. of cákṣāṇaḥ, this rests on slightly shakier grounds: the víśvāni in
the repeated pāda might suggest that our víśvā belongs with pāda a, and it is also not clear
that the participle cákṣāṇa- when uncompounded can take an obj. On the one hand we have
cmpded praticákṣāṇa- with obj. in IX.85.12 víśvā rūpā́praticákṣānaḥ “gazing upon all his
forms” (cf. II.40.5 with abhí and víśvam); on the other, in I.128.3 uncmpded cákṣāṇa- is
used absolutely (cf. also X.74.2). I am therefore open to the possibility that all three neut.
pls. serve as goal, producing an alt. tr. “towards all the dear (products) of poetic skill does
he rush, being observant.” However, I am tolerably certain that both Ge and Re are wrong,
in their different ways. Ge takes the whole acc. phrase as obj. of cákṣāṇaḥ (“auf alle lieben
Dichterwerke achtend”), thus ignoring the evidence of the repeated pāda and opting for the
participle as the governing element, despite the uncertainty of its ability to take objects. Re
seems to take abhí in tmesis with the part. cákṣāṇa-, not with arṣati, thus taking the acc.
phrase with abhí, as the repeated pāda strongly supports, but making abhí the preverb to
√cakṣ: “Regardant en direction de tous les arts-poétique.” But, though abhí does occur
regularly with √cakṣ, it is also extremely common with √ṛṣ, esp. in IX. Since tmesis of
preverb and participle is quite rare, given a choice between construing a preverb in tmesis
with a participle or with a finite verb, the latter must be preferred unless there are serious
semantic drawbacks.

### 03
Pāda b has been variously interpr., primarily because of íbha-. On this word see
comm. ad VI.20.8, IV.4.1 and Old’s detailed refutation of the Pischel-Geldner gloss
‘elephant’(reflected in Ge’s unlikely tr. here ‘Königselefant’) in his n. on this passage. Gr,
flg. BR, suggests reading *íbhe for íbho, an emendation that Old considers possible, and Re
suggests íbho rā́jā is a “composé ouvert” for *ibharāja- ‘roi possédant des vassaux’. I do not
think we need to change the text, however. Working with the meaning ‘vassal’ for íbha- (as
is now generally accepted), we can first note that íbha- and rā́jan- are a complementary
pairing (cf. I.65.7, IV.4.1) expressing a power differential: the king has power over his
vassals, who give their fealty to him. This type of relationship between unequal parties is
one governed by vrata-s, command(ment)s issued by superiors and binding on inferiors (see
Brereton 1981). The adj. suvratá- ‘having good commandments, keeping commandments
well’ can therefore technically apply to either side of the equation: the superior issuing the
vratá or the inferior following it. Elsewhere in the RV the word is only applied to the
superior (who is more apt to draw the interest of the RVic poet than the inferior): the
Ādityas (VI.49.1), patrons (sūrí- I.125.7, 180.6), and in this same phrase rā́jeva suvratáḥ
(IX.20.5) of Soma compared to a king. In our passage I suggest that the other pole, the
inferior, is included in a disjunctive choice “vassal (or) king.” The vassal is suvratá- because
he obediently follows the vratá- imposed by the king. My only hesitancy about this interpr.
is that it implicitly compares Soma not merely to a king, as is standard, but also to a vassal. I
can only suggest that the poet was too pleased about tapping into the inherent ambiguity of
suvratá- to worry about a potentially unflattering comparison, or that the manipulation of
soma by the priests, here represented by the Āyus in pāda a, entails a kind of vassalage and
domination.
The simile particle comes only after the 2nd word. This is in part because the simile
has been adapted from IX.20.5 (not to mention the numerous other exx. of rā́jeva), where
the iva is properly positioned. But note also that we have encountered a number of other
examples of “late” simile particles in this maṇḍala (see comm. ad IX.3.4, 46.1, 47.5, 50.1).
## 058
On the curious structure and contents of this hymn, see the publ. intro.
### 01-03
The first word of the refrain, tárat, is grammatically ambiguous. It can be a 3rd
sg. injunc. and is so taken by, e.g., Gr, Ge, Lub, and Lowe (Part. 281); certainly the same
form in the same position in IX.107.15 tárat samudrám “he crosses the sea” is most
probably a finite injunc. However, flg. one of Old’s possibilities, with AiG II.2.164 and
apparently Re (judging from his tr. “en traversant”) I prefer to take it as a neut. sg. pres.
part. in adverbial usage, in part because beginning and ending this short pāda-length refrain
with two finite verbs, one injunc., one pres. indic., seems clunky: tárat sá mandī́dhāvati.
For another pāda-initial form in -at that I take as a participle see disc. of bhárat ad IX.52.1.
As to what Soma is crossing, it is most likely the waters (cf. ap-túr- IX.61.13, 63.5,
21), as suggested by Ge, Re, et al. - in this case perhaps the waters with which the stalk is
swelled. Or, given IX.59.3b víśvāni duritā́tara in the immediately following hymn, it could
be “all difficult passages.”
## 059

### 01
The first hemistich is notable for its sequence of four root noun cmpds in -jít-
‘winning, winner’. For their possible structural role in the hymn, see comm. ad vs. 4.
IX.59.2; As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. contains three occurrences of the impv.
pávasva, each pāda init. Each of these is construed with a dat. pl. (or abl., acdg. to Sāy.; but
see the parallel Ge cites [n. 2] that speaks for the dat.). This tight repetitive syntactic
structure suggests that the three datives should form a semantic set. The first two are waters
(adbhyáḥ) and plants (óṣadhībhyáḥ). As for the third, dhiṣánābhyaḥ, Ge interpr. it as “ die
(priestlichen) Werke” (and see his extensive n. on the word, n.2c), Re as “les inspirations
(des humains).” However, flg. Pinault (Vedic Workshop, 2007), I take the orig. sense of
dhiṣáṇā- to be ‘holy place’, and in this context I think it likely that it refers to the hearths
holding the ritual fires. If so, the trio of datives would refer to three vital physical elements
of the soma sacrifice: “the waters” for swelling the soma stalk and for mixing the pressed
soma, “the plants” representing the soma plant itself, and “the Holy Places / hearths”
representing the fire into which the soma is offered. The more attenuated interpr. of Ge and
Re are not impossible, but are not as tightly bound to the substances in ab as the
fires/hearths would be.
Re notes the phonetic play (pávasv)ādbhyó ádābhyaḥ in a.

### 04
The injunc. vidaḥ in pāda a is interpr. by both Ge and Re as imperatival, while in
the publ. tr. it’s taken as a general statement in the present. I am now somewhat inclined to
follow the imperatival interpr. of Ge/Re (“find the sun”). On vidaḥ in impv. use, see comm.
ad IX.20.3, I.42.7-9. What may indirectly support my original interpr., however, is a
potential ring-compositional relationship with vs. 1. As noted above, vs. 1 contains a
remarkably pile-up of root noun cmpds in -jít- ‘X-winning’. There exists a very wellattested root noun cmpd svar-víd- ‘sun-finding’, which is semantically very close to the Xwinning cmpds (and cf. also svar-jít- 4x, incl. 2x of Soma in IX). Indeed, svar-víd- is
commonly used of Soma (13x in IX) and in a number of passages occupies this same
metrical slot, the last four syllables of a dimeter pāda (in the acc. sg. svar-vídam, nom/acc.
pl. svar-vídaḥ; e.g., IX.8.9), as our finite VP svàr vidaḥ. This slot is, of course, not available
for the nom. sg. svar-víd, but the 2nd sg. VP here svàr vidaḥ is a reasonable simulacrum,
with vidaḥ incorporating the nominative subject. Now in vs. 1 the cmpds in -jít- are
descriptors of Soma, without modal value. If svàr vidaḥ here is meant as a ringcompositional variant, evoking the cmpd svar-víd- and reprising the X-jít- cmpds of vs. 1,
the general meaning I assigned it in the publ. tr. may correctly capture this structural
feature.
The finite verb in b presents its own problems. The Pp. reads abhavaḥ, though the
putative augment has to be elided after jā́yamāno in order to produce the proper number of
syllables. As is well known (see, e.g., Old, Proleg. 389ff.), this elision, i.e., Abhinihita
sandhi, is fairly rare in the RV, and therefore the orig. text may have had not the impf.
abhavaḥ, but an injunc. bhavaḥ, which was then wrongly analyzed by the Pp. In that case
bhavaḥ could express the same general sense as I just suggested vidaḥ might: “being born,
you become great.” However, as both Old (Noten ad loc.) and KH (Inj. 150) point out, the
injunctives bhavaḥ and bhavat are not otherwise found in the RV, and therefore both
scholars assume that the augmented abhavaḥ is the underlying form here - ‘you became
great’, as rendered in the publ. tr.
## 060
On the structure of this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
The tr. “sing forth with a song” is meant to capture the etymological relationship of
gāyatréṇa gāyata, but gāyatrá- of course refers more technically to a hymn in Gāyatrī meter
- as this one indeed is.
### 01-02
The chaining described in the publ. intro. here involves repeating
sahásracakṣasam from 1c in 2a in the same metrical position.

### 02
The deriv. -bharṇas- in sahásra-bharṇas- is somewhat puzzling: it is difficult to
see what motivated its formation and indeed to fix its meaning. It is found 4x (once as a
repetition), only in IX, always in the acc. sg. occupying the last 6 syllables of a dimeter line
(here, IX.64.25 [=98.1], 64.26), modifying Soma (here), vā́c- (IX.64.25, 26), rayí- (IX.98.1),
though the referent never appears in the pāda with the adj. and so the adj. is loosely
connected with its referent at best. Here it is obviously meant to match sahásra-cakṣas-
‘having a thousand eyes’ in the same metrical position in the preceding pāda, and for this
reason I think it possible that this passage is the locus for its creation. But the match is not
very good: though both are -as-stems, the suffixes (-nas- versus -as-) aren’t superimposable.
The semantic match is also quite imperfect: whatever -bharṇas- means, it is certainly not a
body part like cákṣas-. Since many nominal derivatives of √bhṛ fall in the semantic domain
of ‘present, offering’ and such a meaning fits a ritual context, that seems a safe bet and
would work with rayí-, though it fits vā́c- somewhat less well. With a confidence whose
basis is not clear, Re rejects the notion of ‘offrande’ and asserts that “le suffix -nas- fait
décider pour «bénefice (qu’on tire du culte sômique)»,” for reasons he fails to give. Ge by
contrast tr. “Tausendaufwiegenden” with a question mark, which he then glosses (n. 2b)
with “Tausendwertigen.” Insofar as the suffix -nas- tells us anything (and the -n- is not there
just to supply the heavy syllable that a straight -as-stem sahásra-*bharas- would lack), it
suggests a meaning in the realm of “stuff,” material substance, esp. with regard to
substances of value: cf. rékṇas- ‘inheritance, legacy’, dráviṇas- ‘material goods, chattels’,
ápnas- ‘property’, all with Aves. cognates - so that ‘bringing a thousand (material) presents’
would fit reasonably in this group. AiG II.2.738 glosses -bharṇas- with ‘Darbringung’ and
considers it probably inherited, despite the lack of non-Indic correspondents. Given its
extremely limited distribution, indeed the strong possibility that it was originally created in
one passage, I consider inheritance unlikely; rather, it was probably formed as a near nonce
on the basis of the inherited words just cited.
IX,60.2-3: Here the chaining is slightly inexact: 2c áti vā́ram / 3a áti vā́rān, each followed
by a verbal form of √pū.

### 03
This vs. is in Puraüṣṇih meter (12 8 / 8), i.e., a Gāyatrī with an extended first pāda.
This pāda is almost at the exact center of the hymn, preceded by 6 pādas, followed by 5. The
positioning seems deliberate.
### 03-04
Here the chaining involves only the first word índrasya.

### 04
In addition to the chaining with the previous vs. (on which see immediately above),
this vs. participates in other verbal echoes, as noted in the publ. intro. The end of the 2nd
pāda vicarṣaṇe forms a ring with vícarṣanim at the end of the 2nd pāda of vs. 1, and the last
pāda, prajā́vad réta ā́bhara, is identical to the last pāda of the first vs. of the immediately
preceding hymn, IX.59.1 prajā́vad rátnam ā́bhara, with the substitution of rétaḥ for
rátnam. In our case the semen (rétaḥ) would be both the actual semen that produces
offspring and the liquid soma that mimics it.

### 61-67  
On the place of these long hymns in the structure of the maṇḍala, see publ. intro. to
IX.61. All of these hymns consist of collections of tṛcas of varying degrees of cohesion. In
fact, it is surprising how few tṛcas display a real attempt at thematic or lexical unity, and
what they do show is often simply the byproduct of the fact that both the lexicon and
thematic preoccupations of Maṇḍala IX are comparatively limited and so similar words and
themes are not unlikely to show up in adjacent verses. This lack of unity contrasts, I think
(this is my unsystematic and anecdotal impression) with collections of tṛcas in other
maṇḍalas, notably VIII.
## 061
### 01-03
This tṛca shows some signs of unity. The 1st two vss. are a syntactic unit, with
the objects of the verb in 1c partly postponed to 2ab. The third vs. has as its verb pári …
kṣárā, which echoes pári srava in 1a.

### 01
The publ. tr. fails to render the demon. ayā́that opens the hymn; more literal would
be “flow around in this pursuit (of him) …” Ge (n. 1) considers ayā́a kind of attraction from
*asya ‘of him’, the missing antecedent to yáḥ in b, but the prominent position of ayā́should
be registered. Presumably ayā́vītī́is gesturing towards the physical ritual activity happening
right now.
The unnamed referent in the rel. cl. of bc is of course Indra; the “nine and ninety” are
fortresses / strongholds, as in IV.26.3 … púraḥ … náva sākáṃ navatī́ḥ śámbarasya. This
referent is postponed to the 2nd vs.: púraḥ opens vs. 2.

### 02
As was just noted, púraḥ completes the acc. phrase navatī́r náva that serves as obj.
to avā́han in 1c, as the parallel IV.26.3 just cited demonstrates. But avā́han has another
object in vs. 2, namely śámbaram in b, as shown by a different passage in the Indra cycle of
Maṇḍala IV, IV.30.14 ávāhann indra śámbaram.
The third pāda of this vs. is radically incomplete, consisting only of a particle, a
demon., and two acc. PNs: ádha tyáṃ turváśam yádum. On purely structural grounds, it
would make sense to make these parallel to śámbaram in b, as objects of avā́han (in 1c).
However, this structural argument runs into problems of mythological content. Although
Turvaśa and Yadu are sometimes enemies of Indra (see, e.g., VII.19.2), at other times they
are under Indra’s protection. In particular, in the Indra cycle from which IV.26.3 and
IV.30.14, the parallels to our vss. 1-2ab, were cited above, T + Y are rescued by Indra:
IV.30.17 utá tyā́turváśāyádū, … / índraḥ … apārayat “And Indra brought these two, T + Y,
to the far shore,” just three vss. later than the smiting of Śambara. Note further that
IV.30.17a is very like our pāda, a dimeter line with an intro. disyllabic connective, a form of
the demonstr. syá- / tyá-, and the two names, though with a dual dvandva turváśāyádū rather
than two individual acc. sgs. On this basis, I’m afraid the simple solution of taking T + Y as
further victims of Indra should be abandoned, in favor of supplying (or at least assuming) a
positive verb to govern them, such as Ge’s (n. 2c) “errettete” or Re’s “sauva.”

### 03
The Inhaltsakk. with pári … kṣárā are disharmonious in formation, with the sg.
noun áśvam (rendered in the publ. tr. as the mass noun ‘horseflesh’, perhaps a bit too
vividly) in pāda a followed by two possessive adj. gómat and híraṇyavat ‘possessing /
consisting of cattle (and) gold’ in pāda b, followed by a pl. NP sahasríṇīr íṣaḥ ‘thousandfold
refreshments’ in c. In a we might have expected áśvāvat ‘possessing / consisting of horses’,
to match the adjectival forms in b, but the phonologically similar and adjacent aśvavíd
‘horse-finding’ may have blocked it (to avoid *áśvāvad aśvavíd [though some RVic poets
would have loved that phrase]).
### 04-06
There are faint signs of unity in this tṛca: the word pavítram ‘filter’ is found in
vss. 4 and 5, and both 4 and 6 have pres. mid. participles derived from √pū ‘purify’
(pávamāna- 4a, punāná- 6a), but since this is a Soma Pavamāna hymn, this is hardly
remarkable.

### 04
Both Ge and Re render pávamānasya as simply the epithet Pavamāna, but this loses
the parallelism between the two gen. sg. pres. participles that open and close the hemistich:
pávamānasya … abhyundatáḥ. I render these participles as “while” clauses, to avoid the
awkward “we choose the companionship of you who are Xing.”

### 05
We might fault the poet for a certain laxness of phraseology: how exactly is Soma
meant to be gracious / merciful to us “with his waves”?

### 06
Note the echo across the b-c pāda boundary: … íṣam / ī́śānaḥ …
### 07-09
The tṛca is characterized by the mention of gods in all three vss. The Ādityas
frame it (ādityébhiḥ 7c, mitré váruṇe ca 9c), with a more miscellaneous group in between. It
is also marked by initial repetition: sám opens pādas 7c, 8a, and 8c. This is imperfectly
echoed by sá n(o) opening 9a.
### 10-12
It is difficult to discern any particular unity in this tṛca.

### 10  
The topic of the verse seems to be heavenly versus earthly soma. See Lü 204.
On jātám as an adj., rather than (with Ge, Re, Lü 204, Ober II.16) the noun ‘birth’,
see comm. ad IX.55.2. Another arg. for taking it as adjectival here is that the same form is
clearly an adj. in 13a. As in IX.55.2, I take the missing referent to be ‘honey’ (mádhu) on
the basis of IX.18.2.
Pāda b contains several forms requiring disc., esp. what appears in the Saṃhitā text
as bhū́my. This is analyzed, irregularly, by the Pp as bhū́miḥ. Gr gives the form as bhū́mī but
identifies it as a nom. sg. to bhū́mi-. Old refers to the considerable lit. on the form, opting
for a loc. interpr. (as do all the standard tr.). Wackernagel has a curiously split opinion: in
AiG I.337 (1896) he identifies it as a loc., while in AiG III.136-37 (1930) he decides instead
for the nom., though referring to his former opinion - and in the same vol. (III.155) he says
the same form doesn’t have to be a loc. (“… muss nicht notwendig as Lok. bhū́mī gefasst
werden”), but could alternatively be either a nom. bhū́mī or an instr. bhū́myā. The context,
with the contrast diví ṣát “though being in heaven” with loc. diví, certainly favors a loc.
interpr. for the form, even though taking ‘earth’ as the subject of the clause is possible:
“earth took it, though it was in heaven.” In sum, I think the loc. interpr. is most likely, with
an -ī (or -i) loc, to a fem. i-stem, like védī (or védi) in II.3.4 (see comm. ad loc.). A bhū́mi
with short final vowel is metrically better here (as védi is in II.3.4), but it may result from
shortening in hiatus.
The neut. part. sát has, in my opinion, the concessive value often found with the pres.
part. to √as, though most tr. don’t render it as such (and Re rejects this interpr.). It modifies
the unexpressed mádhu in my view, but the neut. ándhas- acdg. to most others.
ā́dade is another ambig. form.: it can be either a 1st or a 3rd sg. mid. pf. (or a 1st sg.
mid. pres.). Gr takes it as a 1st sg. pf., as does Ge (“Den im Himmel befindlichen (Trank)
nehme ich auf der Erde zu mich”), but a 3rd sg., with the soma (represented by mádhu or
ándhaḥ) as subject (with Re, Lü, Ober) allows pāda c to serve as obj. of ā́dade - Ge has to
take it as an independent nominal clause - and the Gr/Ge interpr. also introduces a 1st sg.
that has no other place in the context, where the 1st pl. reigns.
### 13-15
Again no signs of tṛca unity, unless the presence of cows in all three verses
counts (13b góbhiḥ, 14b vatsáṃ saṃśíśvarīḥ iva, 15a gáve, 15b dhukṣásva).

### 14  
The hapax tatpuruṣa hṛdaṃsáni- ‘gaining the heart’ is curious, in having an
apparent acc. in -am to the neut. root noun hṛ́d-, as if to a masc. or fem. stem or to a
thematic *hṛda- (see, e.g., AiG II.1.208).
### 16-18
This tṛca is unified by the simple device of stationing a form of pávamāna- at
the beginning of each vs. (16a, 17a, 18a). Note also the two forms of rása- ‘sap’ in 17a and
18a (the two pādas are scramblings of each other: 17a pávamānasya te rásaḥ, 18a pávamāna
rásas táva, with different case forms of pávamāna- and enclitic versus full form of the gen.
sg. 2nd ps. prn.). And 16c jyótir vaiśvānarám … matched by 18c jyótir víśvam …

### 16  
The question in this vs. is how to interpr. the simile in pāda b, diváś citráṃ ná
tanyatúm. It has been variously rendered. Note first that in none of the available interpr.
(that I know of) is the simile particle ná positioned in the expected 2nd position, so that
conforming to the usual structure of the simile cannot be used as a criterion to decide which
interpr. is correct. We have had occasion to note this issue before in Maṇḍala IX; see disc.
ad IX.57.3. Re takes the whole of b as a simile, with the “thunder” matching “light” (c) in
the frame; in addition he supplies a different subject for the simile: “Pavamāna a engendré la
haute lumière propre à (Agni) Vaiśvānara, / comme (les dieux ont engendré) le tonnerre
éclatante du ciel.” This is not impossible, of course, but introducing the gods seems
unnecessary, and are they the usual creators of thunder anyway? Lü’s (266) interpr. is
similar, though he allows Pavamāna as subj. of both the simile and the frame. I find Ge’s
interpr. more appealing: he considers tanyatúm part of the frame, with the simile restricted
to diváś citrám. “Sich läuternd hat er den Donner, grell wie den des Himmels,
hervorgebracht.” The c pāda provides a parallel object, rather than constituting the frame as
in the Re/Lü interpr. My tr. essentially follows Ge. The “thunder” that Soma engendered is
the noise produced by the pressing, esp. by the pressing stones, which is constantly
remarked on. It is comparable to the thunder of heaven. All interpr. must silently reckon
with the synaesthesia introduced by the point of the comparison in the simile, citrá- ‘bright,
brilliant, glittering, dazzling’, an adj. that ordinarily characterizes visual phenomena not
auditory ones (though it’s a not uncommon transfer; cf. Engl. “brilliant tone,” etc., used of
voices and musical instruments). For a similar ex. cf. VI.6.2 śvitānas tanyatúḥ “brightening
thunder.” This synaesthetic comparison provides a lead-in to the second object, the “light
belonging to all men.”
Both Ge and Re take jyótir vaiśvānarám as referring to Agni Vaiśvānara specifically.
This is certainly possible, though it is not the soma pressing that ordinarily kindles the ritual
fire. I prefer to take it more generally as shared light, perhaps localized as the sun, which
would continue the heavenly theme of pāda b. Alternatively, this pāda, which is entirely in
the neuter, may be nominative not accusative and refer to Soma himself. This interpr. may
be favored by the matching pāda at the end of the tṛca, 18c jyótir víśvam svàr dṛśé “(as) light
for everyone to see the sun,” where the soma sap—that is, soma itself—is identified as this
light. I would therefore suggest an alternative tr. of pāda c here: “(he) the lofty light
belonging to all men.”

### 18  
I am, reluctantly, taking dákṣa- as an adj. here (as in IX.62.4), with Ge and Re,
though it is generally a masc. noun. Alternatively a noun interpr. is possible (cf. Ober I.457
“dein Saft ist Fähigkeit”): “your sap shines forth brilliant as skill” or “… shines as brilliant
skill,” though I still prefer the adjectival interpr. See Re’s disc.
Scar (237) takes ví rājati as ‘rules’ (“dein Saft herrscht weithin als König …” A pun
is certainly possible here, but the insistent light imagery (dyumā́n in b and the whole c pāda)
suggests that the ‘shine’ sense is the dominant one.
In c Ge takes víśvam as the modifier of jyótiḥ (“… ist alles licht”); so also Scar (237).
This is certainly possible, and jyótir vaiśvānarám in 16c might support it. But “for everyone
/ all to see the sun” is a locution encountered elsewhere (I.15.1, 5, VIII.49.8, X.136.1), incl.
nearby IX.48.4. My interpr. is shared with Re and Ober (I.457).
### 19-21
Little evidence of unity, though 19 and 20 share ‘smashing’ and 20 and 21
cows.

### 21  
As in 16b, the simile in b seems to consist only of what precedes the ná, namely
sūpasthā́bhiḥ, while dhenúbhiḥ constitutes the frame. So also Ge, Re.
### 22-24
The tṛca has something of an emphasis on combat and winning, and the Vṛtra
topic introduced in 22 is reprised via phonological deformation by vratéṣu in 24c.

### 22  
A nice example where surface grammar clashes with mythological content and the
latter wins. Pāda b, the complex object of ā́vitha ‘you helped’ in a, consists of an infinitival
phrase with the obj. of the inf. “attracted” into the dative, while its subject remains acc.:
índraṃ vṛtrā́ya hántave “you helped Indra to smite Vṛtra.” But c, a further specification of
this obj., contains an acc. sg. masc. participial phrase vavrivā́ṃsam mahī́r apáḥ “obstructing
the great waters.” On the surface, the only noun this can modify is índram because this is the
only available acc. sg. masc., but of course it is Vṛtra who obstructed the waters. Though
vṛtrā́ya appears in the dative, it must be the referent of the acc. participle - thus suggesting
that “attraction” in infinitival phrases is a very late and superficial phenomenon. Unless with
Re we want simply to denominate it a “formule morphologiquement non adaptée au
contexte.” I prefer to think that the poet enjoyed producing the syntactic misdirection.

### 23  
Pāda c … vardha no gíraḥ “strengthen our hymns” is the reciprocal to vs. 14a tán
íd vardhantu no gíraḥ “let our hymns strengthen just him.”

### 24  
Pāda a consists of the etymologically identical phrases tvótāsaḥ ‘aided by you’
and távā́vasā ‘with your help’, both containing forms of the 2nd sg. prn. and nominal forms
of √av ‘help, aid’.
Pāda b contains a curious verbal periphrasis, syā́ma vanvántaḥ “may we be
combatting,” with opt. to √as as aux. plus the pres. act, part. to vanóti. This expression does
not seem to be conveying anything different from the opt. to the same pres. stem, vanuyā́ma
(5x), e.g., X.38.3 tváyā vayáṃ tā́n [śátrūn] vanuyāma “With you might we combat those
(rivals).”
As noted above, vratá- in this pāda may have been chosen to recall vṛtráphonologically, forming a faint ring with the √vṛ forms in 22 vṛtrā́ya … vavrivā́ṃsam. It
may even be that jāgṛhi ‘be watchful’ evokes a form of √han, as in 20a jághnir vṛtrám; see
also jahī́in 26b.
### 25-27
This tṛca focuses even more strongly on combat, with forms of √han in 25 and
26 and ‘do battle’ (makhasyá-) in 27. Generosity is also a topic.

### 27  
This vs. is rather cleverer than the two that precede it. In pāda a the nom. pl. root
noun hrútaḥ is, in my opinion, a pun. It belongs to the root √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, curve’, and
its sense was disc., e.g., by KH (Fs. Thieme [1980] =Aufs. III.753-54). He suggests that
here it refers to unevennesses (Unebenheiten) in the fleece sieve (i.e., as I see it, the curvy
tufts of wool), just as, in the other occurrence of this root noun (VI.4.5), it refers to the
curves of a race course (see comm. ad loc.). The literal sense here then is that though the
soma must navigate around the tufts on the sieve, they will not keep it from completing the
course. The second sense is one referring to unscrupulous enemies—Engl. ‘crook’ is an
exact semantic match—and the point is that when Soma wishes to dispense goods to us, our
crooked enemies can’t divert him.
The word family that includes makhá- and the denom. makhasyá- found here
displays both ‘combat’ and ‘generosity’ senses; see comm. ad I.18.9 and, for the verb,
III.31.7. Here I think both are at play, and this double sense is encouraged by the context: as
noted, this tṛca focuses on combatting enemies, and the first hemistich of this vs. states that
these enemies cannot stop Soma. But the tṛca also concerns Soma’s giving, esp. in the last
two vss.: 26a “bring wealth ... 26c “give” … 27b “eager to give largesse.”
### 28-30
The last tṛca continues the concentration on combat and victory.

### 29  
The first two pādas open with somewhat emphatic 2nd sg. genitives, the first with
a fronted initially accented demonst. + enclitic (ásya te), the second with a more
conventional full form of the prn. (táva). See disc. ad IX.66.14.

### 30  
The nominal rel. cl. in ab has no resumptive prn. in the main cl. of c, though “with
these/them” is clearly the intent.
On the construction of dhū́rvane here, see Keydana, Infin. 247, though the arbitrary
line he tends to draw between “true” infinitives and datival purpose nouns seems over-strict
here.
As is shown by IX.29.5 rákṣa ... svanā́t samasya kásya cit (cited by Ge), nidáḥ must
be an abl. (as we would expect in any case with a form of √rakṣ) with a dependent gen., the
indefinite samasya.
## 062
### 01-03
No particular sign of unity in this tṛca, though all three vss. concern the journey
of the soma drops across the filter and towards the milk mixture and the rest of the ritual (as
do vast numbers of other vss. in IX, of course). Vss. 2 and 3 also both contain the pres. part.
kṛṇvántaḥ and datives of benefit.

### 02
This vs. has no finite verb, just two nom. pl. participles. With its nom. pl. subj. it
can be dependent on vs. 1 or vs. 3 (or both); I prefer anticipatory dependence on vs. 3
because of the repetition of kṛṇvántaḥ and the parallel datives.
Note the juxtaposition of the opposites duritā́lit. ‘ill-goings’ (pāda a) and sugā́lit.
‘good-goings’ (pāda b), formed with two different verbs of motion (√i, √gā). It is difficult
to capture this relationship in Engl. without awkwardness, as the literal tr. just given
demonstrate.
My tr. follows Ge in taking árvate parallel to tokā́ya “for our offsping and for our
steed”; I am somewhat tempted to take árvate as an anticipatory parallel to gáve in 3a, with
which it forms a more natural class (“making wide space for our steed and for our cow”),
but I can’t see how to do that without brutally splitting up 2c, since kṛṇvántaḥ is required to
govern sugā́in 2b.
### 04-06
Again no obvious signs of unity, beyond the progress through the preparation of
soma. Note, however, that 4b and 5b both begin apsú and the opening of 6b, áśū(śubhan)
echoes that opening phonologically.

### 04
As in IX.61.18 I take dákṣa- adjectivally (so also Ge, Re); even more than in that
passage, a noun interpr. is difficult: “… the skill, abiding on a mountain”?
The loc. apsú and the locativally used stem giri- implicitly contrast.

### 05
The fluent Engl. of the tr. conceals a syntactic problem: soma should be the obj. of
the verb svádanti in c, and the first pāda, which is entirely in the neuter, with the NP led by
ándhas-, allows such an acc. interpr. However, the intermediate pāda (b) is stubbornly in the
masc. nominative (dhūtáḥ … sutáḥ). We must either take b as a parenthetical nominal
clause, as Ge and I do, or take ab as entirely in the nominative (as Re may do - his structure
is not entirely clear) as a separate nominal clause, and supply a resumptive pronominal acc.
for c.
### 07-09
The tṛca shows no strong signs of internal unity, save for the “sitting” found in
both 7 and 8, but it does echo some of the material earlier in the hymn: ásṛgram in 7b
matches the same verb in 1a; ā́sadaḥ in 7c recalls ā́sadat in 4c, while sī́dan yónā (8c) is a
different echo of 4c yónim ā́sadat; arṣa (8a) picks up arṣanti (3b); svā́diṣṭhaḥ in 9b
expresses the result of svádanti in 5c; and varivo-víd in 9c is a paraphrase of kṛṇvánto
várivaḥ in 2c. It may also be worth noting that this is the first place in the hymn that the
divine recipients of soma are mentioned: índrāya 8a, áṅgirobhyaḥ 9b.

### 09
The metaphorical universe of the soma hymns makes it difficult to interpr. the
phrase ghṛtám páyaḥ, lit. “ghee (and) milk.” In the publ. tr. I take the phrase as the ultimate
goal of pári srava, referring to the milk with which the soma will be mixed after its trip
across the filter. See the esp. explicit IX.31.5 túbhyaṃ gā́vo ghṛtám páyah … dudhré “For
you the cows have milked out ghee and milk,” which identifies the phrase as referring to
substance(s) that the cows produce for soma, real dairy products. But soma is also
sometimes compared to milk and to ghee (e.g., IX.74.4), and so the phrase can also be an
appositive metaphorically characterizing the subject soma, accounting for Ge’s “Laufe du
… als Schmalz und Milch.” However, our 5c svádanti gā́vo páyobhiḥ “the cows sweeten
(soma) with their milk” suggests that the milk and ghee in this vs. are likewise firmly bovine
- though see 20b below.
### 10-12
In this tṛca all three vss. have a form of med. páva-: pávamānaḥ 10b, 11b, (ā́)
pavasva 12a. This is scarcely surprising in the Soma Pavamāna maṇḍala, but in fact this
stem has not yet appeared in the hymn.

### 10  
Several items in this vs. present choices of interpr., none of which are strongly
either favored or disfavored.
The first issue is hitáḥ: as often in this maṇḍala (cf. comm. ad IX.1.2, 44.2, etc.), it
could belong either to √dhā or to √hi. The presence of a verb form belonging undeniably to
the latter, hinvānáḥ in c, cuts both ways, as the poet could either be reinforcing the sense by
duplicate forms of the same root or making a pun utilizing two different roots. In a similar
situation in IX.44.2, with hitáḥ … hinve, I opted to take both to √hi (though not with any
emphatic feeling about it), while here I take hitá- to √dhā, as a pun (again, not
emphatically). The deciding factor here for me is the deictic demon. ayám ‘right here’,
which may point to the current location of the soma, expressed by ‘established, placed’. Re
also takes it to √dhā, but Ge to √hi.
The other uncertainty in the vs. is how to construe ā́pyam bṛhát “lofty friendship”: is
it the complement of cetati or of hinvānáḥ -- which brings up the further question of the
function of the latter participle. Med. hinváte, etc., can either take an obj. or be passive; in
particular the part. hinvāná- is about evenly split. For a nearby pass. form, see, e.g., IX.64.9;
for a nearby transitive form, see IX.63.7 hinvānó mā́nuṣīr apáḥ. Both Ge and Re take it as tr.
here (e.g., “die hohe Freundschaft zur eile treibend”), while I have chosen to take it as
passive and to construe the acc. with cetati, on the grounds that I don’t know what it would
mean to “impel friendship” (though such an image is well within the potential range of a
RVic poet). Gotō (1st class, 139) takes it as I do.

### 11  
The nom. pávamānaḥ in b is helpful in identifying the referent as Soma, in that
both vṛ́ṣā ‘bull’ (and related vṛ́ṣa-vrataḥ) and aśastihā́could be (and are) just as well used of
Indra.
### 13-15
The first two vss. contain forms of kaví-. The epithet “wide-going” (urugāyá13c) may be further specified in the phrase vimā́no rájasaḥ “measurer of the airy realm”
(14b) -- in both cases probably a way of giving a cosmic dimension to the journey across the
filter. The third vs. (15) does not participate in these commonalities.

### 15  
girā́jātáḥ “born on a mountain” is in the first instance a phrasal variant of giriṣṭhā́ḥ ‘mountain-abiding’ in 4b, with girā́showing the i-stem loc. in -ā regular before
consonants (see, e.g., Lanman, Noun Inflect, 385). This interpr. is followed by Ge and Re in
their tr. (see also Ober II.13). However, girā́can also be, as Old and Ge (n. 15a) point out,
the instr. sg. of gír- ‘hymn’; in fact Gr puts it there. The alt. given in the publ. tr. “[/begotten
by a hymn]” reflects this other possible analysis; that soma is produced to the
accompaniment of hymns would make this statement true in ritual logic. It is also possible
that girā́‘by a hymn’ could be construed with stutáḥ ‘praised’ later in the pāda. And to
make things even more complex, stutáḥ might also evoke sutáḥ ‘pressed’.
The pass. dhīyate in b might weakly support taking hitáḥ in 10a to √dhā as well.
Pāda c is the third instantiation (always in the c pāda) of the image comparing soma
installed in the wooden cups to a bird on a yóni-: 4c śyenó ná yónim ā́sadat, 8c sī́dan yónā
váneṣv ā́, our 15c vír yónā vasatā́v iva - and cf. in the preceding hymn IX.61.21c sī́dañ
chyenó ná yónim ā́. Judging from the position of ivain our vs., both the bird and the yónihave become so much part of the identity of soma that only the ‘nest’ (vasatí-) is considered
part of the simile proper - though we must keep in mind the multiple disturbances in the
position of simile particles in Maṇḍala IX as disc. passim above.
### 16-18
Several elements link at least two of the vss. in the tṛca: the presence of vā́jain 16 and 18 (vā́jam 16b, vā́jāya 18b, vājínam 18c) and the dat. inf. yā́tave in 17b and 18b.

### 17  
See publ. intro. for the ritual specificity of the images in this vs.
The participle “yoking” in the publ. tr. of c should properly be in parens., since it’s
simply generated from the finite yuñjanti in b.
The uninflected numeral ‘seven’ (saptá) is stationed between two pl. nouns, gen.
ṛ́ṣīṇāṃ ‘of the seers’ and instr. dhītíbhiḥ ‘with visionary thoughts’. Of course seven is the
canonical number of seers throughout Indian religious history, starting with the RV, but
‘seven’ is also used of dhītí- in IX.9.4 sá saptá dhītíbhir hitáḥ and passages cited there. Most
tr. choose to construe it with one or the other (Ge, Ober [II.72] ṛ́ṣi-; Re, Lü [710], Ober
[II.222] dhītí-), with, surprisingly (to me), more going for dhītí- than ṛ́ṣi-. But surely its
position helps signal that it should be construed with both (as Re in his n. and Ober in his
2nd tr. indicate).

### 18  
This vs. is notable for its 2nd ps. address to the priests (sotāraḥ … hinota “o
pressers, impel …”), also found in vss. 21, 29. Ordinarily 2nd ps. in soma hymns is reserved
for Soma (sg.) and his drops (etc.) (pl.).
### 19-21
There is some chaining between vss. (cows/milk in 19, 20; mádhu in 20, 21
and two mentions of gods in pāda c in 20, 21, incl. dat. pl. devébhyaḥ in each). In addition,
all three vss. begin with the preverb ā́(univerbated and therefore accentless in 19a).

### 20  
With Ge and Re, the publ. tr. interpr. páyo duhanti as “they milk your milk” (or
more emphatically, Re “traient de toi le lait” [my ital.]); that is, they assume that milk
(páyaḥ) here refers to the soma juice. See above, comm. ad vs. 9, on the ambiguous ref. of
this word in the soma maṇḍala. It is also possible here that páyaḥ refers to cows’ milk (see
the cows in 19c), and the passage should be interpr. “they milk milk for you for
exhilaration.”
### 22-24
gṛṇāná- is found in the first and last vs. (22b, 24c); vss. 23 and 24 contain
forms of árṣa-, pári, and cows. In addition vs. 22 seems to chain with the final vs. of the
previous tṛca, 21: 22a asṛkṣata picks up 21b sṛjátā, and 22b śrávase echoes
(deva)śrút(tamam) in 21c, while madíntama- (22b) contains the same splv. suffix as
mádhumattama (21b), (deva)śrúttama- (21c).

### 24  
For some disc. of this passage see Scar 641 with n. 906. He gives pariṣṭúbh- an
active value (“ringsum jubelnd, rauschend”) in this passage: “… zu allen, die ringsum Töne
von sich geben,” in contrast to my passive “encircled with rhythm,” which follows Re’s
“environnées de rhythmes.” Since the cmpd modifies íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’, it is hard to see
how they could actively produce noise, though Scar (n. 906) suggests it might refer to the
cows likewise characterizing the refreshments (gómatīr íṣaḥ), in the form of bellowing milk
streams. This seems a bit farfetched, though it does allow the form to be semantically united
with its other occurrence, in I.166.11, where it modifies the Maruts, who are actively
making noise. For the idiom see I.80.9 pári ṣṭobhata “encircle (him) with rhythm!” where it
is parallel to arcata “chant!” See also nearby IX.64.28 pariṣṭóbhant-. Ge takes pariṣṭubhaḥ
as a noun ‘lauter Loblieder’, also with active sense.
### 25-27
This tṛca shows more signs of unity than others in this hymn, esp. in the 1st
two vss. Both 25 and 26 contain pāda-initial pávasva (25a, 26c) and the variant phrases vācó
agriyáḥ (25a) / agriyó vā́caḥ (26b), as well as forms of víśva- (25c víśvāni, 26c
viśvam(ejaya)). In 27a Soma is addressed by the voc. kave, while 25c contains the phrase
víśvāni kā́vyā.

### 25  
Both Ge and Re supply an intermediate infinitive to govern víśvāni kā́vyā: “um
alle Sehergabe zu gewinnen” and “en vue de (nous procurer) tous pouvoirs-poétiques”
respectively - on what basis is completely unclear to me. I see no reason why it can’t simply
be a goal, as I’ve taken it. See also comm. ad IX.75.1.

### 26  
Because of the accentual difference between vācáḥ in 25a and vā́caḥ in 26b, we
must construe the two superficially near-identical phrases vācó agriyáḥ and agriyó vā́caḥ
quite differently. The first is a single constituent with dependent gen. vācáḥ, but in the 2nd
agriyáḥ and acc pl. vā́caḥ belong to different constituents, despite their adjacency: vā́caḥ is
the (or rather, an) obj. of īráyan.
### 28-30
No overt signs of unity.

### 28  
The first two pādas are simply a word-order variant of IX.57.1ab prá te dhā́rā
asaścáto, divó ná yanti vṛṣṭáyaḥ.

### 29  
Although it may not be clear from the Engl. tr., the phrase beginning “the strong
one … the lord” refer to Soma (in the acc.), not Indra (in the dat.).

### 30  
On the masc. ṛtáḥ and the phrase ṛtáḥ kavíḥ see comm. ad VIII.60.5, which
contains the same phrase, save for sandhi variation.
## 063
### 01-03
No particular signs of unity, though the dat. índrāya in 2b anticipates the three
datives índrāya víṣṇave … vāyáve in vs. 3.
### 04-06
Thematically somewhat unified by the journey theme.

### 04
Its opening eté asṛgram āśávaḥ is reminiscent of the beginning of the previous
hymn IX.62.1ab eté asṛgram … āśávaḥ.
On hváras- see comm. ad IX.3.2.

### 05
The phrase kṛṇvánto víśvam ā́ryam “making it all Ārya,” esp. in conjunction with
aptúraḥ “crossing the waters,” most likely alludes to the Ārya expansion in their migration
into the northern part of the subcontinent, specifically to crossing frontier rivers and laying
claim to the land on the other side. This territorial expansion is implicitly compared here to
Soma’s ritual journey. Since, as Ge notes (n. 5b), the Soma cult is specifically Ārya,
importing this practice into new lands would be a key part of the process of Arya-ization.
### 07-09
On this tṛca see publ. intro. In these vss. Soma is compared to the sun, and his
ritual journey compared to the Sun’s daily journey across the sky. At the same time the
purification of the soma is linked with Manu, the first sacrificer (vss. 7-8), and so the
cosmic and the ritual are connected.

### 07
It is specifically stated here that the stream of soma “made the sun shine” (sū́ryam
árocayaḥ), in other words that the ritual activity produced cosmic effects.

### 08
Soma goes from affecting the sun in vs. 7 to identity with the sun in this vs, since
he yokes Etaśa, the sun’s horse, and travels through the midspace as if on the sun’s daily
journey - at least in my interpr. and that of Ge. But the vs. can be interpr. in a number of
diff. ways, in part because the sū́ra of the Saṃhitā text is multiply ambiguous. If its
underlying form is sū́raḥ, per the Pp., it can be either gen./abl. to svàr- (so Sāy., as well as
Ge and the publ. tr.) or nom. sg. to sū́ra-; however, it could also be underlying sū́re and a
loc. to sū́ra-. (Re also allows the dat., presumably to svàr-, but the only clear dat. to this
stem is accented sūré [IV.3.8]; sū́re duhitā́[I.34.5] is actually an old gen. with close sandhi
effect before dental, likewise in IX.97.38; see my Fs. Melchert article, “Sū́re Duhitár's
Brother, the ‘Placer of the Sun’: Another Example of -e <*-as in Rigvedic Phrasal Sandhi,”
2010.). In any case, an underlying sū́raḥ is more likely than sū́re because of the sū́ro in the
next vs. (9b), which repeats much of the verbal material in this one.
Lü (215-16) objects to Ge’s interpr. of the vs., on the basis that the sun always
travels through heaven, and here the travel is through the midspace (antárikṣena). So in his
view this cannot refer to heavenly Soma identified with the sun, but must refer to the earthly
Soma, who takes the name Sūra (hence sū́raḥ is a nominative for him) and yokes a horse
named Etaśa after the Sun’s horse, and journeys towards heaven through the midspace. In
other words, his Soma seems as if he’s trying to steal the sun’s identity by stealing his
names. I confess that the subtleties of Lü’s distinctions escape me, depending as they do on
his strict separation of earthly and heavenly elements throughout his Varuṇa vols. Re seems
to adopt some version of the Lü interpr., judging from his tr. of bc “… pour qu’il aille du
(domaine de) Manu (au ciel) à travers l’espace-médian,” interpr. manā́v ádhi as if it
contained an abl. manór before ádhi. (He interpr. the same two pādas two hymns later
[IX.65.16bc] quite differently.) I do see the point about the midspace, however, and am
willing to concede that Soma-as-Sun is not quite as high a flyer as the Sun himself. Bl
(RReps ad loc.) also considers sū́raḥ a nom., but in his view this expresses “the complete
assimiliation of Soma Pavamāna to the sun,” which is a different conclusion from Lü’s. The
point is surely not whether Soma is literally in heaven, but that he has acquired and displays
the salient characteristics of the Sun and is therefore identified with the Sun despite
remaining in the ritual arena.

### 09
Pāda b of this vs., sū́ro ayukta yā́tave, consists entirely of words repeated from the
previous vs.; in addition, substituting for étaśam in 8a, we find an expanded horse term, tyā́
haríto dáśa “these ten tawny mares” as obj. of ayukta. Again Soma is being identified with
the sun and his ritual journey identified with the sun’s transit; again the cosmic and the ritual
are intertwined, for the ten mares are probably both the Sun’s horses (as Lü points out, p.
216 n. 4, the Sun is credited with ten yoked horses in I.164.14; cf. also sū́ryasya harítaḥ in
V.29.5) and the ten fingers of the priests that press the soma, exactly so called (haríto dáśa)
in IX.38.3.
The third pāda (índur índra íti bruván) presents another set of problems: how much
of what precedes íti is part of the direct speech and what is the content of the speech? See
Old’s clear formulation of these questions. The standard solution is to take the speech as
including both words preceding íti and to take it as a statement of identity; e.g., Ge’s “Der
Saft ist Indra” (sim. Old, Lü 216 n. 4, Klein DGRV I.407), in part on the basis of a similar
TB statement (see Ge n. 9c), though I don’t think this late parallel should be given much
weight. Moreover, IX.6.2 índav índra íti …, with voc. índo outside of the quotation, shows
that the ‘drop’ word does not have to be included in the quotation here. In addition, the
sandhi of índra íti is ambig.: it can represent nom. índraḥ with the Pp (and the standard
interpr.), but it could also be loc. índre, the choice made by Re (“… en disant « c’est bien
(pour aller) à Indra »”). In conjunction with the journey theme of this tṛca, I find this interpr.
quite appealing and have adopted it.
### 10-12
No particular unity, though vss. 11-12 are concerned with wealth.

### 10  
The datives vāyáve … índrāya of course identify this as a ref. to the morning
soma pressing, where both those gods receive the soma, and also echo the same datives (in
diff. order) in vs. 3.
If gíraḥ opening pāda b is an acc. pl. (as seems likely), it is somewhat awkwardly
placed between two reff. to soma, sutám and matsarám, ending their respective pādas (a and
b). All the acc.s should be objects of pári … siñcata ‘pour in circles’, which obviously fits
the soma liquid better than the songs. Probably for this reason Gr identifies the form as a
voc., the only voc. to the stem, but this certainly does not improve the sense: commanding
the songs to pour the soma is appreciably worse than ordering unidentified priests to pour
songs as well as soma. Elizarenkova’s tr. (Language and Style of the Vedic Ṛṣis, p. 85)
exemplifies this awkwardness however unintentionally: “From here make libation rounds
for Vāyu, for Indra, of the pressed intoxication, O eulogies (or: O eulogizers), onto the sheep
strainer!” She claims that the root noun gír- can be used as an agent (hence her “O
eulogizers”; Sāy. and Ludwig also take it as agentive: see Ge n. 10b), but I know of no such
usage of this extremely common noun. On the other hand, the trope of “pouring prayers” is
not rare in the RV, though pouring them onto the fleece strainer is a bit extreme. Re solves
the problem by supplying a separate verb to govern gíraḥ (“émettez”), but this seems a
typical cop-out on his part.
As in the previous hymn (see comm. ad IX.62.18), the priests are addressed in the
2nd pl. here (pári … siñcata). See also vs. 19, with the same verb.

### 11  
On vidā́as lengthened impv. rather than subjunctive vidā́(ḥ), see comm. ad
IX.19.6. It is accented because it is preceded by a voc. in zero-position.
### 13-15
Again no particular signs of unity. The unmixed (“clear” śukrá-) soma in 14 is
contrasted with the soma mixed with curds (dádhyāśir-) in 15.

### 13  
As in the tṛca vss. 7-9, Soma is again compared to the Sun - but curiously no
clear point of comparison between them appears in the vs. The actions attributed to Soma
here - purifying himself, being pressed by stones, putting his sap in the tub - are exclusive
to him and certainly not characteristic of the Sun.

### 14  
In vs. 5 during his journey Soma “made it all Ārya”; here he crosses these Ārya
domains (dhā́māny ā́ryā) on his journey to the cows’ milk. My interpr. takes this first acc.
phrase as an acc. of extent, of space traversed, while the acc. in pāda c, vā́jaṃ gómantam I
take as the goal of akṣaran. In the next vs., 15c, pavítram áti “across the filter” has the same
function I see for dhā́māny ā́ryā here, and in fact the filter may be identified as the Ārya
domains. By contrast Ge takes dhā́māny ā́ryā as parallel goal to vā́jaṃ gómantam, while Re
characteristically supplies a separate participle (āviśántaḥ “ont occupé”) to govern dhā́māny
ā́ryā. The parallels he cites in the n. do not seem sufficient to me.
### 16-18
No evidence of unity, beyond vājínam (17b), vā́jaṃ (18c), and the vss. are
quite hackneyed, even for Soma Gāyatrī hymns.
### 19-21
This tṛca has more internal unity, as well as connection to the preceding tṛca,
than usual. For its external connections, see 19a vā́je ná vājayúm picking up the vāj- forms
just noted, mádhumattamam in 19c matching the same word (in the nom.) in 16a, and 20a
kavím mṛjanti echoing 17a tám ī mṛjanti (note the identical vowel pattern in kavím / tám ī).
As for internal connections, see dhībhíḥ (20b, 21a), víprāḥ (20b, 21c), and vṛ́ṣā (20c),
vṛ́ṣaṇam (221a).

### 19  
This vs. contains a fairly clever double meaning: the verb pári √sic means
‘sprinkle around / in circles’. When soma is the object, as it generally is, it refers to the
sprinkling of the drops of soma; in other words, the acc. expresses the material that is being
sprinkled. But here in the simile vā́je ná vājayúm, the acc. vājayúm ‘prize-seeking’ refers to
a horse in a race or contest, which would be the target or the goal of the sprinkling, with
some type of liquid being sprinkled upon it. The word play is cleverer still, in that vājayúm
should be read twice, both as referring to the horse in the simile and to soma, which is
elsewhere modified by this word (e.g., IX.44.4 sá naḥ pavasva vājayúḥ), in the frame.
Both Ge and Re construe vā́je in the simile rather loosely; I take it as a unmarked loc.
absol. of the dháne hité (“when the prize is set,” e.g., IX.53.2) type, though without overt
ppl. It adds to the somewhat slant syntax of the simile versus the frame that both contain a
loc. (ávyo vā́reṣu in the frame), but the locc. have different functions. In fact ávyo vā́reṣu
“onto the sheep’s fleece” expresses the goal of the sprinkling and is functionally parallel to
vājayúm in the simile.

### 20  
Note kavím (of Soma) contrasting with víprāḥ, the human poets who groom him.
### 22-24
A form of páva- in each vs.: 22a pávasva, 23a pávamāna, 24a pavase, a
pattern that is repeated in the next tṛca.

### 22  
As in vs. 10, the joint appearance of Indra and Vāyu signals the morning soma
pressing.
On āyuṣák (also IX.25.5) see the sensible disc. of Scar (589-90). Note the presence
of the Āyus grooming the soma in vs. 17.

### 23  
On (ní) √tuś see comm. ad VIII.38.2.
### 25-27
This tṛca shows clear signs of unity, indeed of a monotonous sort. Like the
previous tṛca, each vs. in this one contains a form of páva-, but in this tṛca all three are the
nom. pl. part. pávamānā(sā)ḥ, always opening the vs. Each vs. also contains one finite verb,
an augmented form of √sṛj (asṛkṣata 25a, 27b; asṛgram 26b). The first two vss. also contain
nom. pl. índavaḥ in the same metrical position (final in the b pāda). The lexeme ápa √han
found in the previous tṛca (apaghnán 24a) also reappears here (26c ghnántaḥ … ápa) (and
in the next tṛca).
### 28-30
The páva- sequence found in the last two tṛcas is brought to an end with the
alternative pres. part. punānáḥ ‘becoming purified’, which opens this last tṛca. The lexeme
ápa √han also found in once each in the last two tṛcas (24a, 26c) occurs in the first two vss.:
ápa … jahí (28b, c), apaghnán (29a).

### 30  
The first pāda of this, the final vs., echoes the last pāda of the first vs.: 1c asmé
śrávāṃsi dhāraya, 30a asmé vásūni dhāraya. It is also worth noting that this 2nd sg. impv.
dhāraya ‘secure’ is phonologically almost identical to the instr. sg. dhā́rayā ‘with/in a
stream’, which ends the first pāda of this tṛca (28a) and which is found four other times in
the hymn (4c, 7a, 14b, 21b), always in the same metrical position.
## 064
### 01-03
As noted in the publ. intro., this opening tṛca is marked by the identification of
Soma and his attributes with a bull (vṛ́ṣan-). This theme is especially dominant in vss. 1 and
2: all three pādas of vs. 1 open vṛ́ṣā, with the bahuvrīhi vṛ́ṣa-vrataḥ ending the first
hemistich; vs. 2 is even more insistent, with two forms of the stem (or deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya-) in
each of the three pādas. By contrast, vs. 3 only nods at the theme: vṛ́ṣā appears once in 3a,
though the final word of the vs., vṛdhi, may be meant to echo the word phonologically.

### 01
Old’s interpr. of vṛ́ṣā in c as a neut. pl. adj. with dhármāṇi seems both unnecessary
and unlikely. I know of no other neut. forms of vṛ́ṣan- (the few cited by Old are not
convincing), which suggests to me that, despite its widely accepted classification as an adj.,
the stem is synchronically a masc. noun, which, however, can be used as an adjunct
strengthener of another noun, hence “bull X” as the equivalent of “bullish X” - a usage
similar to English ‘horse’ as an augmentative, meaning ‘strong, large, coarse’ (as in, for ex.,
horseradish). See https://www.etymonline.com/word/horseradish Moreover, since nom. sg.
vṛ́ṣā opens the two previous pādas of this vs., it seems unlikely that a morphologically
different, and at the least very rare, phonologically identical form would open the third -
esp. since, when a neut. adj. is required in the next vs. (2a), the deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya- is employed.

### 03
As noted above, the bull theme gets suddenly muted in this vs.; in compensation, as
it were, other animals are introduced: a horse (a), cows and steeds (b).
Opinions vary on how to render the first two pādas, in part because of uncertainty
about the verb cakradaḥ. Given the immediately preceding simile áśvo ná, the verb should
be intransitive in the sense ‘roar, whinny’; this matches the usage of the simple thematic
(aor.?) krada- in passages like IX.97.28 áśvo ná krado vŕ̥ṣabhir yujānáḥ “Like a horse you
whinny on being yoked by the bulls.” However, the b pāda, sáṃ gā́ḥ … sám árvataḥ, with
two acc. pl.s makes problems. Ge jury-rigs what we might call a semi-transitive usage of the
verb with sám, “zusammenbrüllen” (‘roar [smtg] together’)(see also Ober I.518), while
registering the intransitive usage in the simile parenthetically: “Wie ein Ross (wiehernd)
sollst du, der Bulle, uns Rinder und Rennpferde zusammen brüllen (brausen).” Despite the
precarious nature of this solution, it may be the best one available, and I would entertain an
alternative tr. “You the bull roar like a horse, (roaring) together cows and steeds.” I adopt a
similar one in the publ. tr. for the very similar passage IX.90.4 sáṃ cikrado mahó
asmábhyaṃ vā́jān, with the variant stem cikrada-, also cited by Ge and Re, though I am not
certain I subscribe to that now (see comm. ad loc.). By contrast, Re clearly takes cakradaḥ
as a trans./caus. redupl. aor.: “Tel un cheval, fais mugir ensemble … les vaches … ensemble
(fais hennir) les coursiers.” However, the clear intrans. sense of krada- with the simile in the
parallel passage cited above speaks against the caus. usage; moreover, as disc. at length in
my -áya-book (110-11), neither cakrada- nor the redupl. aor. cikrada- with apparent
“caus.” redupl. shows true transitive usage until the late RV; they also seem to be essentially
interchangeable.
I have a different solution for this passage (though it won’t work for IX.90.4): it is of
course a commonplace that the preverbs sám and ví form a complementary pair. Here I
suggest that the standard lexeme ví √vṛ ‘uncover, open up’ found in c has given rise
situationally to an opposing expression sám √vṛ ‘cover, surround’ in b, with the verb gapped
(or rather anticipated: vṛdhi at the end of c). The bull is urged to deliver cows and horses to
us by confining them. The proposed lexeme sám √vṛ does marginally exist; see I.121.15,
with sám … varanta in intrans. value, as well as ppl. sáṃvṛta- (VIII.17.7). I thus read the
verb cakradaḥ only with pāda a.
### 04-06
No strong signs of unity. Vs. 4 does link to vs. 3 in the preceding tṛca through
the mention of cows and horses. The c pādas of 5 and 6 both begin with a finite form of
páva-.

### 04
In addition to the link to vs. 3 just mentioned, pāda c contains a clever echo of 2a.
That earlier pāda ends with the neut. s-stem śávaḥ ‘strength’; 4c ends vīrayā́śávaḥ, to be
analyzed as two words vīrayā́āśávaḥ “with a yen for heroes the swift ones,” the latter being
the nom. pl. m. of the adj. āśú-. But the final + initial vowels have entirely coalesced, and
given the accentuation of both words and the underlying long final vowel of the first word,
they could have been split vīrayā́*śávaḥ with the latter entirely matching the independent sstem form in 2a.

### 06
The preverb ā́that turns páva- into a quasi-transitive “bring by purifying oneself”
immediately follows the verb, allowing pávantām to take a position matching. that of
pávante in 5c and pávamānasya in 7a.
### 07-09
As just noted, pávamānasya in 7a chains with forms to the same stem in vss. 5
and 6. 7b prá … asṛkṣata also echoes ásṛkṣata prá, which opens the previous tṛca (4a). The
tṛca is unified by the similes comparing Soma to the Sun in vss. 7 and 9, possibly found also
in the beacon (ketú-) of vs. 8.

### 07
The root noun cmpd viśva-víd-, like other -víd- cmpds, is completely ambiguous
between ‘knowing all’ and ‘finding all’ (for viśvavíd- itself see Scar 489 and more generally
480-93). In this context, given Soma’s bestowal of “all goods” (víśvā … vásu) in the
previous vs. (6a), as well as Soma’s journey to all forms in 8b, ‘all-finding’ seems
preferable.
The simile in c, sū́ryasyeva ná ráśmayaḥ, is redundantly marked, with adjacent simile
particles iva ná. There is no structural reason for this; it must result from the attempt to fit
the simile sū́ryasyeva raśmáyaḥ found elsewhere in trimeter verse (see nearby IX.69.6, also
I.135.9, V.55.3, X.91.4) into a dimeter line. Or, to be more precise, to accommodate the fact
that when a form of sū́rya- opens a vs. line, it does not show distraction to sū́r
i
ya-, in order
to avoid placing a light syllable in 2nd position. In a dimeter line, in which this simile has to
occupy the whole pāda, the failure to distract produces a 7-syllable line, and so ná was
presumably added to fill the gap in the line. In a trimeter line that has the simile in initial
position (with undistracted sū́ryasyeva), further material can be added at the end (so I.135.9,
IX.69.6), and in a trimeter line where the simile follows the caesura, sū́ryasyeva can be
distracted (so V.55.3, X.91.4) in that position.

### 08
As noted above, it’s quite possible, even likely, that the beacon in pāda a is a
reference to the sun and therefore another assimilation of Soma to the Sun, as is more
explicit in vss. 7 and 9. For the association between ketú- and the sun, cf., e.g., VII.63.2
ketúḥ … sū́ryasya. Lü (702) suggests rather that the ketú- is lightning, without argument.
Ge renders b as “… rinnst du ... alle Farben annehmend”; similar Lü (702) “strömst
du vom Himmel her in alle Erscheinungsformen.” But the acc. with abhí √ṛṣ is always a
goal (to choose just one example, cf. nearby IX.62.3 abhy àrṣanti suṣṭutím “they rush
towards the lovely praise-hymn”), and I don’t see where (or why) they get their alternative
interpr. By my interpr. the “all forms” to which the soma rushes could be the materials the
soma will be mixed with (water, milk), or everything found on the ritual ground, or indeed
everything on earth and in the midspace, the “all goods” of vs. 6.

### 09
Pāda b, pávamāna vídharmaṇi, is found three times (here, IX.4.9, and IX.100.7) in
three different syntactic contexts, so this has to be the constituency: the voc. plus the loc. Re
takes the ‘speech’ (vā́cam) from pāda a as the implicit subject of vídharmaṇi (“pour qu’elle
se répande au loin”), but because speech is lacking in the other occurrences of the pāda, this
cannot be correct. Most helpful for the interpr. is the fuller expression in IX.86.30 (also
adduced by Ober II.152) tvám pavítre rájaso vídharmaṇi ... pavamāna pūyase “You, selfpurifying soma, are purified in the filter, in the spreading expanse of space ...,” where the
spread of the soma liquid across the fleece filter is compared to the spread (probably of
light) in cosmic space (rájas-).
The simile in the third pāda, ákrān devó ná sū́ryaḥ “you have roared like the Sungod,” is abrupt in its imagery, in that roaring is not the first quality we associate with the
sun. There are several ways to account for the phraseology. In Old’s view (fld by Lü 258),
the shared quality of Soma and Sun is not expressed by the verb, which is independent of
the simile. This independence would be comparable to that found in the preceding hymn,
IX.63.13, where the same simile (sómo devó ná sū́ryaḥ) is found, with a different but
equally incompatible verb phrase ádribhiḥ … sutáḥ “pressed by stones,” which is certainly
not true of the Sun. This is the easiest solution. Ge (n. 9c) suggests rather that it’s a
condensed comparison to the Sun’s horse (sim. Ober I.224). In my view, Old’s interpr. is
strictly correct, but I think the poet, by juxtaposing the simile with an apparently
inappropriate verb, is forcing the striking image of a roaring Sun, which both works as a
kind of synaesthesia (the intense brightness of the sun is experienced as intense noise) and
imposes a third intermediate term, a horse or bull, to which both the Sun and Soma are
compared.
### 10-12
There are some unifying features in this tṛca. Although this is hardly striking
in the IXth Maṇḍala, all three vs. contain a form of √pū, with those in vss. 11, 12 the
identical phrase pavítra ā́“in the filter. The word índu- opens the first and last pādas of the
tṛca (10a, 12c). The cmpd devā-vī́- ‘pursuing the gods’ in 11b is echoed by its splv. devavī́tama- in 12b. More subtly, the missing obj. of sṛját in 10c is most likely ‘wave’, found in
the resumptive rel. cl. opening vs. 11, ūrmír yáḥ … For the VP ūrmím √sṛj see VI.17.12
asṛja ūrmím apā́m adduced by Old.

### 11  
This vs. is entirely a rel. cl. and most comfortably adjoins vs. 10 (see comm.
immed. above) - pace Lü (603-4), who attaches 11 to 12.
### 13-15
Again, each vs. has a form of √pū, for what that’s worth (pavasva 13a,
punānáḥ 14a, 15a). In 15a devá-vītaye links to the rt. noun cmpd devā́-vī́- (deva-vī́tama- in
the previous tṛca, 11b, 12b).
### 16-18
The first two vss. of this tṛca both contain nom. ‘drops’ (índavaḥ) and their
acc. goal, the sea (samudrám); their first pādas also both contain nom. pl. pres. middle
athem. participles with the extended ending -āsaḥ, hinvānā́saḥ and marmṛjānā́saḥ
respectively. The third vs. stands apart.

### 18  
The opening of pāda a #pári no yāhi gets remixed into c #pāhi naḥ.
### 19-21
The undiscerning (ápracetasaḥ) in 20c are contrasted with the discerning
(prácetasaḥ 21b) and the undiscriminating (ávicetasaḥ 21c). The first vs. (19) of the tṛca
does not participate.

### 19  
Etaśa, the Sun’s horse, who figured in the previous hymn (IX.63.8), reappears
here. In the previous passage Soma yoked Etaśa; here he is identified as Etaśa and is himself
yoked.
The interpr. of this vs. is considerably complicated by the universal (Sāy., Gr, Ge,
Re, Lü 216, 269) assignment of the main clause verb mímāti to √mā ‘bellow’). This leaves
padám in b with nothing to do. In Lü’s 2nd tr. (269) it is the place towards which Etaśa
bellows (“… weihert das Etaśa-Ross dem Orte zu”), a transl. that at least does not violate
the syntactic structure of the vs. Otherwise the solutions involve on the one hand plucking
padám out of the b pāda, which remains part of the main clause, and construing it loosely in
the dependent clause of c - an egregious violation of RVic syntax. So Ge: “Es brüllt das
Zugross von den Sängern angeschirrt, wenn er in den Ozean gesetzt den Schritt vorwärts
(tut).” And even with this trick Ge needs to supply a verb (“tut”) with which to construe
padám. The other solutions violate RVic syntax less dramatically, but violate it they do - by
making the b pāda part of the yád clause with c, though this would place the yád
unacceptably deep into its clause. Lü’s 1st solution (216) is almost identical to Ge’s
(including the crucial “den Schritt vorwärts (tut)”) except that he takes b with c, not a. Re
deals with padám differently, but still takes b with c: “Il hennit ... quand, attelé par les
chantres, il a été placé en avant, en (son) sejour, (à savoir) sur l'océan.” In addition to
sweeping b into the c clause, his interpr. requires ā́hitaḥ to take an acc. of place, padám
(“placé … en (son) séjour”), which is resumed by a loc., samudré (“(à savoir) sur l'océan”).
This supposed acc. usage with ā́√dhā is unparalleled.
The interpr. of the vs. is almost magically simplified by assigning mímāti to a
different root, √mā ‘measure’, which builds a homonymous redupl. pres. mímāti, which is in
fact far better attested than the one to √mā ‘bellow’. Although many of its forms are medial,
there are a considerable number of act. forms, particularly the impv. mimīhi. I suggest that
we have here an idiom “measure (its) pace (<step),” a reasonable activity for a draught
horse. I suggest a similar interpr. of the cmpd mitá-dru- (see comm. ad IV.6.5), where I take
the 1st member as the ppl. of √mā ‘measure’. This interpr. allows padám to be the obj. of
the verb in the main cl. and keeps the two clauses separate. And it certainly makes as much
sense for the Sun’s horse to be moving at measured pace through the sky as for it to be
bellowing.

### 21  
On vená- see comm. ad VIII.100.5.
### 22-24
The mention of the divine recipients of the soma in vss. 22 and 24 marks this
tṛca, though the middle vs. lacks this feature. The (human) inspired poets (víprāḥ) in 23
implicitly contrast with the kaví- Soma, addressed in the voc. in 24. Note also that this is the
third tṛca in a row that refers to sitting on (or coming to) “the womb of truth” (17c, 20ab,
22c), a trope found also in 11c; all four expressions are slightly different, though containing
the same basic elements: 11c sī́dann ṛtásya yónim ā́, 17c ágmann ṛtásya yónim ā́, 20ab ā́…
yóniṃ hiraṇyáyam … ṛtásya sī́dati, 22c ṛtásya yónim āsádam. For further on this trope see
comm. ad vs. 30 below.

### 23  
A minor poetic echo, the rhyming openings of pāda a táṃ tvā and c sáṃ tvā.
### 25-27
The unusual acc. expression vā́cam … sahásrabharṇasam is found in both 25
and 26 (in different order). For sahásra-bharṇas- see comm. ad IX.60.2. All three vss.
contain the nom. sg. masc. punānáḥ.
### 28-30
The contrast between the two types of soma drinks, pure and mixed with milk,
are highlighted in this tṛca, at least in my view: 28c sómāḥ śukrā́gávāśiraḥ describes them
straightforwardly, while 30ab ṛdhák … saṃjagmānáḥ “separately (and) uniting (with milk)”
is more cryptic.

### 28  
On pari √stubh see nearby IX.62.24. It is not entirely clear to me how the kṛ́p-
(form, body) of Soma would ‘encircle with chant/rhythm’, since its physical form should
not be producing noise. More common is the association of kṛ́p- with light (esp. the light of
Agni), as Re points out (cf. VI.2.6 kṛpā́… rocase, VII.3.9 sváyā kṛpā́tanvā̀rócamānaḥ), but
in our passage rucā́and kṛpā́are parallel and independent. A passive sense ‘encircled with
chant/rhythm’ (so Re) would work better in context, but that seems precluded by the use of
the act. stem stóbha-.

### 29  
Pāda a contains what appears to be an etymological figure, but I consider it
somewhat trickier than that. The first two word, hinvānó hetṛ́bhiḥ, are transparently related
and easy to construe together, and IX.13.6 hiyānā́ná hetṛ́bhiḥ “like (horses) being driven by
their drivers” displays the same apparent configuration. However, the instr. in our passage is
followed by a ppl. yatáḥ ‘held, guided’, which is regularly preceded by an instr. agent, often
nṛ́bhiḥ (approx. 10x in IX), or in this very hymn, vs. 15 vājíbhir yatáḥ “guided by the prizeseekers.” So I suggest that hetṛ́bhiḥ is actually the agent for following yatáḥ, though also
adjacent to its etymological kin - a fine twist on the RVic poetic trick of positioning a word
between two words both of which it could be (or indeed is) connected to. A more literal
rendering of the pāda would be “ "... impelled, by the impellers held.”
The simile in c is problematic for several reasons. To begin with, the subject of ab is
singular, but the simile must be couched in the plural, given the pres. part. sī́dantaḥ. This is
less of a problem than it appears: first, this hymn and soma hymns in general regularly
switch back and forth between sg. (soma) and pl. (soma drinks / drops, etc.) referring to the
same substance, and this could easily be a unmarked case of that. Moreover, if the target of
the simile is in the pl., it can have attracted the participle into the pl.
This raises the question: what is soma being compared to? and the related but more
technical question: is vanúṣaḥ nom. pl. (and therefore the simile target) or some other case
(acc. pl., abl./gen. sg.)? Because we need something to license the pl. of sī́dantaḥ and
because we need something to compare the soma to, taking vanúṣaḥ as nom. pl. seems the
most economical solution - although this requires discounting the attractive parallel
adduced by Ge, I.26.3 sī́dantu mánuṣo yathā. In that passage mánuṣaḥ, which rhymes with
our vanúṣaḥ, is gen. sg. (and the pl. impv. sī́dantu simply agrees with the pl. subject in ab).
That vanúṣaḥ is nom. pl. is also the judgment of Ge and Re, though with vastly different
semantics. Ge “wie die wetteifernden Reiter(?)” (I have no idea where he gets the “riders,”
and his question mark shows his uncertainty about it; nonetheless it was taken up by Ober
[II.245] as evidence for horseback riding in the RV!); Re “(s’asseyant au séjour du Ṛta)
comme les dévots qui s’(y) asseoient.” Re seems closer to the mark, though still pretty far
from it. Because of the repetition noted above (ad 22-24) of the trope “sit on the womb of
truth” (4x in this hymn), it seems likely that sī́dant- here would evoke this recurrent
expression, which is certainly appropriate to the soma (drinks) that are the subject of the
simile. It is more difficult to identify who or what vanúṣaḥ refers to. This stem, and the
associated denom. verb, can have both positive and negative values, expressing various
types of eagerness and craving: “striving, eager, zealous, etc.” on the one hand (hence Re’s
dévots), “over-zealous, covetous, rapacious, etc.” on the other. Before identifying its usage
in this particular passage, I’d like to introduce a third term into the simile. In similes
involving sitting, the comparandum is often a bird - e.g., śyenáḥ in nearby IX.61.21 =

### 19  
sī́dañ chyenó ná yónim ā́, as well as IX.96.23 śakunáḥ ná pátvā and with the pl.
VIII.21.5 sī́dantas te váyo yathā “sitting like birds” very similar to our passage. I suggest
that birds are the underlying comparandum here as well, and that this underlying target is
qualified by vanúṣaḥ ‘rapacious’, or, as I render it “raptor (birds).” This produces a more
satisfying, or at least more interesting, simile than Re’s “like devotées,” and it is constructed
from readily available elements - though it does require more machinery.

### 30  
As indicated above (ad 28-30), I believe that the unmixed and mixed soma drinks
are referred to here, though no interpr. I know of shares this opinion. The adv. ṛ́dhak (so
accented) means ‘separately, apart’; the form ṛdhák with final accent is found only here, and
it is difficult to assess what the accentual difference means: is it just a mistake or
meaningless variant? or is it meant to signal some change in grammatical function or
meaning? If we can fancifully imagine an internal derivation of adverbs quasi-parallel to
that of bráhman- à brahmán-, yáśas- à yaśás-, perhaps ṛdhák refers to something
characterized by separateness. With a further flight of fancy, we can suggest that this would
be the unmixed soma, referred to unequivocally two vss. earlier as śukrá- (28c), and
contrasting with the soma that “unites” (saṃjagmāná-) with milk, again straightforwardly
referred to in 28c as gávāśir-. Although neither of the terms in vs. 30 is elsewhere used of a
type of soma, at least as far as I know, the contrastive pairing was set up at the beginning of
the tṛca and could, I would assert, have been decoded by a RVic audience and applied to the
more opaque expressions here. I will not discuss the alternative interpr. (Ge, Re, Lü 259,
Ober I.457, II.143), which differ wildly from mine and from each other and, in the case of
Ge and Re, depend on an out-of-date interpr. of ṛ́dhak.
## 065
On the qualities of this hymn as a whole, see publ. intro.
### 01-03
No particular signs of unity. Vss. 2 and 3 have forms of the pres. part.
pávamāna- and 3 also the impv. ā́… pavasva, but esp. in this hymn, the appearance of these
forms is hardly noteworthy. Vss. 2 and 3 also have devébhyaḥ in their b pādas, but in
different cases.

### 01
The identification of Soma with the Sun, noted passim above in the last two hymns,
here begins the hymn.
The tr. “rosy (fingers)” is of course an unauthorized allusion to Homer’s “rosyfingered dawn” - though it is more legitimate than it might first appear. The word tr. ‘rosy’,
úsri-, is ultimately derived from the ‘dawn’ word; cf. the related usrá-, usríya-, both of
which are color terms representing the light of dawn (‘ruddy’) generally applied to bovines.
The next pāda, with its fem. subj. svásāro jāmáyaḥ “kindred sisters” is a standard way of
referring to the fingers of the priests that prepare the soma (cf., e.g., IX.89.4). Thus the first
two pādas superimpose two images: the ruddy Dawn(s) impelling the sun, the fingers
impelling the soma - allowing each to participate in the imagery of the other. Because of the
erotic relationship sometimes depicted between Dawn and the Sun, it would be better to tr.
pátim in b as “their husband” (with Ge, Re), not ‘lord’ as in the publ. tr. - making one more
link between the imagery of pādas a and b.
Note that Ge nodded (slightly) in tr. mahā́n índum as “den grossen Indra,” enabled by
the constant association between those two words in IX.

### 02
The āmreḍita rucā́-rucā evokes the single instr. rucā́at the end of the preceding
hymn, IX.64.28 (also vs. 13 of the same hymn and vs. 27 of this one).
Pāda c is characterized by alliteration of an unremarkable type: víśvā vásūny ā́viśa.

### 03
Both Ge and Re take devébhyaḥ as dat. with dúvaḥ: “Eifer für die Götter,”
“l’hommage aux dieux,” whereas in the publ. tr. I take it as an abl., “friendship from the
gods.” The issue is the multivalence of dúvas- and its derivatives; in the meaning
‘friendship’ it generally refers to the mutually agreeable relationship between men and gods.
In this context it seemed to me odd to order Soma to “bring [us] through purification”
friendship for the gods, hence my ablatival interpr. However, a more detailed examination
of the usage of dúvas- and the denom. duvasyá- shows that the offering / seeking of dúvasgenerally goes from men to gods (or Agni, as the god closest to men, to gods). E.g., devéṣu
kṛṇuto dúvaḥ “The two [= married couple] do friendly service to the gods”; III.3.1 agnír hí
devā́m̐amṛ́to duvasyati “For Agni the immortal does friendly service to / befriends the
gods.” I therefore would emend the tr. to datival “bring … friendship for the gods.” Like the
parallel obj. suṣṭutím ‘good praise’, dúvas- is then something that we mortals offer to the
gods, but, though it originates from us, it is Soma who stimulates our production of these
offerings, hence ā́… pavasva “bring by purifying yourself.”
### 04-06
No obvious signs of unity

### 06
On druṇā́see comm. ad IX.1.2.
### 07-09
Again no signs of unity.

### 07
The vs. contains an address (in pl.) to priest-singers to sing (gāyata), with
comparison to a previous singer Vyaśva (vyaśvavát ‘like Vyaśva’) who did the same. Why
Vyaśva appears here is something of a mystery. Aside from a bare mention in an Aśvin list
hymn (I.112.15), Vyaśva is found only in VIII, where he is identified as a ṛṣi (VIII.9.10,
23.10) and his descendants receive the dakṣiṇā at the end of the sacrifice (VIII.24.28-29).
The adv. vyaśvavát ‘like Vyaśva’ is found 3x in that little group of hymns in VIII (23-26),
attributed in the Anukramaṇī to one of his descendents, Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva. I don’t know
why he should surface once in IX; our hymn is not attributed to him or any of his obvious
relatives (rather to Bhṛgu Vāruṇi or Jamadagni Bhārgava), and there is nothing particularly
somic about his appearances in VIII - though his descendents may once be called somín-
‘having or providing soma” (VIII.24.29; see comm. ad loc.). He is more closely associated
with the Aśvins (I.112.15 just mentioned; VIII.9.10, 26.9 [both Aśvin hymns]).

### 08
The construction of the first hemistich is somewhat tricky. The rel. yásya must
refer to soma, with the rel. cl. hanging off vs. 7. In pāda a the yásya qualifies várṇam
‘color’, which serves as obj. of hinvánti in b. “They impel his color” is a slightly odd
locution, and it becomes odder in b, with the acc. hárim. The stem hári- is a color term and
could qualify várṇa- (“tawny color”), but it also is regularly applied directly to soma (e.g.,
in vss. 12 and 25 of this hymn) and also identifies Indra’s horse(s). Ge (n. 8b) cleverly
suggests that hári- is to be read twice, with the second reading an unmarked simile referring
to a horse of the appropriate color. This provides a more appropriate obj. for hinvánti (“they
impel (like) a fallow bay (horse)”), while connecting the putative horse with the “tawny
color” (várṇam … hárim) that is the 1st obj. of the verb.
### 10-12
Again, no particular signs of unity.

### 10  
The function of the ca in b is unclear. Klein (DGRV I.256-57) discusses three
possible explanations - Ge’s, Re’s, and one of his own - of which he prefers Re’s: that
marútvate ca conceals an ellipsis “(for the Maruts) and (for Indra) accompanied by the
Maruts,” which seems by far the least likely and the most cumbersome. Among other things,
the Maruts barely figure in IX (though cf. vs. 20 below), and I also know of no passages
containing marútvant- that also contain a free form of marút-. My solution is admittedly
makeshift but simpler, that cs conjoins the disharmonious dhā́rayā “in a stream” and
marútvate … matsaráḥ “exhilarating drink for Indra.” This is closest to Ge’s, criticized by
Klein as assuming “a harsh conjunction in pādas a and b.”

### 11  
With Ge (n. 11a) I tentatively assume that the arms (oṇyòḥ) are Indra’s, since he
was mentioned in the preceding vs. But as in IX.16.1 they might belong to the officiant.
### 13-15
Again, no signs of unity.

### 15  
A rare sign of hostility (abhimāti-hán- ‘smasher of hostility’) in these anodyne
Gāyatrī assemblages.
### 16-18
The tṛca is thematically unified by the journey of Soma and, in vss. 17-18 his
conveying good things to us on that journey. Cf. esp. 17 ā́naḥ … váhā and 18 ā́naḥ …
bhara. All three vss. end in a purpose dative / dative infinitive: 16 yā́tave, 17 ūtáye, 18
devávītaye.

### 16  
īyate is assigned to √yā/ī ‘implore, beseech’ by numerous scholars, incl. Gr, Lub,
and Lü (214-15: “Der König wird mit Liedern gebeten”), though Ge, Re and the publ. tr.
take it to √yā/ī ‘speed’ (so also Sāy., who glosses gacchati). In favor of the latter, Re
declares that īyate is always “il s’avance” in IX. I would also point out 1) the king is
definitely traveling in pāda c (yā́tave, to the same root) and 2) the ‘is sped’ interpr. is
supported by a passage like IX.26.3 táṃ vedhā́m medháyā́hyan “They impelled the ritual
adept with their wisdom” also containing an instr. of medhā́- with a clear indication of
movement (ahyan). Kulikov (495-96) discusses both root possibilities without seeming to
decide, though the fact that he lists it with 2
yā (ī) ‘implore, request’ probably indicates his
choice.
śatagvínam gávām póṣam, lit. “thriving of cattle that possesses hundredfold cattle”
(vel sim.), redundantly codes the cattle twice (-gvínam gávām).

### 18  
The s-stem neut. júvas- is a hapax, contrasting with the more conventionally
formed and somewhat better attested jávas-. The zero-gr. root syllable is of course
anomalous (see AiG II.2.232, without explanation), though see nearby dúvaḥ (vs. 3b),
whatever its source. It may owe its form (or have been encouraged in maintaining its form)
by the properly formed homonymous root noun pl. (vayo-)júvaḥ (to -jū́-) in the same
metrical position in 26a below, as well as the aforementioned dúvaḥ also in the same
position in 3b (cf. also ābhúvaḥ 27a, mayobhúvam 28a). A somewhat similar explan. is
given by Re. Given the contextual triggers in this passage, it is probably wise not to invest
too much in a deep diachronic account of the anomalous root syllable.
The simile in b, rūpáṃ ná (or rūpáṃ ná várcase), is difficult to interpr. Ge simply
renders it literally “wie Schönheit unserem Aussehen,” but it is unclear to me what the basis
of comparison is. Re’s rendering goes to the opposite extreme, with a flurry of parentheses:
“comme (on ajoute) la forme-concrète pour (donner) l'éclat (à une idée).” My own interpr.
arises from the parallelism between vss. 17 and 18. In the former we ask Soma to bring
material goods, esp. livestock. Here in pāda a we request abstract qualities, “strength and
speed,” and I suggest that rūpáṃ ná “as if (in) physical form” is assimiliating them to the
material goods of the previous vs. Re’s alt. interpr., given at the end of his n., “apporte-nous
force et vitesse, tel un objet-concret,” is similar and preferable to his more elaborate first
interpr.
### 19-21
No clear cohesion, though vss. 19 and 20 both contain a form of √ṛṣ.
### 22-24
As noted in the publ. intro., this tṛca is thematically unified by a listing of the
many place in which soma can be pressed in 22-23; all these clauses share a single verb
sunviré in 22b. The two vss. are followed by a summary vs. (24) expressing the hope that all
these diverse soma types will bring good things to us. The tṛca also shows signs of formal
cohesion that are rare in these Gāyatrī assemblages: vss. 22-23 consist of six pāda-length
rel. cl., all introduced by yé, with disjunctive vā found in both c pādas, while 24 begins with
the resumptive and summarizing correlative té.

### 22  
The first two pādas contain antonymic locations.
The location in c is taken by Ge/Re as a place name, “in Śaryaṇāvat,” but a place
descriptor seems preferable, given the other locative expressions in these vss. On the word
see comm. ad VIII.6.39 and Thieme, Unters. p. 40 n. 2.

### 23  
Ge and Re (see also Mayr. PN s.vv.) take ārjīkéṣu and kṛ́tvasu as referring to
peoples. On ārjīká- see comm. ad VIII.7.29 and Thieme, Unters. p. 40 n. 2. As for kṛ́tvan-,
since in its other two occurrences in the RV (VIII.24.25, X.144.3) it is adjectival, in the
meaning ‘active, enterprising’, I see no reason why it should be a proper noun only here. I
was tempted to tr. it “ritually active,” but this came uncomfortably close to “sexually
active.”
As for pastyā̀- as ‘dwelling place’, rather than ‘river’ (Ge, Re, etc.), see comm. ad
I.40.7 and IX.97.18.
### 25-27
All three vss. in this tṛca contain a middle form of √hi ‘impel’ (25c hinvānaḥ,
26b hinvānā́saḥ, 27b hinvire, the first two passive, the third transitive. In addition the tṛca
opens and closes with a form of páva- (25a pávate, 27c pavasva).

### 25  
haryató háriḥ “delightful tawny one” is a word play, with two semantically
different stems. This same word play is the focus of a whole hymn, III.44, and obviously
was a staple of RVic phraseology.

### 26  
On the relationship of vayojúvaḥ in pāda a and sáho júvaḥ in 18a, see comm. ad
18 above. Scar (174) hesitates between act. and pass. meaning for this hapax rt. noun cmpd
vayo-jū́-: “die Lebenskraft fördenden” / “von Kraft beschleunigten.” In the publ. tr. I opt for
an intrans. + instr. value: “speeding with vigor,” though I now think passive “sped by vigor”
would be even better, on the basis of the clear pass. forms in context (hinvānā́saḥ …
śrīṇānā́ḥ … mṛñjata) as well as a passage in the immediately preceding hymn, IX.64.16 prá
hinvānā́saḥ ... dhiyā́jūtā́ḥ “Being impelled forth … sped by insightful thoughts,” with the
passive ppl. jūtá-.

### 27  
The pāda-final dat. devátātaye echoes devávītaye in 18c.
### 28-30
As if to make up for scanting tṛca cohesion earlier in the hymn, this tṛca is
bound by bonds of iron: 13 occurrences of ā́, most construed with an acc. of a desirable
object, all sharing a single verb (ā́) vṛṇīmahe (28b). In addition the three c pādas are
identical. This refrain contains the nom. stem pā́nta- ‘drink’, not the pres. part.
## 066
This is the second to the last of the composite Gāyatrī hymns in this maṇḍala; the last
(IX.67) is attributed to a variety of named poets, while the Anukramaṇī assigns this one to
śataṃ vaikhānasaḥ “100 Vaikhānases.” Both attributions seems to acknowledge the
composite nature of these compositions, as opposed to the previous ones, which have a
single poet named for the whole hymn. Still, we would be hard-pressed to assemble 100
Vaikhānases: only one, Vamra, is named in the Anukramaṇī, as the author of X.99, a hymn
to Indra, and the patronymic (and its underlying base) are both absent from the RVic text.
### 01-03
The tṛca shows clear signs of unity, esp. lexically. Not only do all three vss.
contain a form of páva- (pávasva 1a, voc. pa/ávamāna 2b, 3c), but the stem víśva- is found
4x (1a, b, 2a, 3b), kave (3c) echoes kā́vya (1b), and pl. dhā́māni in 3a echoes du. dhā́manī in
2b. These “domains” of vss 2-3 are thematically connected to the voc. viśvacarṣaṇe
‘common to all the separate peoples’, in defining the spaces over which Soma holds sway.

### 01
The b pāda lacks a verb: Ge supplies (silently) “zu gewinnen,” Re parenthetically
“pour (atteindre).” The pāda is found 3x elsewhere (IX.23.1, 62.25, 63.25); in two the vs.
contains a form of √sṛj ‘surge’ (asṛgram 23.1, asṛkṣata 63.25) and I therefore supply that
verb here.

### 02
The issue in this vs. is the identify of the two dhā́manī; dependent on the answer to
that is the function of the du. pronoun tā́bhyām, which could be instr., dat., or abl.
Answering the first question is made difficult by the fact that this is the only du. form of
dhā́man- in the RV. Ge tr. “Formen” (likewise Re “formes”) and in n. 2-3 explains these as
the different stages (Stadien) the soma goes through in its preparation. This interpr. fails to
explain the difference between the du. of vs. 2 and the pl. of 3; nor does it account for how
Soma “rules with” these forms (taking tā́bhyām as instr. as he does). Re’s interpr. of
dhā́manī in 2 as the pure and mixed forms of soma provides a satisfactory account of the
dual, but does not explain the transition to the pl. in 3 and again fails to explain how Soma
rules with them. I take the term quite differently, as ‘domains’ (rather than ‘forms’). In vs. 2
the dual refers to Heaven and Earth and alludes to the split of Soma into heavenly and
earthly forms, a common trope in IX: he has a home in both places. Taking tā́bhyām as abl.,
I see Soma as ruling from both those polarized spaces, which together contain everything.
This interpr. gives pratīcī́in c more content than the fairly empty renderings of Ge (“die
sich (uns) darbieten”) and Re (“qui se tiennent face (à nous)”): Heaven and Earth as the two
cosmic halves face each other.

### 03
My interpr. of the du. dhā́manī in 2 as the two cosmic domains allows the contrast
between that form and the pl. dhā́māni to make sense. We have moved from the cosmic, to
the ritual, in particular to the ritual ground - and here the pl. ‘domains’ are the ritual spaces
that Soma traverses and encloses. This change of venue and focus is signalled esp. by
ṛtúbhiḥ ‘according to the ritual sequences’. Thus the themes of space and the cosmic reach
of Soma that I identified as characteristic of this hymn find economical expression in the
transition from the cosmic Soma in vs. 2 to the ritual Soma of vs. 3.
The main verb of this clause is pári … asi, in the formula viśvátaḥ pári √as
‘surround entirely’ (on which see my 1998 “Rigvedic viśvátaḥ sīm, Or, Why Syntax Needs
Poetics,” Fs. Watkins). Within this phrase we seem to have an embedded rel. cl. yā́ni te
“which are yours,” dependent on the obj. dhā́māni, and embedded relatives are generally
blocked in the RV. But as we have noted elsewhere (see, e.g., comm. ad VI.21.2, 22.5),
nominal rel. clauses are an exception to this rule, and here the yā́ni seems to be displaying
(proto-)izafe behavior.
### 04-06
This tṛca does not show particular internal cohesion, but it has striking echoes of
the preceding tṛca. Like vs. 1, vs. 4 begins pávasva; 4b begins abhí víśvāni like 1b, with a
different acc. pl. following; 4c sákhā sákhibhya ūtáye is identical to 1c, save for the final
word. Vs. 5 contains dhā́mabhiḥ echoing the two forms of dhā́man- in vss. 2-3. Only vs. 3
is free of links to the 1st tṛca.

### 04
As in 1b, I supply ‘surging’ with 4b, on the basis of their identical construction.

### 05
This vs. seems to unite Soma’s two theatres of operation, as laid out in vss. 2-3, the
cosmic and the ritual. His “gleaming rays” (reminiscent of the sun) spread both “on the back
of heaven” (divás pṛṣṭhé) and across the ritual filter (pavítram); the instr. dhā́mabhiḥ
“through your domains” can make reference both to this combining of cosmic and ritual and
also, more specifically, to the limited ritual domains expressed by the pl. dhā́māni in vs. 3.
Re’s characterization in his n. - “Soma-soleil …; en fait, l’image rituelle se combine avec
l’image solaire” - expresses this rather nicely, though it’s hard to get it from his tr. On the
likening of the soma liquid on the filter to the sun, see IX.10.5 and comm. thereon.
### 07-09
No particular sign of cohesion either internal or external.

### 07
This vs. contains the famous phrase ákṣiti śrávaḥ (or a minor variant of it)
“imperishable fame,” interestingly acquired not by a human, but by Soma himself.

### 08
It may not be clear in the publ. tr. that “you” and “the inspired poet” are identical.
The referent of the “seven siblings” (saptá jāmáyaḥ) is disputed. Ge identifies them
as the fingers - and certainly jāmí- is regularly used of the fingers of the officiants in IX.
But 1) do fingers “cry out”? and more important, 2) why then “seven”? It seems unlikely
that the poet would deliberately evoke an image of disfigurement or, at the very least,
incompleteness. Ober (II.73; see II.71) tries to rescue this identification by suggesting that
seven and ten are “equivalent” indications of totality. But as he himself notes, a number of
other groups of seven are mentioned in IX. A reference to one of these in this vs. would save
us from positing an defective set of fingers. The most likely referent in my view are the
seven streams, saptá síndhavaḥ found two vss. earlier (6a). Rivers regularly make noise in
the RV, and the proximity of that very phrase in vs. 6 tips the scales for me. Another
feminine group of seven is the seven insightful thoughts, saptá dhītáyaḥ (IX.8.4, 9.4, 15.8,
62.17). dhītí- also make noise, and they also (though not explicitly numbered 7) appear
several vss. later doing just that: 11c ávāvaśanta dhītáyaḥ “the insightful thoughts have
bellowed.” However, supplying dhītáyaḥ here would lead to a poetically clumsy nearredundancy: the related dhī́-, also ‘insightful thought’, is found in the same clause, and “the
seven (inspired thoughts) cried out to you with inspired thoughts” would be, to say the least,
awk. (rather than being a pleasing etymological echo, at least to my mind). Lü (246) also
goes for streams, and Re, citing his treatment, seems silently to endorse it. Lü claims that Ge
identifies the seven as dhītáyaḥ, despite Ge’s clear n. 1 “Die Finger.” I don’t see where Lü
got this - I assume it’s simply a lapse.
In IX the figure Vivasvant seems to be the prototype sacrificer (see Old ad IX.99.2),
perhaps in his role as father of Manu. For further on Vivasvant see publ. intro. to I.139 as
well as comm. to IX.99.2, X.14.5.

### 09
Since they are grooming (√mṛj) him, the ‘unwed ones’ (agrúvaḥ) are probably here
the fingers, continuing the fem. pl. agent but modulating from streams to fingers (whose
number is not specified here).
In b the phrase ádhi ṣváṇi is problematic. It is generally taken as a root noun loc. to
√svan ‘sound’: Gr, apparently Ge (see his n. 9b and his locatival tr. “unter Gebrause”),
apparently Re (but see his hesitations in his n.), Schindler (Rt. Noun p. 51, but see below),
Ober (II.73)—though Lub lists it under a stem sváni-, so presumably interpr. it as a
nom./acc. sg. neut. Schindler’s disc. suggests a slight variation on the root noun interpr.,
with the possibility that it is used here as an adj. ‘rauschend’ modifying jīráu, as Gr takes it.
In that case the independent sván- was extracted from the compd tuvi-ṣváṇ- ‘powerfully
sounding’, an interpr. that seems over-elaborate.
Whether as root noun or an -i-stem, our form is equated with sváni in the similar
pāda-final phrase ánu ṣváṇi in VI.46.14. However, I have demonstrated that sváni in that
phrase must be a verb form, a 3rd sg. passive aor., as Old suggests. See comm. ad loc. Scar,
in a detailed disc. of the two sváni forms (676-77), suggests that our phrase, too, might
contain a verb form. By his analysis pāda b is an (unsignalled) dependent cl., parallel to the
yád clause of c, and so the accent on 3rd sg. sváni would be correct for a finite verb. He tr.
“es putzen dich …, während es über der Wollseihe, unter dem fliessenden Wasser raschelt
[und] während du … gesalbt wirst.” This is clever, but I am disturbed by marking only one
- and only the second - subordinate clause overtly. Moreover, this interpr. also must assume
that there is a gapped subject to sváni or that it is used impersonally (both possibilities
floated by Scar). None of this is impossible, but the required assumptions and syntactic
twists pile up.
I am drawn rather to an old suggestion of Aufrecht’s, endorsed by Old (but rejected
explicitly by Schindler and Scar) that ádhi ṣváṇi rests on ádhi *ṣṇávi “on (the sheep’s)
back.” Because of the morphological difficulties (the nonexistence of a loc. *snávi to begin
with), I would not posit Aufrecht’s intermediate form, but simply assume a reduction and
metathetic scrambling of sā́navi, which occurs several times in the pāda-final phrase ádhi
sā́navi (VI.48.5, IX.31.5, 37.4, 63.27); ádhi is the standard post- (/pre-)position in this
expression; cf. also ádhi sā́no avyáye IX.86.3, 91.1, 96.13, 97.40 and numerous variants.
The presence of ávye at the beg. of the pāda would set the audience’s expectation for “on the
back of the sheep.” The presence of the “noise” root √svar in the preceding vs. (8a asvaran)
may have facilitated the metathesis, to produce a form appearing to belong to the
phonologically and semantically similar root √svan, reinforced by rebhá- in the flg. pāda.
In c I take rebháḥ … ajyáse as a pun, dependent on the literal sense of √ribh, which,
rather than being ‘sing’ as it generally is glossed, is really ‘creak, rasp’. See comm. ad
VI.3.6. Here Soma is as usual ‘anointed’ (ajyase) with milk, and in that regard he is
identified as a rebhá-, a ritual officiant with a particular voice quality. But as disc. ad VI.3.6,
in a TS passage √ribh is used for a squeaky wheel, and of course the way to fix such a
wheel is to “grease” it (√añj). So the unmarked comparison here is “(as) a squeaky (wheel)
is greased.”
### 10-12
This tṛca is thematically unified by the journey theme, reinforced by two
forms of √sṛj in vss. 10 (asṛkṣata) and 11 (ásṛgram), the former in an etym. figure. Note the
juxtaposition of the newer s-aor. 3rd pl. middle and the older root aorist, with no apparent
functional or semantic difference. On these two formations see Narten (Sig.Aor. 270-71);
she claims that they were originally differentiated functionally and still are occasionally (see
IX.86.4), but in almost all occurrences this difference has been lost.

### 10  
Soma’s acquisition of “imperishable fame” in 7c is anticipated, as it were, by his
streams, likened to horses, “seeking fame” (śravasyávaḥ).
### 13-15
No signs of cohesion.

### 13  
On pādas bc and esp. the remarkable causative future reflexive form vāsayiṣyase
‘you will cause yourself to be clothed’, see disc. in the comm. to the parallel passage IX.2.4.

### 14  
It is difficult to render the vs.-initial ásya te lit. “of this here you”; the demon.
essentially exists as a prop for the enclitic te and a way to emphasize the 2nd ps. pronoun.
I do not know what the difference is between sakhyá- and sakhitvá-, or if any
difference is meant. The former is far better attested and has a fuller paradigm, well
distributed across cases and numbers (sg. and pl.); the latter is almost confined to the
nom./acc. sg. (with 2 occurrences of the loc. sg.). In any case the vs. comes out a little flat:
we want your comradeship because it will benefit us. The poet may have been trying to
distract attention from this flatness by varying the derivational realization. It’s also worth
noting that pāda a is also found in IX.61.29 without sakhitvá- in context and pāda c is found
in IX.31.6 without sakhyá- in context.
In his endearingly crusty way, Bloomfield (RR ad IX.31.6) pronounces our vs.
“arrant nonsense”: “pādas a and c, borrowed from good quarters, show that the stanza is
irresponsible patchwork.” This seems rather harsh, but probably results in part from his
interpr. of íyakṣantaḥ as the desid. of √yaj, rather than the now generally accepted
derivation from √(n)aś; see comm. ad VI.21.3. Attributing it to √yaj produces a participial
phrase in b that has nothing to do with sakhyé in a: “In thy friendship we, sacrificing with
thy help, do we, O Indu, thy friendship crave” (Bl’s tr., which justifies his “arrant nonsense”
judgment). Whereas a connection with √(n)aś sets out the reason we want your
comradeship—we stand to gain from it—and makes ab a unified expression.

### 15  
The usually idiomatic ā́pavasva lacks the usual acc. object (“bring [X] by
purifying yourself”). Perhaps the ā́anticipates the ā́in c, in the idiom ā́… viśa ‘enter’.
The question in b are whether the two datives mahé … nṛcákṣase belong together and
what the referent(s) is/are. Ge takes them together and identifies the referent as Indra, who
appears by name in the next pāda, which would support Ge’s solution. However, as Re
points out, nṛcákṣas- is never used of Indra, but generally of Agni or Soma. Re himself
separates the datives, supplying ráṇe with mahé from the beginning of the tṛca (13a) and
identifying the referent of nṛcákṣase as “le dieu Soma.” Although the first choice seems
possible and even reasonable, the second is awkward: it seems odd to order Soma to purify
himself for himself, even if the addressee is the substance soma (which shouldn’t actually
have such agency) as distinct from the god. Given that the next tṛca but one (vss. 19-21) is
addressed to Agni, that god seems a more likely choice. Re’s motivation in separating the
two datives in b seems to be to wring the three functions out of the vs. (or, I gather, ab), but
I don’t see how they would match up. In any case, a modified tr. à la Re, without reference
to the three functions, is conceivable: “… for the quest for cattle, for great (joy), for the one
of manly eye [=Agni].”
### 16-18
The first two vss. are linked lexically and by their investment in grammatical
comparison. The third is unconncected, but 18c echoes vs. 14 in the previous tṛca.

### 16  
As Re points out, sán here is non-concessive. Instead it seems to have a function
rather like the one I identified in III.30.5 (see comm. ad loc.), namely a definitional one:
where, on the basis of the description of the god’s activities or qualities, he is assigned an
agentive title.

### 17  
This vs. expands on the etymological figure and superlative phrase in 16b,
ugrā́ṇām … ójiṣṭhaḥ, but with three pairs of comparatives, beginning with the ugrébhyaḥ …
ójīyān, lexically identical to the splv. phrase but morphologically different. The second is
also an etym. figure, of less interest than the first because it lacks morphological variation:
śū́rebhyaḥ … śū́rataraḥ. While the third substitutes a synonymic cmpd. for the abl. term:
bhūridā́bhyaḥ … máṃhīyān “more generous than those who give much.” A low-key but
pleasing set of variations on a phrasal theme.

### 18  
The sole Anuṣṭubh verse in a sea of Gāyatrīs. Note that it is the last vs. before the
Agni tṛca, and so it may function as a closing or pseudo-closing vs., dividing the larger
hymn into parts.
The first hemistich has received a variety of interpr., splitting into two major camps
dependent in great part on the identity of sū́raḥ. Ge (see his n. 18ab), Re, Ober (I.494) take it
as a gen. sg. of svàr-, one of a string of gen. dependent on sātā́‘at the winning’ - hence, “at
the winning of the sun, refreshment, offspring, and bodies.” There are several arguments
against this interp., however: 1) sū́raḥ has to be nom. sg. to sū́ra- in 22c, and so consistency
would be nice (if not entirely necessary); 2) íṣaḥ has the wrong accent for gen. sg. (expect
iṣáḥ); 3) the standard interpr. of the sequence éṣaḥ is ā́íṣaḥ (already Pp., though see other
poss. in Ge’s n. 18ab), but the mid-pāda location of ā́, between two supposedly parallel
genitives, is an odd position for a preverb / adposition / adverb, and it has no obvious
function in the clause. In fact the clause has no verb and no obvious one to supply - witness
the variety of suggestions: Ge “(stehst uns),” Re “(qui t’es préparé),” Ober “(hilfst uns).” I
therefore follow the path generally sketched by Old (see also Lü 267 n. 4): a nominal
equational cl. with nom. sg. sū́raḥ to sū́ra- (note that both Gr and Lub so list the form), tváṃ
soma sū́raḥ “you, Soma, are the sun”; followed by a 2nd cl. beginning with ā́. Though ā́
remains mid-pāda, it is initial in its clause, as we would expect. An imperative of bringing /
giving / suppying needs to be supplied, with acc. pl. íṣaḥ (properly accented) as obj. Cf.
expressions like III.53.1 ... íṣa ā́vahatam ..., VI.52.16 ... íṣa ā́dhattam, and, with
specifically Somian vocab., nearby IX.65.13 ā́... íṣam pávasva “By purifying yourself,
bring refreshment here.” More to the point, perhaps, the immediately following vs., 19b, ā́
suvórjam íṣaṃ ca naḥ “impel hither nourishment and refreshment to us,” is quite similar and
could provide the missing verb.
A structurally less crucial question is the relationship between the two genitives in b,
tokásya … tanū́nām. As indicated above, Ge takes them as parallel; Re by contrast takes
tanū́nām as a beneficial “pour nous-mêmes,” independent of the genitives dependent on
sātā́. In the publ. tr. I take them as nested, with tanū́nām dependent on tokásya, though I
have no particular objection to the parallel interpr.
As noted above, vṛṇīmáhe sakhyā́ya is a permutation of 14c sakhitvám uśmasi.
 On vṛṇīmáhe yújyāya, see comm. ad IX.88.1. Given the other exx. of this lexeme, I
would now alter the tr. to “we choose you for yoking [/use].”
### 19-21
On this tṛca see publ. intro. It is so insistently Agni-focused (all three vss.
begin with a form of that stem, two as voc.) that the Anukramaṇī lists Agni as the deity of
the three vss. But it is of course far more likely that Soma is being identified with Agni here.
The equation and poetic merging of these two ritual gods is found elsewhere, most notably
in “the hardest hymn in the RV” (V.44), which is simultaneously applicable to both gods
throughout its length. Their blending is shown here by the use of both Somian and Agnian
vocab.: for the latter, see esp. puróhitaḥ (20b); for the former, the three forms of páva-, one
each in each vs.: 19a pavase, 20a pávamānaḥ, 21a pavasva. Note that after this Agni tṛca the
word sóma- doesn’t appear until vs. 29 and a likely identification with Indra (as well as
comparison with the sun) intervenes.

### 19  
Since pavase has an obj. ā́yūṃṣi, it would be desirable to have the preverb ā́,
which has transitivizing function with this root. This is easily done: ā́yūṃṣi can be
decomposed into ā́ā́yūṃṣi without change to the Saṃhitā text, though it is contra to the Pp.
This preverb in tmesis shows up apparently 2nd in the clause because it follows the zeroposition voc. ágne.

### 21  
Here, despite the obj. phrase in b, pávasva lacks the expected ā́. It would
technically be possible to take b with c: “establishing luster and an abundance of heroes
for/in us, wealth and thriving in me,” which would leave pavasva intransitive. However, this
seems artificial, and the existence of two 1st ps. pronouns in b and c, in different numbers,
would be awkward. Moreover, 27c, with an independent dádhat clause, speaks in favor of
separating b and c here.
### 22-24
No strong signs of unity, though a form of pávamāna- opens vss. 22 and 24,
but Soma as the sun in 22c returns in the theme of light and the defeat of darkness in 24bc.
The adj. vicakṣaṇáḥ ‘visible afar’ in 23c also participates in this imagery, partly matching
viśvádarśataḥ ‘visible to all’ in the same position in 22c -- though the Engl. tr. ‘visible’
suggests a closer connection than exists in the Skt., which has √dṛś in 22 but √cakṣ in 23.
The light imagery in this tṛca may pick up on the identification with Agni in the previous
tṛca, while the verb jáṅghanat that closes the tṛca (24c) may modulate towards an
identification with Indra, probably found in the following tṛca.

### 23  
hitáḥ in b could of course belong to √hi ‘impel’, though little would change if did.
As it happens both Ge and Re also opt for √dhā here.

### 24  
With Lü (266), I take ṛtáṃ bṛhát as a nom. in apposition to Soma, rather than
another acc. obj. to ajījanat as Ge/Re do. Either of course is possible; there are several
passages in which an identification of Soma with ṛtá seems likely. See comm. ad IX.56.1.
But I would certainly accept an acc. interpr. as alternative.
### 25-27
Each vs. opens with a form of pávamāna-, which also connects it with the
preceding tṛca (see above). An even stronger link to the previous tṛca is the gen. intens. part.
jáṅghnataḥ in 25a, which picks up the same stem (in the nom. jáṅghanat) at the end of the
immediately preceding pāda, 24c. As for internal unity, note the free phrase háreś candrā́ḥ
in 25b, which is transformed into the cmpd. háriścandra-(only here in the RV, though
prominent as a PN beginning in the Br.) in 26c. Superlatives also figure in the last two vss.:
rathī́tama- 26a, śubhráśastamaḥ 26b, vājasā́tama- 27b.

### 25  
With Ge and Re, I supply ‘darkness(es)’ (támāṃsi) as obj. of jáṅghnataḥ on the
basis of 24c.
I supply ‘drops’ with candrā́ḥ on the basis of III.40.4 candrā́sa índavaḥ, though Ge’s
“Güsse” and Re’s “coulées de soma” certainly fit the context, too. My “drops” is indirectly
supported by the additional descriptor jīrā́ḥ ‘lively’, which is most commonly found in the
cmpd. jīrá-dānu- ‘having lively drops’, with a different word for drop.
Note the play jīrā́ajirá-. The cmpd ajirá-śocis- is a bit difficult to fit into context.
The 1st member ajirá- means ‘quick, nimble, agile’, and the whole bahuvrīhi occurs once
elsewhere of Agni, VIII.19.13, where I tr. “of nimble flame.” How this would apply to drops
is not entirely clear; I assume it refers to the propensity of drops, esp. moving drops, to
catch the light. It is also possible that ajiráśociṣaḥ is gen. sg. and modifies Soma, rather than
nom. pl. modifying the drops. This would not appreciably change the image.

### 26  
The Indraic cast of this vs. is quite clear, and I therefore think that Soma is being
identified with Indra here (as he was with Agni in the tṛca 19-21). To begin with, the splv.
rathī́tama- is generally used of Indra (e.g., VIII.45.7); marúd-gaṇa- ‘having the Maruts as
his flock’ is of course characteristic of Indra (e.g., VIII.89.2) and also expressed by other,
similar but better-attested epithets like marút-vant-. Moreover, the stem śubhrá-
‘resplendent’ in the masc. pl., here in the instr. pl. śubhrébhiḥ, is almost always used of the
Maruts (e.g., I.167.4).
The problem in the vs. is the splv. śubhráśastamaḥ in b. The interpr. reflected by Ge
and Re stems from Old, who sees it as a haplology from *śubhrá-śasta-tama-, i.e., the splv.
to a ppl. cmpd. Old himself doesn’t provide a gloss, but on the basis of a cmpd. like kaviśastá- ‘praised by poets’ it should presumably be something like ‘most praised by the
resplendent’, though neither Ge’s “über die anderen Schönen als der Schönste gepriesen”
nor Re’s “par rapport aux (êtres) beaux, il est le plus célébré (quant à son fait d’être) beau”
reflects this presumption; that is, they do not take the 1st member as agent. Nor does the
accent of the cmpd (either reconstructed or as attested) match that of kavi-śastá-, though
admittedly it does match the standard devá-hita- type. And the instr. śubhrébhiḥ seems an
odd choice - we would expect a gen. pl. with the splv. of course; the anomalous instr. is
surely responsible for the knots that Ge and Re tie themselves into, as well as Ge’s cryptic
(or disingenuous) n. 26b “śubhrébhiḥ Instr. = Ablat. in Verbindung mit Superl. =
Komparat.” The publ. tr. represents a very different analysis, which I now think must be
wrong: as the splv. to a root-noun cmpd. ‘proclaiming splendor’, but, as I realized all along,
the accent is wrong (expect *śubhra-śás-(tama-)), and it is difficult to argue that the accent
got misplaced because the word structure was misunderstood, esp. given the root noun cmpd
splv. in the next vs., vāja-sā́-tama- with correct accent. In addition, śubhrá- is an adj.,
‘resplendent’, not a noun ‘splendour’, and √śaṃs doesn’t take any form derived from √śubh
as obj. So I now would reject the publ. tr. and return to Old’s haplology - though with a
semantic interpr. different from the Ge/Re complex. I would take the 1st member in
agentive value, as is usual in such cmpds: “most praised by the resplendent (ones),” with the
usual number neutralization. The reference is to the Maruts. What then of the independent
instr. śubhrébhiḥ? Either it doubles the 1st cmpd member, whose function in the cmpd may
have become unclear because of the haplology - hence “most praised by the resplendent
(ones), by the resplendent ones.” Or it may be an instr. of accompaniment: “most praised by
the resplendent (ones), along with the resplendent ones.” This would reflect the fact that the
Maruts both praise Indra and receive praise themselves. This dual role of the Maruts, both
praising and praised, is the subject of “poetic repair” in V.52, the first of Śyāvāśva’s Marut
hymns. See comm. ad loc and reff. given there. Although I slightly favor the former
explanation, English is better served by the latter, and I would now substitute the 2nd tr. just
given; “most praised” should also receive an asterisk.
Unfortunately “gold-glittering” for háriścandra- obscures its relationship to háreś
candrā́ḥ in 25b “of the tawny one, the glittering (drops).”

### 27  
In this vs. we seem to have returned to the identification of Soma with the sun, as
shown esp. by raśmíbhiḥ “with his rays” - this instr. pl. being reserved almost exclusively
for the sun’s rays (see, e.g., nearby IX.61.8 sū́ryasya raśmíbhiḥ). The image is of the sun /
Soma pervading space, with Soma’s rays being the traces of the golden liquid as it spreads
across the filter.
### 28-30
No particular evidence of unity, except for an emphasis in the 1st two vss. on
the technicalities of soma-preparation.

### 28  
This vs. has two passively used participles, suvānáḥ ‘being pressed’ and punānáḥ
‘being purified’, which contrast with the agency implicitly accorded to Soma Pavamāna,
“self-purifying” Soma. This more agentive participle returns in the final vs. (30b), just
before we ask Soma for his favor.
The repetition of índuḥ (pādas a and c) is somewhat clumsy, but the 2nd occurrences
enables the usual word play with adjacent índram.
## 067
On the structure and authorship of this hymn and their implications for RVic studies
more generally, see publ. intro. as well as Old.
### 01-03
Attributed to Bharadvāja, the tṛca shows elementary unity by positoning tvám at
the beginning of each vs.

### 01
Gr derives dhārayú- from dhā́rā- ‘stream’ and glosses ‘strömend’, an idea that
goes back to Sāy. Ge follows suit (“der hervorsprudelnde”), though in n. 1a he entertains a
derivation from √dhṛ, which underlies Re’s “le mainteneur” (see his n.) I also think that
√dhṛ is the correct etymon. There would be no reason to shorten the final of dhā́rā- (though
dhā́ra-pūta- ‘purified by streams’ (?) and dhāra-vāká- ‘recitation for the streams’ (?) do
give me pause), while there is a well-established relationship between -ā̆-yá-(ti) verbs and -
ā̆-yú- adjectives (type devayá- / devayú-). Though it has a different accent and a different
functional profile, dhā́ráyati is a very common verb, and it is easy to imagine the creation of
a -yú- nominal to that stem. However, if it is derived from dhā́rā- ‘stream’, the sense should
not be of the type given by Gr and Ge, but rather ‘seeking streams’, as is standard with -yuformations to nouns. The idea would be that the soma, once pressed, goes forth to seek the
ritual waters.
### 04-06
The Kaśyapa tṛca: it lacks cohesion across all 3 vss., though 4 and 5 share
“rushing across the fleece”; ‘rush’ (árṣa-) also provides a link to the last vs. of the preceding
tṛca, 3b, as does the verb acikradat (4c), which echoes kánikradat (3b).

### 05
The preverb/preposition ví is insistent, with 4 occurrences in the vs.
Re sees the three functions here, but that seems something of a stretch.
### 07-09
Elementary sign of cohesion in the Gotama tṛca: a form of páva- in every vs.

### 09
On úsrayaḥ as ‘rosy (fingers)’ see comm. ad IV.65.1.
The publ. tr. contains a grammatical error: asvaran should of course be ‘they cried’
not ‘they cry’.
### 10-12
This, the Atri tṛca, shows very tight cohesion. To begin with, Pūṣan, under his
name (vs. 10) or characteristic epithets (kapardín- vs. 11, ā́ghṛṇi- vs. 12), appears in every
vs., in particular as the recipient of the pressed and purified soma in vss. 11-12. Since, as
noted in the publ. intro., Pūṣan is rarely found in IX, devoting a tṛca to him here is striking,
and the assumption that he wants soma is esp. anomalous, since in the hymn devoted to
Indra and Pūṣan (VI.57) Indra’s desire for soma is explicitly contrasted with Pūṣan’s for
porridge (VI.57.2).
More evidence for strong cohesion: the third pāda of each vs. is a refrain: ā́bhakṣat
kanyā̀su naḥ “He [=Pūṣan] will give us a share in maidens.” The connection of this refrain
with soma is, to say the least, not straightforward. Ge (n. 10-12) suggests that the idea is
that Pūṣan, as a thank-you for the soma, will give maidens as compensation for the poet
(Dichtersold) or as a guest-gift (Gastgeschenk). This is certainly possible, though the quid
pro quo isn’t evident to me in the text; nonetheless it conforms to the dānastuti concept.
Ober refines this somewhat by identifying the maidens as brides (e.g., I.320), but at least in
his vol. II he takes Soma as the subject of the refrain (“[D]er [Soma] gewähre uns Anteil an
den Jungfrauen”; II.51 n. 240). Simply on the basis of rhetorical structure, this seems
unlikely: in the vs. containing the first appearance of the refrain (10) there is not even
indirect reference to Soma; the only possible subject is Pūṣan, and there is unlikely to be a
switch in subject in the refrain in the following two vss. By contrast, Gr identifies the
maidens here as daughters, presumbly implying that this expression is a twist on the “give
us sons” wish so often expressed. Though I appreciate Gr’s attempt to save Pūṣan from
being a pimp, I doubt that any Rigvedin would wish [at least out loud] for a passel of
daughters
The last two vss. of the tṛca are simple variants of each other. Both begin with ayám
referring to soma; both contain a datival expression identifying Pūṣan as the recipient of the
soma; their b pādas both begin ghṛtáṃ ná pavate, with a disyllable qualifiying ghṛtám
following.

### 10  
The publ. tr. presents the journeys as ours, reading naḥ with both avitā́and
yā́mani-yāmani. Ge and Re instead assume the journeys are Pūṣan’s: e.g., “Unser Gönner ist
Pūṣan, der auf jeder Ausfahrt Böcke als Rosse hat.” Since one hymn devoted to Pūṣan, I.42,
is almost entirely devoted to Pūṣan’s protection of us on the journey and on the path and in
the short Pūṣan cycle in VI (VI.53-58) the god is several times asked to lead or direct us
(e.g., VI.53.2) and to clear paths for us (VI.53.4, 54.1-2), I think it likely that the focus here
is on our journeys.

### 11  
kapardín- is used of Pūṣan in VI.55.2, though it is also applied to a few other gods
in the RV, notably Rudra (I.114.1, 5).

### 12  
ā́ghṛṇi- is an epithet exclusive to Pūṣan. On the word, see comm. ad VI.53.3.
That Pūṣan is addressed in the 2nd ps. here, while the refrain remains in the 3rd ps.,
might be taken as evidence for Ober’s identification of Soma as the subject of the refrain -
since soma is in the 3rd ps. in this vs. However, refrains tend to operate in syntactic
independence from their vss., and, as I argued above, once the refrain is set, it is unlikely to
change referents.
### 13-15
Little evidence of unity in the Viśvāmitra tṛca, though the falcon (śyená-) as
image of Soma occurs in both 14 and 15. More generally, both 14 and 15 depict the rapid
and dramatic movement of soma into the ritual receptacles.

### 13  
Soma is obviously “child of the speech of the poets” (vācó jantúḥ kavīnā́m)
because ritual speech sets in motion the preparation of soma.

### 14  
What is the “armor” (várma) that soma “plunges through” (ví gāhate)? Ge (n.
14ab) suggests that the image is of a warrior clothing himself in armor, that is, the wooden
cup, but he doesn’t construe várma with the verb, but takes it as loosely descriptive with a
verb used absolutely (“er taucht in seinen Panzer unter”). Re also thinks the várma refers to
the cup (“la paroi [wall] de la cuve” acdg. to his n.), but has the courage to construe it with
the verb: “il plonge dans (le récipient, sa) cuirasse.” But ví is not “dans.” I think it refers
instead to the filter, whose fleece both represents his armor and a substance that soma must
get through, hence the slightly off-balance image. Note first of all that the same verb, though
with different preverb, is used precisely with the filter a few vss. later in this hymn:

### 20  
pavítram áti gāhate / … vā́ram avyáyam “he plunges across the filter, the sheep’s
fleece.” As for the fleece as Soma’s armor, see the very full expression in IX.98.2 pári ṣyá
svānó avyáyam ráthe ná vármāvyata “This one, being pressed, has engirded himself in the
sheep's fleece, as a man on a chariot does in armor.” Ober (II.77) also considers the armor to
be the fleece.
### 16-18
This tṛca, ascribed to Jamadagni, is unifed first and foremost by its meter,
Dvipadā Gāyatrī, the only representative of this meter in the hymn - and in fact in all of the
RV (see Arnold p. 244). There is no particular unity in lexicon (though note mandáyan 16a
and madíntamaḥ 18a), but the tṛca does mention the two gods who receive the first soma
oblation, Indra (16) and Vāyu (18).
### 19-21
This is the last tṛca of the hymn, attributed to Vasiṣṭha. The 1st two vss. are
variants of each, couched in 2nd and 3rd ps. respectively: their first pādas differ only in their
initial disyllable, with the rest identical: … tunnó abhíṣṭutaḥ; their second pādas both depict
the journey to and across the filter, both beginning pavítram. The third vs. stands apart,
though the identification of Soma as ‘demon-smasher’ in 20c is thematically linked to the
plea in 21 that Soma “smash away” peril.
### 22-27
As noted in the publ. intro., these vss. are a self-contained purificatory spell,
with all vss. ending with an act. impv. belonging to the pres. punā́ti: all 2nd sg. punīhi (naḥ)
except 22c punātu (naḥ). The means of purification is, in the first instance, the filter
(pavítra-), which of course literally means ‘instrument (-tra-) of purification’. The pavítrais mentioned in vss. 22-25, with other, non-physical means of purification added (e.g., the
sacred formulation vss. 23-24), with these means appropriate to the gods who wield them
(Savitar’s ‘impulsion’ [savá-] vs. 25). The first agent of purification is Soma Pavamāna
himself (22), then Agni (23-24), then Savitar (25). The three - Soma, Agni, and Savitar -
then appear together in 26, and in the final vs. (27) it opens out to all the divinities. The
rhetoric is pretty flat, but the structure is a pleasing example of repetitive variation.

### 22  
The nominal rel. cl. yáḥ potā́seems to be another ex. of the embedded, pseudoizafe construction discussed elsewhere, though in this case there is a resumptive pronoun
beginning the continuation of the main cl. The structure is: ab beg. of main cl. marked by
sáḥ, no verb; c rel. cl. yáḥ potā́, followed by rest of main cl., with verb, but introduced by a
repetition of sáḥ: sá punātu naḥ, or, more schematically:
ab sá NOMINATIVE NP /
C. yáḥ NOM. NP, sá VERB
with the two sá hunks together forming the main cl. A sort of hybrid construction.
In the publ. tr. I take pavítreṇa in b with pávamānaḥ in a, unlike Ge and Re, who
construe it with punātu in c (e.g., “qu’il nous clarifie avec le filtre”). Their interpr. is
supported by the INSTR. punīhi naḥ constr. in 23-24, 26 (and variant in 25), and since I no
longer consider yáḥ potā́an embedded rel. clause and therefore have no need to consider ab
entirely separate from the resumptive sá phrase in c, there is no syntactic obstacle to this
interpr. I’d be inclined, however, to read pavítreṇa with both: “The one who purifies himself
through our filter (/purifier) today, the limitless one who is the purifier, with the filter
(/purifier) let him purify us.”
The agent noun potár- (also pótar-) as if to an aniṭ root is surprising, esp. in
juxtaposition to the instrument noun pavítra- and, a few vss. later, the god savitár- to the
parallel root √sū. We would of course expect *pavitár- -- a form we almost get in RVic
pavītár- and do get in AV pavitár-. The problem is identical to that posed by the priestly
title hótar-, derived from √hvā / hū ‘invoke’, so we expect *hávitar- -- although in that
instance interference from the likewise ritual verb √hu ‘pour, libate’, whose agent noun
should properly be hótar-, helps explain the discrepancy. AiG II.2. 672 explains pótar- by
suggesting that it is an inherited word and no longer closely tied to the verb from which it
was originally derived. This seems backwards to me - wouldn’t inherited and isolated
words be more likely to maintain their expected phonological shape? And, judging from this
passage, potár- (so accented) has not lost its connection with √pū. However, a few pp. later
(AiG II.2.676) the much more plausible scenario is proposed, that potár- / pótar- has
followed hótar-, which owes its shape to the interference just noted, and stotár- ‘praiser’.
Sim. EWA s.v. pótar-.

### 23  
The image of the filter stretched out in Agni’s flame is striking, but I don’t know
exactly what the picture is meant to be - in contemplating the fire do we have a vision of a
purifying apparatus? Or is the expression simply a fancy way of saying “the purifier that is
your flame”? The beginning of the next vs., with pavítram arcivát, would support the latter
suggestions.
Ge takes bráhma as obj. of punīhi: “… mit der [=pavítram] läutere unsere feierliche
Rede.” But 1) this would break the pattern of punātu / punīhi naḥ “purify us” in vss. 22, 24,
26) by demoting naḥ from object; 2) bráhma as a means of purification is found in the next
vs. in the cmpd brahmasavaíḥ. The fairly strict rhetorical patterning of these vss. therefore
imposes (at least to my view) an instrument-of-means reading on bráhma, and I see no
reason why it can’t be part of the definitional preposed rel. cl. yád te “what is your …,”
parallel to pavítram. yád would be appropriate to both, since they are both neut., and they
are then both picked up by instr. téna in c. That bráhma has been postponed till the
beginning of c is not surprising, given the long NP containing pavítram. The new cl. begins
mid-pāda with téna; since sá/tám forms regularly take init. position in pāda / clause, the
mid-pāda position here suggests that it begins a new cl. and bráhma is not part of it. Like
Ge, Re makes bráhma somehow oblique, but I don’t really understand what he’s trying to
convey: “clarifies en notre Formule.”

### 24  
This vs. has both physical and conceptual purifying instruments: the flame-sieve
of 23 and the bráhman- also introduced in 23, which, in the cmpd brahma-savá-, also
provides a transition to Savitar and his impulsions in vs. 25.

### 25  
In addition to the introduction of Savitar, we also get a slight rearrangement in
word order. The conjoined phrase pavítreṇa savéna ca would not fit in the slot right before
the impv. in c, a position it occupies in 23c, 24b, 24c, 26c, so the final enclitic naḥ is
converted to a full prn. mā́m and placed in initial position. This prn. also has to be read as
distracted máām to achieve 8 syllables. I wonder why the poet didn’t just use asmā́n, which
would fit the meter and better match naḥ. One of the only instances in which I think I could
compose the vs. better than the poet - though “me” (both tonic mā́m and enclitic mā) serves
as insistent obj. in vs. 27.

### 26  
Initial tribhíḥ matches initial ubhā́bhyām in 25a. Since ubhā́bhyām was further
specified by a bipartite NP pavítreṇa savéna ca (25b), I would like to see three instr. in this
vs., each correlated with one of the three gods mentioned. And this is how I have rendered
it, with várṣiṣṭhaiḥ connected to Savitar (and Soma), dhā́mabhiḥ with Soma, and dákṣaiḥ
with Agni. By contrast, Ge and Re construe várṣiṣṭhaiḥ with dhā́mabhiḥ, which they
consider to be of three types (that is, “with the three highest dhā́mans …”; Re “avec les trois
positions les plus éminentes”) - although in their notes both come close to espousing a
position close to mine. Possibly in their favor is the fact that soma is unaccented in b, and if
várṣiṣṭhaiḥ is followed by a sub-clausal break, the voc. might (or might not) have been
accented. In the publ. tr. I read várṣiṣṭhaiḥ both with Savitar’s savaíḥ, which has to be
supplied, and with Soma’s dhā́mabhiḥ, and tr. the latter slightly differently: “through
Soma’s domains.”

### 27  
This last vs. of the purificatory spell is in a different meter (Anuṣṭubh) and makes
reference to a larger variety of personnel - both often signs of finality.
### 28-29
It’s not clear why we return to purely Soma vss. at this point, but the aoristic
summary in 29 (úpa … áganma bíbhrato námaḥ “up to him have we come bearing
homage”) is another typical hymn-ender, summarizing the hymn that precedes.

### 29  
The hapax āhutī-vṛ́dh- could be either passive (as in the publ. tr., also Ge) or act.
‘strengthening the oblation’ (Re). Scar (514) considers both possibilities and opts, weakly,
for the former. Either could certainly work in context. The long final vowel -tī- is found
only here, versus the standard ā́huti-. This can either be a metrical lengthening of the stem
vowel, since *āhutĭ-vṛ́dham, with 3 (or actually 4) light syllables in a row, would produce an
unacceptable cadence. Or it can be an instr. sg. to the -ti-stem (see inconclusive disc. in
Scar.), which would clinch the interpr. of the cmpd as passive ‘strengthened by the
oblation’. I weakly favor the latter.

### 30  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is extremely puzzling and my tr. and interpr.
are at best speculative. Old’s comments are useful in clearing away the detritus of the more
fanciful interpr., but neither he nor the other standard comm. have cracked the code: see
Ge’s n. 30a with lit. The syntax and the sequence of events are quite straightforward:
someone’s axe has disappeared (contra Gr, nanāśa must belong to ‘disappear’, not ‘reach’;
the ‘disappear’ association is now generally agreed upon), and Soma is asked to bring it
back through his purification (the common idiom ā́√pū). But whose axe? and why an axe in
this context? and what does a rat have to do with it?
To begin with the 1st question: most take alā́yyasya as a PN (“the axe of Alāyya”),
which saves trouble but doesn’t help us in deciphering the verse. Gr derives it from √lī and
tr. ‘sich nicht duckend’; Mayr (EWA s.v.) simply pronounces it “unklar.” I suggest that it
belongs to √rā ‘come to / be at rest’, with an l-form like iláyati (see Narten, “Ved. iláyati
…,” 1968; Jamison, -áya-, 48-49, EWA s.v. RĀ3
). I would interpr. it as a gerundive like -
pā́yya- (√pā both ‘drink’ and ‘protect’), as well as the more numerous extended stems of the
type śravā́yya-, whose -ā- does not belong to the root. A parallel negated form (though again
not to a ā-root) may be found in atasā́yya- ‘unshakeable’; see comm. ad I.63.6. I suggest
that alā́yya- means ‘not able to be brought to rest, not to be stilled’.
This may not seem to advance us very far, but this word must be evaluated in
conjunction with paraśúḥ, on which it depends. The paraśú- is frequently associated with
Agni; cf., e.g., I.127.3, IV.6.8, and VI.3.4, in all of which Agni is compared to an axe. The
other common word for axe, vā́śī-, is also characteristic of Agni: he carries it (VIII.19.23)
and possesses it (vā́śīmant- X.20.6). Agni’s axe must be his flame, and of course fire is
always in motion, never still. I therefore suggest that alā́yya- refers to Agni, the axe to his
flame, and the pāda declares that his flame has disappeared or been lost. This may refer to
the famous myth in which Agni runs away from his ritual duties and has to be coaxed back
by offering him a better deal - or it may simply record a ritual disaster: the sacrificial fire
has gone out. In any event Soma is taxed with bringing him back in pāda b.
If my interpr. of the first pāda is anywhere near correct, it pleases me to fancy that
this is the first (very indirect) textual evidence to Paraśu Rāma.
The real puzzle in this vs. is pāda c, which presents ākhúm as an apparently parallel
object to the paraśú- that Soma is supposed to bring back. Both Ge and Re find this
relatively easy to deal with because they take it as a simile, marked with cid. But as I have
noted in a number of places, there are no clear instances of cid as a simile marker, and here
it is also not clear what similarity the poet might be trying to point to (that moles live hidden
seems to be the best guess). My own suggestion is hardly better than this (if that). The ākhúis probably a ‘mole-like rat’ since there are no true moles in the subcontinent (see Katz,
JAOS 122 [2002], “How the Mole and Mongoose Got Their Names,” esp. 301-2). The word
is found only here in the RV, which complicates the interpr., but it has become fairly
common by middle Vedic. In particular, the ākhú- is associated with Rudra; already in VS
III.57, TS I.8.6.1 the ākhú- is Rudra’s victim / portion at the Tryambaka ritual. I therefore
think it is possible (no more than that) that Soma is being asked also to bring Rudra back, in
the form of his totem animal. Of the few hymns dedicated in full or in part to Rudra (there
are only 3 dedicated to him alone), 2 (I.43, VI.47) are Soma-Rudra hymns, so there is some
association between the two gods, whose rationale unfortunately escapes me.
Why this vs. ended up in this hymn I have no idea - except as a composite hymn it
may have attracted various vss. that were floating around, and since it addresses Soma and
uses a standard Somian verb (ā́√pū), the hymn may have seemed as good a place as any to
stash this vs. It clearly has nothing to do with the two Soma vss. that preceded nor with the
added summary vss. that follow. It also appears to be a younger vs., given the -l-form and
the non-RVic word ā́khu-.
### 31-32
On the import of these two vss., see publ. intro. They are obviously secondary
additions to the hymn, promising great benefits to anyone who studies the previous vss. of
the hymn.

Commentary IX.68-114

The trimeter portion of the IXth Maṇḍala begins with IX.68, and the Jagatī
section goes through IX.86.

## 68-70  
The theme of these three hymns, particularly insistent in the first and last,
is the difference between and ultimate unity of earthly and heavenly Soma.
## 068
On the architecture and thematics of this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 01
The position of ā́in b is distinctly odd, breaking up the simile gā́vaḥ … ná
dhenávaḥ and not even placed at a metrical boundary; indeed, the pāda has an
unusual break (⏑ / - ⏑) after late caesura. It is all the more puzzling because ā́has no
apparent function in the vs.: √syand does not otherwise appear with ā́, and the usual
nominal cases to which ā́serves as adposition are absent. Perhaps it’s a clumsy
attempt to convert the simile gā́vo ná dhenávaḥ, which fits well at the end of a
dimeter line (see VI.45.28 and nearby IX.66.12), into a Jagatī cadence. It’s also
worth noting that a more conventional order … / *ā́gā́va ná dhenávaḥ, with ā́at the
metrical boundary and the simile unbroken, would produce both a worse break and
an impossible cadence. So perhaps this was the best the poet could do - though why
does he need an ā́in the first place?
Old suggests (ad II.3.3) reading *barhiṣ-ṣádaḥ with restored sibilant cluster.
However, of the six occurrences of this cmpd a heavy second syllable would make
the meter worse in II.3.3, V.44.1 (bad breaks), though admittedly the other 4, which
open the vs., might be somewhat improved by a heavy 2nd syllable. However, the
evidence of the break should weigh more heavily than that of the opening. See Scar’s
disc. p. 570 and esp. n. 806.
The mirror-image sequence (par)isrú(tam) usrí(yā́) is rather nice.
usríyāḥ in d can be either nom. or acc. pl. (see Old, who doesn’t decide). Flg.
Ge and Re, I take it as the an acc. pl. fem., taking part in a double acc. construction
with nirníjam √dhā “assume X as garment.” As Ge points out (n. 1d) this is a
paradox: the (masc.) soma drops are likened to cows (b) and provided with udders
(c), but clothe themselves in cows(‘ milk) in d. By contrast, Scar (675) takes it as
nom. pl., which is certainly possible, but less poetically fruitful.

### 02
ā́váram “at will” may recall vā́ram (in the common Somian phrase ávyo
vā́ram, etc. “sheep’s fleece”) referring to the filter.

### 03
As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. significantly enlarges Soma’s
domain: in vs. 2 he circles around the filter at the ritual; in vs. 3 he journeys across
the two world halves, Heaven and Earth -- and in fact makes them swell up with his
“imperishable milk” (the soma juice itself, presumably).
ákṣitā is most likely instr. sg. with páyasā, on the basis of IX.31.5 páyaḥ ...
duduhré ákṣitam, though Old suggests the possibility that it would be dual nom./acc.
Although this would make reasonable contextual sense -- the two imperishable
worlds -- it would need to be fem. and therefore *ákṣite. Old floats the possibility that
the preceding dual adj. sākaṃvṛ́dhā could have influenced the ending. But on the
whole, since páyas- ákṣita- is found elsewhere, it seems best to stick with that
grammatically acceptable alternative.
The root affiliation of the intens. part. vivévidat is disputed. Though Gr
assigns it to √vid ‘find’, Ge, Re (explicitly in his n.), Lü (228-29) take it to √vid
‘know’ (“Der … genau kennt”; “qui discernes”). I follow Schaef (183-84) (and Gr)
in taking it to √vid ‘find’; the point, I think, is that at every soma-pressing Soma refinds and re-defines the domain he crosses, here encompassing the whole universe. It
should be noted that the middle part. to this same intens. stem also governs rájasī in
I.72.4 ā́ródasī brhat ̥ ī́vévidānāḥ, though I tr. it ‘ever possessing’ there. See comm. ad
loc.

### 04
As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. carries on and develops the themes
of vs. 3. In that vs. Soma moves across the two worlds, implying a horizontal axis,
while here, in my view, we shift to the vertical -- with Soma’s head in heaven and his
foot(print) on earth. This vs. is much discussed by Lü (228-32), who also emphasizes
the cosmic, but because he always strictly separates the heavenly and the earthly
soma, I think in a way he misses the point.
My image of the vertical Soma depends on taking padám in b as his
‘footprint’, but this is not the standard interpr. in this passage, where padám is
generally taken simply as ‘place’ vel sim. (Ge Stätte, Re séjour), with Ge further
specifying it as the cup. His identification of the padá- with the cup then leads Ge to
a somewhat aberrant tr. of pinvate (‘overflow’: “… macht … seine Stätte
überquellen”). But the middle voice of pinvate, contrasting with act. pinvat in the
previous vs. (3b), encourages a self-beneficial (/-involved) interpr. of the verb, as
does the instr. svadháyā ‘by his independent power’ -- which supports my interpr. of
padám as referring to Soma’s own footprint.
And what does it mean that he “swells his own footprint”? I connect this with
vājáyann apáḥ “stirring the waters” in pāda a. Here I would agree with Lü that these
are the heavenly waters, and I further suggest that these waters, stirred up by the
heavenly Soma and fallen from heaven as rain, are what swells his footprint and the
earth on which it’s emplanted. This rain may also be indirectly alluded to in pāda c.
The grain that ornaments the soma plant is probably, on the one hand, a reference to
the variety of soma drink into which grain is mixed (see IX.55.1 and comm.; also
Ober II.55), but I think it also likely alludes to the fecundating power of rain and the
vegatation it produces.
There are two finite verbs in d, both accented (adjacent … násate rákṣate …),
with no overt mark of subordination. With most interpr. I take the násate clause as
implicitly subordinated, with rákṣate beginning the main cl., but contrastive verbal
accent of adjacent verbs could as easily be invoked (and would make little diff. in
interpr.: “he joins … he guards …”). Lü makes much of the last clause, and in fact
takes śíraḥ as subj. of rákṣate (which seems unlikely on rhetorical grounds), but I
think the sense is fairly straightforward: even while soma is being pressed by the
fingers at the earthly ritual, he keeps his head safe in heaven.

### 05
As disc. in the publ. intro., this is an omphalos vs., which provides the
solution to the paradoxes set up in the earlier vss. of the hymn, albeit in veiled form -
- veiling that has kept its actual contents obscure (and may still do).
The first half is fairly clear, until almost the end: it refers to the birth of Soma,
here called both a kaví and “the embryo of truth” (ṛtásya gárbhaḥ)(see further
below). This embryo was deposited, presumably at its birth or even its conception,
“beyond the twins” (yamā́paráḥ). Given the two previous vss., which contain duals
that refer to the two world-halves, Heaven and Earth (so identified by Ge and Re,
e.g.), the most sensible interpr. of “the twins” here is as a reference to the same pair -
- esp. since H+E were referred to by the fem. of the ‘twin’ word in 3a (yamyā̀)(in
addition to 3c mahī́apāré rájasī and 4a mātárā). But this interpr. is somewhat
clouded by the fact that the next pāda (5c) contains both a dual phrase yū́nā … sántā
and a dual verb ví jajñatuḥ. It is of course the default interpr. that all three of these
duals (the two NPs and the verb) should refer to the same pair. What is somewhat
baffling to me is that Ge (followed by Re) decides that this pair is the Aśvins (see
esp. his n. 5bc). The Aśvins do not otherwise appear in this hymn, and indeed Re
outlines firm grounds to reject this identification in his hesitant n.: “la participation
des Aśvin au cycle du Soma étant faible et le contexte cd insuffisamment précis.”
(Curiously, though Ge’s more overreaching mythological interventions often stem
from Sāy., Sāy. in this case provides the far more sensible interpr. of the two as
Soma and Sūrya.) I think the Aśvins can safely be dismissed as candidates for the
dual reference (so also Lü 275). Let us then return to the more likely referent for
yamā́in b: Heaven and Earth. Pāda b seems simply to be saying that Soma (or part of
Soma) was deposited as an embryo beyond Heaven and Earth, giving him cosmic
reach indeed.
The trickier pāda is c. The presence of a dual nom./acc. and a dual verb of
course invites the former to be taken as subject of the latter, and the standard interpr.
understandably follow this path, with the sg. subj. of ab supplied as obj. of the verb --
e.g., Ge “Als Jünglinge haben sie ihn zuerst ausfindig gemacht.” This is obviously
possible, and it need not involve identifying the two youths as the Aśvins; Heaven
and Earth could be the pair in question. However, the dual NP raises several
questions. For one thing, are Heaven and Earth really young? And even if so, what
does this have to do with the action in question. Further: why sántā? The pres. part.
of √as in the nominative is usually concessive, but “although being young” doesn't
make much sense here. I assume Ge’s “Als” is his only recognition of the participle;
Re’s “jeunes encores” must be his (see also Lü’s “Als sie jung waren,” 275). But
none of these renderings really accounts for why the participle is there, or for why
H+E are identified as youths.
I have a less straightforward interpr. of this pāda -- inspired in great part by
Ge’s interpr. of pāda d, which he takes (n. 5d) as depicting the two births of Soma,
the heavenly and the earthly. I think these two forms of Soma are already present in
pāda c, in the accusative phrase yū́nā … sántā, and the subj. of the dual verb ví
jajñatuḥ is Heaven and Earth, not overtly present but referred to as the yamā́in b (as
well as in vss. 3-4). Under this interpr. the participle sántā has a reason to be there: it
is an existential in a predicated proposition after ví √jñā ‘recognize’ -- rendered in
the publ. tr. by “that there were two youths.” And of course it makes sense that
Heaven and Earth would be the first to notice this, because the two births were
located in those two places. It also makes sense that the two forms of Soma would be
identified as ‘youths’, since they were recently born.
Following Ge on pāda d, the first mentioned birth “deposited in secret” (gúhā
hitám) is the heavenly one (picking up níhito yamā́paráḥ in b), while a bit
paradoxically (because of the úd ‘up’), the one “held aloft” (údyatam) is the earthly
one, referring to the ritual presentation of the soma.
Given this interpr. of the 2nd hemistich, it is quite possible that pādas a and b
refer to these two different births: the poet born with skill and mind (a) would be the
earthly Soma, equipped for his ritual role, while the one deposited beyond the twins
(b) would obviously be the heavenly one.

### 06
The famous Somaraub, i.e., the stealing of Soma from heaven effected by a
falcon and treated esp. (though obscurely) in IV.26-27, is rarely mentioned in
Maṇḍala IX, as Ober (II.162) points out. Here it serves to bring the heavenly Soma to
earth, to join with and super-charge the earthly, ritual Soma—the difference between
the two Somas having been treated in vs. 5.
As noted in the publ. intro., the omphalos vs. 5 is encased in lexical rings.
Here vividuḥ responds to vivévidat in 3c (and both relate semantically to ví jijñatuḥ in
the omphalos vs., 5c), aṃśúm (6d) and its semantic doublet ándhas (6b) to aṃśúḥ in
4c, pariyántam (6d) to pariyán (2c) (cf. also pariprayántam 8a), and suvṛ́dham (6c) to
sākaṃvṛ́dham (3b).
In addition to lexical rings, there is chaining: 6c marjayanta is picked up by
7a mṛjanti (with no semantic or functional difference between the stems or the
voices: marjayanta is an -anta replacement); 6a manīṣíṇaḥ ‘possessing inspired
thoughts’ by 8b manīṣā́ḥ ‘inspired thoughts’.

### 07
The fingers of the pressers are found both here in pāda a and in 4d, though
with different lexical realizations and different functions in the vs. There is also an
exact, though mirror-image, responsion: yató nṛ́bhiḥ (4d): nṛ́bhir yatáḥ (7d). On the
other hand, hitám in 7b almost surely belongs to √hi ‘impel’, while hitám in 5d
belongs to √dhā ‘place, deposit’.

### 08
Ge (see his n. 8a) takes vayyàm as the PN of a hero aided by Indra to whom
Soma is compared: “(einem zweiten) Vayya.” Although a hero of that name does
exist, his presence seems limited to passages where he is mentioned with the better
attested Turvīti (I.54.6, II.13.12, I.19.6) or, once, in a list of clients of the Aśvins
(I.112.6). The du. form in II.3.6 vayyè (or vayyā̀; see comm. ad loc.) belongs to a
separate stem vayī́- ‘weaver’. Despite Ge’s energetic attempt to justify it, the
introduction of a minor hero from the Indra cycle makes no sense here (any more
than his introduction of the Aśvins in vs. 5). I therefore adopt Re’s suggestion (disc.
in detail in his n.) that vayyà- here is a deriv. of vayā́- ‘branch, twig’, which could
easily describe the soma, esp. as the pressed juice is circling the filter (see immed.
preceding paiprayántam) and leaving its twigs behind.
On the other hand, Ge’s explan. of suṣaṃsádam ‘keeping good company’ is
persuasive; it refers either to the gods and priests or to the water and the milk (or, I
would add, both).
The standard tr. (not, however, Scar [608]) construe diváḥ in c with vā́cam in
d; cf., e.g., Re “… lance la voix (venue) du ciel,” which is then further interpr. as
thunder (see Ge’s n. 8d, Ober II.209). But I prefer to take diváḥ with immed.
preceding ūrmíṇā for several reasons: 1) a pāda boundary and the verb intervene
between diváḥ and vā́cam; 2) the ūrmí- from heaven is found in IX.49.1 apā́m ūrmíṃ
divás pári; 3) the formulaic VP íyarti vā́cam (II.42.1, III.8.5, 34.2, IV.21.5, etc.) does
not otherwise appear with a source of the speech specified. Surely the point here is
that when the soma is being ritually prepared he/it inspires ritual speech.

### 09
Here again the standard tr. supply ‘speech’ as obj. of the chained iyarti, as is
very probable, but make diváḥ dependent on this gapped obj. (e.g., Ge “(die Stimme)
des Himmels”); again I construe diváḥ elsewhere, here with rájaḥ ‘realm’. For the
phrase cf. divó rájaḥ I.62.5, 110.6. The further point here is that the ritual speech
inspired by Soma is impelled all the way to heaven.
The VP várivo vidat “finds wide space” (d) responds in sense (and partially
etymologically) to urú jráyaḥ “wide expanse” in 2c.

### 10  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. functions as an extra-hymnic summary
vs., signalled by the initial evā́, which often begins summary vss. It is distinguished
from the rest of the hymn by being in Triṣṭubh not Jagatī. Its 2nd hemistich also
reaches beyond Soma: in c we call on Heaven and Earth, and d is addressed in the 2nd
pl. to the gods in general, not to Soma. This pāda has the feel of a refrain, though it is
found only once elsewhere, at X.45.12. However, its major elements are found in
various permutations in other passages, e.g., I.85.12 rayíṃ no dhatta vṛṣaṇaḥ
suvī́ram. For a similar finale see the next hymn, IX.69.10. On the reason for the focus
on Heaven and Earth see comm. on that vs. and on IX.70 passim.
## 069

### 01
The first pāda of this vs. has an overt subject, matíḥ ‘thought’, as does the
last, sómaḥ. The intervening pādas have only similes to which the missing subject is
compared. In my view both the thought and the soma are possible in b and c, and the
double reading is deliberate. Ge (1b) suggests that Indra is another possibility in b,
but introducing Indra seems gratuitous.
The referent of init. ásya in d is uncertain. Since sómaḥ is the overt subject of
the pāda and is performing his action “under the commandments of this one” (ásya
vratéṣu), it might seem that soma is excluded as a referent. Re suggests a priest, Ge
the singer or the sacrificer, or perhaps soma, Old (fld by Schmidt, vrata 76) soma,
with the ásya reflexive. Since most forms of vratá- in IX are specifically Soma’s
(e.g., IX.53.3 ásya vratā́ni nā́dhṛ́ṣe, pávamānasya … “The commandments of this
self-purifying one cannot be ventured against”), that seems the likeliest solution here,
esp. as no ritual personnel have been mentioned as yet. However, I think it likely that
we’re dealing once again with the double identity of soma/Soma: heavenly Soma the
god has vratá-; earthly, ritual soma obeys them.
The verb of d, iṣyate, is assigned by Ge (fld. by Kulikov 459), to √iṣ ‘desire’;
among other things this requires interpr. vratéṣu in a very forced manner, as ‘work’:
“Zu den Werken dieses ist der Soma erwünscht.” Better is the ascription to √iṣ
‘send’ (e.g., Gr, Re, Lub). The verb is unaccented, but (pace Gr, Wh Rts, Lub) it
probably does not belong to the same stem as the act. transitive -ya-pres. íṣyati (once
1st sg. mid. iṣye IV.33.1, also transitive), but rather to a separate pass. stem with
underlying accent *iṣyáte. It is functionally parallel with úpa sarji ‘is/has been
released’ in b.

### 02
The accent of the two adjacent verbs pṛcyáte sicyáte suggests that the first
clause is implicitly subordinate. The two subjects of vs. 1, the thought (matí-) and
soma, are both found here (soma as ‘honey’ [mádhu]), but each as subj. of one of the
verbs, rather than, as in vs. 1, as simultaneous subjects of verbs without overt
subjects. Most tr. take úpa … pṛcyáte as ‘is fertilized, impregnated’ vel sim; see the
full treatment in Kulikov 152 and n. 372. Because the actions of the two verbs in the
pāda are presented as complementary, I prefer the more physically explicit ‘is
engorged’: as the thought is filling up and swelling with eloquence, as if with liquid,
the liquid soma is being disgorged, poured out.
With the Pp as well as most tr. (see inter alia Ge’s n. 2b), I take mandrā́janī as
a karmadhāraya, mandra-ájanī-, rather than the equally possible bahuvrīhi mandráajanī. But its sense, as a metaphorical reference to the tongue, is best illuminated by
the bahuvrīhi (obviously based on a karmadh) mandrá-jihva- ‘having a gladdening
tongue’.
The stem saṃtaní- is found 3x in the RV (here, V.73.7, IX.97.14), always
with regard to loud noise. It seems generally to be assumed that it’s derived from
√tan ‘stretch’ (though Gr [s.v.] ascribes it to his 2 tan ‘thunder’ not 1 tan ‘stretch’,
that seems to be a mistake: see his comment under 1tan + sám) - hence tr. like Re’s
“concert.” It is true that the ppl. saṃtata- to √tan ‘stretch’ is a later (ŚS) tech. term
describing “stretched and continuous recitation” (see Re’s Vocabulaire, Sen’s
Dictionary of the Vedic Rituals, both s.v.), hence applied to sound, and ‘a stretching
together’ for saṃtaní- could perhaps refer to strings sounded in unison. But a more
likely root is ready to hand: √tan ‘thunder’, the s-less form of √stan ‘id.’, which can
be used metaphorically of the sound of ritual speech, etc. (e.g., VI.38.2). I therefore
render saṃtaní- as ‘thunder, thundering’ in all three occurrences. The preverb sam
probably contributes its frequent intensifying sense ‘entirely’.
The sense of the simile praghnatā́m iva is not entirely clear. prá √han occurs
only three times in the RV: here; in the enigmatic hymn, X.27.1, where, however, it
has the fairly clear violent meaning ‘smite, smite off’, as it does in a number of
passages in the AV; and in the negated root noun cmpd áprahan- (VI.44.4) also
meaning ‘not smiting’. But here it must refer to the noise (“thundering,” saṃtaníḥ)
produced by the action of prá √han, not the associated violence (pace Scar 689, who
places it in the ‘zuschlagend, losschlagend, kämpfend’ realm). Perhaps prá √han
here refers to the beating of drums, or perhaps it is an early reference to the practice
of hunting with “beaters” driving the game in the direction of the shooters. On the
whole, the former is more likely; we know essentially nothing about hunting
practices in ancient India, and furthermore it’s not clear to me that the beaters
themselves would make much noise, though the flushed game might, in combination
with any dogs the beaters had with them.

### 03
Ge plausibly suggests that the wives Soma is seeking (vadhūyúḥ) are the
waters and the milk.
The ritual action referred to in b is quite clear, but the referent of the
metaphorical subject is harder to decode. The act in question is the sluffing off of the
twigs and other detritus as the juice runs across the filter, as is clear from the more
explicit passage in the immediately preceding hymn, IX.68.2 upārúhaḥ śratháyan
svādate háriḥ “loosening his shoots, the tawny one becomes sweet,” whose verb
śratháya- is of course derivationally related to our verb śrathnīté. The problem is that
the subject is feminine, naptī́r áditeḥ “the granddaughter (/niece/descendant) of
Aditi.” As Ge (flg. Sāy.) notes, the actual referent is most likely the soma plant. But
the words for soma plant (aṃśú-) and soma stalk (ándhas-) are m. and n.
respectively. The best gender match would be óṣadhi- ‘plant’, but the soma plant is
never so called, as far as I know, and the word is very rare in IX, where the few
occurrences do not refer to the soma plant. I can only suggest that the sexualized
image of the plant loosening its garments, combined with the surrounding feminine
imagery (esp. 3a, 4ab) encouraged the use of an explicitly female subject - and
perhaps an underlying fem. óṣadhi- was conjured up. But I am not particularly
satisfied with this. Old suggests instead that the referent is the cow, “die … ihren
Verschluss locker macht d. h. Milch gibt.” Though this would solve the gender
problem, it would distance the passage from the parallel in IX.68.2.
The subject is all the more puzzling because the female in question is
(possibly - see below) identified as the descendant of Aditi. Now Aditi is of course
famous for her motherhood, but her children are also famously sons. Brereton
(Ādityas, 234-35) thinks that Aditi is here because of the reference to ‘truth’ (ṛtá-),
with which she is associated elsewhere, but does not address the question of the
gender of Aditi’s offspring here. Again I have no good explanation, but see below for
another way of construing áditeḥ.
The referent of the dat. part. in the phrase ṛtáṃ yaté is also disputed. Ge, I
think plausibly, takes it as the soma juice, which, having shed the detritus of the plant
in the filter, can flow to its goal. Lü (484 n. 1), fld. by Re, thinks rather of the mortal
offerer, which is certainly possible. The issue is made more complex by the parallel
in IX.74.3, whose b pāda ends, like here, áditer ṛtáṃ yaté. One troubling feature is
that in both cases the standard interpr. (incl. the publ. tr.) construes áditeḥ with what
precedes, although it is found in the repeated phrase and therefore might be expected
to belong with what follows. Moreover, the referent of ṛtáṃ yaté in IX.74.3 is no
more - indeed less - clear than it is here. It could be soma or it could be the mortal
worshiper. In IX.74.3 I suggest, somewhat unsatisfactorily, that it could be read both
ways; here I think soma as referent makes better sense. In IX.74.3 I also suggest that
we should take the repeated phrase seriously and construe áditeḥ to the right, not the
left, yielding “for him who goes to the truth of Aditi.” If we do that here as well, we
are spared the problem of why the plant is the descendant of Aditi, though without a
genitive of relationship, “granddaughter” is oddly underdefined. Nonetheless I
suggest a possible alternative tr.: “The granddaughter loosens (her garment [=shoots
of the soma plant]) for him who goes to the truth of Aditi.” Of course it would be
possible to read áditeḥ twice, both with what precedes and with what follows.
### 04-05
There is considerable chaining between these two vss.: pári … avyata
(4d), pári vyata (5b); niktám (4d), nirṇijānáḥ (5b), nirṇíje (5c), all referring to
Soma’s clothing himself in milk. On the connections with the next hymn, see comm.
ad IX.70.1.

### 05
The 2nd half of this vs. once again portrays Soma as reaching through the
midspace to heaven. On the technicalities see Ge’s long n. 5cd.

### 06
The form prasúpaḥ to the hapax root noun cmpd prasúp- is potentially
multivalent; it has been analyzed as a nom. pl., modifying the soma juices, an acc. pl.
obj. of drāvayitnávaḥ ‘causing to run’, or as an abl. infinitive (see Ge, Re, Old; Gr
takes it as nom. pl.). Although most interpr. think it has to be one or the other, I see
no reason why this ambig. form can’t be read twice in the passage: I take it as both
acc. pl. and abl. sg. Re’s view is similar to mine, in that he wants it to serve as acc.
pl. with the causative adj. as well as nom. pl., but he suggests this is the result of
“haplologie à distance,” which seems unnec. to me. There are numerous examples of
poets exploiting morphological ambiguity to allow a word to have two (or more)
different functions in a clause.
With Ge I take the “stretched string” as a reference to the filter.
The final pāda is uncertain. Both Ge and Re take dhā́ma as the subj. of pavate,
though with different interpr. of the resonant word dhā́man-: “Ohne Indra läutert sich
kein Ding”; “Sans Indra, nulle structure (sômique) ne se clarifie (valablement).”
However, I find it unlikely that a dhā́man-, whatever it refers to, can purify itself,
and I am reluctant to take pavate, which in its overwhelming number of uses is
reflexive, as a passive. Instead I take Soma as subject, as he essentially always is
(incl. in vs. 3), with dhā́ma as the object of a transitive self-beneficial, a slight
expansion of the usual reflexive usage. The sense (whatever the interpr. of pavate) is
of course that the ritual soma-pressing is pointless without Indra, the archetypal
soma-drinker, to consume the product. I think it possible that dhā́man- ‘domain’ here
refers to the filter, as in IX.63.14.

### 07
The “bulls” of b (vṛ́ṣa-cyuta-) are generally and persuasively taken as the
pressing stones (Ge, Re), but it is also possible that it’s a reference to Indra, given 6d.
The presence of Indra gives impetus to the ritual preparation, just as his absence robs
it of motivation.

### 08
The naḥ in pāda a was omitted in tr.; it should read “bring us (wealth) …”
Soma is addressed in the sg. (voc. soma), but the rest of the clause is couched
in the pl. (“you [pl.] are …”: yūyám … sthana), with the common vacillation between
the sg. substance / god and the pl. juices / pressings.

### 10  
The last pāda of this vs., like the 2nd half of the final vs. of the previous
hymn (IX.68.10cd), enlarges the divine range beyond Soma (and Indra). It is
addressed to Heaven and Earth, along with the (other) gods - the same set of divine
personnel found in X.68.10cd. The focus on Heaven and Earth in both IX.68.10, and
this vs. may have to do with the theme of heavenly versus earthly soma explored in
these two hymns, esp. IX.68. The theme is continued in IX.70, which focuses even
more on Heaven and Earth in the hymn itself, not merely the summary vs.
## 070
On some of the difficulties in the hymn see publ. intro. Much of the problem
lies in the fact that the referents of many of the crucial elements are not identified
and are not easily supplied from context; it is worth noting, for example, that the
word sóma- does not appear till vs. 7c. Framing the whole as an extended treatment
of the relationship between the earthly and the heavenly soma aids in interpr. The
insistence on the word ubhé ‘both’ (vss. 2-5) noted by Ge (n. 2-5) may underline this
double vision.

### 01
The opening pāda of this hymn shows the power of the ritual hic et nunc:
the 2nd word, asmai, is unaccented, which indicates that the referent is something
already in the discourse. This “something” is of course soma/Soma, both present on
the ritual ground and the acknowledged dedicand of the hymn. There is no need for a
prior mention. See also IX.11.1a and with asya IX.29.1a and IX.30.1a.
As noted in the publ. intro. (and see Ge’s n. 1), this vs. surely concerns the
heavenly soma, whose real (satyā́m) milk mixture is produced for him in distant
heaven. I do not think this necessarily requires the cows of pāda a to be the celestial
rivers, as Lü predictably does (250); it may involve the interplay between earthly
cows and heavenly milk.
The making of Soma’s garments was something of a preoccupation of the
previous hymn, IX.69, esp. vss. 4-5, using some of the same phraseology, though the
hymns are attributed to different poets from different lineages. Note esp. IX.69.5c
divás pṛṣṭhám … nirṇíje kṛta “he has made the back of heaven for his raiment” and
our 1c catvā́ri anyā́bhúvanāni nirṇíje, cā́rūṇi cakre “he made the four other dear
worlds for his raiment” (in my tr.), both with ACC nirṇíje √kṛ. Both Ge and Lü (438,
566) take bhúvanāni here as “beings” (Wesen), while Re attenuates it to “essences,”
but given the cosmic imagery of IX.69.5, I think that it more likely refers to Soma’s
clothing himself in “worlds.” Furthermore, I am not at all sure that the substances
that Ge (n. 1c, partially flg. Sāy.) considers the referent of bhúvanāni, namely
(various) water(s) and milk, would be called bhúvana- in Vedic. Although German
Wesen can cover ‘nature, essence’ in addition to ‘being’, I doubt that bhúvana- has
the same semantic range. It does give me pause, however, that in the next vs. (2c)
Soma wraps himself in the waters.
There is another problem in this little phrase - one of my own making. By my
rules (“Vedic anyá- 'another, the other': Syntactic disambiguation,” in Sound Law
and Analogy [Fs. Beekes], ed. A. Lubotsky, 1997: 111-18), 2nd position anyá-, the
position anyā́takes here, should be definite. I have so translated it (“the four other …
worlds”), though I cannot identify which four other worlds these would be. Neither
five (1+4) or four is a standard number for cosmic divisions in the RV. The standard
tr. take it as indefinite (e.g., Ge “vier andere schöne Wesen”), and I admit that an
indefinite reading is less problematic (though scarcely unproblematic). Perhaps the
presence of a numeral in first position may displace anyá- to the right, or perhaps it
even performs a quasi-definitizing function. The quantifier víśva- always occurs with
non-initial anyá-, though usually pāda-final (1997: 112, 114). In any case I would
now favor an alternative tr. “He made four other dear worlds to be his raiment,”
though in the absence of an understanding of what the “four” are—no good solutions
have so far been suggested—a definite interpr. remains a possibility.
Though Ge renders ṛtaíḥ as “nach den Regeln,” Lü (438, 566) is surely right
that ṛtá- here refers to hymns (Kultlieder), which are in some sense true speech. Re
points out the presence of both satyá- (b) and ṛtá- (d) in the vs.

### 02
The phrase amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇaḥ recurs in the same position in vs. 4 and must
have the same referent. (See also IX.108.4, 110.4.) What that referent is is disputed.
Unlikely is Lü’s interpr. (237), fld. by Re, that it refers to a celestial seat: Soma
separates Heaven and Earth in order to make a place for himself, from which he can
create the heavenly streams. Ge tr. “Göttertrank,” and (n. 2a) equates this with the
heavenly Soma. In this I think he is correct, with amṛ́ta- here the nominalized neut.
‘(drink) of immortality’, hence the neut. form of the adj. cā́ruṇaḥ. (On supposed
masc. cā́ruṇaḥ in VIII.5.14, see comm. ad loc.). The subject who seeks the share of
the heavenly Soma is of course earthly Soma. He has the power to separate H+E
because of his kā́vya- ‘poetic skill’; recall that earthly Soma was born as a kaví- in
IX.68.5a, and it may be that what earthly Soma has going for him that heavenly
Soma does not is his way with words and kinship with the human poet.
The lexeme used to express the separation, lit. the “loosening,” of Heaven and
Earth is ví √śrath. The same root is used in IX.68 and IX.69 to characterize Soma’s
sluffing off of his stems and twigs on his journey across the filter (IX.68.2b
śratháyan, IX.69.3b śrathnīte). Although the action here is very different from that in
those two passages, it is worth noting that the same root, a not particularly common
one, is used.
The instr. maṃhánā is a bit difficult to fit into context. The stem ordinarily
means ‘liberality, generosity’. Ge (Lü) tr. “bereitwillig,” following Gr’s gloss, Re
“avec majesté.” If we stick with the base meaning ‘liberality’, I think it’s possible to
extend it to ‘lavishly’ - as in “sprinkle liberally with salt,” etc. Here it would refer to
the generous amount of Soma’s covering.
In d yádī must surely be decoupled into yád ī, as seems to be tacitly
recognized by all the standard tr. “If” would not work in context.
I do not really understand the last pāda, in part because it is unclear who the
subj. of vidúḥ is. Ge (n. 2d) tentatively suggests either the waters or the gods, Sāy.
(fld. by Lü) the priests; Re’s tr. implies the waters, but he alternatively suggests
priests in his n. Since no priests and no gods have been mentioned so far, and the
waters are found in the main cl. to which this subordinate cl. is attached, the waters
seem the most likely candidate. But what is the point? Does Soma get to appropriate
the waters as his garment when they come near because they know he’s there
(because of his fame) and recognize his seat? And which Soma are we talking about
- earthly (which I weakly favor, because the waters are likely to be the ritual waters)
or heavenly? The problem is compounded by the verb: the pf. véda is generally
stative (‘know’), but my tr. (and those of others) implicitly assumes a dynamic
change of state, ‘recognize’ vel sim.; see Ge’s “in Erfahrung bringen,” Re’s “elles
eurent (re)connu (son) siège.” A more stative interpr. would be possible if yád is
rendered ‘since’, not ‘when’. I confess to puzzlement.

### 03
The dichotomy between the earthly and the heavenly continues here, with
Heaven and Earth being replaced by their proxies, gods and men - implied in b by
“both races” (janúṣī ubhé) and explicit in c in nṛmṇā́ca devyā̀ca. The ketú- in pāda a
also has double reference in my view: on the one hand, ketú- can be used of the
beacon(s), that is, the ray(s), of the sun (e.g., I.50.3, VII.63.2); on the other hand, in
two of the very few other occurrences of this stem in IX (IX.86.5-6) Soma’s ketávaḥ
circle around the filter, an apparent reference to the glinting soma drops. So we have
a joint reference to the heavenly Soma as sun’s rays and the earthly soma sparkling
in its ritual progress; the two together can pervade the two races of gods and men (b)
and purify what is associated with them (c).
In d manánāḥ is problematic. It is a hapax, and assuming it is an -ana-stem, it
shows aberrant accent, since such stems either have root or final accent (on the
accentuation of such stems in general see AiG II.2.180-82 and on the rarity of this
accent pattern 182; cf. 187 for neut. nouns with this accent). It’s generally taken as a
primary deriv. of √man in the meaning ‘thoughtful’. My ‘zealous’ rests on an
invented connection with manā́- ‘zeal’, which in fact rests on nothing beyond my
feeling that ‘thoughtful’ doesn’t particularly fit the context, and in any case there are
many ways to express ‘thoughtful’ that would not involve creating a nonce stem with
a peculiar accent. But I hold no brief for my own stab in the dark and simply think
that we are all missing something. On the other hand, it’s likely that there is a
primary or secondary connection to √man ‘think’, so most tr. fall within acceptable
limits.

### 04
In the first pāda we are firmly in the realm of earthly ritual soma: the
grooming by ten is a clear reference (clear to those familiar with soma rhetoric) to
the fingers of the presser at their task.
The question is what is happening in pāda b, and determining this depends in
part on the analysis of pramé. This is almost universally taken as a datival infinitive
or quasi-infinitive to prá √mā ‘measure forth’. Cf., e.g., Ge “… (fliesst er), um unter
den mittleren Müttern als Richtschnur zu dienen” and see, in addition to Old and Re,
Lü (242-43), Scar (377-78), Keydana (Inf. 201). There are several problems with the
dominant analysis: 1) the lexeme prá √mā ‘measure forth’ is not otherwise found in
the RV, except in the late X.130.3, 7, where it has been generated to pratimā́-; 2) it is
not at all clear what the pāda is supposed to mean or refer to. The standard view is
that “the middle mothers” are the rains (e.g., Ge, Re; middle because they are in the
midspace), but this doesn’t actually help with the sense - nor does Lü’s interpr. as
(guess what!) die Himmelsflüsse. In fact plural “mothers” in IX, and mostly
elsewhere, generally refers either to cows or to waters. None of those who favor
‘rains’ provides evidence for mothers=rains in the RV, and rain would be out of
place in this context. Nor do I see what the “measuring” would consist of.
I suggest instead that pramé belongs to √mā ‘bellow’ (a possibility
considered, but not favored, by Scar). Although prá does not appear with this root in
the RV, it is attested with other verbs of roaring; cf. nearby IX.77.1 eṣá prá kóśe …
acikradat “This one has cried out in the bucket.” Soma’s propensity for noisemaking
is often highlighted, indeed in this very hymn; see in the next few vss. 6b nā́nadat
‘roaring again and again’, 7a ruváti ‘bellows’ (and by implication 5c śúṣmeṇa ‘with
his blustering’). Under this analysis of pramé the pāda can make sense in the ritual
context established by pāda a: the prá opening b invites a verb of motion to be
supplied (“[goes] forth”), depicting the journey of Soma after his pressing, which
was treated in pāda a. He bellows on this journey, as he passes first among the waters
and then the cows [=milk]. The “midmost mothers” are, in my view, the waters with
which he mixes before reaching the milk - “midmost” because of their position
between filter and milk.
As for sácā, as disc. ad IV.31.5 sácā is generally a pleonastic marker of a loc.
absol. Here though I do not interpr. madhyamā́su mātṛ́ṣu as an absol. construction, I
would still consider sácā essentially functionless, just pleonastically accompanying
the loc. phrase. If we want to assign lexical value to it, however, it could express
Soma’s bellowing in company with the mothers: waters also frequently make noise.
In c the earthly soma is still at issue - here protecting the commandments
(vratā́ni pānáḥ) of the heavenly Soma, once again designated amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇah as in
2a; see comm. ad loc. A similar relationship between the earthly soma and the
commandments of the heavenly Soma is found in the previous hymn, IX.69.1d.

### 05
The repetition of a passively used part. to √mṛj, intens. marmṛjāná-,
matching mṛjyámāna- in the opening pāda of the previous vs. 4a, situates us in the
same ritual context as that vs. Again Soma sets out on his journey beyond the filter,
through the territory that here is configured as “between the two worlds” (ubhé antā́
ródasī).
Forms of the root √hṛṣ sometimes take dat. infinitives; cf. VIII.19.19 ágne
hárṣasva dā́tave “O Agni, be roused to give” (sim. IV.21.9). Contrary to the standard
tr., I therefore construe indriyā́ya dhā́yase with harṣate. The adj. indriyá- lit.
‘Indriyan, relating / appropriate to Indra’ has personal reference here (as also in the
same phrase in IX.86.3): “for Indra’s suckling.”
On śurúdh- see, inter alia, KEWA, EWA both s.v., Thieme 1941 (=KlSch
338-49), Scar 63, 464. The etymology is disputed, in part because the segmentation
of this disyllable is unclear: śur-údh or śu-rúdh-. The former is supposed to be
parallel to a putative *iṣ-údh- found in the denom. iṣudhyá-, but I have suggested a
different etym. for this word: see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming “ “Vedic
iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” The latter
segmentation is favored by Thieme, who derives it from *(p)śu-rúdh- ‘das Vieh
mehrend’. Scar (464) objects that we would then expect *śū-rúdh- (like anū-rúdh-,
vī-rúdh-), but that is precisely what needs to be read here (see already Gr); otherwise
the cadence is the very bad - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ x. No other forms of the stem occur in the
cadence; of the other 9 attestations, 5 are found after an early caesura, where a heavy
first syllable would change the standard break ⏑ ⏑ - to a still very common - ⏑ -; the
other 4 occur after a late caesura ending with a heavy syllable, where - / - ⏑ would
definitely be less acceptable than the normal - / ⏑ ⏑ produced by reading a light first
syllable. On the whole I am inclined to accept Thieme’s etymology, at least in
preference to one based on a 2nd member -udh, and to assume an original *śūrúdh-, at
home here and possibly in the 5 forms after early caesura, whose first syllable was
ultimately shortened by analogy to compds in su-.

### 06
Both Ge and Re assume that the ná in a is wrongly placed and that the
simile really targets usríyaḥ (though they both somehow work the two mothers into
it). I think rather that mātárā ná is the complete simile and the “two mothers” are
being compared to the gapped goal “Heaven and Earth.” Cf. IX.97.13 nadáyann eti
prthiv ̥ ī́m utá dyā́m “roaring he goes to H+E” to our nā́nadad eti. The “two mothers”
as stand-ins for H+E are found in our little group of hymns in IX.68.4 sá mātárā
vicáran.
The 2nd hemistich is difficult to sort out because it is unclear how to
distribute the series of acc. sgs. in c: ṛtám prathamám yát súvarṇaram. I take all three
together, with ṛtám modified by prathamám and further specified by yát svàrṇaram,
a nominal izafe-type construction, all as obj. of jānán. Ge (and Re) take everything
up to yát as obj. of jānán, but svàrṇaram as obj. of avṛṇīta. Lü (396) has ṛtám as obj.
of jānán, yát svàrṇaram as obj. of avṛṇīta, and prathamám as adv. All three take
svàrṇara- as a place name: for Ge a place famous for its soma, for Lüders the
Himmelsquell of soma. But, as disc. ad IV.21.3, svàrṇara- is a name only in VIII;
otherwise it seems to refer to a “realm of solar glory,” different from Heaven and
Earth, as shown by IV.21.3 and X.65.4, where Heaven and Earth and various other
places appear parallel to svàrṇara-.
However we distribute the accusatives, each of us has to decide what this
hemistich is trying to say, and I would not say that any of us has succeeded in this.
With regard to my own interpr., I tentatively suggest that once again its subject is the
earthly, ritual soma; in his cosmic journey to and through Heaven and Earth he
recognizes the sun as “the first truth” and chooses it as his alter ego, his cosmic
doublet, which resounds to his own glorification. In this paraphrase I realize that it is
unclear why this is the “first” truth, and I therefore consider it possible that
prathamám is adverbial, as Lü takes it - and suggest an alternate tr. “first recognizing
the truth that is the realm of solar splendor …” But all this is very sketchy.

### 07
Once again the nirṇíj- (see above, ad vs. 1), here firmly anchored in the
ritual here-and-now as the sheepskin filter. The bovine skin (gavyáyī tvák) either
refers to the milk mixture or the cowhide on which the pressing apparatus is set up.

### 08
Although the med. part. punāná- is generally passive or at least used
absolutely, as opposed to reflexive pávamāna- ‘self-purifying’, here it must be
reflexive-transitive, with tanvàm. The construction is in fact proleptic: “purifying his
body/himself (so that he/it is) spotless.”
On the isolated -iṣ-aor. adhāviṣṭa and its deriv. from √dhāv ‘run’ not √dhāv
‘rinse’, see detailed disc. by Narten (Sig.Aor. s.v. dhāv), also Ge n. 8b, Re n.
In the publ. tr. I interpr. “threefold” (tridhā́tu) as a reference to the soma at the
three soma pressings, even though the three pressings are actually not terribly
prominent in this maṇḍala. The same phrase is found in IX.1.8 and similar ones at
VI.44.23, IX.86.46. However, this is not the standard, or even a standard, view. Sāy.
thinks it refers to three additives with which the soma is mixed: water, sour
milk/curds (dadhi, not an additive in the RV soma ritual), and milk (payas), though at

### 08
he suggests rather three (later) soma vessels: droṇakalaśa, ādhavanīya, and
pūtabhṛt, none of which is found in the RV (though dróṇa and kaláśa- individually
are both soma vessels). Ge in both passages (IX.1 n. 8c, IX.70 n. 8d) suggests soma
juice, milk, and water. Re tr. “est fabriqué de trois manières,” but does not pronounce
on what they are. Since mádhu ‘honey’ is normally a stand-in for sóma- in this
maṇḍala, “the honey is made threefold” (tridhā́tu mádhu kriyate) seems to refer to a
three-part division of the soma itself. However, the similar phrase in IX.86.46,
mádaḥ pári tridhā́tuḥ … arṣati “the exhilarating drinks rushes around threefold,”
gives me pause, in that it seems to refer to a single incident of soma’s rushing and is
difficult therefore to parcel out to the three pressings. I therefore think that Ge’s
suggestion that it refers to a liquid made up of three parts—soma juice, water, and
milk—is probably correct, certainly at IX.86.46 but probably here and in IX.1.8 as
well. “Three-backed” (tripṛṣṭhá-) in nearby IX.71.7 may belong here too and also
perhaps the three heads (trī́n … mūrdhnáḥ) of IX.73.1.

### 09
The last pāda is a nice ex. of what appears to be a semi-gnomic expression.

### 10  
Pāda b is oddly phrased: it contains the idiom ā́pavasva, which ordinarily
means “attract X-ACC here through your purification” (see comm. ad IX.7.8 and
passim), but though it has an acc. (jaṭháram), it would seem quite odd to say “attract
Indra’s belly here through your purification.” It seems rather to be a variant of 9b
índrasya hā́rdi … ā́viśa “enter the heart of Indra.” And the lexeme ā́pavate does
seem to have a variant construction with acc. of goal. Cf. ā́pavasva … pavítram
IX.25.6, 50.4 “purify yourself in(to?) the filter.”
## 071
On the structure of this hymn see publ. intro. As indicated there, it is
structured as a series of more or less concentric responsions. These include āsádam
1a / 6b; ní riṇite 2a / ā́… riṇanti 6c; várṇam … asya tám 2b / várṇo asya sá 8a; girā́
3c / 6c; násate 3c / 8d - as well as others less narrowly lexical. However, these
responsions don’t seem to define an omphalos.
The hymn continues the preoccupation with the clothing and coverings that
Soma assumes in the course of the ritual preparation, particularly in the first two and
last two vss.

### 01
The first pāda poses difficulties if dákṣiṇā is taken as a nom., with Sāy, Old,
and apparently Re, requiring the hemistich to be chopped up into very small clauses
and across the pāda boundary (acdg. to Old, ā́dákṣiṇā sṛjyate / śuṣmy ā̀sádam, véti /
druháḥ rakṣásaḥ pāti jā́gṛviḥ) and soma not to be the subj. of passive ā́… sṛjyate,
against standard phraseology. The syntactic difficulty disappears if, with Ge, we take
dákṣiṇā as an instr., leaving soma as the subject throughout. This leaves us with the
question of what is meant; since dákṣiṇā is not otherwise found in IX (though
dákṣiṇāvant- occurs once, IX.98.10), we are on our own. I suggest that, since
dákṣiṇās are distributed at the Morning Pressing, this is a reference to that ritual
moment.
Once again there is a question of Soma’s nirṇíj- as in recent hymns (see
comm. ad IX.69.4-5, 70.1). The phrasing here—nábhas páya, upastíre camvòḥ …—
is esp. reminiscent of IX.69.5d upastáraṇaṃ camvòr nabhasmáyam “… an
underlayer made of cloud in the two cups” and makes it quite likely that “cloud (and)
milk” (that is, cloud = milk) are the underlayer here as well. In his tr. Ge makes them
both to be both the headdress (opaśám) and the underlayer and in n. 1cd suggests that
the milk is the headdress and the cloud the underlayer. But, as Old points out, the
close sandhi of nábhas páyaḥ speaks against separating them syntactically, and
opaśá- can simply be construed with kṛṇute without a second object; cf. VIII.14.5
cakrāṇá opaśáṃ diví “making himself a headdress in heaven” (though Old thinks this
passage is not typical). My tr. is closest to Re’s; Old’s notion that the poet heaped up
all the items he had to mention higgledy piggledy (not his term), without sorting
them, seems unlikely.

### 02
In b the question is whether he removes his asuryàṃ várṇam (Ge, WEHale
95) or reveals it by letting it spill down (Old, Re, Scar 686, as well as publ. tr.). The
lexeme ní √rī here (ní riṇīte) is used twice in Dawn hymns (I.124.7, V.80.6) when
she “lets her breast spill over” (ní riṇīte ápsaḥ), in other words, when she reveals her
body. The same usage is surely found here, with even more justification for the
liquid imagery, since soma is indeed a liquid. Presumably with the “covering”
(vavrím), i.e., the twigs and the like, removed (pāda c), the golden color of the juice
shows brightly - a color that could easily be associated with lordship. As Old points
out, Soma is several times identified as an ásura-, incl. in nearby IX.73.1, 74.7. I see
that in the publ. intro. I say that “Soma shed his original form and color” in this vs.; I
now no longer believe that he sheds his color.
In c pitúḥ has two competing analyses, each of which is grammatically
possible. Ge (flg. Sāy, fld. by Hale 95, Scar 341, 686) takes it as the nom. sg. to pitú-
‘food’ (Ge “… kommt er als Speise”). Although grammatically impeccable, this
interpr. is thematically dubious: pitú- is not otherwise found in IX and soma is never
identified as pitú- elsewhere. Preferable is the analysis as gen. sg. of pitár- ‘father’
(Re, Lü 211, publ. tr.). As Lü points out, niṣkṛtá- ‘rendezvous’ generally takes a gen.
of the being(s) being met, so ‘of [=with] the father’ would met the expectations for
such a genitive. With Lü (though without necessarily accepting all of the Lü baggage
that goes with it), I think it likely that the father here is Heaven (the standard Father
Heaven), once again an indication of the cosmic ambitions of the ritual Soma.
The ‘floating’ (upaprút-) substance he makes into his garment is universally,
and convincingly, taken to be the milk mixture.

### 03
This vs. is characterized by an accumulation of finite verbs, esp. in the 2nd
hemistich, which contains five: … modate násate sā́dhate … nenikté … yájate.
The cloud in b can be read in two ways, ritually as the milk mixture (see
nábhas páyaḥ in 1c; also nabhasmáyam in IX.69.5d, both as ‘underlayer’; also Ge’s
n. 3b), but cosmically as a rain cloud. This latter sense connects nicely with the verb
vṛṣāyáte: Soma, as often, is depicted as acting like a bull, but this verb can also be
associated etymologically or folk-etymologically (on the likely etym. connection see
EWA s.v. vṛ́ṣan-) with √vṛṣ ‘rain’ (see Re’s n.).
Pāda c is more intricately structured than at first appears. On the one hand all
three verbs, modate násate sā́dhate, appear to be construed with the final instr. girā́;
cf., e.g., Re’s “Il jubile, caresse, réussit grâce au chant,” as well as the publ. tr.
However, only the central verb násate is regularly construed with an instr.; modate is
found once (X.30.5) with an instr., while the relatively rare medial sā́dhate
‘succeeds’ generally lacks complements. Moreover, when násate takes the instr., it
appears with the preverb sám - as it does in fact in vs. 8: sám INSTR násate sám
INSTR, with the sám insistently repeated. In our pāda I would suggest that there is a
ghostly trace of this sám in the opening sequence sá modate, which could reflect an
older or underlying *sám modate. Though this would have metrical consequences,
they would be slight, since the quantity of pāda-initial syllables is always indifferent.
This posited *sám cannot be read with the immediately following verb modate, since
√mud never appears with sám in the RV (although the rt noun cmpd svādú-sammud-
[so accented] is found twice in AVŚ), but “skips” to the 2nd verb in the sequence.
The repeated sám in 8d can then be interpr. as a type of poetic repair.
The verb nenikté ‘washes’ is of course etym. related to nirṇíj-, the word for
garment that figures so heavily in these hymns (incl. in the immed. preceding vs.,
2d), but their developed meanings are too divergent to allow the connection to be
represented in Engl.
párīman- is a hapax, but, as is generally agreed (see EWA s.v., Re’s n.), it
most likely belongs to √pṝ̥‘fill’. It may have been formed on the model of better
attested várīman- ‘broadness’, which ends the next vs. and occupies the same
metrical slot. Both these words function in much the same way as tánā ‘in its full
measure/extent’, which ends vs. 2.

### 04
The first hemistich contains two untethered genitives, sáhasaḥ and
mádhvaḥ. The first of course evokes the common phrase sūnú- sáhasaḥ “son of
strength,” and ‘son’ is easily supplied (see Old, Ge n. 4a, etc.). mádhvaḥ is more
problematic. In fact Ge identifies it instead as a nom. pl. fem. (presumably to a stem
*mádhū-? though we might expect trisyllabic reading mádhu
vaḥ) referring to the
Apsarases, who in IX.78.3 (which contains the other ex. of the phrase harmyásya
sakṣáṇim) do prepare the soma. Despite this parallel, his suggestion has little to
recommend it: the Apsarases are not otherwise called ‘sweet, honied’, and mádhu- is
so typed as a synonym/descriptor for soma and its gen.-abl. mádhvaḥ so well attested
that it is hard to image how an audience could force the fem. pl. interpr. on this word
with so little to go on. In the publ. tr. I sneaked it in as parallel to sáhasaḥ, but this is
not very satisfactory. Old suggests supplying rásam ‘sap’ or ūrmím ‘wave’, both of
which appear with dependent mádhvaḥ, with rása- more common. I would now tr.
“(sap) of honey” (so also Re, Scar 39).
Ge (n. 4b) plausibly suggests that the “secure house” (harmyá-) is the plant’s
husk.
The second hemistich depicts a somewhat outlandish situation: cows
preparing their milk on the “head” (mūrdhán-) of Soma. IX.93.3 contains a similar
picture: cows preparing Soma’s head with milk, using both mūrdhán- and śrīṇanti as
here. Both clearly refer to the mixing in of the milk; if the mixing involves pouring
the milk into a vessel containing soma, the upper surface of the soma could be
considered his “head.”
With Ge (fld. by Scar 39), contra Pp., I read dat. suhutā́de not suhutā́daḥ. The
dat. would refer to Indra, while the suhutā́daḥ as nom. pl. would modify the cows,
who are not typically eaters of oblations, or as abl.-gen. sg. would have no obvious
referent. See Old’s efforts in that direction.
On várīman- see disc. of párīman- in vs. 3.

### 05
On bhuríj- see comm. ad IX.26.4.
Though chariot-making is a common trope and regular comparandum in the
RV, it is not usual (at least as far as I can recall) to compare the preparation of soma
with the assembling of a chariot. It may appear here because the thus-prepared Soma
is about to follow the track of the cow, at least in my interpr.
The grammatical identity of jígāt in c is disputed. It appears to be, and is
usually taken as, an injunc. to the redupl. pres. jígāti (Gr, Macd [VGr, p. 342], Lub,
Hoff. [Inj. 271 n. 12, but hesitantly]; by implication Ge and Re), but Old (and by
implication Lü 252) suggests that it’s a nom. sg. pres. part. and, on the grounds of
pā́nt- and yā́nt-, sees no difficulty with this analysis. But, of course, for a redupl.
pres. the weak form of the participial suffix is expected even in “strong” forms, and
is in fact found in participles to other redupl. pres. to roots in -ā, √dā and √dhā, with
well-attested nom. sg. m. dádat-, dádhat-. Though I accepted Old’s word (as I so
often do) in the publ. tr., I now think jígāt is better taken as an injunc., though this
need not change the actual tr.: “As he goes, he extends …,” with implicitly
subordinated 1st verb in a two-verb sequence. “He goes, he extends …” is of course
also possible.
The interpr. of the rest of the hemistich is uncertain, due to differing opinions
about the sense and syntactic position of padám. With regard to its sense, padá- is of
course multivalent: ‘footprint, track, place’and ultimately ‘word’. As for its syntax,
does it belong in the main clause beginning in c, modified by apīcyàm, with yád in d
beginning a new cl., or does it belong to the yád cl. of d? Ge follows the latter tack,
with two NPs, góḥ apīcyàm and padám, in two separate clauses: “er stürtz sich auf
das Geheimnis der Kuh, wenn die Andächtigen(?) seine Stätte bereitet haben,” with
padá- = ‘place’. The Geheimnis der Kuh is the milk (n. 5c). There is nothing
impossible here, but the adj. apīcyà- ‘secret’ invites association with padá-, on the
basis of the semantics of the formulaic phrase “hidden track,” which is found in IX in

### 02
gúhā padám and IX.10.9 divás padám … gúhā hitám. Both Re and Lü take
apīcyàm padám together, but Re interprets padám as ‘word’ (“le mot secret de la
vâche” - though ‘word’ for padá- is barely found in the RV if at all) and Lü as
‘place’, which he further specifies, in his usualy style, as the “Milchflut im Himmel.”
On the basis of the formula just cited, I prefer ‘track’, with the verbs of motion in c
indicating that Soma is following this track (which, on the basis of 102.2 I think is
the track through the filter) to his rendezvous with the milk.
matútha- is a hapax whose formation is unclear, but a derivation from √man
‘think’ is the default (see EWA s.v. MAN1
). It merits no mention in AiG (at least acdg.
to the index thereto), but see Re’s plausible suggestion that it is connected to mántu-.

### 06
Act. trans. (ā́) riṇanti, with priests vel sim. as subj. and soma as obj.,
contrasts with medial (ní) riṇīte in 2, with soma as subj. and a self-involved,
reflexive-type meaning.
I supply ‘stall’ as the goal in the simile on the basis of passages containing ápi
√i with pā́thaḥ as goal (I.162.2, II.3.9, III.8.9, VII.47.3). It is not necessary, however.

### 07
A complex vs. esp. in the 2nd hemistich.
In the publ. tr. I take pāda a as a nominal sentence with párā as predicate: “far
away is …” I now think a verb of motion, almost surely from √i, should be supplied:
“Away (goes) the ruddy poet …” The lexeme párā √i is matched by parāyatī(ḥ) in
pāda c, by my analysis (for which see below). The reference is once again to Soma’s
journey from the filter to the rendezvous with the milk.
“Three-backed” (tripṛṣṭha-) is probably to be interpr. like tridhā́tu in nearby
IX.70.8. Pace Lü (708-9) I very much doubt it refers to his threefold heavenly Soma.
Pāda c lacks a syllable, which is not easily recovered. This simply adds
uncertainty to an already problematic pāda. The subject is yátiḥ, taken by all (incl.
me) as a -ti-stem deriv. to √yam ‘hold, control’. It should in origin be a fem. abstract
‘control’ vel sim., but like other exx. of the formation has acquired a personal
agentive sense (on which transference see AiG II.2.637) - hence my ‘marshall’ (for
awk. ‘holder-fast, controller’).
More puzzling is parāyátī (Saṃhitā), beginning with what its underlying form
is. The Pp gives parāyátiḥ, which is accepted by all the standard interpr., but also
possible in this sandhi context would be parāyátī and parāyátīḥ. The standard view is
that the form is composed of parā and the selfsame -ti-abstract -yáti- that
immediately precedes it and that it also is a nom. sg. masc. referring to Soma - hence
Ge’s “abseits lenkend(?),” Re’s “poussant en arrière,” etc. But the lexeme párā √yam
doesn’t exist in the RV - or anywhere else for that matter. What does exist, and fairly
commonly, is párā √i ‘go away, depart’. In fact in the pres. part. it is used once of
the Dawns, the same Dawns who appear in our pāda d: I.113.8 parāyatīnā́m ánu eti
pā́thaḥ “She [=current Dawn] follows the troop of those who go away [=previous
Dawns].” I suggest here that we have an acc. pl. fem. pres. part. It should be accented
*parāyatī́s, but it is not difficult to imagine that its accent could have been retracted
redactionally to match preceding yátiḥ. This pres. part. then modifies pūrvī́r uṣásaḥ
in the following pāda and is part of the simile rebhó ná in that pāda. I take rebhá-
‘hoarse-voiced (singer)’ (on which gloss see comm. ad VI.3.6) here as referring to
Agni as often (incl. I.113.17, in the hymn just cited). Like Agni, Soma ‘radiates’ (ví
rājati). With Lü (708) and Gotō (1st cl., 268 n. 612) I take the verb to √rāj ‘shine’,
not, with Gr, Ge, Re, to √rāj ‘rule’.

### 08
On the responsions between 8a and 2b and between 8d and 3c, see comm.
ad locc.
On the basis of 9b, “the glittering form” seems to be appropriated from the
sun.
The sequence of tense in b is somewhat troubling. The main cl. contains a
pres. sédhati, which seems to express a general truth. The condition on this truth is
expressed by the subordinate yátra cl., but we should then expect either a pres.
“when he lies down” or an aor. or pf. of the immed. past “when he has lain down” -
as I in fact tr. ā́śayat -- but this is not a normal use of the imperfect.
Properly speaking we would expect the acc. pl. to be accented *srídhaḥ, as it
normally is. Formally this should be an oblique sg., but that analysis simply doesn’t
work in context.
## 072
In contrast to the contorted thought and metaphorical flights of the first few
hymns in the trimeter group (IX.68-71), this one is relatively straightforward, with
the major exception of vs. 3.

### 01
The accent on īráyati and its juxtaposition with another finite verb, hinváte,
marks the former as implicitly subordinate.
On the hapax pariprī́- see Scar 337-38.

### 02
The subordinating yád appears fairly late in its clause in b, though what
precedes it all belongs to the predicate (though consisting of two NPs).
In c yádī must clearly be dissolved into yád ī, esp. given the parallelism
between the subordinate clauses of b and cd.

### 03
Although the major problem in this vs. is the impossible hapax vinaṃgṛsáḥ
in c, the puzzlement begins with b. What does it mean that Soma goes “across the
dear bellow of the daughter of the Sun” (sū́ryasya priyáṃ duhituś tiró rávam), and in
particular what is the daughter of the Sun doing here? She is found twice elsewhere
in IX in the full phrase sū́ryasya duhitár-: at IX.1.6, where she purifies the soma, and
IX.113.3, where she brings soma in the form of rain, as well as, most likely, named
only as duhitár- in IX.97.47 (for which see below). Ge (see esp. n. 3b to IX.113.3)
considers her “die Rede- und Gesangeskunst selbst,” on the basis of a dubious
reading of III.53.15 (see comm. ad loc.), and so in our passage he interpr. her bellow
as the song of the priests, which the noisy soma “übertönt” (n. 3b); Re partially
follows him by supplying “au chant des prêtres” to gloss “à la chère rumeur de la
Fille du soleil” in his tr., but supplies a verb of motion with tíraḥ: “(passant) outre,”
though without comment. But Ge’s interpr. requires that tíraḥ ‘across’ when
construed with a noun referring to noise can mean something like “(sing) over,
drown out.” But when independent, tíraḥ always governs an expression of space,
e.g., in IX tíraḥ rájāṃsi “across the realms” (IX.3.7-8), tíraḥ pavítram “across the
filter” (IX.68.2, 109.16). Tellingly, tíraḥ is once used with an acc. of noise, calls, but
these are conceived of spatially, as the calls of other sacrificers which the Aśvins
should travel across to arrive at my sacrifice: VII.68.2 … gantam havíṣo vītáye me /
tiró aryó hávanāni “come to pursue my offering / across the calls of the stranger.”
There is, however, another, idiomatic, use of tírah, with the root √dhā in the
meaning ‘hide (oneself), disappear’. An example is found in the next hymn, IX.73.3
maháḥ samudráṃ váruṇas tiró dadhe “As great Varuṇa, (Soma) has hidden himself
in the sea.” Another is found in conjunction with the word duhitár-, identified above
as another example of daughter (of the Sun) by most (incl. Ge, Re): IX.97.47 tíro
várpāṃsi duhitúr dádhānaḥ “hiding himself in the forms of the daughter (of the
Sun).” In that passage I identify the “forms of the daughter (of the Sun)” as the milk,
so called because it is white and gleaming like the Sun; in other words, this is yet
another version of the mixing of soma with milk. And I now further suggest that that
is what we have here as well - that we should supply a form of √dhā to produce the
same idiom we find more clearly in the next hymn and in IX.97.47. The sticking
point is then rávam: what does it mean to “hide himself in the bellow of the daughter
of the Sun”? I would suggest that it is an example of standard RVic breviloquence as
well as synaesthesis. The “bellow” refers to the characteristic sound of cows, who
were already mentioned (gā́ḥ) in the preceding pāda, so the phrase “the bellow of the
daughter of the Sun” collapses the sound and the visual appearance associated with
the milk=cows. I would now tr. the hemistich “Not stopping, he goes beyond (the
filter) toward the cows, hid(ing himself) in the dear “bellow” of the daughter of the
Sun [=milk].”
There is comparatively little sensible to say about the hapax vinaṃgṛsá-,
though it is possible to indulge in speculation. Perhaps the only truly sensible thing to
note is that it is a partial anagram of the patronymic of the poet (Harimanta)
Āṅgirasa: (vin)aṅgrsḁ -, and such phonological associations often drive the
appearance of problematic forms. Sāy. glosses it stotā ‘praiser’ on the basis of
context and a rather perfunctory stab at etymology. Ge renders it ‘arm’ on the basis
of Naigh. 2.4 and, again, context: the mention of the fingers in the following pāda
would support that interpr. But the word as we have it does not look analyzable acdg.
to Indo-Aryan morphological structure: save for the initial vi there is no sign of
internal structure, and segmenting the vi does not produce anything that looks
promising on the surface. As Ge points out (pace Old), the context is erotic. The
initial ánu certainly belongs with jóṣam in the standard idiom ánu jóṣam “according
to (one’s) pleasure,” with unaccented asmai intervening in Wackernagel’s position.
But with Ge (n. 3c) I would now also read it with abharat in the erotic idiom ánu
√bhṛ ‘penetrate sexually, stick (one’s penis) in’, as discussed in my 1980 “A Vedic
Sexual Pun: ástobhayat, anubhartrī́, and RV I.88.6” (Acta Orientalia 42) - though in
that article (p. 59 n. 4) I more or less discounted this passage. Acdg. to this reading,
asmai would be Soma and the recipient of the sexual act, while the vinaṃgṛsá- is the
sexual actor. As noted in the publ. intro., erotic contexts often contain slang and
twisted expressions that we cannot access.
At this point we leave the realm of even shaky evidence and enter that of pure
speculation. Although the word we have cited is vinaṃgṛsáḥ, in its sandhi context it
might also begin *dvi-: abharad vinaṃgṛsáḥ could be a degemination of abharad
*dvinaṃgṛsáḥ, of the type I have recently discussed in several publications (esp.
“False Segmentations and Resegmentations in the Rigveda: Gemination and
Degemination,” forthcoming). There are no metrical implications. If we segment off
dvi- ‘two, bi-’, naṃg- (/ naṅg-) could be analyzed as a metathetic taboo deformation
of nagná- ‘naked’, of a type that the ‘naked’ word has often received across IndoEuropea. A cmpd with the meaning ‘having two naked …’ could refer to the arms of
the presser (per Naigh. cited above, which cites vinaṃgṛsau as a dual and glosses
bāhū) or to the pressing stones, and the sexual act would be the violent pressing
itself. (If there is anything to this, the phrase nṛ́bāhubhyām coditáḥ “driven by the
two arms of men” in 5a might be a reparative paraphrase.) Even by this flight of
fancy I cannot figure out what to do with -ṛsa-, whose lack of ruki is another
peculiar, non-Indo-Aryan-looking feature. And just to throw in another off-the-wall
suggestion, in my 1980 article I suggested that the anubhartrī́- of I.88.6 was a veiled
reference to the musical instrument, the vīnā-, and the beginning of our word vinaṃ(-
grsḁ )- could be a play on that. None of this is worth much, which is why I leave the
word untransl.
Having pronounced the word uninterpretable, Re simply ignores it in his tr.,
though curiously provides a fem. subject, presumably the daughter of the Sun: “elle
lui offrait ses charmes,” a tr. of extreme erotic delicacy.
### 04-05
These two vss., in the center of the hymn, are constructed in parallel. To
begin with, the post-caesura portion of 4d and 5b are identical: pavate sóma indra te.
Both vss. also begin with a sequence of AGENT/INSTR. + past part. expressions: 4a has
the cmpds nṛ́-dhūto ádri-sutaḥ, while 5a has the analytic expressions nṛ́bāhubhyāṃ
coditó dhā́rayā sutáḥ, with the 1st member of the 1st phrase (nṛ́-) and the 2nd ppl.
(sutá-) repeated. The last of the phrases contains a non-agentive instr. dhā́rayā ‘in a
stream’ that nonetheless fits the morphological template. The two vss. diverge
otherwise, though the beginnings of 4c and 5c, púraṃ(dhivān) and ā́prāḥ respectively
have an etymological connection that would no doubt be clear to the audience. As
noted in the publ. intro., no particular message seems to be conveyed by this
omphalos-like structure, unless it is to put the abruptly addressed Indra in the center
of the action. It is also the case that this is the first instance of √pū ‘purify’ in the
hymn, and the quintessential IXth Maṇḍala med. verb pávate ‘purifies himself’
appears in these two matching phrases and in vss. 7-9 (7d pavate, 8a pavasva, 9d
pavamāna).

### 04
Although both Ge and Re tr. -dhūta- as ‘shaken’, I prefer the more technical
soma-ritual sense ‘rinse’. On √dhāv (∾ √dhavi ∾ √dhū) ‘rinse’ as a semantic
specialization of the same root meaning ‘shake’, see EWA s.v. DHAVI
, Gotō [1st Cl.
186-89]). This root complex is distinct from √dhāv ‘run’. See further ad vs. 8 below.
Both Ge and Re take pradívaḥ with what precedes; this is entirely possible
and impossible to determine. Not much rests on it.

There is a sharp split of opinion on the grammatical identity of
punarbhúvaḥ. Gr, Scar (361), and the publ. tr. - as well as, probably, Ge (his “immer
aufs neue” is not totally clear) - take it as a nom. pl. fem. with the cows and the
thoughts; Re and Lü (224-25), the latter cited verbatim by Ober (II.149), as gen. sg.
masc. dependent on sádane and referring to Soma. Not surprisingly Lü is esp.
adamant and sees the whole vs. as a depiction of Soma’s “Aufstieg in den Himmel,”
where he is reborn. I am open to either grammatical analysis. The word order might
favor the dependence on immed. preceding sádane and thus the gen. sg. interpr. On
the other hand, the two other attestations of punarbhū́- are fem. (though neither is
pl.), and in conjunction with saṃyátaḥ ‘in uninterrupted array’, it could describe the
constantly new, but always similar, sequence of milk-mixtures and hymns in the
soma ritual. However, it is possible to adopt the gen. sg. interpr. without subscribing
to the journey to heaven: Soma can be considered reborn or regenerated because the
pressing has rendered a new substance from the plant. I would therefore entertain an
alt. tr. “The cows and thoughts … go together to him in the womb of truth, in the seat
of the regenerated (soma),” though I favor the fem. pl.

### 07
The first pāda gives a classic description of Soma as a pillar reaching from
earth (specifically the ritual ground) to heaven, as the support of the latter.
In d cā́ru must be adverbial.

### 08
This is the first time in the hymn that Soma appears in the 2nd ps.; the
previous 2nd ps. address was to Indra (4d, 5d). It is also the first appearance of the
1st ps. ‘we’ of the human worshippers.
The nasal pres. dhūnoti is generally considered to express only the ‘shake’
meaning of the root complex √dhāv (∾ √dhavi ∾ √dhū), on which see comm. ad vs.
4 above, while dhā́vati is considered the only pres. to ‘rinse’. Therefore the pres.
part. ādhūnvaté should mean ‘shaker’ here. Gotō (187) seems to see in this passage a
sort of play on words with -dhūta- in 4a, tr. “dem Preisenden und dem ‘Schüttelnden’
hilfreich seiend,” with ‘shaker’ in quotes. But I think the nasal pres. was available in
a context like this to express the specialized ‘rinse’ sense; I find it difficult to believe
that -dhūta- in 4a and ādhūnvaté here are meant to belong to different roots, esp.
since they both refer to humans’ ritual activity in preparing soma. Note that this is
the only form of dhūnoti that appears with ā́, which is the standard preverb with
dhā́vati ‘rinses’. The preverb here may be participating in a type of repair: the cmpd.
in 4a nṛ́-dūta- does not have the preverb, quite possibly because *nrā̀dhūta- by losing
the syllabic quality of its 1st member would be hard to parse and lose the symmetry
with nṛ́bāhubhyām in 5a. The nasal pres. may have been used here so the root
syllables of the two forms could be matched (dhū) and also to avoid confusion with
dhā́vati ‘runs, streams’, which is quite common in IX.
## 073
On the key to this hymn, see publ. intro. Old argues that it is a hymn for rain,
but I don’t see that (nor does Ge), despite the presence of Varuṇa. Both Ge and Old
properly remark on the repeated phrase sám asvaran.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., I consider it significant that the repeated phrase
sám asvaran never has an overt subject, allowing for double ref.: the soma streams
roaring as they cross the filter and the priest-poets accompanying this journey with
hymns. I therefore would reject the various subjects supplied here by various tr.
I interpr. drapsásya dhámataḥ as a species of gen. absol., though it could be
dependent on one of the implicit subjects of the verb, namely the soma streams.
I am not entirely sure what b is telling us. In the immediately preceding hymn
(IX.72.6) as well as elsewhere in IX, the “womb of truth” (ṛtásya yóni-) is the place
where the soma and the milk mix; the verb sám aranta “have joined together” invites
us to interpr. this as expressing that mixture here as well. If so, then what are the
“ties of lineage” (nā́bhayaḥ)? I would tentatively suggest that it refers to the ultimate
kinship of cow and bull (that is, of milk and soma). This may be supported by a
passage in the next hymn, IX.74.4, where soma, after this mixture, is referred to as
“the navel of truth” (ṛtásya nā́bhiḥ). It is also possible that it’s a reference to the
unexpressed double subject that “sounded in unison” in the preceding pāda - that is,
the roaring soma streams and the singing poets. Their “ties of lineage” would be
based on their joint vocalization, and they meet and join together on the part of the
ritual ground where the soma is readied for offering to the gods. Others of course
have different opinions: for Ge it’s gods and men, for Lü (234-35, fld. by Re) the
heavenly and earthly soma.
In c, acdg. to Ge and Re, the ásura created (cakre) for himself three heads,
either (Ge; see also WEHale 79) so he could seize the soma (probably; see Ge’s n. 1
cd) or (Re) so he could be more easily seized. By contrast, I interpr. cakra ārábhe as
a periphrastic caus.: “made/caused his three heads to be seized,” with the ásura- =
Soma, as also in the next hymn, IX.74.7; note also his asuryàṃ várṇam in nearby
IX.71.2. It would help, of course, to know what the “three heads” are, but I suggest
that since mūrdhán- is often a ‘peak’, it may be the same as Soma’s three backs (see
the bahuvr. tripṛṣṭḥá- twice nearby in IX.71.7 and 75.3). As for these expressions of
triplication, see the speculations ad IX.70.8. Whatever the identity of the heads, I
think the point is that, after the various stages of preparation, Soma is making
himself available for ritual use, allowing himself to be “seized” and distributed into
the cups. This interpr. is supported by 3d, which contains the acc. inf. ārábham,
matching ārábhe here.
In d note satyásya opening the pāda, which contrasts with ṛtásya in the same
position in b. Although I am given pause by IX.89.2 r̥tásya nā́vam (like our satyásya
nā́vaḥ), I think the two genitives must be interpr. differently. I suggest that it is Soma
who is satyá- here: ‘trusty’ as in the publ. tr., or even ‘really present’, referring to the
prepared soma on the ritual ground. Sāy’s notion that the boats are the soma cups is
quite plausible, though Ge (n. 1d) prefers the hymns.
### 02-04
Ge considers these vss. “doppelsinnig,” with ref. both to the priest-poets
and the soma juices. This seems quite reasomable, and his individual notes are worth
the attention.
### 02-03
The three even-numbered pādas 2d, 3b, 3d all end with an augmented 3rd
pl. redupl. aorist: apīparan, avīvipan, and avīvṛdhan respectively.

### 02
As Ge (n. 2a) points out aheṣata can be either transitive (‘have propelled
[soma]’) or intransitive/passive (‘have surged / been propelled’); both usages are
paralleled in IX - see the passages cited by Ge. Moreover, as he also points out (and
see again his cited passages), mahiṣá- ‘buffalo’ can refer either to soma or to the
priests. Thus, to spell out the two senses: “the buffalos [=soma streams] have been
propelled / the buffalos [=priests] have propelled (the soma).” The choice of both a
noun subject and a verb form that allow double interpr. is unlikely to be accidental,
esp. in this hymn of floating reference.
In b the subj. vená- can elsewhere refer either to soma (though usually in the
sg.) or to priest-poets; see comm. ad VIII.100.5. The unexpressed element in the pāda
is the obj. of avīvipan ‘have set atremble’. Both speech and soma (streams) are
appropriate objects. If soma (streams) are the referent of the subject venā́ḥ, then
speech is likely the object. Cf. IX.96.7 prā́vīvipad vācá ūrmíṃ ná síndhur, gíraḥ
sómaḥ “Like a river its wave, self-purifying Soma has sent the wave of speech, the
hymns, pulsing forth.” If the priests are the subject, then soma is most likely the obj.
Although there are no transitive forms of √vip that take soma as obj., note that in
nearby IX.71.3 soma is the subj. of the intrans. vépate ‘he trembles’.
In the 2nd hemistich again the unexpressed subj. can be priest-poets or soma
streams. Both can “give birth to chant” - the priest-poets directly, soma by inspiring
ritual speech -- and both can strengthen Indra’s body.
As Ge (n. 2c) appositely points out, arká- can refer to the roar of the rushing
soma, but it can of course also refer to the hymns of the poets. In c pāda-final íd
seems relatively functionless: “just the chant / the chant alone” does not seem to add
to the sense - unless it somehow underscores the double reading just suggested.
Perhaps it’s simply there to convert a putative Triṣṭubh cadence to a Jagatī.

### 03
Again, the subject of the verb in pāda a is unexpressed. On the basis of
pavítravant- ‘provided with the filter’, one might expect that the referent is the ritual
officiants, but note that the other occurrence of this -vant- stem in IX, at IX.101.4,
modifies sómāḥ. Again, I think both readings are meant.
On tiró dadhe see comm. ad IX.72.3. Though Ge and Old take it as transitive
(Ge “… hat den Ozean verborgen (?)”), Re and Lü (268) interpr. it as reflexive ‘hid
himself in x’, correctly in my view; Old explicitly rejects the reflexive interpr., but
the middle voice makes this the more likely one. Old is motivated by his
unconvincing interpr. of the hymn as a rain charm. In the ritual context the “hiding”
refers to the post-pressing mixing of soma with water: the soma disappears into it.
In d śekuḥ … ā́rábham “they have been able to seize” responds to 1c cakra
ārábhe “caused to be seized.” Their connection would have been clearer in the publ.
tr. if they were tr. with identical renderings of ā́√rabh, rather than “to take hold of”
here. I would therefore emend the tr. to “have been able to seize.” The questions then
are what is the referent of dharúṇeṣu and how does it relate to ārábham? In the
flanking hymns, IX.72.7 and 74.2 sg. dharúṇa- is the soma itself. I am inclined to
take the pl. here as referring to the soma configured in parts - in particular to the
‘heads’ of 1c, which soma caused to be seized (by my interpr.). The shared verb ā́
√rabh certainly encourages this identification. The point would be that only the
insightful know how to separate soma from the cleansing waters. This interpr.
requires that ā́√rabh can take a loc. of what is grasped, in addition to the more
common acc. (as in 1c). For a passage with such a loc. see I.168.3 and comm.
thereto. By contrast Ge takes the dharúṇa- not as parts of soma but as instruments in
which to seize him, namely the soma cups (n. 3d; apparently fld. by Lü [268]). The
use of the stem dharúṇa- in the sg. to refer to soma makes his interpr. difficult to
sustain.
### 04-05
See comm. on IX.41.1-2 on the similarity of phraseology in these two pairs
of vss. These vss. usher in the use of ritual speech against a variety of enemies.

### 04
The first hemistich seems clearly (at least to me) to contrast the ritual soma
streams on earth (a) with those in heaven (b), though curiously it does not seem to
have caught Lü’s attention. That pl. asaścátaḥ elsewhere (IX.57.1, 62.28) explicitly
modifies dhā́rāḥ ‘streams’ makes that identification in b quite likely. See also

### 06
in the next hymn, with similar phraseology, where ‘streams’ is also the likely
referent of asaścatáḥ, and at least one reading involves a contrast between earthly
and heavenly soma.
As pointed out also be Ge and Re, the mention of spies in c extends the
Varuṇa identification from the preceding vs.
The binding snares in d are surely the curls of the sheep’s wool of the filter
that can obstruct the progress of the liquid.
### 05-06
These two vss., almost in the center of the hymn, have a similar structure.
Their first pādas are nearly identical: ABL ABL ádhy ā́yé samásvaran “Those who
sounded in unison from X X.” The second pādas simply further describe the
unspecified subject of the first pādas, while their second hemistichs present what
happens to evil beings as a result of the sounding in unison of the first. See also Old
on the symmetry of the vss. and how this affects their interpr.

### 05
With Sāy. and Re but contra Ge, I consider the father and mother of pāda a
to be Heaven and Earth, matching that same pair in d. The reference is to the earthly
and heavenly soma of 4a and b, which “sound in unison,” though also including the
priest-poets, as disc. in the publ. intro. They marshall their joint power, embodied in
the māyā́associated with Varuṇa, against those “without commandments” (avratā́n);
vratá- are of course esp. associated with Varuṇa, and by virtue of their presence in
both heaven and earth can banish enemies from both places.
Note the return of √dham ‘blow’ from 1a. In its earlier occurrence this root
simply expressed the action of the drop (drapsásya dhámataḥ), but here the verb has
been weaponized, as it were, against enemies.

### 06
Ge interpr. mā́na- as “Tonweise” and then imposes a musical-mode interpr.
on the whole 1st hemistich, an interpr. that infects Re as well. With Old I find this
“zweifelhaft.” In the publ. tr. it is rendered ‘edifice’; for mā́na- as some sort of
building see VII.88.5, where JPB tr. ‘mansion’. Because of the structural parallelism
with 5a (see comm. above), I would prefer that this abl. phrase refer to a place. The
“ancient edifice” can be both soma’s seat in heaven and the place, or seat, on the
ritual ground where soma mixes with the milk and the priest-poets sing their hymns.
For a similar phrase see I.107.5 pratnáṃ sadhástham ā́sadat “he [=Soma] has taken
his ancient seat.”
As for ślóka-yantra-, in my view it simply expresses the fact that sound -
both the sound of the soma streams and the sound of the hymns of the priest-poets -
guides and accompanies the soma along the journey of its preparation.
I am less certain about what to do with rabhasásya mántavaḥ, in part because
the exact nuance of the fairly rare word mántu- is not clear. (Old’s disc. here seems
off the point.) Although in cmpds (sumántu-, etc.) it seems to have the quasiinfinitival sense ‘… to think about / contemplate’ (see AiG II.2.663), as a freestanding noun it generally is glossed as ‘counsel, counselor’ corresponding to Old
Avestan maṇtu- (e.g., Gr, AiG II.2.663). This works reasonably well for mántavaḥ in
X.63.8 (All Gods), but the other two passages containing mántu- (I.152.1, X.32.4)
are too obscure to shed any light - though ‘counsel, counselor’ is not entirely
excluded. The poss. deriv. mantumant (3x, always voc., never accented) is
compatible with a sense ‘possessing (wise) counsel’ in all three passages (esp.
VI.56.4), though the case is not overwhelming, given the semantic independence of
vocatives. Since rabhasá- is elsewhere used of the pressed soma drinks (I.82.6 sutā́so
rabhasā́ḥ), I take sg. rabhasásya as referring to soma here as well, but this leads to a
possible contradition: if the soma streams are one of the subjects of ā́… samásvaran,
then how can they be counselors of themself, -ves? The phrase would work better if
it applied only to the priest-poets who form the other part of the subject of the verb.
Since ślókayantra- also works better if it applies only to one part of the subject,
namely the soma streams, I now think that pāda b involves a non-overtly conjoined
NP: “those with a signalling call for their reins [=soma streams] (and) the counselors
[=priest=poets] of the wild one [=Soma].” I would therefore emend the tr. to what
was just suggested. This is the closest we have come to specifying who the subj. of
the repeated verb is, though both NPs are so opaque that nothing much is given
away.

### 07
The first hemistich now begins to solve the riddle of the double reference,
by situating the poets in (or at) the filter, purifying their speech like the soma streams
that cross the filter.
I do not know why the Maruts appear here, esp. as spies - quite distinct from
Varuṇa’s spies in 4c, as Ge (n. 7d) also asserts. His reason for bringing in the Maruts
is dependent on his musical mode interpr. of vs. 6 and therefore not helpful.
I would change the tr. of svàñcaḥ in d to “of lovely outlook” (from “well
directed”). See comm. ad VI.15.10.

### 08
The subject here is of course Soma, though tricked out with Varuṇian
vocabulary (see, e.g., Lü 402-3).
It is not clear what the three filters (trī́… pavítrā) are; the phrase recurs in

### 55  
with equal lack of clarity - though there all three don’t have to be fitted into
the heart. The three filters here recall the three heads of 1c, though I do not think the
referents are the same.

### 09
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs., esp. its first hemistich, provides the
solution to the implicit riddle of the hymn, by associating “the thread of truth”
(ṛtásya tántuḥ) both with the filter and therefore the soma streams on their ritual
journey and with the tongue tip and therefore the priest-poets’ hymns. See disc.
there. Note also that ṛtásya tántuḥ forms a slight ring with ṛtásya yónā in 1b.
The vs. is very similar to IX.83.1, a mystical hymn also treating the filter and
attributed to the same poet.
pavítram te vítatam brahmaṇas pate, prabhúr gā́trāṇi páry eṣi viśvátaḥ
átaptatanūr ná tá āmó aśnute, śr̥tā́so íd váhantas tát sám āśata
The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred formulation. Advancing,
you circle around its limbs on all sides.
A raw one, with unheated body, does not attain it [=filter]; only the cooked
ones, driving along, have attained it entirely.
Note esp. pavítram … vítatam matching our vítataḥ pavítra ā́, prabhúḥ matching our
áprabhuḥ, and the emphasis on attainment, ná … aśnute, … sám āśata, matching our
anínakṣanta āśata. For further disc. see also the publ. intro. to IX.83.
In d padāti must be a double marked subjunctive to the root aor, which is
otherwise only middle. The model for its creation is not clear to me.
## 074
Curiously, a much translated hymn, found in Doniger 121-24, Maurer 85-88,
despite its difficulties.

### 01
Contra the standard tr. (Ge, Re, Lü [265], Doniger, Maurer), I take b with c,
not with a, since the logical relation between a and b is weak and there are two
ostensibly different subjects, while c follows from b. In b Soma, configured as a
racehorse, seeks to win the sun, which in its brightness is the cosmic equivalent of
the milk that is the goal of the ritual soma’s journey (see also IX.76.2). In c he “keeps
company with” (sacate) the semen of heaven (divó rétasā). On the cosmic plane this
is the rain; in the ritual it is the water with which the soma is mixed after filtering and
before the mixing with milk - though here the two acts of mixture, with water and
with milk, may be conflated, with rain/mixing water referred to as payovṛ́dh- ‘milkstrong’. For a slightly clearer passage see IX.84.5. The fact that the verbs of b and c,
síṣāsati and sacate, recur in the climactic vs. 7 (see below) supports my view of the
structure of this vs.
In d most tr. take sumatī́as ours (e.g., Doniger “with kind thoughts we pray
…”), whereas I assign it to Soma. In general sumatí- can belong either to mortals or
to gods, and very little is at stake here - though I still favor my interpr.

### 02
The soma plant as pillar connecting heaven and earth and filling the
midspace (ab) gives way to the plant as sacrificer (c)—an abrupt conceptual
transition somewhat jarring to modern sensibilities.
In b Re supplies both the world and the filter as complement to paryéti. This
seems reasonable, though the verb would have slightly different senses: “encompass
(the world)” / “circle around (the filter).” I would now favor making this explicit in
the tr.
The standard tr. take ā́vṛ́tā as instr., with a variety of interpr.: Ge “nach dem
Herkommen” (sim. Scar 509), Re “par le processus-rituel” (sim. Maurer), Doniger
“by tradition.” I take it rather as a fem. du. modifying ródasī (so Gr Nachtr.).
Pāda d contains the only ex. of sám √dhṛ in the RV (and one of the few in
Vedic). I would now be inclined to give it a more literal tr.: “the poet holds together
…” The poet in this case is of course Soma.

### 03
Pāda b is problematic, and it shares some of its difficulties with IX.69.3,
which ends identically: áditer ṛtáṃ yaté. See comm. ad loc. In both cases the
standard tr. (incl. my publ. tr.) take áditeḥ with what precedes, despite its being in the
repeated phrase. The other problem is the referent of the dat. part. in the phrase ṛtáṃ
yaté. Is it Soma, as Ge (and the publ. tr., also probably Maurer) take it, or the mortal
worshiper (Re, flg. Lü; Doniger)? Determining this depends in part on deciding what
“the wide pasture-land of Aditi” means. It is possible that it refers to the expanse on
the ritual ground between the filter and the place where the soma meets the milk, in
which case ṛtáṃ yaté could refer to the soma traversing this expanse, as in the publ.
tr. However, in the other two passages containing gávyūti- in IX (IX.78.5, 85.8),
“wide pastureland” is the reward for mortals. See esp. IX.78.5 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim
ábhayaṃ ca nas kṛdhi “make wide pasturage and fearlessness for us.” In the other
passage, IX.85.8, the phrase occurs with śárma sapráthaḥ “extensive
shelter/protection,” which is found exactly in our vs. 1d. I therefore now inclined to
think that this pāda concerns the mortal worshiper - but this causes problems with
the 2nd hemistich, which consists only of two rel. clauses, whose referent must be
Soma. If ṛtáṃ yaté does not refer to Soma, there is no antecedent in the first
hemistich (or in the following vs.) for the double yáḥ of c and d. Re gets out of this
by supplying “(C’est le soma),” which does the trick but contravenes the apparent
structure of the vs.; Doniger simply tr. part of d as a main cl. I find myself torn and
take refuge, as often, in double reading - suggesting that at least one referent of ṛtáṃ
yaté is Soma, and therefore there is at least a partial antecedent for the yáḥ-s of cd.
While fiddling with pāda b, I also wondered if we should take the pattern of
repetition seriously and construe áditeḥ with what follows, rather than what
precedes. Although urvī́- gávyūti- is found several times elsewhere - in addition to
here and the two passages in IX just cited, also V.66.3, VII.77.4 - it is nowhere else
associated with Aditi. And Aditi, as mother of Varuṇa among others, is associated
with ṛtá-, so “for him who goes to the truth of Aditi” would not be a jarring
expression, though its exact sense is hard to pin down. I therefore suggest an alt. tr.
“wide is the pasture-land for him who goes to the truth of Aditi.” See also IX.69.3.
As multiple comm. have remarked, Soma is both associated cosmically with
rain and in the ritual preparation drips like rain from the press and off the filter.
All the standard tr. render itáūtíḥ with the older, now obsolete tr. ‘helping
from here’ vel sim., rather than ‘eternal, ageless’, on which see comm. ad VIII.99.7
and EWA s.v. However, in this passage it certainly plays off itáḥ ‘from here’ in the
previous pāda in the same metrical position; note the pattern c itá u(sr)í(yo) / d
itáū(t)i(r), with the vowels ū̆ … i replicating the 2nd half of the word. This pattern is also
anticipated by (gávy)ūtir in b (though in a different metrical slot).

### 04
This vs. sets out the identification between soma and rain most clearly
(which is, nonetheless, not all that clear). In pāda a the “embodied cloud” (ātmanván
nábhaḥ) is, on the one hand, a cloud, which produces rain (called ghee and milk); on
the other, it must refer to something from which soma (called ghee and milk) is
produced - most likely the soma plant, with Ge (n. 4). The milk (páyaḥ) here seems
not to refer to the actual milk mixture.
The word ātmanvánt-, which I render ‘embodied’ (others ‘living, breathing’),
is found only three times in the RV, once in another Kakṣīvant hymn (I.116.3 to the
Aśvins) and once in another Aśvin hymn, I.182.5. In both those passages it refers to a
boat, and I suggest ad I.182.5 that this describes a boat with a cockpit, a substantial
body. Here it would indicate that the cloud had enough substance (“body,” as in the
Engl. metaphor) to yield significant amounts of liquid, and it may also sketch the
rounded contours of a cloud.
In b, with most, I take soma to be the referent of ṛtásya nā́bhiḥ. See comm. ad
IX.73.1.
The subj. of cd are in the first instance the priests, but in d esp. there is a
double reading, with the Maruts pissing rain, as the priests “piss” down streams of
soma by their ritual activity.
On péru- see EWA s.v.; ‘swelling’ is based on Lü -- see reff. in EWA.

### 05
A variety of identifications have been suggested for the various elements in
this vs. See the various tr.
In pāda a sácamāna ūrmíṇā “keeping company with the wave” echoes 1c divó
rétasā sacate “keeps company with the semen of heaven,” though here the presence
of the subj. aṃśúḥ ‘plant’ seems to anchor the expression to the ritual, without
cosmic dimensions. In the ritual realm it probably refers to a slightly different part of
the ritual from the one depicted in 1c, despite the presence of water in both cases.
There it most likely referred to the mixing of the soma juice with water, after the
pressing. Here because of aṃśúḥ I think it refers to the initial soaking of the plant
before pressing. This is supported by b, where it, namely the soaking water, swells
the skin (pinvati tvácam) - the skin being, in my view, the outer surface of the plant.
The adj. devāvī́- modifying ‘skin’ usually modifies soma itself (see Scar 498),
referring to the juice’s journey after pressing to the place where it will be offered to
the gods. Here the various moments in the ritual are collapsed: it is not the skin, but
the juice pressed from the skin, that seeks the gods.
However, in b the skin may also be the waterskin=cloud from which rain is
produced (see, e.g., V.83.7) and in that case the plant of a could also be a cloud,
roaring with thunder.
The 2nd hemistich is bookended by verb forms of √dhā: #dádhāti
…dhā́mahe#. This etymological connection cannot easily be captured in English
because each verb has an idiomatic sense: the first for the setting of an embryo, i.e.,
impregnation; the 2nd in the middle in the sense of ‘acquire’. Both ritual and cosmic
readings are available here.
It is not clear to me whether Aditi here has any meaningful connection with
the Aditi in 3b or is simply a reference to the ritual ground.

### 06
The first pāda, sahásradhāré ‘va tā́ḥ asaścatáḥ is an abbreviated version of
IX.73.4ab sahásradhāré ‘va té sám asvaran, … aśaścatáḥ. As in that vs. the earthly
soma streams in the filter (a) are contrasted with (b) those in heaven (“the third
realm” tṛtī́ye … rájasi, comparable to 73.4b divó nā́ke), though the latter are also
probably rain.
The interpr. of the 2nd hemistich is complicated by the unclear hapax nā́bhaḥ
in c. Numerous suggestions have been made about its meaning: clouds (von
Schröder, etc.; see Schindler), openings (Old, fld. by Maurer), teats (Ge), spurts (Re),
springs (Lü 285, Doniger); for disc. see Schindler, Rt Nouns, s.v. nábh- and EWA
s.v. NABH. Before focusing on the sense, it’s useful to observe that nā̆bh is a favorite
phonological configuration for this poet: see nearly matching 4a nábho, in the same
metrical position as our nā́bho, as well as 4b nā́bhir likewise in that position. We can
also, at least in my view, eliminate the supposed root noun nábh- in I.174.8 from
consideration and potential connection, since I take nábhaḥ there as a verb form. See
comm. ad loc. With many (e.g., tentatively EWA), I connect nā́bhaḥ here with the
root √nabh ‘burst’, and suggest that it has the adjectival sense ‘bursting’; the
underlying noun subject is surely ‘streams’ again, referring to both the heavenly
soma and the rain. The union of those two with the earthly soma is described in d.
Why “four” is not entirely clear. Our passage might be illuminated by IX.89.5
cátasra īṃ ghrtad ̥ úhaḥ sacante “four, yielding ghee as their milk, accompany him” if
there is any illumination to be gotten from that passage. Cf. also I.62.6, VIII.100.10,
both with fem. ‘four’ and varieties of liquid nourishment. The most likely
explanation for the “four” is suggested by Ge’s tr of nā́bhaḥ as “Zitzen(?)” (see also
his n. 6c). Although I do not think that nā́bh- means ‘teat’ directly, I think the
number four suggests that the streams here are likened to them: cows generally have
four teats.
Another similarity between this passage and IX.89.5 leads me to alter the
publ. tr. here. The four in our passage are níhitāḥ (ní √dhā), which, with Re, I tr.
“hidden.” But this ppl. is paralleled in IX.89.5 by the fuller phrase samāné antár
dharúṇe níṣattāḥ “set down within the same support,” with an almost synonymous
ppl. cmpd ní-ṣatta-: ní √sad), also characterizing the four. There I take níṣatta- in its
literal sense and suggest that the “same support” might be the udder itself. I now
wonder if níhitāḥ should also be taken literally here and mean “the four, deposited
(in the udder), bursting …”
### 07-08
These two vss. seem to resolve the situation set up in vs. 1, esp. 1bc: the
racehorse that was striving to win the sun (=milk) there (1b) has achieved this goal
and “keeps company” with ritual speech and labor, as it did in 1c (and 5a) with more
physical features of the ritual process. The repetition of the desid. síṣāsati from 1b in
7a and the resolution of the desid. into an achieved state via a pf. part. sasavā́n (8b)
signal the relationship between vss. 1 and 7-8 - as does the repetition of sacate from
1c (/sácamānaḥ 5a) in 7c.

### 07
As just noted, yát síṣāsati is identical to yád … síṣāsati in 1b, and śvetáṃ
rūpám “white form” seems the equivalent of svár ‘sun’, the obj. of síṣāsati in the
earlier vs. - both referring to the milk mixture. It might be possible to take yád here
as neut. rel. with rūpám and tr. “he makes for himself the/a white form that he is
striving to win,” although I’m not sure that’s an improvement. In any case, I think the
point is that Soma has attained the milk he was striving for.
Pāda b seems something of a non sequitur, and it may be that bhū́man-, which
has a range of senses, should be tr. differently (Ge tr. Natur) - although in the
preceding hymn, IX.73.5, in the phrase bhū́mano divás pári it clearly means ‘earth’.
Perhaps it contrasts with diváḥ in d and should be tr. “Soma … knows the earth” -
the point being that the earthly Soma is fulfilling his ritual tasks, which will enable
him to make contact with the heavenly soma and bring it as rain from heaven in d.
Note that this is the first time that the word sóma- appears in the hymn, and the only
occurrence outside of the extra-hymnic vs. 9.
As just noted, sacate reprises the same verb in 1c and its equivalent participle
in 5a sácamānaḥ. In both those cases soma was “keeping company” with a physical
element of the ritual, namely water. Here the instr. express the human activity in the
sacrifice: dhī́- ‘insight’, perhaps better here ‘insightful/visionary thought’ - that is
the hymn - and śámī- ‘ritual labor’. This acknowledgement of the human
contribution to the soma sacrifice is also found in the next vs.; otherwise it is absent
from the hymn, except passingly and enigmatically noted in 4cd. Through most of
the hymn Soma is presented as the only actor and agent of the ritual.
The problem in this pāda is pravát, which has received various analyses. See
esp. the possibilities laid out by Old, as well as the nn. of Ge and Re. Of the choices,
I prefer the nom. sg. Since the stem pravát- is fem. this requires reading sā́/ īm
against Pp sáḥ / īm, but this actually improves the reading, since with the masc. prn.
we would expect sá īm in the Saṃhitā text (cf., e.g, IX.88.2). I take sém abhí pravát
as a self-contained, almost parenthetical clause: it explains what precedes in the same
pāda, namely that the hymns and physical ritual labor of the sacrificers are the way to
approach Soma.
And this in turn will lead to his producing rain in d, by splitting open the cask
of heaven. This “splitting” (áva darṣat) is perhaps thematically related to the
“bursting” down from heaven (nā́bhaḥ … avó diváḥ) in 6c, if that’s what nā́bhmeans. It is difficult to render the áva in the lexeme áva darṣat, but áva is a
Lieblingswort of this poet: see 1a, 4d, 6a, as well as aváḥ in 6c - all presumably in
service of the “rain down from heaven” theme.

### 08
This is the triumphant realization of the quest set in motion in vs. 1. The
race horse (vājī́) of 1b reappears here having won (sasavā́n) at the finish line
(kā́rṣman) what it was seeking to win (síṣāsati) there - namely the milk, here given a
very full expression: śvetáṃ [recurring from 7a] kaláśaṃ góbhir aktám “the gleaming
white tub anointed with cows.”
This first hemistich plus pāda c is the actual end of the hymn, and so this
successful resolution of vs. 1 provides a thematic ring. Pāda c reintroduces the
human ritual personnel, who propel Soma in his guise as racehorse—thus allowing
the priest-poets to take some credit for the successful conclusion of the sacrifice,
after having been shut out for most of the hymn. Pāda d is a snatch of a dānastuti, and
vs. 9 seems an afterthought tacked onto the hymn. Or such is my analysis; most of
the other tr. attempt to link the second hemistich with the first, syntactically and
thematically. Most radically Ge (fld. by Doniger), who makes d dependent on
sasavā́n in b, with c a parenthetical intrusion. Maurer, by contrast, makes d the obj.
of c, which does less violence to the order of elements but is still, to my mind,
unsatisfactory. Among other things soma is the usual object of √hi in IX, which
contains multiple exx., and so making the cows (somehow) the object violates
formulaic expectations. Cf. esp. IX.106.11 hinvanti vājínam, with soma identified as
a vājín as here.
It is easy to understand the attempts of others to link d with something else in
the vs., because it consists only of a dative phrase (kakṣī́vate śatáhimāya) and a gen.
pl. (gónām). However, as I just remarked, this pāda seems to be an abbreviated
dānastuti, with the dāna specified and no stuti given, but the poet and would-be
recipient emphatically named. In such circumstances condensed phraseology is not
surprising. Ge appositely cites as parallel I.126.2 śatáṃ kakṣī́vān ásurasya gónām “A
hundred cows of the lord (have I,) Kakṣīvant, (taken).” In our passage the “hundred”
is cleverly tucked into the adj. śatáhima-, which otherwise presumably expresses
Kakṣīvant’s proleptic wish for a 100-year lifespan; it seems unlikely that he is
already that old.

### 09
As I just noted, this vs. seems to be an extra-hymnic afterthought and is
stylistically and thematically detached from the rest of the hymn. It is the only one
containing 2nd ps. reference, which is insistently carried here by four vocc. (a soma,
b pavamāna, c madintama, d pavamāna), an enclitic prn. te (a), and an impv. (d
svádasva). It also contains only the 2nd naming of soma (cf. 7b) and the only forms
of the root √pū, as well as other standards of the somic lexicon (a rása-; b ávyo
vā́ram, ví √dhāv; c √mṛj, madintama; d índrāya … pītáye). In other words, all the
clichés - maddeningly absent from the rest of the hymn - are trotted out, like a
global example of poetic repair, as if to say, “if you were too dim to figure it out, this
is what it was about!” It is not possible to decide whether Kakṣīvant himself added
this magic decoder ring or whether it was appended secondarily. IX.74 is the last of
the 9-vs. trimeter hymns, so it could have originally been an 8-vs. hymn to which the
clarifying vs. was added. The fact that vs. 8 is in Triṣṭubh in an otherwise Jagatī
hymn might indirectly suggest that, since final vss. are sometimes in a different
meter from the rest of their hymn and, if we remove vs. 9, vs. 8 would be the final
vs., ending with Kakṣīvant’s plea for dāna. But it is certainly possible to imagine
Kakṣīvant having his little joke by supplying the key to the hymn in an appendix vs.

### 75-79  
This next group of hymns is attributed to Kavi Bhārgava, also the poet of the
Gāyatrī hymns IX.47-49. They are refreshingly free of the puzzles and contortions of
the first set of trimeter hymns.
## 075

### 01
The opening abhí priyā́ṇi pavate … nā́māni is reminiscent of
IX.62.25=66.1=107.23 pávasva … abhí víśvāni kā́vyā “purify yourself towards all
products of poetic skill,” where in all cases I take the abhí ACC phrase as goal. See
comm. ad IX.62.25. The point is that Soma in the course of his ritual preparation
aims his journey towards the place where the hymns are being recited - in this case
the hymns mentioning his names and epithets. Like the other RVic gods (esp. Indra),
Soma “grows strong” on praise. In contrast, Ge thinks that the “names” are “die
Formen oder Phasen des zubereiteten Tranks”; sim. Lü (526) “Erscheinungsformen.”
I don’t see why the physical needs to replace the verbal here, esp. given the emphasis
on the verbal, and indeed on names, in the next vs.
Properly speaking, yahváḥ should be part of the main cl., in order for yéśu to
take its proper place in the rel. cl. A slightly revised tr. would be “Delighted, the
youthfully exuberant one purifies himself towards his own dear names, upon which
he grows strong.”
The 2nd hemistich implicitly contrasts the heavenly soma with the earthly,
ritual one of ab, as so often.
The adj. vícakṣanaḥ ‘wide gazing’, characterizing Soma, is a partial match for
acc. víṣvañcam ‘facing in many directions’, used of the sun’s chariot.

### 02
The publ. tr. contains a clear error — ‘father’ instead of ‘lord’, for pátiḥ in b
— a regrettable lapse. It should be corrected to “speaker and lord,” and
“father” in the publ. intro. should likewise be changed.
Old finds “tongue” as a descriptor of Soma “bizarr,” but given how much
emphasis is placed in IX on Soma’s noise-making capabilities and association with
speech, I don’t see why. This vs. depicts Soma as the origin and controller of speech
and name-giving, while in vs. 1 (ab) in complementary fashion he aims towards and
is nourished by the names given him by others, or so I interpr. it.
As Ge points out, cd is (partially) illuminated by I.155.3cd, whose d pāda is
identical to ours: dádhāti putró ávaram páram pitúr, nā́ma tṛtī́yam ádhi rocané diváḥ
“The son [=Viṣṇu] sets in place the lower and the higher (names) of the father and
the third name in the luminous realm of heaven.” In both cases the entities in
question in the c pāda are surely Heaven and Earth (so for our passage both Ge [n.
2cd] and Re). The “luminous realm of heaven” must be the realm beyond the nearer
sky; the “third realm” (tṛtī́ye rájasi) appears in the preceding hymn (IX.74.6), though
the same geographical area may not be in question. In any case Soma’s ability to
name these cosmic entities emphasizes his global mastery of speech, and the paradox
of the son naming his parents makes the wonder all the greater.

### 03
The same phrase ṛtásya dohánāḥ is found in I.144.3. In our passage I think
it refers both to the cows=milk and to the poets.
On tripṛṣṭhá- see disc. ad IX.70.8, 71.7.
I take ví rājati with both ‘shine’ and ‘rule’.

### 04
In IX.98.9 Ge suggests that the world-halves (ródasī) are the jaws of the
soma-press, which could account for their being called his mothers (mātárā) here.
On samáyā (ví dhāvati) see comm. ad I.113.10.

### 05
Ge (n. 5c) insists that āhanáso víhāyasaḥ is gen. sg. with te, rather than
nom. pl. with mádāḥ (Gr, Re, publ. tr.). That is of course possible, but the difference
is fairly minor whether the phrase modifies Soma or his exhilarating drinks.
## 076
As noted in the publ. intro., the martial tone is reminiscent of that of another
of Kavi Bhārgava’s productions, IX.47, though there is little or no overlap in
phraseology.

### 01
On pā́jas- see comm. ad I.58.3. For a god making or assuming his pā́jas-,
see, with medial forms of √kṛ, IV.4.1 kṛṇuṣvá pā́jaḥ (of Agni) as well as IX.88.5
vṛ́thā pā́jāṃsi kṛṇute nadī́ṣu, identical to our passage except with a Triṣṭubh cadence,
and, with ā́√dā, IX.68.3 pā́ja ā́dade. Presumably in our passage and 88.5 it depicts
the swelling of the soma stalks in the waters.

### 02
The participial phrase svàḥ síṣāsan “striving to win the sun” is a match for
svàḥ yád … síṣāsati in nearby IX.74.1 “when he strives to win the sun” (also IX.7.4),
where I suggest that the sun stands for the gleaming milk with which the Soma will
unite at the end of his ritual journey. This association would be emphasized in our
passage by gáviṣṭiṣu ‘in the cattle raids’, with cattle standing for milk, as usual. For
further on sun=milk see comm. ad vs. 4.
As Ge points out (n. 2d, not reflected in his tr.), ajyate has a double sense,
since it can be the passive both of √aj ‘drive’ and √añj ‘anoint’. Both are appropriate
here.

### 03
The extreme dislocation of hemistich-initial índrasya from jaṭharéṣu on
which it depends must result from the desire to match the initial índrasya of 2c.
The simile-marking particle iva is late here, since the simile must consist of
vidyúd abhréva.

### 04
The hapax rt noun cmpd ṛṣi-ṣā́h- ‘vanquishing the seers’ (or, as Scar [600]
suggests as an alternative, ‘unter den Ṛṣis siegreich’) is, on first glance, a surprising
collocation, since we generally expect √sah to take more obvious enemies as object.
Yet, of course, poetic competition is an important feature of RVic culture, and the
rest of the vs. asserts Soma’s dominance in this competition - esp. the final, decisive
ásamaṣṭa-kāvyaḥ ‘whose poetic skill is entirely unattainable’, but also his role as
“father of thoughts” (pitā́matīnā́m), and his ability to make “the vision of truth”
(ṛṭásya dhītím) bellow (presumably louder than the other ṛṣis can). The point of the
cmpd might be clearer if tr. “vanquishing the (other) seers”; as Scar points out, Soma
is elsewhere identified as ṛ́ṣi-.
ásira- in c is a hapax. It is plausibly derived from √as ‘throw, shoot’: see,
e.g., Gr,, AiG II.2.361, as well as, more hesitantly, EWA s.v. AS2 — with a
metaphorically tranferred meaning ‘ray, beam’ < ‘missile, spear’; cf. Engl. ‘shaft’ for
both shaft of a spear or similar weapon and shaft of light. Say. glosses it first with
kṣepakeṇa to √kṣip ‘throw’ and then with raśminā, the more usual (also
metaphorically transferred) word for the sun’s rays. Gr’s gloss combines the literal
and the transferred sense in ‘Strahlengeschoss’, while Ge (“Strahl”) and Re (“rayon”)
render only the transferred sense. Mayrhofer (EWA 144-45) is more tentative: he
questions the connection of the word to the ‘throw’ root, and his gloss also expresses
doubt about the transferred meaning: “‘Strahl’ (<‘*Geschoss’ [der Sonne]?).” On
both etymological and contextual grounds - what does it mean to “be groomed by the
lance/ray of the sun”? - it is worth asking what this hapax is doing here. Acdg to Lü
(704), the sun is the heavenly pavítra- and so naturally its beam(s) would perform the
purification of soma. Although I agree that the sun can sometimes be equated with
the filter (see, e.g., IX.83.2), I doubt if that’s what’s going on here. For one thing, the
root √mṛj is not generally used for purification across the filter (though it can be; cf.
e.g., IX.86.6, 107.11), but refers rather to the ritual operations involving water (esp.)
and milk; cf., e.g., IX.68.9 adbhir góbhir mṛjyate “he is groomed with waters, with
cows.” Moreover, the parallelism with raśmí- is not as exact as is implied; most
importantly raśmí- is almost always plural, whereas our form is sg., and soma is
never “groomed” with/by even pl. raśmíbhiḥ.
Bearing in mind that I interpret “seeking to win the sun” in 2b as expressing
Soma’s intention to unite with the milk mixture (metaphorically the sun), as well as
the fact that √mṛj ‘groom’ can be construed with an instr. referring to the waters and
milk used to prepare the soma, we can now consider a different interpr. of
sū́ryasyā́sireṇa. It does not depict the sun’s (single) ray as filter, but the “sun’s shaft”
(or even “sun’s shot”) as the milk infused into the soma - referring either to the sun’s
light (‘shaft’) as gleaming milk or the infusing itself (‘shot’). The latter would have
the merit of requiring fewer semantic steps by simply using the literal meaning of the
root in an extended sense; cf. English ‘shot’ used of a small amount of usually
powerful liquid, generally alcohol, also (for slightly different reasons) used of
espresso. Once this interpr. is considered, the reason for the creation of the hapax
becomes apparent (at least to me). The technical term for the milk mixture is āśír-
(see nearby IX.75.5); our ásir- is phonologically very close, and I would suggest that
it was created as a pun on the standard term. In fact the phonology might be closer
still: the Saṃhitā text reads sū́ryasyā́sireṇa, which is resolved by the Pp. into
sū́ryasya ásireṇa (the extra syllable is metrically necessary); *ā́sireṇa would also be
possible. However, unfortunately I think this latter reading unlikely because it would
convert the standard break after late caesura, two light syllables, into a far less
common one with heavy - light. Another factor that may have contributed to the
creation of this hapax is the presence of ṛṣi(-ṣā́ḍ) in the same metrical position in the
preceding pāda, with ṛṣi- a scrambling of ásir-.
Not much changes in the tr., though I would now emend it to “He who is
groomed by a “shot” [/a shaft] of the sun [=milk] …” However, this analysis shows
once again that when encountering a hapax we should not just seek a plausible
meaning and a plausible etymology, but try to figure out why the hapax was
introduced in the passage, which often opens the way to better understanding of the
other two questions.

### 05
The sá in c with 2nd ps. reference (sá … pavase) violates the rule that such
reference is found only with imperatives. (See my “Vedic 'sá figé': An inherited
sentence connective?,” Historische Sprachforschung 105 [1992] 213-39.) I think it
likely that it has been modeled on the numerous sá (…) pavasva exx. in IX (15 by
my count, e.g., nearby IX.72.8=107.24); an imperative would in fact work better with
the yáthā purpose cl. in d. The indic. pavase may have been substituted because
*pavasva would produce a very abnormal break. An almost identical pāda is found in

### 32  
sá índrāya pavase matsarávān, inexpertly adapted to Triṣṭubh (note the bad
cadence [though see comm. ad loc.]).
The splv. matsaríntama- is somewhat oddly formed, with the possessive suffix -
ín- added to an adj., with no change in sense. The stem occurs 4x (once in a repeated
pāda), always at the end of a pāda. AiG II.2.340 considers it the equivalent of
*matsara-tama-, based on madín-tama-. Given the metrical unfavorability of the
stem *matsaratama-, this seems a plausible explan.
## 077
The word sóma- is absent from this hymn, although four of the five vss. (all
but c) open with a nom. sg. masc. referring to the soma and inviting that word.
As mentioned above, Kavi Bhārgava briefly treats the Somaraub here (vs. 2)
and in his dimeter hymn IX.48 - a myth otherwise rarely mentioned in Maṇḍala IX.

### 02
The gen. obj. of ā́yuvate, mádhvaḥ, is hard to interpret; it certainly doesn’t
seem likely to be a partitive.
I don’t know what to do with the particle áha, which is oddly positioned in the
middle of a pāda interrupting an NP. Re’s “d’un coeur, ah! rempli de crainte” is
appealing, but áha doesn’t ordinarily have such an exclamatory value, as far as I can
see - and it’s a little too conveniently superimposable on our (both French and
English) “ah!”

### 03
Both Ge and Re take pū́rvāsa úparāsaḥ as temporal designations: the earlier
and later drops. If so, it is hard to understand how we can order both types (esp. the
earlier ones, which should be beyond our control) to run. I prefer to see them as
spatial. For such a usage cf. V.31.11 pū́rvaṃ karad úparam “(what is) in front ... he
will put behind.”
As has long been known (see Old, citing Barth., as well as EWA s.v.), ahī́- is
etymologically identical to Aves. azī (OA, YA), which characterizes cows - contra
Gr’s ‘Schlange’. It’s not clear to me why Ge and Re seem so uncertain about it, esp.
as Ge cites Aves. azī in n. 3c.

### 04
As noted in the publ. intro., the vs. seems to contain a paradox, whereby the
masc. Soma conceives an embryo, most likely of himself. See Ge’s n. 4c.
The hapax urubjá- is puzzling. Gr’s suggestion that it derives from a
phonological deformation of *ud-ubjá- seems reasonable, esp., as Mayrhofer points
out (EWA s.v. UBJ), with the interference of urú-. Verbal forms of úd √ubj are found
in AVŚ and TS.

### 05
Soma is notably identified with Varuṇa and Mitra in this vs. - the former
because he cannot be deceived by the crooked (hurúg yaté), the latter because
(implicitly) he mediates between the ritual communities (vṛjána-).
With Mayr. (EWA s.v. híruk), I take hurúk to √hvar ‘go crookedly’ (also in a
moral sense). The expression hurúg yaté contrasts with ṛtáṃ yaté “going to truth” in
the same metrical position in nearby IX.69.3, 74.3 and four other times.
## 078
A remarkably straightforward hymn. Oberlies tr. it in Relig. RV II.125.

### 01
Pace Gr, who identifies it as fem. nom. sg., the adj. tā́nvā is most likely acc.
pl. n., parallel to riprám. On the basis of IX.14.4 jáhac cháryā́ṇi tā́nvā “leaving
behind the stems that belong to his body,” śáryāṇi should be supplied, as indicated by
Ge (n. 1c) and Re.

### 02
A causal rendering of hí in c, as in the publ. tr., is somewhat jarring: it is
hard to see how cd provides the causal basis for pāda b or for ab together. Moreover
the thousand horses in d is a surprising number to be crowded into the soma cups and
the identity of those horses is not clear. Although the standard tr. (Ge, Re, as well as
Ober [II.125/160] and the publ. tr.) all take c and d as parallel and both under the
domain of hí, I would now separate c and d, with d a main clause for which c
supplies the causal basis. The amended tr.: “because there are many courses for you
to travel, there are a thousand fallow bay horses sitting in the cups.” The point here, I
think, is that the poured soma forms multiple rivulets as it crosses the filter, and these
separate drippings of soma are conceived of as horses as they go into the cups.
A minor question in d is the grammatical identity of the rt. noun cmpd.
camūṣádaḥ, which can be gen. sg. or nom. pl. Both Ge and Re take it as gen. sg.,
referring to Soma; the publ. tr. and Oberlies as nom. pl.; Scar allows either and
doesn’t decide. In fact it doesn’t really matter and the other attestations, both sg. (1x)
and pl. (4x) refer to soma (drinks), which in this case could be either the
metaphorical horses or a supplied “you [Soma].”

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., the Apsarases, who are rarely mentioned in the
RV, unusually stand here for the waters with which the soma is mixed. Although
“sitting within … have streamed” seems slightly contradictory, it must be that they
first streamed and then took their seats in the cups. This could be conveyed by a tr.
“The Apsarases …, (now) sitting within, streamed towards Soma.”
On the phrase harmyásya sakṣáṇim “conquerer of the secure house,” found
also in IX.71.4, see comm. ad loc.
Pāda-final sakṣáṇim echoes manīṣíṇam at the end of pāda a, in addition to
participating in another phonetic figure with b and d, as noted below.
In d it is unclear what ákṣitam modifies, since both sumnám and pávamānam
are possible. Both Ge and Re take it with the former (e.g., “une faveur
impérissable”), while Ober (II.125) and I take it with the latter. Although
“imperishable favor/grace” might seem closer to the famous expression
“imperishable fame,” word order favors the connection with pávamānam, as does an
expression like IX.26.2 sahásradhā́ram ákṣitam “the imperishable one of a thousand
streams,” definitely referring to soma. I would note, however, that the word order
argument may be weak, since ákṣitam may have been placed in final position for the
phonological echo of pāda-final akṣaran (b) and sakṣáṇim (c). The stem ákṣita- is
also almost always pāda-final (15 out of 18 occurrences). Of course, it would be
possible to read the adjective with both acc.
## 079

### 01
I take the loc. bṛháddiveṣu in b as referring to the gods, who inhabit lofty
heaven (so also Ober II.60; see also alternative in Ge’s n. 1b). I take it as referring to
the destined recipients of our pressed soma. The standard view is rather that it is a
personal name and refers to the human pressers, to be construed with suvānā́saḥ
(e.g., Klein DGRV I.241 “being pressed among the Bṛhaddiva’s”). But this PN is
only certain in a single passage in the late RV, X.120.8-9, in the sg.; elsewhere, and
esp. in the plural, the stem refers to gods or other heaven-located substances. Cf.,
e.g., II.2.9 amṛ́teṣu … bṛháddiveṣu. Mayr (Pers.Nam.) considers the PN possible here
(“vielleicht”), but does not commit to it.
The real puzzles in this vs. are found in the 2nd hemistich, which has been
much discussed, esp. by Old. See also Ge, Re, and Hoffmann (Aufs. 363). Before
considering the problems of interpr., we should first note that pāda c is metrically
disturbed: it has only 11 syllables in this Jagatī hymn, and in order to produce the
proper Jagatī cadence the final ó in the pāda-final sequence iṣó árātayaḥ must be
read long, despite its position in hiatus. (A Triṣṭubh cadence for this 11-syl. verse is
excluded.) There is no obvious way to fix either the undercount or the anomalous
long o. Note in particular that nothing can be added in the opening ví ca náśan na(ḥ),
because it is an opening of 5 and the enclitic naḥ must be part of it, since pronominal
enclitics never follow the caesura. So a potential easy fix is impossible: to read
*náśan[ta] na(ḥ), with the verb matching naśanta in b but having undergone a
species of haplology. (For a different possible fix, see below.) It is therefore possible
that pāda c is corrupt in some way. On the other hand, the poet may have wanted to
draw attention to the similar openings—x x náśan na(ḥ) and x x naśanta—by this
metrical disturbance.
In order to approach the sense of the hemistich there are a number of clues we
should note: 1) the near-coincidence of verbs: (ví) náśan / naśanta; 2) the accent on
the first verb, which must result from the subordinating use of ca as ‘if’ here; 3)
several parallels, which unfortunately pull in different ways. See esp. X.133.3 ví ṣú
víśvā árātayo, aryó naśanta no dhíyaḥ; also II.35.6 nā́rātayo ví naśan nā́nr̥tāni. A
feature that we might expect to be a clue, the different voices of the two verbs, act.
(ví …) náśan, med. naśanta, does not turn out to be helpful, since -anta replacement
is always a possibility in 3rd pl. injunctives, and naśanta also immediately precedes
sániṣanta and could have adapted itself to that verb. The two passages just cited, with
(ví …) náśanta and (ví) náśan respectively and at least possible identity of meaning
(see below), demonstrate the problem with using voice as a criterion.
Old’s analysis of the situation, incl. the close parallel in X.133.3, is acute, and
he suggests several quite different solutions, without, however, deciding for one. His
first question is whether the two verbs belong to the same root. If so, the likely one is
√naś ‘reach, attain’, but, in his opinion, this makes trouble for pāda c; moreover, in
X.133.3, which he considers an abbreviated reworking of our passage and in a way
its oldest commentary, an affiliation with √naś ‘disappear, perish’ makes better
sense for the first part of the clause (“all hostilities will disappear”). Old’s first stab
at interpr. thus assumes that the two verbs belong to different roots, with ‘disappear’
in pāda c and ‘reach, attain’ in d: “Hinweg mögen schwinden von unsrer Nahrung die
Kargheiten: so mögen denn die Geizigen [Akk.] treffen.” This interpr. must take iṣáḥ
as an ablative sg., aryáḥ as an acc. pl., and supply árātayaḥ in c as the subj. not only
of ví … náśan in c but also of naśanta in d. What doesn’t seem sufficiently
represented in his interpr. is the subordinating value of conditional ca. Old’s second
alternative interpr. takes into account the missing syllable in c (though not the
problematic quantity of o in hiatus). He suggests remedying the undercount by
inserting a negative after the caesura: ví ca náśan *ná na …, which would avoid the
problem of an enclitic following the caesura we noted above. In his emended pāda
there would be an opening of 4; accented neg. ná would immediately follow and host
the enclitic. Haplology would easily account for the transmitted text. The sequence
with negative would be very like II.35.6 cited above: “hostilities shall not reach
[him].” This solution is very clever, and it would allow both verbs to belong to the
same root, ‘reach, attain’. He paraphrases (but doesn’t tr.) it as “die árātayaḥ sollen
nicht uns treffen; wir wollen die arí treffen.” But the problem once again is that he
does not represent the conditional ca. “If the hostilities do not reach us” is
significantly worse than his paraphrase. He himself is disturbed by the unusual
position of ná (though I think that could be acceptable) and the fact that X.133.3
clearly means something different, perhaps because this passage was misunderstood
by the poet of X.133.
My own—quite uncertain—interpr. is that the two verb forms belong to
different roots, just as I take the single verb naśanta in X.133.3 as a pun involving
the same two roots. But, unlike Old’s first alternative, I think the first verb is ‘reach’
and the 2nd ‘perish’. I take iṣáḥ as acc. pl. (as do Ge, Re, Hoffmann, Klein, and
Ober, in their diff. interpr.), even though root-accented *íṣaḥ is expected (though
ending-accented acc. pl. in this stem is not rare). I then supply ‘refreshments’ as
subject of naśanta in d, with aryáḥ gen. sg. depending not only on this supplied subj.
but also on the árātayaḥ of c. The point is: if the stranger’s hostilities go after our
things, theirs will be destroyed as well. It is also possible that the subj. of naśanta in
d is the same árātayaḥ: if their hostilities come after us, those hostilities are doomed.
As I just said, I don’t have a high degree of certainty about the correctness of this
interpr. Those produced by the others just named, which all assign both verbs to
‘reach, attain’, are certainly not out of the question. Unfortunately I can’t endorse
either of Old’s alternatives, however.
### 01-02
The opening of this vs. prá ṇo dhanvantv índavaḥ … echoes that of vs. 1
X no dhanvantv índavaḥ, prá but with the preverb in tmesis relocated to a more
standard, pre-verbal position.
Although (a)codásaḥ (1a) and (mada-)cyútaḥ (2a) obviously belong to
different roots (√cud, √cyut), they have similar semantics, ‘impel, urge on’ and
‘arouse, set in motion’, and similar phonology. So the negated acodás- ‘without
impulsion, without being impelled’ and positive mada-cyút- ‘arousing exhilaration’
(by my interpr., but see below) function as a virtual polarized pair, describing the
drops as not themselves needing any impetus to move, but providing impetus to
others. A pseudo-etymological figure.

### 02
The rt. noun compd mada-cyút- (on which see also above) is taken by Ge as
having passive semantics (“rauscherregt”), in contrast to the active transitive
semantics of my ‘arousing exhilaration’ and Re’s “mouvant l’ivresse.” Scar (128-29)
allows both for the cmpd in general, without deciding on particular passages. Since,
all things being equal, rt noun cmpds to roots with transitive value tend to display
that (type vṛtra-hán-), and most of the other -cyút- cmpds are transitive (acyuta-cyút-
‘shaking the unshakeable’, parvata-cyút- ‘shaking the mountains’), a transitive
interpr. seems to me the default. For the five attestations of madacyút- in IX, all
modifying soma or soma drops, as here, a transitive interpr. is the more natural:
soma is, after all, what produces máda-. However, the cmpd. elsewhere also modifies
Indra or similar entities, who are more likely to be roused to exhilaration than to
rouse it (e.g., I.51.2), and the passive value should be allowed there. Indeed in I.81.3,
by my interpr., there are two potential referents (Indra / soma) and two different
readings of the cmpd.
Pāda b poses problems: what is the disjunction signaled by vā; where does the
rel. cl. with yébhiḥ begin; what is the referent of yébhiḥ; how should dhánā be
construed? Ge starts the rel. cl. with yébhiḥ, leaving the disjunctive phrase dhánā vā
in (or attached to) the main cl. Since there is nothing in that cl. with which to
construe dhánā he must supply a verb parallel to dhanvantu: “… sollen rinnen …
oder die Kampfpreise (gewinnen).” Sim. Klein, DGRV II.205. There is nothing
objectionable about this solution - ‘win’ regularly takes dhána- as obj., and in fact
soma or its equivalent is sometimes the subj. Cf., e.g., IX.65.9 … te … víśvā dhãnāni
jigyúṣah “of you [presumably = soma] having won all the stakes” (though it’s worth
noting that the exact half-vs. is found in VIII.14.6, applying to Indra). But nothing in
the context invites or supports supplying a verb here. Re’s solution is more
economical, in using dhánā as an alternative subject for prá … dhanvantu, though
running forth is less natural action for stakes to perform. Ober (II.248) also takes the
disjunction as belonging to the main cl., but with dhánā as an alternate goal for the
running drops: “… sollen vorwärts laufen oder hin zu den Siegespreisen.” All of
them, Ge (/Klein), Re, and Ober start the rel. cl. with yébhiḥ and make its antecedent
dhánā. By contrast, I take all of pāda b as the rel. cl. (the position of yébhiḥ is of
course perfectly compatible with this), with dhánā a 2nd acc., of goal (rather like
Ober), with junīmási. The antecedent of yébhiḥ is then the soma drops, which give us
(and the horses) the energy to race to the prizes.
Ge, Re, and Ober take c with d. This is certainly possible, but I prefer taking it
with b, to express the potential hazards and dirty-dealing facing our horses in this
race.

### 03
Both árāti- and arí- return from 1cd, but given the uncertainties in that
passage, the return is not terrible useful.
What is most notable here is the carefully balanced construction of ab, with
double utá opening the pādas, the following parallel but contrastive gen.-abl.
expressions svásyā árātyā(h) … anyásyā árātyā(ḥ), and finally the similarly parallel
but contrastive nominal clausettes arír hí ṣá(ḥ) and vṛ́ko hí ṣaḥ. It is (almost)
impossible to escape concluding that the poet was contrasting two similar but very
distinct sources of hostility. Unfortunately, Thieme (Fremd. 45-46) does escape this
conclusion, deciding that the two gen. phrases and the two annunciatory nominal
clauses are merely a way of generalizing to “everybody.” His tr. simply ignores the
signposted construction of the two pādas and jumbles the parallel phrases together.
This was not Thieme’s finest hour. Without an idée fixe to prove (as was the case of
Th), the construction imposes an analysis: a hostile person belong to our side is an
arí, one on the other is a wolf. Now elsewhere in Indo-European and indeed
elsewhere in the RV, “wolf” can be used of a human who is outside social
boundaries, an outlaw (see, e.g., my “Function of Animals in the RV, 2016: 208-9).
Here the outlaw is contrasted with the arí-; with Th. I take him as a “stranger,” but
against Th. as a stranger who belongs to the larger Ārya community, who is “one of
ours.” The hostile person outside of that community, the “other,” is a wolf. With Th.
again, I’d say that the ultimate intent of ab is universal, to counter the threats from
any possible source, but this universality is achieved by an implicitly conjoined
contrast between the two opposites that make up the whole.
By my rules (“Vedic anyá-, Fs. Beekes 1997), anyá- here should be definite
because it is in non-initial position - hence “the other.” This works well with the
interpr. just elaborated, that the two contrastive phrases define the whole.
One further syntactic issue: what is the gen.-abl. in svásyā árātyā(h) …
anyásyā árātyā(ḥ) doing? Ge supplies “protect” to govern an abl., on the basis of
VIII.71.1 pāhí víśvasyā árāteḥ. This is certainly possible - and is endorsed by Old.
However, because of the starkness of the expression, which underlines the contrasts
between each matching element, I am reluctant to introduce any extraneous words
and take the two phrases as independent gen.-abl. in loosely causal/circumstantial
usage. Not very satisfactory, I admit.

### 04
On this vs. see publ. intro.
The first pāda is problematic. The standard interpr. is that Soma’s navel is tied
either to the navel in heaven (Ge, Old, Ober [II.13], Kü [242]) or Soma’s navel in
heaven is tied to our navel (Re). E.g., Ge: “Du, dessen höchster (Nabel) an den abel
im Himmel geknüpft ist.” Before even considering what this would really mean,
there is a simple grammatical problem: this interpr. (and those of the others) requires
masc. paramáḥ and yáḥ both to refer to fem. nā́bhi-. Disc. of this gender clash is
remarkably cavalier. Old suggests that nā́bhi- may be masc. here; Ge (n. 4ab)
registers this suggestion but also suggests that the synonym bándhu- could be
supplied in substitution (not a bad idea, though bándhu- is rare in the RV and doesn’t
seem to show up in the vicinity of nā́bhi-). The push to have two forms of nā́bhi- in
this pāda is clearly based on very similar IX.10.8 nā́bhā nā́bhim na ā́dade “He has
bound his navel to our navel” and the idiom sám / ā́√dā ‘tie’ with two forms of
‘navel’, on which see comm. ad I.139.1. There is another slight problem, that the rel.
prn. yá(ḥ) is rather too deep in its clause, if the whole pāda forms the rel. cl., as in
most interpr.
I don’t have a good solution to this pāda. I would first point out that init. diví
te matches up with init. pṛthivyā́s te in b, and at least the disturbance in word order in
the pāda may result from the desire to locate heaven and earth in parallel positions.
Otherwise, instead of assuming a masc. nā́bhi- I supply ‘form’ with the masc.
paramó yáḥ in the publ. tr., but there is no particular support for this, and if I was
thinking of rūpá- at the time, this doesn’t work because rūpá- is neut. There are no
masc. nouns that are regularly qualified by paramá-, while nā́bhi- is qualfied as
paramā́(with a fem. form) in X.61.18. The upshot is - I’m fairly sure my rendering
is wrong, or at least not right, and I’d be inclined to go with the standard, despite the
distressing gender clash: “It was in heaven, to its navel, that your highest (navel) was
bound.” As to what this means, presumably it is another instantiation of the
“heavenly soma” trope: no matter that the physical plant is earthbound (as in pāda b),
it has a heavenly analogue. One thing that is clear is that ādadé belongs to √dā
‘bind’; see comm. ad I.139.1 and Kü 242.
Fortunately the rest of the vs. is relatively straightforward. The “fingers” that
grow on the earth are the parts of the plant: if soma is ephedra intermedia (wfhich
grows in the Himalayas), it has slender upright shoots that could be conceived of as
fingers.
## 080

### 01
The rhyming verbs pavate and havate take identical positions in pādas a and
b respectively. See also 2d pavase, 3a pavate, 3b śrávase in the same position.
Pāda c compares soma to a thunderstorm, producing a roar like Bṛhaspati’s
while flashing forth (ví didyute) like lightning.
In pāda d the value of ná is disputed: is it the simile particle or the negation?
The problem prompted a 5-pg. digression by Old on the positioning of the two
elements. He comes out strongly for the simile marker here, a view shared by Ge,
Re, Kü (250, 503), and the publ. tr., while the negative is favored by Lü (99 and n.
2), Ober (II.216), and Schmidt (B+I 79)(with Ge considering it in n. 1d). Lü
recognizes that the position favors the simile particle, but prefers the negative since
there’s no obvious element to supply to fill out the simile. Ge suggests that subj. to
be supplied is either the soma vessels or the gods, with both Old and Re favoring the
gods, who came on the scene in pāda b. I think instead that it is the waters with
which the pressed soma is mixed; this would fit the comparison to ‘seas’. Cf. I.173.8
… sávanā samudré “the pressings in the sea,” which I also think refers to the mixing
water. (Of course sávanāni could also be the subject of vivyacuh, but this would
require supplying an obj.)
On the full grade of vivyacuḥ (for expected *vivicuḥ) see Kü 503 n. 1000. One
might also note that the expected form would yield a terrible cadence. Acdg. to Kü,
the indic. pf. to √vyac is always a presential stative, and he considers the indic.
necessary in this context to express that value. Otherwise, the full-grade 3rd pl. could
belong to the plupf. (here as injunc.); cf. the augmented plupf. avivyacuḥ (X.56.4).
Kü considers the injunc. excluded here, but in fact I think it’s quite possible: “they
have enveloped the pressings,” parallel to ví didyute ‘has flashed forth’ in c, and
might alter the tr. in to the preterital one.

### 02
On áyo-hata- see comm. ad IX.1.2.

### 03
On kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see comm. ad III.36.8, VIII.92.24. Here
the context is not diagnostic and might in fact slightly favor ‘belly’, esp. given vs. 1
of the next hymn (IX.81) by the same poet, which contains jaṭháram ‘belly’.
However, the preponderance of evidence for ‘cheek’ elsewhere is pretty strong.
### 04-05
Both vss. open with táṃ tvā, echoing yáṃ tvā beginning vs. 2.

### 04
Pādas a and b share a verb, duhate in b. Each pāda contains a contrastive
pair: devébhyaḥ … náraḥ “the men for the gods” and sahásra(dhāram) … dáśa
(kṣípaḥ) “thousand(-streamed) … ten (fingers).”

### 05
The first two pādas have the same structure as 4ab: they share a verb form
of √duh, duhánti in b, with two different subjects, hastínaḥ (a) and dáśa kṣípaḥ (b)
again. The “stones” of 4c (grā́vabhiḥ) return, but with different lexical realization
(ádribhiḥ).
## 081

### 01
īm in c anticipates śū́ram in d.

### 02
With Old I see “of gods” (devā́nām) in the phrase “the double birth of gods”
as pregnant for “of gods (and men),” very much as a pregnant dual like dyā́vā “two
heavens” or pitárā “two fathers” implies its opposite number. As Old points out, the
locational adverbs in the next pāda amúta itáś ca “from yonder and from here”
strongly suggest heaven and earth as their spheres. Ge considers “gods and men to be
the sense, but, in order not to supply a 2nd gen. pl., he achieves this by way of the
unlikely “(heavenly and earthly) gods,” that is, gods and men. Ober (I.391) thinks
that the double birth is of Devas and Asuras, but this is anachronistic.

### 03
The vs. contains a play on vásu, which further puns on the poet’s name. In
pāda a the acc. vásu refers to the material goods we ask Soma to provide for us,
while in c the dative vásave appears to refer to a good person, the recipient of Soma’s
aid. Since the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn (along with IX.80 and 82) to Vasu
Bhāradvāja, the recipient is presumably the poet himself. (Because Re has a
particular, and peculiar, view of vásu, his tr. does not reflect the pun.)
párā sicaḥ ‘pour away’, which appears only here in the RV, must play on the
very common soma verb pári √sic ‘pour around, pour in circles’, of the circular
motion of pouring the soma juice onto the filter. See pári √i / pári √yā of soma’s
journey around the filter in vss. 1-2 of the next hymn (IX.82), attributed to the same
poet.
With Old I read *sucetúnā (also in V.65.3) for transmitted sú cetúnā. The
former cmpd. is pretty well attested, while cetú- doesn’t otherwise exist. And in both
instances the phrase/cmpd is pāda-final, which would put an independent particle sú
in an unusual location: it otherwise generally takes Wackernagel’s position.

### 04
Ge, Re, and Ober (I.526) take surātáyaḥ as referring to a separate group of
divinities (e.g., Re “les (divinités) aux beaux dons”), but there is no such corporate
entity as far as I am aware. In other passages the stem simply modifies the gods in
general (X.65.4) or the Maruts (X.78.3). Here I think it applies to the listed gods as a
group, and as a summary adj. was stationed at the end of a pāda, here matching the
position of *sucetúnā at the end of 3c in the previous vs.
## 082
### 01-02
As Ge points out (nn. 1d, 2d), ghee (ghṛtá-) in these two vss. stands for
the milk mixture.

### 01
The simile in b is also found in X.43.2 rā́jeva dasma (with voc.), as Ge (n.
1b) points out. The simile is likely to be self-contained, not a necessary part of the
rest of the clause, contra Ober (II.214-15), who sees it as expressing a peculiar trope,
“der ‘brüllende’ König.”

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. marks a departure from the first two
conventional vss., with richer imagery, esp. in the first pāda. The first hemistich must
refer to the soma plant, growing in the mountains. The god of the thunder(storm),
Parjanya is his father because rain produces plants. The qualifier parṇín- means, in
the first instance, ‘feathered’ (e.g., VIII.5.33 váyaḥ … parṇínaḥ “feathered birds”),
but of course parṇá- ‘feather’ has already undergone widening in the RV to mean
‘leaf’ as well, and so it must be interpr. here.
The scene shifts back to the ritual ground in cd: the two additional ingredients
of prepared soma, water and milk, are found in c, with the pressing stones in d (the
actual order of ritual preparation would be the reverse, of course).
In c utá is in an unusual position and its function is unclear. Klein (DGRV
I.380-81) simply describes the situation as involving “nonparallel clauses and weak
nexus,” remarking further that cd “bears little cohesive relationship to ab,” though
that’s what he thinks utá is connecting. Ge and Re both tr. as “also,” and the publ. tr.
follows this interpr., which seems more likely than Klein’s near-null hypothesis.
Perhaps contributing to its unusual position is the parallelism of abhí gā́utā́saran#
and 1b abhí gā́acikradat#, with the verbs trisyllabic asaran and quadrisyllabic
acikradat respectively. The utá supplies the necessary extra syllable and, by
coalescing with the augment, the heavy antepenult needed for the cadence.
In d “unite with the stones” may be a little strong: better “come together
with.”

### 04
Since śéva in pāda a must be a vocative morphologically, its accent is
unexpected in this pāda-medial position. There are two factors that might have
contributed to it, which, however, cancel each other out. On the one hand, the point
of contact between the simile “like a wife to her husband” and the frame is this very
adj. ‘kindly’, and so an underlying fem. nom. sg. *sévā must also be assumed. This
overlap between an expected nom. and the voc. addressed to the correspondent of the
wife, namely Soma, may have led to the anomalous accentuation. On the other hand,
if the simile was felt to be a self-contained clause, śéva would begin a new clause or
at least a new syntactic unit. I’m not sure that either is sufficient, but I weakly favor
the second.
The voc. phrase in b, pájrāyā garbha, likewise causes a problem, though not
of accent: garbha is properly unaccented, and its dependent gen. pájrāyā(ḥ) shows
the expected shift to initial accent in this pāda-initial voc. phrase, from the suffixally
accented stem pajrá-. The question is the referent of this fem. pajrā́-. Ge, Re, Ober
(I.530) take it as a PN (e.g., “O Kind der Pajrā”). It is certainly true that pajrá- can
be a PN (see Mayr [PN], though he doesn’t include this passage in his list), but
usually in the pl. of a family of poets. It is never otherwise found in the fem., and it
would be very strange (in my opinion) for a named mother to be specified in this
kind of context, unless she is a goddess. Far more likely is Sāy.’s identification of the
referent as the earth. The stem pajrá- as an adj. means ‘sturdy, steadfast’, a
reasonable description of the earth. Earth as Soma’s mother would fit nicely also
with 3a, which names Parjanya as his father. The rains generate the plant, but it
grows in the earth.
The standard interpr. of prá carā in c is as 2nd sg. impv. addressed to Soma,
and this is certainly possible. But I think it is equally possible that, in this 1st ps.
context, it’s a 1st sg. subjunctive, and the contents of the poet’s direct speech
announced in immed. preceding brávīmi te. This is how it is rendered in the publ. tr.
The sú in c is in an unusual position, but it is in the same position as sú in the
preceding hymn, IX.81.3, attributed to the same poet. There Old suggested (and I
followed) reading it with the following noun as cmpd. *sucetúnā. I follow the same
path here, reading *sujīváse, though this time without Old’s imprimatur. The case
here is not as strong. With regard to IX.81.3 the putative cmpd sucetú- exists
independently, while the transmitted stem cetú- does not. Here the opposite is true:
the infinitival dat. jīváse is quite well attested, whereas sujīvás- is not found. This
gives me pause about the emendation, but even without it, I think that sú should be
read with jīváse and with its lexical value, not merely as a particle: “… to live well.”

### 05
In b paryáyā(ḥ) is the augmented impf. to √yā; so correctly Gr, Ge. But Re
in a rare grammatical lapse seems in his n. to take it as a subjunctive (presumably to
√i), but that form should be (and is) áyaḥ.
## 083
On the structure of this hymn and my interpr. of its enigmatic contents, see
the publ. intro. Here I will not treat in detail the interpr. of others.

### 01
As indicated in the publ. intro. and above, ad IX.73.9, this vs. is very like
the last vs. of IX.73, a hymn also focused on the filter, both physical and mystical.
The identity of the ‘limbs’ (gā́trāṇi) in b is not entirely clear. I take it as
referring to the metaphorical limbs of the filter, though the visual picture thus
conjured up is imperfect, unless the fleece filter comes not only from the back but
from the legs of the sheep. I do not think it is the limbs of the soma-drinkers, with
Re.
I take tád in c to be the filter, again both physical and mystical. As I say in the
publ. intro., “raw” versus “cooked” in this hemistich refers to the transformation
effected on the soma plant by its ritual preparation, even though “cooking” is not
technically involved. The pl. in d is presumably the soma drops or drinks, as opposed
to the mass sg. in c referring to the as-yet-unprepared plant.

### 02
The identification of sun and soma, with the rays of the sun across the sky
(the cosmic filter, as it were) compared to the tracks of soma across the ritual filter.
The ī of pavītár- is anomalous and may in fact be suspect. The stem only
occurs twice in the RV, the other time at IX.4.4, where the ī is not metrically
guaranteed. In our passage, as Gr. points out, the SV [also JB] reading pavitā́ram is
metrically better. The stem with ī is confined to the RV, except that the repetition of

### 04
in SV also has the ī (as opposed to the SV rep. of our passage). The expected
pavitár- is found in the AV and later. Given extremely common savitár- to the
parallel root √sū, it is hard to understand how pavītár- acquired its unetymological ī.
I tentatively suggest that it is a metrical analogy to the far more common pavítra-,
with heavy 2nd syllable because of the cluster. As this hymn shows, pavítra- occurs
in the same contexts as pavītár-. It might also be influenced by the weak forms of the
associated 9th class present (suffix nī), which immediately follows the form in

### 04
pávītāraḥ punītána.

### 03
Further identification of soma and the sun. For pṛ́śni- and ukṣán- used of the
sun, see, e.g., V.47.3; for the sun supporting the worlds, see X.170.4 (dedicated to
Sūrya) yénemā́viśvā bhúvanāny ā́bhr̥tā “by whom all these worlds are borne.”
As indicated in the publ. intro., I take the 2nd hemistich as expressing a
reciprocal paradox: the forefathers were created as masters of artifice (māyāvín-) by
the artifice (māyā́-) of Soma/the sun, but they also engendered him. I take the pf.
mamire as passive, with Gr. The standard tr. (and incl. HPS, B+I, 78) take the verb as
transitive, supplying bhúvanāni from b as obj. (I do have to concede that the pf. is
otherwise generally transitive.) But under their reading I don’t understand how the
forefathers as possessing their own māyā́(māyāvínaḥ) needed “his māyā́” (asya
māyáyā) to accomplish the task.
If there is any difference in meaning between māyāvín- (3x) and the far better
attested and more orthodoxly formed māyín- I cannot detect it.

### 04
For my view of the Gandharva as another instantiation of soma/the sun see
publ. intro. This more or less agrees with Ge (n. 4a: the sun, acdg. to Sāy.) and Re
(Soma-Gandharva). I do not see this vs. as referring to the Somaraub as Ober does
(II.162).
As indicated in the publ. intro., with the 2nd hemistich we return to the world
of ritual and to the filter specifically.
nidhā̇́- clearly means ‘snare’; see the other occurrence in X.73.11 nidháyeva
baddhā́n “bound as if by a snare.” But the semantic dev. from the presumed source ní
√dhā is not clear. That lexeme generally means ‘set down, deposit, keep
safe/secure’. Perhaps ‘snare’ develops from this last meaning: a device used to
secure an object. On this problem see detailed disc. by Scar (255). It would be nice to
connect it with ní √dā ‘bind’, but pesky phonology gets in the way.

### 05
The garment of cloud in b is presumably the milk in ritual terms, a real
cloud for the sun identified with soma.
## 084

### 01
Acdg. to Ober (I.526), this vs. is concerned with the “landerobernde
Funktion (König) Somas,” which makes sense. Pāda c directly asks Soma to provide
us with wide space, and his epithets vícarṣaṇi- ‘unbound(ari)ed’ and apsā́- ‘waterwinning’ in ab belong to this conceptual realm. In d urukṣitaú ‘in the wide dwelling
place’ may as well, if it refers to our (newly acquired) dwelling, per Ober. Re takes it
rather as the dwelling place of the divine folk, but given the context Ober’s view is
more persuasive.

### 02
The territory-winning theme of vs. 1 may be continued here, but on the
cosmic level, with Soma mounting all the worlds. This is also probably a reference to
Soma as the sun, as Ge suggests (n. 2a).
As noted in the publ. intro., the “knotting and unknotting” probably has both a
ritual and a moral reading. Ritually it presumably refers to soma’s passage across the
woolly tangles of the sheep’s fleece filter. But Ge cites as potential parallel IX.97.18
granthíṃ ná ví ṣya grathitám …, ṛjúṃ ca gātúṃ vṛjínaṃ ca … “ Untie like a knot the
straight and the crooked way (which are) knotted up, when you are being purified,”
which implies a moral dimension as well, since “straight” and “crooked” are often
used in that sphere.
Pāda d lacks an acc. in the frame to be construed with siṣakti as parallel to
uṣásam in the simile. Perhaps the gods in general (the daívyaṃ jánam of 1d and 3d),
or the three gods named in 1b, Indra, Varuṇa, and Vāyu. Re supplies Indra, and the
parallel he cites, I.56.4 índraṃ síṣakti uṣásaṃ ná sū́ryaḥ, supports this suggestion,
esp. since Indra recurs in vss. 3 and 4.

### 03
The ritual and/or real world situation depicted in pādas a and c is unclear. In
particular, in pāda a what plants does soma (+ milk) pour onto? Ober (II.42) may
well be right that it depicts soma as rain, though we would still lack a ritual analogue
to the plants receiving rain in the real world. Rain in this pāda would fit with the
lightning imagery in c. Soma him/itself flashed forth (ví didyute) in IX.80.1, and
“ever-flashing light” (dávidyutatī- rúc-) is associated with the soma drinks in
IX.64.28.
The publ. tr. construed dhā́rayā with sutáḥ, because this expression (IX.51.5,
72.5, 100.6, 108.5) or minor variants (IX.3.10=42.2, 10.4, 97.45) are fairly common
in this maṇḍala. However, both Ge and Re take it with pavate, parallel with vidyútā
(e.g., “Der ausgepresste Soma laütert sich mit Blitz (und Regen)guss”), and this may
be preferable in the rainstorm context.

### 04
Notice the return of the god Vāyu of 1b in the guise of the common noun
‘wind(s)’ (vāyúbhiḥ) in c, juxtaposed with Indra in d.

### 05
The last pāda is notable for the concentration of poet words: vípraḥ kavíḥ
kā́vyena, a role not otherwise attributed to Soma in this hymn.

### 85-86  
On the structure of the last two hymns of the Jagatī group, see the publ.
introductions to IX.85 and 86. In brief, after a series of hymns of 5 vss. (IX.75-84),
these last two have 12 vss. and 48 vss. respectively. However, they are clearly
composites: IX.85 consists of three groups of four vss. apiece, IX.86 of 16 tṛcas. The
standard principles of hymn arrangement can thus be restored.
## 085
For the four-vs. sequences and their contents, see publ. intro.

### 02
In pāda c the preverbs abhy ā́are oddly positioned, after the caesura, and,
more important, the two apparent acc. objects śátrūn ‘rivals’ and bhandanāyátaḥ
‘those seeking blessings’ are antithetical, with only the first an appropriate obj. to
jahí. The problems disappear if, with Ge, we supply a second verb to go with the
preverbs and to govern the 2nd acc. A verb of motion fits well, and √i, √gam, and
√yā all appear with this combination of preverbs, whereas √han does not. Ge goes
for slightly richer semantics: “(komm) … zu (Hilfe)” - without specifying what verb
he supplies, but note that √av does not appear with those preverbs.
The identities of Soma and Indra appear to bleed into each other in the course
of the vs. In ab the 2nd ps. subject is clearly Soma, on the basis of voc. pavamāna (a)
and priyó mádaḥ (b). The assumption then is that the impv. jahí in c is also addressed
to Soma. But in d we get direct address of Indra and at the end of the pāda he is the
subj. of a second jahi. Therefore pāda c, which contains no lexical clue to the
addressee, could be addressed either to Soma or to Indra (or both).

### 03
The blending of identities in 2cd is made explicit in pāda b here, where
Soma is called “the very self of Indra” (ātméndrasya).
On the meaning of the secondary root √niṃs see comm. ad VIII.43.10. There
I stated my preference for maintaining the older gloss ‘kiss’, against the colorless
‘seek out’, which was suggested by Gotō and adopted by EWA, etc. However, I must
admit that, at least superficially, ‘seek out’ works better here than ‘kiss’ and it is
reflected in the publ. tr. But a ceremonial kiss signaling fealty is certainly possible -
like kissing the pope’s ring or the widespread custom of kissing someone’s feet as a
gesture of respect. So Ober (I.531-32) “Sie küssen den [Fuss des] König[s] dieser
Erde.” Both Ge and Re render the phrase without interposing a bodypart, e.g., “ils
baisent le roi de ce monde.” I am now inclined towards the more precise and physical
“they kiss the king,” rather than the publ. tr.’s “They seek out the king.” This interpr.
is made the more likely because “kissing” Soma in the ritual can well indicate
consuming soma by mouth, that is, drinking it.

### 05
The passive ajyase has, as often in this maṇḍala, a double meaning, ‘is
anointed’ (√añj) and ‘is driven’ (√aj).
On the meaning (‘all at once’, not ‘in the middle’) and the formulaic
construction of samáyā, see comm. ad I.113.10.
### 07-08
Pādas 7c and 8a have almost identical structure:
pávamānā abhy àrṣanti su(ṣṭutím)
pávamāno abhy àrṣā su(vī́ryam)
which effects the transition from 3rd pl. to 2nd sg.

### 08
The somewhat awkward tr. “constricting pressure” reflects the literal,
additive sense of páriṣūti-: pári ‘around’ + √sū ‘impel, thrust’. Maybe something
like “squeezing” would sound a bit more idiomatic, though it is hard to find any
English idiom that more or less represents the etymology and fits with the verb. Of
course, narrowness and constriction are particularly feared and avoided in the Rig
Veda. Perhaps “claustrophobia” might work, though of course the -phobia part is
absent; “constriction” is probably the best choice in English. It is also not clear what
threat páriṣūti- poses to the ritual soma, which, after all, has been subjected to
serious pressing (via the phonologically similar but unrelated root √su) and therefore
has nothing left to fear in that regard. In real world terms it of course refers to the
opposite of the “wide pasturage and great, extensive shelter” that Soma is urged to
rush to in pāda b. In this regard it is similar to the words aṃhatí-, áṃhas-
‘constriction, constraint’. The other occurrence of páriṣūti- (I.119.6) is found in a
similar context, with a contrast between constraint and wide space: yuváṃ rebhám
páriṣūter uruṣyathaḥ. JPB tr. “You give Rebha space from being besieged,” but in
my opinion the sense is more particular: “you give Rebha wide space from (/out of)
constriction.”
On īśata see comm. ad I.23.9.
### 09-12
As noted in the publ. intro., these four vss. treat the identification of
Soma and the sun and are similar to the very enigmatic Vena hymn, X.123, which is
attributed to the same poet, Vena Bhārgava.

### 09
The double vision of both heavenly Soma/Sun and earthly ritual soma is
clear here, with pādas a, b, d all having a celestial orientation, each containing a form
of div-/dyu- ‘heaven’, while the filter of pāda c brings us back to the ritual. The subj.
of d is probably, on the one hand, the ritual officiants, who perform the ritual action
of milking (that is, pressing) the soma. But the substance obtained is “the beestings
[colostrum, first milk] of heaven” (pīyúṣam … diváḥ), and the next vs. makes clear
that those performing the milking here are also the venā́ḥ ‘seekers’ in 10b, where
they are located “in the vault of heaven” (divó nā́ke).
### 10-11
The two tr. of vená- in 10b ‘seekers’ and 11b ‘trackers’ respectively
should be harmonized. I would now tr. ‘seekers’ for both.

### 10  
The cosmic/natural and the earthly/ritual double vision is played out
simultaneously throughout this vs. In ab the seekers milk the streams “in the vault of
heaven” (divó nā́ke) but milk them out of “the mountain-dwelling ox” (ukṣáṇaṃ
giristhā́m), the earthly soma plant. In c the drop grows strong not only “in the
waters” (apsú), presumably the ritual waters used to swell the plant, but also “in the
sea” (samudrá ā́); in d it is both “in the wave of the river” (síndhor ūrmā́) and “in the
filter” (pavítra ā́).
On the basis of the shared verb (duhate in 9d, duhanti in 10b) the venā́ḥ here
appear to be identical to the subjects of 9d, as suggested above.
Pāda b is identical to IX.73.4. As noted in the comm. thereon, there is good
reason to supply “streams” (dhā́rāḥ) as the referent for the pl. adjs. mádhujihvā(ḥ)
and asaścátaḥ, which are therefore fem. acc. pl. Curiously Ge takes the former as
nom. pl. m. here, though fem. in 73.4, while Ober (II.13149-50, ) takes them both as
nom. pl. m.; Re tr. as I do.

### 11  
I would now take the pf. part. upapaptivā́ṃsam as explicitly anterior to the
impf. akṛpanta: “the eagle that had flown to the vault.”

### 12  
This final vs. is esp. close in phraseology to the Vena hymn, with pāda a
identical to X.123.7a and pāda c almost identical to X.123.8c. Note also that ádhi
nā́ke asthāt unites ádhi ... asthāt of our 9a and nā́ke of our 10a.
Ge takes the part. praticákṣāṇaḥ as transitive/causative “seine Farben alle
offenbarend” (though he questions this in n. 12b); sim. Ober (II.13) “erscheinen
lassend.” Re’s tr. is like mine (“regardant-en-face toutes les formes siennes”),
although in his n. he considers the opposite possibility, citing passages with práti
√cakṣ that supposedly have this transitive sense. But his exx. are not probative, and
the middle voice of the participle makes it esp. unlikely to have this sense.
## 086
As noted above, an assemblage consisting of 16 three-vs. units, attributed to a
variety of poets and poetic groups and showing no particular unity of structure or
special poetic merit. However, there is often patterned repetition both between tṛcas
and within them.
### 01-03
The first two vss. of this tṛca begin identically (prá te), and all three vss.
concern the swift journey of the soma drinks, which is compared to that of swift
animals. Vss. 1 and 3 share the same verb (√ṛṣ: 1b arṣanti, 3a arṣa; ásṛkṣata in 2b is
semantically similar) and the same goal, the kóśa- or ‘cask’, while vss. 1 and 2 both
contain āś́vaḥ ‘swift’. Of course none of these features is unusual in the soma corpus,
so they are not strong evidence for tṛca unity.

### 01
The rt noun cmpd dhī-jū́- (also in vs. 4) could have two different readings,
‘sped by insight(s)’ and ‘speeding insights’; see Scar 170-71. The publ. tr. opts for
the passive interpr., as does Re, while Ge chooses the transitive one. Either is
possible in this ritual context, and parallels cut both ways. On the one hand, there is
the parallel cmpd dhī-jávana- (3x), which must have transitive value; on the other,

### 16  
… āśávaḥ / dhiyā́jūtā́ḥ ..., with āśávaḥ as here, supports the passive
reading. And of course both might be meant.
The standard tr. (Ge, Re, also Scar 170) supply ‘horses’ with raghujā́ḥ, and
this of course is quite possible. The adj. raghú- and its cmpds do modify horses
elsewhere (e.g., V.30.14). However, the cmpds. raghu-pátma-jaṃhas- ‘having
plumage (fit) for rapid flight’ (VI.3.5), raghu-pátvan- ‘rapidly flying’ (2x) reference
flying, and various related forms reference birds: V.30.9 raghúḥ śyenáḥ, II.19.4 váyo
ná paptū raghuyā́. The specification of flight in these forms suggest to me that
raghú- (etc.) was originally specialized for the swift flight of birds and then
generalized to other fast things, and I therefore supply ‘birds’ in the simile. On the
other hand, since vss. 2 and 3 both contain likely (ráthyāsaḥ 2b) or explicit (átyaḥ 3a)
horses, tṛca unity might favor ‘horses’ in the simile here as well.

### 02
It seems a little odd to say that chariot horses go “each separately,” since
one would think that the horses would be attached to the same chariot and efficient
movement would require them to pull together. But almost the same phrase occurs in
X.91.7 … rathyò yáthā pṛ́thak, though there referring to charioteers, and so the
words must belong together. Perhaps it refers to separate chariots, each with its own
set of horses—or that each horse in a chariot team has its own place in harness and
each individually contributes to the speed of the whole?

### 03
Pāda a is metrically disturbed, despite apparently having 12 syl. With
Arnold and HvN, best to read *hyānáḥ for hiyānáḥ (as sometimes elsewhere), to
avoid a too early or too late caesura and a bad Jagatī cadence. The pāda is then a fine
Triṣṭubh.
Although, as noted above, vss. 1 and 3 share the same goal, the kóśa-, the
physical referent has changed between 1 and 3. In the former, the cask is presumably
the soma vessel on the ritual ground, but in 3b it is characterized as kóśaṃ divó
ádrimātaram “the cask of heaven, whose mother is the stone”—in other words the
vault of the sky (or the soma container in the sky). So the subject is the heavenly
soma, not merely the ritual substance, even though the ritual details are re-asserted in
cd. For the heavenly cask, see V.53. 6, 59.8, IX.88.6. Old reports without enthusiasm
a potential emendation to nom. ádrimātā, modifying soma, with ádri- the pressing
stone. This would yield another Triṣṭubh pāda. However, since heaven (or at least the
container of the heavenly soma) may be made of stone, there seems no reason to
emend.
In the publ. tr. for ease of English parsing I moved the tr. of svarvíd from b to
cd, but this mixes the levels: the sun-finding Soma is the one that reaches heaven,
while the soma of cd is the substance purified in the sheep’s filter. Better (if
somewhat awkward): “… rush to the prize, as the sun-finder (rush) to the cask of
heaven …”
### 04-06
The first vs. of the new tṛca is in part a distillation of the previous tṛca.
The next two vss. end their first hemistichs identically: 5b, 6b GEN satáḥ pári yanti
ketávaḥ “The beacons of the one being X circle around.” But as in the first tṛca, this
identity conceals a fundamental difference of reference, with both a cosmic and a
ritual dimension.

### 04
As just noted, this vs. seems to distill the first tṛca and is esp. similar to vs.
1. Like both 1 and 2 it opens prá te, and the 2nd hemistich also begins with prá, with
prā́ntár echoing prá ta). Even more strikingly the first pāda matches 1a almost
exactly:
1a prá ta āśávaḥ pavamāna dhījávaḥ
4a prá ta ā́śvinīḥ pavamāna dhījávaḥ
The only difference is the third word, and the two are phonological multiforms of
each other - or rather, ā́śvinīḥ must have been formed as a variant of āśávaḥ, since
the vṛddhi deriv. ā́śvina-, -ī is found only here in the RV (though it occurs elsewhere
in Vedic), while āśú- is quite common. In addition, asṛgran (4b) and asṛkṣata (4c)
reprise ásṛkṣata of 2b, and páyasā (4b) recurs from 2c.
However, these similarities once again mask conceptual differences.
The first question to confront is what the referents are for the fem. pls. ā́śvinīḥ
in pāda a and sthā́virīḥ in c, and are they the same? Ge and Re both supply different
nouns for the two - dhā́rāḥ ‘streams’ for the first (already Sāy.) and gíraḥ ‘hymns’
for the second. (Sāy. supplies dhā́rāḥ for the second as well.) Although this split
reference is perfectly possible - and at least páyasā ‘with their milk’ might favor a
liquid interpretation in ab - I prefer to supply gíraḥ for both. In the 2nd hemistich the
passage adduced by Old to explain pāda c, I.181.7 ásarji vām sthávirā vedhasā gī́ḥ
“A substantial song has been sent surging to you, o ritual experts,” resembles our
passage very closely, with fem. gī́ḥ and with verb, adj., and voc. matching elements
in cd. There is only one fem. form to the adj. sthávira-, namely the one just cited
modifying gír-. The pleonastically vṛddhied adj. in our passage, fem. sthā́virī-, is a
hapax in the RV - and in fact I would suggest that it owes its vṛddhi to an attempt to
match that of ā́śvinīḥ. Moreover, I.181.7 passage is in an Aśvin hymn (the referents
of vām … vedhasā), and to my mind the unusual ā́śvinīḥ ‘destined for the Aśvins’ in
the first hemistich invites us to supply a form of praise as the fem. pl. referent. We
might also cite other exx. of the Aśvins’ association with praise hymns (not, I realize,
unusual for Vedic gods!): VII.72.3 stómāso aśvínoḥ, VIII.9.7 aśvínoḥ ... stómam,
VIII.9.16 vācā́.... aśvínaḥ (though none of these is fem. pl.). Thus in my view the
entities “destined for the Aśvins” in pāda a are more likely to be hymns than streams.
In the first hemistich the fem. subj. (whatever it is) surges “into the support”
(dhárīmaṇi), which I take to be the soma vessel. I supply the same loc. with antár in
the 2nd hemistich. Cf. nearby IX.89.5 samāné antár dharúṇe níṣattaḥ “set down
within the same support,” with dharúṇe an etymological and semantic match for
dhárīman-.
As noted above, asṛkṣata in c repeats ásṛkṣata in 2b, but they are functional
opposites: the first verb must be intrans. ‘have surged’ (or pass., ‘have been
discharged’) with the soma drinks as subject, while our verb is trans. with the seers
as subj. and hymns as obj. The intrans/pass.. function is taken over in vs. 4 by
asṛgran in b. The aor. of √sṛj is overwhelmingly medial and overwhelmingly
intrans./pass. in function, including the numerous exx. of 3rd pl. ásṛkṣata. There are
only two transitive occurrences of this form, this one and one in V.52.6. In our case I
think it likely that in this vs. asṛkṣata has been made to contrast functionally with
likewise 3rd pl. asṛgran, which patterns with the aor. passive and therefore has more
title to intrans./pass. function. Narten (Sig.Aor. 270-71) discusses the functional
issues in the s-aor. paradigm of this root, but she holds the (to me) unlikely position
that the medial forms should be fundamentally transitive (though she hedges here)
and the intrans. use is secondary, despite the clear numerical superiority of the
intrans. usage. I think it makes more sense to consider the transitive usage, at least
here, as forced on a normally intrans. form by the pressure of asṛgran.
The formation of the hapax voc. ṛṣiṣāṇa is opaque. Gr’s gloss ‘dem Sänger
freund’ reveals nothing about his analysis of the 2nd part; sim. Re’s ‘propre aux
Prophètes’ without further comment. With Ge, the publ. tr. assigns the 2nd member
to √san ‘gain, win’, hence ‘winning seers’. If we maintain that analysis, the sense
might be compared to ṛṣi-sáh- in IX.76.4, which means ‘vanquishing (the other)
seers’, in poetic competition or the like. However, given the seṭ nature of √san and
the persistent short vowel (-)san- in most of its nominal forms, this analysis is not
entirely persuasive, esp. since the semantics are not absolutely compelling. AiG
II.2.926 posits (without conviction) a suffix -sāna-, but also suggests a connection to
the (pseudo-)part. -asāna- type (which is treated at AiG II.2.236-37), but it doesn’t
fit the general profile of this group (on which see comm. ad IV.3.6). Perhaps -sānais better connected to √sā ‘bind’; cf. the noun viṣā́na- V.44.11, which has the merit
of existing and whose long vowel is predictable. Hence ‘binding seers’ or ‘having the
binding of seers’ - that is, holding them fast, commanding their loyalty or attention,
as in pāda c. But in the absence of any further information, accentual, contextual, or
formulaic, we can’t get much further.
### 05-06
As noted above, these two vss. have parallel structures in the crucial 2nd
pāda. Although Ge notes this, his tr. does not reflect the parallelism of the two
genitive phrases with pres. part. satáḥ, nor does Re’s. Although taking account of
this somewhat complicates my tr., I think it must be done. Vs. 6 is the clearer one:
the pres. part. to √as is, as often, concessive: although Soma stays fixed, his beacons
(continue) to circle. A concessive sense is harder to excavate from vs. 5 - hence the
somewhat awk. rendering in the publ. tr. - but I think it is rhetorically called for. In
both vss. the GEN satáḥ phrase specifies the spatial position of Soma. In 6 he is fixed;
he has completed his journey to the soma vessels, as pāda d tells us. Vs. 5 is
chronologically earlier than 6: Soma is advancing (prabhú-) on his journey, which is
still in progress, as he “reaches through” vyānaśí- the domains, i.e., the filter and
subsequent locations. Cf., for prabhú-, nearby IX.83.1 pávitraṃ te vítatam …,
prabhúḥ … páry eṣi víśvátaḥ “ The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred
formulation. Advancing, you circle around it on all sides.” The lexeme pári √i in
soma contexts describes the movement of the soma juices around the filter. I think
the point of both our vss., 5 and 6, is that, though Soma has moved on beyond the
filter (5) and finally settled in the vessels (6), his beacons continue to circle around
the filter. I am not entirely sure what that means in physical terms - perhaps the
residual soma, caught as drops in the wool of the filter and glinting as the final drops
drip down? or are the beacons pieces of ritual equipment? I think the former is more
likely, given the reoccurence of sg. ketú- in vs. 7 referring to Soma himself, but I am
tolerably certain that the pl. in 5-6 distinguishes the vanguard of the soma, Soma
proper, from the rest of the liquid that follows.

### 05
As should be clear from the immed. preceding discussion, as elsewhere in
IX I take dhā́māni ‘domains’ as referring to the filter and subsequent locales that the
soma traverses, not, with Ge, Soma’s forms. (What Re means by “structures” is
uninterpretable to me.) The physical locations on the ritual ground can also be
viewed as the cosmic domains over which Soma has dominion - hence the
hyperbolic statement in d, attributing universal rule to Soma.
On víśvasya bhúvanasya rājasi, see the identical phrase in 28b.
vyānaśí- belongs with the redupl. -í-stem type of cakrí-, etc. (cf. weak pf. vyā̀naś- to √(n)aś); see AiG II.2.292. It can therefore govern the acc., like other
instances of this formation type, and we can easily supply dhā́māni from pāda a,
strongly supported by the parallel later in the hymn: IX.86.15 yó asya dhā́ma
prathamáṃ vyānaśe “who has reached through his first domain,” with the medial
perfect to ví √(n)aś.

### 06
The referent changes from 2nd ps. (vs. 5) to 3rd (vs. 6), although this is not
clear until the 3rd sg. verbs in the 2nd hemistich.
“On both sides” (ubhayátaḥ) probably reflects the double reference just noted:
the ritual and the cosmic, or the earthly and the heavenly. See Ge n. 6ab.
I read yádī as yád ī (with enclitic prn.), since “if” does not work well here.
### 07-09
The beginning and end of this tṛca echo the preceding one: ketúḥ in 7a
picks up the pl. ketávaḥ in 5-6, and the end of vs. 9, kaláśeṣu sīdati, is identical to the
end of 6. The tṛca traces a trajectory from the ritual journey—the filter and the cask
in 7—to a cosmic one, with Soma as king (8a) traversing first earthly natural features
(seas, rivers, streams, waves 8ab) and then bridging the distance between earth and
heaven (8d, 9ab), ending back on the ritual ground (9d). Of course the equivalence of
the ritual and cosmic features is always in the foreground, as when in 8c he mounts
the sheep’s back (=the filter), which is immediately (8d) then identified as “the navel
of the earth” (nā́bhā pṛthivyā́ḥ), with the same word for ‘back’ (sā́nu) used in 8c for
the filter and in 9a for heaven.

### 09
The rel. cl. of b lacks a verb. I think that whatever is supplied must be able
to be construed with dhármabhiḥ “according to (his) ordinances.” My ‘abide’ is a
slight elaboration on Ge’s ‘sind’: “durch dessen Bestimmungen Himmel und Erde
sind,” which I think is fundamentally correct. This is another hyperbolic statement of
Soma’s cosmic power. Re’s “lui à qui (appartiennent) le ciel et la terre avec les
choses-à-maintenir” separates yásya from dhármabhiḥ and finds little work for the
instr. pl. to do. The two instances of dhármabhiḥ (here and 5c) should be more or less
in harmony.
### 10-12
Following a pattern we’ve met earlier, the first vs. of the new tṛca
echoes the previous one. In particular, the beginning of 10a jyótir yajñásya pavate is
almost identical to 7a yajñásya ketúr pavate, with ketú- = jyótis- semantically and the
order of the first two elements flipped. As for intra-tṛca connections, 10b #pitā́
devā́nām is picked up by 11b #pátir diváḥ. There is also a fair amount of repetition of
vocabulary and even phraseology from earlier in the hymn (e.g., 6cd … mṛjyáte
háriḥ … kaláśeṣu sīdati and 11cd háriḥ … sádaneṣu sīdati, marmṛjānáḥ), but most of
this involves material so ubiquitous in soma discourse that it doesn’t mean much.

### 10  
Ge notes the parallels between our vs. and IX.75.2:
IX.75.2a. … pavate mádhu priyám, …
 2cd dádhāti putráḥ pitrór apīcyàm, nā́ma …
IX.86.10a … pavate mádhu priyám, …
 .10c dádhāti rátnaṃ svadháyor apīcyàm
But he doesn’t seem to take the parallelism too seriously. In particular, though both
75.2c and 86.10c have a dual gen./loc. to be construed with a VP in which the subject
deposits / establishes a secret X [name in 75.2, treasure in 86.10], Ge takes the dual
as loc. in 75.2 (where there’s a parallel loc. sg. rocané), but gen. here (“Er bringt das
verborgene Kleinod der beiden Eigenmächte”)(sim. Re), with a somewhat forced
interpr. of dádhāti as ‘bringt’. Since the dual seems to have the same referent in both
passages, Heaven and Earth (so both Ge and Re), and the passages are otherwise so
similar, it seems to me very likely that they are structured in the same way. I
therefore take svadháyoḥ as loc.
It’s worth noting that this is the only du. form of the stem svadhā́-

### 11  
I do not know why the seats are identified as those of Mitra. I doubt that
Lü is correct that it is only because Mitra’s seat is in highest heaven (210), much less
that Mitra is at this stage in Vedic being identified with the sun (605).

### 12  
The vs. is structured by three pāda-initial forms of ágre + GEN, reinforced
by agriyáḥ in b.
### 13-15
This tṛca is characterized by increasingly larger claims for Soma’s
cosmic reach. It has fewer connections to previous tṛcas, save for the echo in 15b
dhā́ma prathamám vyānaśe of 5a and c, on which see comm. there.

### 13  
Ge identifies (n. 13a) and tr. matávān as a real past active participle
(“Nachdem er sich bedacht hatte …”)(sim. Lü 243). This seems highly unlikely to
me; Whitney’s statement (Gr. §960) should be noted: “Derivative words of this
formation [=-távant- sj] are found in RV., but without anything like a participial
value. The AV. has a single example … In the Brāhmaṇas also it is hardly met with.”
See also Re’s n. The fact that the base, matá-, is not found independently as a ppl. in
the RV, but only once (besides here) in the cmpd. matavacas- (voc., so unaccented,
I.46.5), makes the building of a past active part. to it even less likely. Instead -vantmust have its usual possessive sense and in context mean ‘accompanied by thoughts’
(like marútvant-), referring to the praises given to Soma at the ritual. These act as a
spur to set the soma in motion, hence the following simile.
The 2nd hemistich opens with a form of the 2nd sg prn., táva, followed at
intervals by two vocc., kave at the end of c and indra in d, followed immediately by
vs.-final te. It only becomes clear in d, with the 3rd ps. phrase pavate sómaḥ, that the
2nd ps. cannot be Soma, as it was earlier in the hymn (vss. 1-3, 4-5). The kave is a
bit of a red herring, since it could, and often does, refer to Soma, and though Indra is
sometimes so designated, other gods are far more commonly so called. The voc.
indra at the end settles the matter, but our poet seems to tease us with other
possibilities.
The image of Soma purifying himself “between the two world-halves” of
course reflects the cosmic reach of the Soma, but it may also have a narrower ritual
application. In IX.98.9 Ge suggests that the world-halves there are the jaws of the
soma-press, which would fit nicely here. See also IX.75.4, where the world-halves
are called the mothers of Soma.

### 14  
I would now tr. the pf. part. jajñānáḥ with past value, “once having been
born.”
The standard tr. (and incl. Ober II.76; Lowe, Part. 158) take svár as nom. with
the pf. part.: “having been born as the sun.” This is of course quite possible. But I
would expect a goal with abhí √kram and therefore take svàr as acc. in that function
(see also Scar 330).
I take nábhasā as instr. of extent of space, rather than accompaniment (Ge,
Lowe) or, even less likely, agent (Re “s’est élancé par la nuée,” despite the absence
of any verbal form that could be interpr. as passive).
The identify of the “age-old father” isn’t clear, and various candidates have
been suggested: Sāy.: Indra; Ge (n. 14d): Parjanya or Heaven; Re: Heaven. I’m
generally inclined towards Heaven, though of course bringing Heaven here is not
physcially possible.

### 15  
The gen. asya of pāda a could depend instead on viśé - or indeed on both
viśé and śárma. Since I don’t know what ‘clan’ is in question, it is hard to determine
if it belongs to Soma.
On dhā́ma … vyānaśe, see comm. ad vs. 5. I do not think, with Ge, that the
dhā́man- refers to the first “form” of soma in the phases of soma-preparation.
In d note the play in the phrase sáṃ yāti saṃyátaḥ, which belong to different
roots (√yā and √yat respectively). The latter has been rendered in quite different
ways: Ge: “… gelangt er zu allen Stufenfolgen”; Re “il parcourt toutes les
confluences”; Lü (702) “… geht er zu allen Treffpunkten”; Scar (404) Nomen act.
‘feste Aufstellung’. But saṃyát- is generally an adj., usually in the pl. of liquids
(V.34.9 ā́paḥ saṃyátaḥ, VIII.100.9); esp. pertinent are two passages in our own
hymn: vs. 18 in the next tṛca saṃyátam pipyúṣīm íṣam “continuous, swelling
refreshment” and, by implication, in vs. 47 dhā́rāḥ … saṃyátaḥ “continuous
streams.” On the basis of these passages, I supply “streams” here as well. See, e.g.,
vs. 8.
### 16-18
The first two vss. of this tṛca begin with prá with a verb of motion, but
otherwise there is little that unifies the tṛca. Nor is there much that connects with the
rest of the hymn, save for 16a … ayāsīt … índrasya niṣkṛtám / 7b=32d … úpa yāti
niṣkṛtám and the repetition of saṃyát- in 18a (cf. 15d and disc. there).

### 16  
Pāda b strikes me as the quotation of a well-known general truth or
proverb, providing the basis for the particular action of pāda a: Soma cannot let Indra
down, because (of the old saw) “a comrade …” It’s also worth noting that the other
occurrence of saṃgír- (X.89.9) is also the obj. of prá √mī. Re also adduces IV.25.7
ná … sakhyám índraḥ … sáṃ gṛṇīte “Indra does not agree to companionship (with
…).”

### 17  
The publ. tr. does not make it clear that “your” is pl. (enclitic vaḥ) and
must refer to the poet/officiants.
What is striking stylistically in this vs. is the sequence of three heavy nom. pl.
fem. -yu-adjectives: mandrayúvo vipanyúvaḥ, panasyúvaḥ, the latter two derived
from the same root. Though morphologically parallel, they are somewhat
disharmonious: mandrayú- is a hapax, vipanyú- is reasonably well attested and
generally modifies the human officiants (gods a few times), while the rather fewer
occurrences of panasyú- (and the related verb panasyá-) refer to gods. Hence the
“thoughts” of our vs. seem both to “express admiration,” as humans do to gods, and
“invite/require admiration,” as gods do from humans - so the thoughts’ purposes
seem to be various, both to praise the gods and be admired for their fine crafting?
I’m not exactly sure what saṃvásana- (a hapax), lit. ‘dwelling together, joint
dwelling’ is expressing here. Ge seems similarly puzzled, tr. “in den Sitzungen” with
a question mark; Re’s “dans les sessions-rituelles” is more definite and appealing,
but I don’t see where he gets it. Perhaps it doesn’t indicate that the thoughts are
dwelling with each other but that they, as a group, are dwelling with something/-one
else - perhaps the soma, perhaps the milk and other non-verbal parts of the ritual
machinery?

### 18  
Note the functional contrast between ā́… pavasva and adjacent
pávamānaḥ.
### 19-21
No obvious signs of unity. The instr. manīṣíbhiḥ is found at the end of
19 and immediately afterwards at the beginning of 20. The dawn(s) and the rivers are
found in both 19 and 21, but not in mutually reinforcing ways. As for external
connections, the “partnership” (sakhyá-) of Indra and Vāyu in 20 is reminiscent of
the companions/partners (implicitly Soma and Indra) in 16b. There are various
lexical echoes (e.g., vicakṣaṇáḥ 19a = 11b), but the limited vocab. of the Soma
hymns makes this unremarkable.

### 19  
“Bull of the thoughts” (vṛ́ṣā matīnā́m) is a slightly odd expression, but it
fits the pattern of IX.76.4 pitā́matīnā́m, 96.5 janitā́matīnā́m, 103.4 netā́matīnā́m,
though without obvious agentive content here —although Ge interpr. ‘bull’ as
‘Befruchter’.
The three genitives with pratarītā́by all the standard accounts (incl. the publ.
tr., also Ober II.53) consist of two temporal expressions (day, dawn) and a spatial
one (heaven). It is not clear to me what “lengthening/extending heaven” would
involve, and so, though gen./abl. diváḥ is almost always ‘heaven’ rather than ‘day’, I
now wonder if it here refers to ‘day’. Other passages containing both ‘day’ words
include III.56.6 trír ā́diváḥ savitar vā́ryāṇi, divé-diva ā́suva trír no áhnaḥ “Three
times a day, every day, o Savitar, impel valuables to us, three times daily”; X.7.4
dyúbhiḥ … áhabhiḥ; X.12.4 áhā yád dyā́vaḥ … áyan — and, interestingly enough,
two expressions in this very hymn, vss. 41 and 42, on which see further ad locc. The
question is what, if anything, is the semantic distinction between the two ‘day’ words
div- / dyu- and áhar / áhan-. In principle “daytime” (versus night time) could be
distinguished from the 24-hour day. Which, then, would be which? Assuming that
PIE *d ie̯ u-̯ (and its descendents) referred esp. to the bright sky, we might expect the
‘day’ occurrences of div- / dyu- to refer to the bright day, i.e., day versus night,
leaving áhar for the 24-hour day. And the numerous exx. of náktam (…) divā́(and
reverse order) “by night and by day” (I.24.10, 12, 34.2, 98.2, etc., etc.) seem to bear
out this prediction. We also find div- / dyu- contrasted with other words for ‘night’:
e.g., in the instr. pl. dyúbhir áktúbhiḥ (I.34.8, 112.25, III.31.16), and in other case/no.
pairs I.116.24 dáśa rā́trīḥ … náva dyū́n, VI.49.10 rudráṃ dívā vardháyā rudrám
aktaú. However, áhar is also commonly found in these contexts. Cf. the cmpd.
ahorātrá- ‘day and night’ and expressions like rā́tryā áhnaḥ (X.129.2), tísraḥ kṣápas
trír áhā (I.116.4), vy àktū́n … vy áhāni (V.54.4), rā́trībhiḥ … áhabhiḥ (X.10.9),
áhobhiḥ… aktúbhiḥ (X.14.9), aktúbhyaḥ … áhabhyaḥ (X.89.11). Also passages in
which light is put into or created for áhar / áhan- — e.g., IX.92.5 jyótir yád áhne
ákṛṇot. An esp. telling example is X.68.11 rā́tryāṃ támo dadhur jyótir áhan “They
put darkness in the night (and) light in the day.” I therefore find myself at something
of an impasse, since both words are used contrastively with ‘night’, and in a passage
containing both ‘day’ words assigning one sense to the one and the other to the other
seems arbitrary. In any case, I now do think that diváḥ means ‘day’ here, and would
substitute the tr. “… the lengthener of the day, of dawn, of the daytime” (having
made the arbitrary choice).
On krāṇā́see comm. ad I.58.3. In addition to the adv. sense (‘successfully,
effectively’) discussed there, this old instr. can be used with true instr. value: ‘by the
action’, as here. In his 1903 art. (cited ad I.58.3) Old (p. 35=Kl Schr. 1113) identifies
krāṇā́here as a neut. pl., not instr. sg.: “die Werke der Ströme, die Kufen hat er
brüllen gemacht.” But by the time of the Noten he instead takes it as instr.: “durch
das Tun der Flüsse.” This is in fact the standard interpr. of krāṇā́síndhūnām here: Ge
“Unter Mitwirkung der Ströme”; Re “Par l’action des fleuves”; Lü (254) = Ge, but
with (?) inserted after “Mitwirkung.” But this pāda is regularly compared by these
very same scholars with IX.102.1 krāṇā́śíśur mahī́nām. And it is generally agreed
that mahī́nām in that pāda refers also to the rivers. But there is a split about where to
construe this gen. Ge (and perhaps by implication Old) follows the pattern of our
passage: “Unter Mitwirkung der grossen (Ströme),” but Lü argues (239, 242), rather
persuasively, that mahī́nām belongs rather with śíśuḥ, as “child of the great (rivers),”
in part on the basis of síndhumātar- (IX.61.7) ‘whose mothers are the rivers.” He is
followed by Re. In the interpr. of the two passages only Ge is consistent, in taking
the gen. with krāṇā́in both cases. Lü, Re, and the publ. tr. all construe the gen.
differently in the two places. I now think this is wrong and a consistent interpr.
should be made, but I make the opposite choice to Ge’s. In the passage here I would
supply ‘child’ as headnoun for síndhūnām and change the tr. to “Through his action,
(the child) of the rivers …” There are several reasons for my change of heart besides
a desire for consistency. For one thing krāṇā́is never elsewhere construed with a
gen. For another, Soma is otherwise the sole subj. of ávīvaśat and doesn’t need any
assistance in this action.

### 20  
Ge interpr. pavate as a passive, with manīṣíbhiḥ as agent (“Von den
Verständigen wird der allerste Seher geläutert”), but pávate is so insistently reflexive
in the Soma maṇḍala that I strongly resist a passive here. Re’s tr. is like mine, though
he doesn’t comment.
Trita is the ur-Soma presser. See disc. ad IX.37.4. Here, as Ge (n. 20c)
suggests, Soma re-creates him for the current pressing, to ensure that Indra and Vāyu
will get their soma.

### 21  
The first three pādas of this vs. begin ayám ‘this one here’.
The thrice seven cows here are also found in IX.70.1, as Ge (n. 21c) points
out. See the seven cows in vs. 25.
### 22-24
The tṛca seems to be characterized by augmented imperfects, though
three of the five could be injunctives instead: ā́rohayaḥ [maybe] 22d, abhavaḥ 23c,
avṛṇoḥ [maybe] 23d, amadan 24b, ā́bharat [maybe] 24c. It is also characterized by
mythic allusions, esp. the Vala myth and the opening of the cowpen for the Aṅgirases
(23d) and the stealing of soma from heaven (24c), as well as the cosmogonic act of
raising the sun into heaven (22d). Both this latter deed and the opening of the Vala
cave are deeds usually attributed to Indra.
As for phraseology, in 22c and 23b the soma is “in the belly of Indra”
(índrasya jaṭháre(ṣu) - sg. in 22c, pl. in 23b); pavítra ā́is found in both 22b and 23a.
With regard to external connections, 22d nṛ́bhir yatáḥ is also found in 20b, and 23b
índrasya jaṭháreṣv āviśán echoes 19d índrasya hā́rdy āviśán, with a different body
part.
It may also be that 22 continues the theme of 21: in 21a Soma made the dawns
shine forth (ví rocayat), while in 22d he made the sun mount in heaven (sū́ryam
ā́rohayo diví). The two verbs are not only identical in formation (both -áyatransitives) but phonologically similar.

### 22  
Although the Pp. analyzes ā́rohayaḥ as containing an augment (ā́/
arohayaḥ), it could equally well have an injunc.: ā́/ rohayaḥ. The latter would fit
better with the injunc. ví rocayat in 21a, just disc.; the former with the other
augmented forms of this tṛca.

### 23  
The augmented impf. abhavaḥ is somewhat surprising in this context,
because, at least in the publ. tr., it seems to refer to the recent past, rather than to the
mythic past of the following (a)vṛṇoḥ. Perhaps, however, it opens the telling of the
Vala myth continued in d (and possibly 24ab; see below).
The augment in (a)vṛṇoḥ is quite insecure: the Pp restores it, but it is not
found in the Saṃhitā text and is metrically de trop.

### 24  
Both hemistichs open with a distracted 2nd sg. acc. pronoun (t
u
vā́m). The
accusative of this pronoun is, of course, historically monosyllabic, though distraction
is not uncommon in the RV. Here the distraction may have resulted from matching
the distracted nominative sg. form that opened the 2nd hemistich of the previous vs.,
23c.
The impf. amadan in b is wrongly tr. as a present in the publ. tr.: correct to
“did … applaud.” This may continue the account of the Vala myth, with the “very
attentive poets” being the Aṅgirases themselves. It seems unlikely that it is the first
action of the soma-stealing myth found in c.
Once again the Pp. analyzes ā́/ abharat, but the sequence could instead be ā́/
bharat with an injunc.
### 25-27
Cows (that is, the milk-mixture) are esp. prominent in this tṛca: there
are seven in 25b (recalling the “thrice seven” that produced the milk-mixture in 21c),
here called dhenávaḥ, with gā́ḥ in 26c and góbhiḥ in 27c. Other miscellaneous
animals: the sheep’s fleece (ávye … vā́re 25a), buffaloes (mahiṣā́ḥ 26d), a steed
(átyaḥ 26d), as well as the tawny one (hárim 25b, 27b), if that is specifically a tawny
horse or, as in 31b (vṛ́ṣā … háriḥ), a tawny bull.
25b and 27b both open háriṃ navante, each followed by a diff. preverb to be
construed with the verb (abhí, áva). In 27a asaścátaḥ recalls 18c ásaścuṣī.

### 26  
The two pres. participles to √kṛ, act. kṛṇván (b) and med. kṛṇvānáḥ (c),
provide almost a textbook example of the functional distribution of voices: in b Soma
makes X (into) Y for someone else (dat. yájyave), while in c he makes X (into) his
own Y.

### 27  
On the likely pun on abhiśríyaḥ, see Ge (n. 27ab), also Scar 547-48.
It is not entirely clear what “the third back” (tṛtī́ye pṛṣṭhé) refers to, but most
likely the highest (third) realm of heaven. Cf., for the back of heaven in general,
divás pṛṣṭhé in IX.66.5.
### 28-30
As noted in the publ. intro., this tṛca shows a high degree of unity. To
start with, every pāda but 2 (of 12), begins with a form of the 2nd sg. prn.: mostly
nom. t
u
vám (28b, d, 29a, c, 30a) but also gen, táva (28a, 29b, d), with the final
hemistich breaking the pattern with a single acc. t
u
vā́m (distracted; see comm. ad vs.
24 above) in c and a single dat. túbhya in d. Only 28c and 30b fail to open with such
a form (and 28c has the enclitic te later in the pāda). In addition, all 3 vss. contain the
voc. pavamāna (28c, 29d, 30b), and all three also have forms of víśva- 28b, d, 29a,
30d). Note also that víśvasya bhúvanasya in the first vs. (28b) is echoed by víśvā
bhúvanāni in the last (30d), and that vídharmaṇi (29b) is taken up by better specified
rájaso vídharmaṇi (30a); cf. also távemā́h (28a, 29b) varied by túbhyemā́ḥ (30d).
In terms of contents, the tṛca insistently asserts Soma’s universal rule over all
cosmic elements.

### 28  
Ge and Re (also Ober II.43) construe táva with rétasaḥ (e.g., Ge “Von
deinem himmlischen Samen sind diese Geschöpfe”). I am reluctant to do so because
of the parallelism of távemā́ḥ (/ túbhyemā́ḥ) just noted: all three expressions should
be rendered in the same general way. In addition Ge’s tr. essentially assumes rétasaḥ
is abl., but its companion adj. divyásya is stubbornly gen. I would therefore stick to
my tr., though slightly modified for clarity to “Yours are these offspring of (your)
heavenly semen.”
For … víśvasya bhúvanasya rājasi, see 5d, which is identical, and 36d …
víśvasya bhúvanasya rājáse, in an acc. + inf. phrase.
Pāda c is essentially a restatement of b.
Since dhāma-dhā́- is an etymological figure, I have rendered it as one, rather
than ‘establisher of domains’, vel sim.

### 29  
The cmpd. viśva-víd- is ambiguous here. Ge and Re both tr. as ‘allknowing’, and that is favored by the context, since it is immediately followed by the
voc. kave (‘sage poet’). But the cmpd recurs in the very similar pāda, 39c tváṃ suvī́ro
asi soma viśvavít, and that vs. contains three similarly formed cmpds that surely
belong to √vid ‘find’: IX.86.39a govít … vasuvíd dhiraṇyavít. There the context
favors ‘all-finding’. (Scar treats the two roots √vid together [489], so he is not forced
to distinguish.) I suggest, as usual, that it’s a pun.

### 30  
On the expression pavítre rájaso vídharmaṇi and its more succinct variants
see comm. ad IX.64.9.
### 31-33
After the tight structure of the preceding tṛca, we have returned to the
lax stringing together of soma tropes. There is a lot of noise-making in 31 (b
cakradat, c vāvaśānā́anūṣata), which is slightly echoed in 33 (b kánikradat).
Otherwise I see nothing particularly unifying.
As for external connections, GEN niṣkṛtám √yā in 32d is found also in 7b and
16a, and of course much of the soma lexicon is repeated elsewhere.

### 32  
Although the standard interpr. of yáthā vidé here makes Soma subj. of the
verb (e.g., Ge “wie er es versteht”), pāda-final yáthā vidé is a common tag (I.127.4,
132.2, etc.) with a passive reading of the verb: “as is known, in the way that is
known.”
The “directives of truth” (ṛtásya praśíṣaḥ) are convincingly identified as the
hymns by Lü (469-70), as the adj. návīyas-, a standard descriptor of hymns in the
fem., suggests.
I assume that the “threefold thread” (tántum … trivṛtám) refers to the three
soma pressings.
### 34-36
Nothing much in the way of internal unity or external connection,
beyond the obvious soma themes.

### 34  
The publ. tr. does not make sufficiently clear (or clear at all) that
pávamāna is a voc. Better tr. “Self-purifying one, as a great flood you run …”
With Ge and Re I take máhy árṇaḥ “great flood” as a nom., coreferential with
the 2nd sg. subj. The statement “you are the sea” (29a tváṃ samudró asi) gives
semantic support to the coreferential reading, though the two words (samudrá- and
árṇas-) are different. By contrast, Lü (204, 239; sim. Ober II.152 n. 111) takes it as
acc. of extent, indicating the space that the soma traverses, with the “filters” of b
parallel to it in a simile: “du durchläufst die grosse Flut, wie die strahlende Sonne die
wollenen Seihen.” This interpr. requires that the real filter (the sheep’s fleece) that
the real soma ordinarily traverses be part of the simile, expressing what the sun
crosses, while the metaphorical filter (“the great flood”) is part of the frame, where
the real soma is crossing it. This is either very clever poetics, with several levels of
metaphor below the surface simile - or an indication that his interpr. is incorrect. I’m
afraid that I incline towards the latter view.
The expression in c gábhasti-pūto nṛ́bhiḥ is somewhat curious, since it
essentially provides two agents, or agent-like elements, for the pūtá- ppl.: the 1st
cmpd member gábhasti- and the indep. instr. nṛ́bhiḥ. (Of course, the men are the
agents whose hands are the instruments.) Without the ‘hand’ (gábhasti-) we would
expect *nṛ̥́-pūta-, like nṛ́-dhūta- (1x), nṛ́-ṣūta- (1x)(which, oddly enough, both rhyme
with our putative form). Re has a slightly different interpr., but it has the same
configuration. His “pressé par les seigneurs à l’aide des pierres” construes nṛ́bhiḥ
with what follows, the instr. ádribhiḥ and the ppl. sutáḥ, with the two instr. filling the
agent and instrument slots respectively. Since nṛ́bhiḥ is stationed exactly in between
the two instrument+ppl. expressions, there’s no way to tell - though it seems to me
somewhat more elegant for nṛ́bhiḥ to double a cmpd. member rather than
morphologically doubling another instrument. Note that ádri-ṣuta- is also attested
(2x) and that the same ádribhiḥ sutáḥ as here is found in this hymn in 23a..
### 35
The accumulation of √mad derivatives is striking: mádvā mádyo mádaḥ. The
last, máda-, is of course extraordinarily common, and the 2nd mádya- reasonably
well established (13x). But madván- is found only twice.

### 36  
Who the seven sisters (bzw. mothers) are is a matter of dispute: Sāy.: the
streams or rivers, Ge: thoughts, Re (flg. Lü 246): celestial streams/rivers. No one
seems to cite the seven milk-cows (saptá dhenávaḥ) in vs. 25 of this same hymn, or
their multiplied number (thrice seven) in 21. But in this hymn “cows” seems the
mostly likely immediate referent, esp. given the image of maternal care, whatever
those cows may otherwise represent (beyond the milk-mixture).
On the expression in the last pāda, see similar phrases in vss. 5 and 28.
### 37-39
For the first time in this hymn (save for briefly in vs. 18), this tṛca
shows some interest in what Soma might do for us, particularly in the 2nd two vss.
Note in 38 first the enclitic naḥ and then the 1st pl. opt. syāma. The poet both asks
for benefits directly and by implication, in the cmpds with 2nd member -víd-
‘finding’: góvid-, vasuvíd-, híraṇyavíd-, viśvavíd- “cow-finding, goods-finding, goldfinding, all-finding” and the bahuvrīhi suvī́ra- ‘possessing good heroes’. If Soma
finds or possesses these things, he can distribute them to us. The connection between
vss. 38 and 39 is nicely signalled by the near identity of 38c and 39a:
38c … pavasva vásumad dhíraṇyavat
39a … pavasva vasuvíd dhiraṇyavít
where the suffix of possession (-mant-, -vant-) subtly gives way to the
phonologically similar root-noun -víd-, suggesting that Soma possesses those things,
which he can now find for us. The epithet nṛ-cákṣas- ‘having his gaze on men’,
found several times previously in this hymn (vss. 23, 36), seems finally to take on its
full lexical value in 38, where it is predicated of Soma (nṛcákṣā asi) and strengthened
by viśvátaḥ ‘on every side’, to express Soma’s interest in us and our welfare. The
reciprocal relationship between us and Soma is also expressed by the parallel pādas
38d and 39b, both containing bhúvaneṣu as the location of both us (38d) and Soma
(39b).

### 38  
I take the -mat and -vat forms adverbially.

### 39  
On viśvavíd- see comm. ad vs. 29. Ge takes it as ‘all-knowing’ here, but
the other -víd- cmpds in the vs. favor ‘all-finding’. Re, like me, ‘all-finding’ here,
though ‘all-knowing’ in 29.
### 40-42
The focus on our welfare found in the last tṛca is found here in vs. 41
but is otherwise muted.

### 40  
vanánā- is a hapax, though there seems to be general agreement that it
means something like ‘desire’, derived from the seṭ root √vani ‘love, hold dear’.
There is an Old Avestan hapax of the same shape (Y. 44.15) that seems unconnected,
in that, contextually, the standard tr. ‘victory’ seems correct, and it should therefore
be derived from aniṭ √van ‘win’. But Kellens-Pirart in their OA lexicon (1990)
equate it directly with our vanánā- and gloss it ‘charme’ - which makes no
contextual sense and can, I think, easily be dismissed. In any case it is easy to see
how our form came to be built. It is the object of the verb úd … atiṣṭhipat ‘made to
stand up / raised up’. The next vs., 41a, has a very similar VP, bhandánā úd iyarti,
where the verb is semantically equivalent to our verb and has the same preverb, and
the nominal object is a fem. acc. pl. -ánā- form, which provided the template for
vanánā-. Given this parallelism and given the fact that the phrase in vs. 41 has to do
with granting blessings to us, I think it likely that the desires Soma raised in 40a are
our own (so also Ge, Re), which he will fulfill in the next vs.
ví gāhate as in 8a; cf. also áti gāhate in 26a.
Soma is presumably “thousand-spiked” (sahásrabhṛṣṭi-) because of the knobs,
thorns, or similar extrusions on the plant.

### 41  
On the relation between the first hemistich and vs. 40 see immed. above.
The publ. tr. “… all blessings, consisting of offspring and easy to bear” is
awkward and hard to parse. It might be better as “… all blessings, consisting of
offspring - a light burden -,” with subhára- used in almost jocular fashion. It can
simultaneously also refer to “easy birth,” with ref. to prajā́vatīḥ.
The unusually formed (pseudo-)āmreḍita áhar-divi ‘every day, day upon day’
is esp. interesting in light of the discussion of the two ‘day’ words ad vs. 19 above. It
must be a substitute for the more orthodox āmreḍita áhar-ahar (6x) for metrical
reasons: the standard cmpd. is metrically awk. With three light syllables in a row, it
certainly won’t fit in any cadence and would be difficult anywhere in the vs. line but
where it’s always found, pāda-initial (which isn’t all that great either - openings with
light syllables in both 2 and 3, not to mention 1 and possibly 4, are quite irregular;
see Arnold pp 194-95). It is puzzling, however, that the well-attested (47x) (also
somewhat aberrantly formed) āmreḍita to the second ‘day’ stem here, namely divédive, was not used in our vs., since it would fit the cadence perfectly and is quite
common in Jagatī cadences. In any case, at least áhar-divi suggests that there’s no
clearcut difference of meaning or reference between áhar- and the forms of div-/dyuthat mean ‘day’.
In the 2nd hemistich, Soma is not asked directly for benefits, but rather urged
to intercede with Indra - to beg him for our sake - for offspring and wealth. This
displacement is made all the stranger by the use of a “future imperative,” yācatāt,
which properly should follow another impv. Perhaps the displacement in time that
such an impv. represents - that is, there should be an intervening impv. before it -
indirectly reflects the displacement in person - that is, Soma is the middleman,
intervening between us and Indra. I suppose it is bad form to ask Indra directly in a
hymn devoted to Soma.
There is further displacement here. The “sacred formulation bringing
offspring” (bráhma prajā́vat) that we want Soma to get Indra to give us is not a direct
request for Indra to bestow offspring on us, but rather for him to inspire in us a
formulation that we can then offer to him, which will, only then, result in offspring.
It’s a long and winding road to what we want!
The interpr. of the hapax bahuvr. áśva-pastya- is disputed. My tr. “consisting
of horses in the homestead” essentially follows Gr’s ‘Rosse im Stalle habend’,
though it would be more lit. as ‘having a homestead that has horses in it’ - a vájrabāhu- type cmpd. Ge’s tr. “an vielen Rossen” seems to evade the issue, but his
statement in n. 41c “wie später -śālin-” is more forthcoming: -śālin- means lit.
‘having a house/room’, but develops to ‘abounding in’. Nonetheless, I find it hard to
believe that a RVic poet would go to the trouble of using a fairly rare word as 2nd
member, only in order to bleach it of its particular meaning. Re’s “la richesse qui
réside dans les chevaux” (and Ober’s “dessen fester Wohnsitz Pferde sind” [I.537 n.
111]) employs an abstract sense of pastyà- to characterize where wealth’s dwelling
is: it resides in - that is, is founded on / consists of — horses. Whereas my interpr.
assumes a concrete homestead, which belongs to the speaker and/or his associates,
that is stuffed, as it were, with horses. The difference between the abstract and the
concrete interpr. is small but significant, and I continue to prefer the concrete one.

### 42  
This vs., too, contains the two ‘day’ words, gen. pl. áhnām, dependent on
ágre, and the adverbial instr. expression ánu dyúbhiḥ. See comm. ad vss. 19, 41.
I take prá … cetayate as a reflexive trans./caus. ‘makes oneself perceived’,
contrary to the intrans. interpr. in my -áya- book (p. 163).
As is generally recognized, nárā ca śáṃsam shows a species of tmesis, from
the cmpd nárāśáṃsa-.
### 43-45
This tṛca seems more artful than most of the other, with metaphor
layered upon metaphor (vss. 43, 45), varied by similes (vs. 44).

### 43  
The first hemistich is striking with its series of identical verbs in pāda a,
with pāda b ending with the same verb: añjáte vy àñjate sám añjate, … abhy àñjate.
The first pāda lacks a syllable (rest at 4); as Old suggests, the metrical irregularity is
most likely meant to call attention to the word play.
Ge, Re, Lü (239) take the various verbs as reflex., with Ge (n. 43ab) taking
the subj. as the soma-drinking singers and Re as the waters. But though mid. √añj is
probably more often reflex./pass. than trans., it can be the latter, and that makes more
sense here. Cf., e.g., IX.97.57 sám añjate rūpám “they jointly anoint his form,” and
recall the many times in this maṇḍala in which soma “is anointed,” using the true
passive ajyáte (-se) (often as a pun with ‘is driven’ to √aj). See especially in the next
tṛca of this hymn 47c góbhiḥ … samajyáse, in the same metrical position as sám
añjate here. I supply the default Soma as obj. throughout the first hemistich; he is
found as explicit (though metaphorical) obj. in the 2nd hemistich. As for the subj. of
all these verbs, I agree with Re that it is the waters.
The “ox flying in the burbling up of the river” of pāda c is an ex. of the layers
of metaphor just alluded to above: it compresses three different representations of
Soma into a single image.
I take the subj. of gṛbhṇate and referent of hiraṇya-pāvā́ḥ in d still to be the
waters, with āsu functioning as reflexive. Re explicitly changes his subj. here to “les
hommes.”

### 44  
Ge, Re, Ober (II.54) take ándhaḥ as nom., parallel to dhā́rā in the simile.
But insofar as it is possible to narrow the referent of this word, it is used of the stalk
of the soma (see comm. ad IV.1.19). I take it here as acc., construed with áti. This
pāda, like the following one, depicts the soma juice leaving behind the solid parts of
the plant, and áti ‘beyond’ is used in both pādas to express the material beyond
which the soma juice has gone.
The simile in d, átyo ná krīḷan, is also found in 26d.

### 45  
In a agre-gáḥ echoes ágre áhnām in 42a; in our vs. áhnām appears in the
following pāda, dependent on something else (vimā́naḥ), though Re supplies it with
agregáḥ as well.
bhúvaneṣv árpitaḥ also in 39b.
In d I construe rāyé with okyàḥ, although I cannot find any parallel usage. But
on its own, okyàḥ is hard to fit semantically into the vs.; cf. Ge’s “gern bleibend” and
Re’s “(ce dieu) domestique,” which seem like afterthoughts..
### 46-48
The hymn ends with a tṛca no more unified than most of those that
preceded it, repeating the same tropes oscillating between ritual and cosmic images.

### 46  
In pāda a skambhó diváḥ reminds us of 35d divó viṣṭambháḥ with a diff.
lexical real
On tridhā́tu- see comm. ad IX.70.8.
Pāda c aṃśúṃ rihanti matáyaḥ pánipnatam is identical to 31d, save for the
first word, which in 31 is śíśum.
In d yádi would be best read yád *ī, both for sense and for meter, since an
opening with light syllables in positions 3 and 4 before an early caesura is very rare
(see Arnold 194).
Ge tr. nirṇíjam … yayúḥ as “Staat machen” (make a show), based, he says (n.
46d), on śúbhaṃ yā. I see no reason to attenuate the sense of nirṇíj-. As Scar (284-
85) argues, this stem can be both a concrete noun ‘garment’ and an infin. ‘to array’.
The infinitival usages he cites are mostly the dat. nirṇíje (which, in all quoted cases, I
take as a noun) and he is uncertain about the usage of this acc. ex. But since the
analysis just proposed of yád *ī provides us with an acc. obj., infinitival usage seems
best here.

### 47  
Pāda b is awk. in English. The sense is that the streams of the soma being
purified go charging forward continuously, with ráṃhayaḥ ‘charges, speedy forward
movements’ subj. of yanti.

### 48  
The aggressively hostile command in pāda c comes as something of a
surprise in this otherwise ritually and cosmically focused hymn.
The last pāda is the Gṛtsamada refrain from Maṇḍala II. This tṛca is attributed
by the Anukramaṇī to Gṛtsamada, but perhaps only on the basis of the refrain.

## 87-97  
The section containing Triṣṭubh hymns

## 87-89  
These three hymns are attributed to Uśanas Kāvya, probably on the basis of
the mention of his name in 87.3.
## 087

### 01
In b Soma is urged to run for the prize (vā́jam); in c he is then compared to a
prize-winning horse (áśvam … vājínam), a nice ex. of how description shades into
simile. It is made somewhat more complex by the fact that the simile (probably)
surrounds the target ‘you’: áśvaṃ ná tvā vājínam, so that vājínam could technically
be part of the frame, not the simile (“… you, the prize-winner, like a horse”), though
in fact tvā is in modified Wackernagel’s position. Soma is directly called a vājín- in
4d.

### 02
This vs. contains two links to the preceding hymn, despite their difference in
meter: most of pāda c pitā́devā́nāṃ janitā́… is identical to IX.86.10b, with each
closing with a word that conforms to its cadential template; the first two words of d,
viṣṭambhó divó, are identical to IX.86.35d divó viṣṭambháḥ, but in opposite order,
with minimal metrical difference. (Our pāda is repeated in IX.89.6, while the order in
86.35 is repeated in IX.108.16.)

### 03
The first hemistich contains three resonant words in the realm of poet /
wordsmith / seer: ṛ́ṣir vípraḥ … kā́vyena, with kaví- represented by the vṛddhi deriv.
This deriv. is similar, but not identical to the patronymic kāvyá- associated with the
immed. preceding uśánā, and by its difference in accent and in case, it cleverly plays
on the full name Uśanā Kāvya. (On the tricky morphology of the name, see my 2007
“Vedic Uśanā Kāvya and Avestan Kauui Usan: On the Morphology of the Names,”
in Verba Docenti [Fs. Jasanoff].) As Ge suggests, the Anukramaṇī’s attribution of
this hymn to the legendary Uśanas Kāvya is no doubt based on this vs.
The Engl. tr. does not make clear that “of theirs” is fem. (āsām) and must
anticipate the cows (gónām) in the next pāda.

### 05
In pāda b the HvN text reads mahé vā́jāyām ṛ́tāya śrávāṃsi, with word
break after putative vā́jāyām. But it should instead read vā́jāyāmṛ́tāya without break
(as in both the devanāgarī text and the transliterated text of Aufrecht), to be analyzed,
with Pp., as vā́jāya / amṛ́tāya. Undoing the vowel contraction at the caesura in this
way produces too many syllables (12, with a Triṣṭubh cadence). Old is uncertain
whether to opt for that analysis or for contraction over the caesura, which seems to
be Arnold’s (not very clearly expressed) view (p. 192, §215 iii).
Given the importance of vā́ja- ‘prize’ (1a, 5b, 6d ) and vājín- ‘prizewinner’
(1c, 4d)) in this hymn, the tr. of the dat. phrase in pāda b should be corrected to “for
the great immortal prize.”
In keeping with my view that medial forms of the them. stem pávate are
always reflexive, not passive, the tr. should be corrected to “purifying themselves
through the filters” - esp. because of the contrastive undoubted passive pūyámānaḥ
in the next vs.

### 06
The gen. jánānām is best construed with puruhūtáḥ as (pseudo-)agent. See
the same phrase, though with accented voc. púruhūta, in IX.52.4, 64.27 - though in
the former passage I construe the gen. with another noun in the publ. tr. I now think
that may be wrong.
The accentuation of the athem. part. túñjāna- is puzzling; the other ex. of this
part. (IX.57.2) has the expected accent tuñjāná- as do finite forms like tuñjánti.
There also exists a single form of a thematic med. part. túñjamāna- (III.1.16) also
with unexpected accent on the root syllable. Gotō (1st Kl, 78) suggests this form is
“metrical” for the athem. form, but does not treat the accent.
The finale of d, abhí vā́jam arṣa, is identical to the end of 1b.

### 08
On the mixture of myth and ritual in this vs., see publ. intro. Given the fem.
subj. prn. sā́, the mythological allusion to Saramā would be available to the audience
on the basis of the phrase gā́viveda “found the cows”; cf. V.45.7 sarámā gā́
avindat, .8 sarámā vidat gā́ḥ -- though it must be admitted that gā́ḥ √vid has other
gods as subject elsewhere. See comm. ad V.29.3.
Notice that the pf. viveda returns here from 3c, which was also, if less clearly,
about the Vala myth.

### 09
The publ. tr. takes pāda c as a second complement of pári yāsi in pāda a,
parallel to rāśím … gónām. By contrast both Ge and Re take c as the obj. (or pseudoobj.) of śíkṣā in d: e.g., “Suche uns … viele grosse Labsale zu erwirken.” But the
lexicalized desid. stem śíkṣa- does not take an obj., but only a dative of benefit (see
comm. ad VI.31.4), and so that interpr. seems blocked to me. However, it may be an
independent nominal clause: “many are (your) lofty refreshments,” the interpr. I
would now favor. Scar’s (636-37) interpr. is similar, though he then sneaks c in as an
understood obj. of śíkṣā: “ Viel, gross sind die Labungen … verhilf [zu diesen]” or
“… verhilf uns [dazu],” which seems unnec.
All the standard interpr. (incl. the publ. tr.) take the last three words as a
separate clause, but this short phrase poses several problems. First, tā́ḥ is a nom.
(/acc.) plural fem. demonst., but the following word, the hapax root noun upaṣṭút, is
by all appearances singular. Several solutions have been proposed to this mismatch.
Ge simply says (n. 9d) that upaṣṭút at the end of the hymn represents pl. upaṣṭútaḥ,
which is not very satisfactory. He tr. “Dein sind diese Lobpreisungen.” Old has two
suggestions: 1) upaśṭút is adverbial: “in einer zu den stútaḥ gerichteten Bewegung,”
citing phrases like stutī́r úpa (I.84.2). But he gives no parallels for such adverbial
formation (maybe the likewise problematic dakṣiṇít?), and it is also hard to see how
this would work in context (“these are in the direction of your praise”??). 2) upastút
is an agent noun: Soma as praiser. But he rejects this even as he suggests it. Scar
(636-37) discusses previous suggestions and suggests further possibiities. Re’s
solution as embodied in his tr. “Ces (avantages sont) ta louange (même),” with an
equational sentence equating tā́ḥ with upaṣṭút, seems to me the best way to deal with
the number disharmony - though in his n. Re floats several other, less compelling
possibilities. The question then is what is the reference of tā́ḥ. I’m not sure what Re
means by “avantages.” I think the most likely referent is the fem. pl. in the
immediately preceding pāda: íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’, and Re’s n. gives what I consider
the clue to the interpr. of the whole in his citation of the cmpd. iṣa(ḥ)stút- in V.50.5
(though in fact he cites it in service of a different solution). In V.50.5 iṣa(ḥ)stúto
manāmahe I tr. “Let us conceive praise-songs as refreshment” (see comm. ad loc.).
Here I suggest that we are announcing our praise-song as Indra’s refreshments, the
counterpart to the refreshments he offers us. The publ. tr. does not convey this sense;
it should be changed to “These (refreshments) are (our) praise for you.”
The retroflexion in upaṣṭút- is extremely puzzling, esp. given the nonretroflexed úpastuta- (upastutá-), úpastuti-, upastútya-. AiG I.237 registers the form,
but simply says that sometimes -ṣ- in cmpds spreads beyond its proper domain,
which isn’t terribly helpful.
## 088
On the thematic structure of the hymn, see publ. intro. The similes that begin
the middle vss. 3-5 are all further defined by the syntactic structure GOD ná yó. In the
first two of these Soma is in the 2nd ps., but in the 3rd ps. in vs. 5.

### 01
The vs. is notable for the dense repetition of the 2nd ps. sg. prn., with five
exx. in the first three pādas.
The initial annunciatory ayám should probably be more clearly represented in
the tr.: “this soma here …”
For the metrically bad vavṛṣé see Kü (459) and comm. ad VI.4.7. As Kü
points out, we would expect this seṭ root to have a pre-C weak perf. stem *vavūr-,
which would fit the cadence here much better.
The publ. tr. renders mádāya yújyāya sómam as “the soma to be yoked for
exhilaration,” falsely giving the impression that dat. yújyāya modifies acc. sómam. I
now realize that the five occurrences of dat. yújyāya should be taken as nouns
expressing purpose, not as adjectives. Interestingly four of the five passages have as
main verb a form of √vṝ ‘choose’: VII.19.9 … vṛṇīṣva yújyāya …, VIII.4.15 prá …
vṛṇīmahe, yújyāya …, IX.66.18 vṛṇīmáhe yújyāya, and our … vavṛṣe, … yújyāya.
There thus appears to be a fixed syntagm X yújyāya √vṛ “choose/select X for yoking
(/for use),” and I would now tr. this passage “… the drop, the soma, which you have
chosen for yoking for exhilaration.” I would not construe it directly with the adjacent
dative mádāya, which is a separate expression of purpose.

### 02
The “yoking” theme of 1d is immediately taken up in 2a by the passive aor.
ayoji, with concrete sense at least in the simile.
On the unexpected short vowel in the hapax bhuri-ṣā́ṭ (for bhūri-), see the not
entirely satisfactory disc. by Scar (607).
náhus- must be a PN (see Mayr. PN); it is generally, but not exclusively,
found in the sg. The deriv. nahuṣyà- here is best interpr. in conjunction with nearby

### 02
kavyaíḥ... nahuṣyèbhiḥ, where it refers to poets. That interpr. would fit the
context here as well, since the Nahusian creatures are roaring at the soma on the
ritual ground.

### 03
Both Ge and Re take iṣtá- in the cmpd. iṣtá-yāman- as belonging to the root
√iṣ ‘send’ (e.g., “[d]er seine Fahrt beeilt” and see Ge’s n. 3a). But as Old (ZDMG 62
[1908] 473-74) points out, we should then expect *iṣitá-yāman-. (Like me, Old
attributes iṣṭá- here to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’, though his interpr. of the cmpd. differs from
mine.) The parallel passages with iṣṭáye in conjunction with √yā that Ge adduces in
his n. (and others he doesn’t cite) all belong, in my opinion, to ‘seek, desire’, not
‘send’.

### 04
In order to connect the comparison with Indra more clearly to the whole vs.,
I would now be inclined to tr. “Like Indra, who is the doer of great deeds, you are are
a stronghold-splitting smiter of obstacles,” though this now makes it less clear that
Soma is being compared to Indra also in his general capacity of doer of deeds. The
Sanskrit is more forgiving.
Pāda c is metrically defective; see esp. Old for disc. After suggesting, and
rejecting, various fixes, he considers the possibility that the pāda ended with hantā́,
which was redactionally eliminated by word haplology, since the next pāda begins
with hantā́. This would get us the proper syllable count, though, as Old notes, the
cadence would be bad, in that the antepenult would be heavy: … áhināmnāṃ
*hantā́#. Despite the problem of the cadence, this seems like the most attractive
solution, and I would now slightly alter the tr. to “Because, like Pedu's (horse) (you
are) *the smiter of those with serpents' names, you are the smiter of every Dasyu.”
On the serpent-smiting horse that the Aśvins gave Pedu, one of their clients,
see I.117.9, 188.9. Unfortunately this is all we know about the horse’s exploits.

### 05
Because the finite verb kṛṇute in b is unaccented, the rel. cl. must be
confined to pāda a, and this in turn means that sṛjyámānaḥ is a predicated pres.
participle. On the phrase in pāda b, see comm. ad IX.76.1.
The loc. váne must be read twice, in both simile and frame, with different
senses. Just as Agni/fire is set loose in the firewood, Soma is set loose in the wooden
cup.

### 06
The simile in b is somewhat odd. It is in the nom. pl., and its comparandum
should therefore be the soma juices (eté sómāḥ) in pāda a. But the sense of the simile,
“like heavenly buckets” (divyā́ná kóśāsaḥ), doesn’t fit the soma juices, but rather the
containers that hold the soma liquid. When the word kóśa- is used in ritual context, it
refers to a bucket or cask, towards which the soma is generally moving. I therefore
think that the comparison here is between the heavenly kóśa- and the sheep’s fleece
filters in pāda a, from which the soma drips as if from a cloud. The third word of the
simile, abhrá-varṣāḥ “possessing/holding the rain from clouds,” is the clue: soma is
regularly compared to rain (see, e.g., Ober II.40-42) esp. as it comes off the filter,
but here the comparison is to containers that are the source of rain. If this analysis is
correct, a syntactic problem arises: the simile should be acc. pl. matching vā́rāṇy
ávyā. I suggest that pāda b is parenthetical, that it does refer to the fleece filters, and
that the fact that the latter is neut. facilitated the switch to the nominative parenthesis.
The simile in c also has a slight twist, but is hardly as problematical as b. The
simile particle here is positioned late, assuming that the simile consists of samudráṃ
síndhavo ná nī́cīḥ “like rivers downward to the sea,” with samudrám corresponding
to kaláśān in d. However, because samudrá- is regularly used in soma hymns as a
(perhaps faded) metaphor for the waters that the soma enters, it may be that
samudrám is not felt to be part of the simile here. Cf. the parallel passage IX.64.17
vṛ́thā samudrám índavaḥ / ágman “The drops have come at will to the sea,” without
overt simile marking.

### 07
Ge and Re take the simile in c to be ā́po ná makṣū́(Ge: “rasch wie das
Wasser”), but makṣū́is an adverb, and so the simile would not be well formed. Re
deals with this problem by supplying a participle, “(agissant) promptement comme
les eaux.” I take makṣū́rather with the imperatival clause that follows: sumatír bhavā
naḥ. It is worth noting that makṣū́is almost always initial, and if we detach the simile
ā́po ná it could be so here as well.
So what quality of Soma’s is being compared to that of the waters? I take it to
be sahásrāpsāḥ, which opens pāda b, a word whose meaning is not transparent. Sāy.
glosses it pururūpaḥ ‘having many forms’, which is featureless enough to qualify
almost anything; Ge and Re follow him. But ápsas- means ‘breast’, and the cmpd
dīrghā́psas- (I.122.15), modifying a chariot, is generally rendered by ‘having a long
front’ - presumably a long forward projection. Our cmpd is rendered in EWA [s.v.
ápsas-] as ‘tausendfrontig’, but it is hard to conjure up a such a picture, particularly
with reference to soma, much less the waters. More promising is the context in which
the two independent forms of ápsas- (I.124.7, V.80.6) are found. (The third form
usually grouped here, found in VIII.45.5 girā́v ápsaḥ, is better segmented as girā́
vápsaḥ; see comm. ad loc.) Both passages have a female as subject, with the VP ní
riṇīte ápsaḥ “she lets her breast spill over,” describing a young woman (/Dawn)
displaying her charms. Here the breast is conceptually a liquid, and it seems to refer
to the pliant flesh, breast tissue, that spills out of her garment (a metaphor alive in
21st c. US). Starting from this picture of a liquid or liquified breast, I suggest that -
apsas- in our cmpd. refers to forward projections, esp. those that could appear in a
liquid - in short, ripples - which fits both the waters and the soma reasonably well.
The final simile of the vs., “like a sacrifice that conquers in battle” (pṛtanāṣā́ṇ
ná yajñáḥ) is unusual; the other 8 occurrences of the cmpd. pṛtanāṣā́h- qualify gods,
the qualities of gods, or a hero. However, the purport of the simile is not difficult to
construct: if we mortals perform the sacrifice correctly, it will attract and gratify the
gods, particularly Indra, who will provide the divine aid needed to prevail in battle.
Note that pṛtanāṣā́ṭ forms a ring with bhuriṣā́ṭ in 2a.
The retroflex initial of -ṣā́h- in this cmpd is the result of the assimilation of -sto the retroflex final in the nom. sg. -ṣā́ṭ; see Schindler (Rt. Nouns p. 48): 5 of the 9
forms of this cmpd are nom. sg. The retroflex is then spread throughout the paradigm
(acc. sg. 3x, gen. sg. 1x) and also into the deriv. pṛtanāṣā́ya- (III.37.1). On the
variable length of the root syllable in the oblique (-ṣā́ham 1x, -ṣáham, -as 3x), see
Scar (612-13).

### 08
This vs. is identical to I.91.3, also a Soma hymn. Unfortunately the publ. tr.
of the two vss. differ in pāda b. In I.91.3 I tr. “lofty and deep is your domain.” I now
think this should be harmonized with the tr. here “yours is his lofty, deep domain.”
The vs. attributes to Soma some of the salient characteristics of the three principal
Ādityas overtly in a, c, d, and it seems unlikely that one pāda would deviate from this
pattern. Both Varuṇa (I.123.8, IV.5.4) and (more often) Varuṇa + Mitra (I.152.4-5,
VII.61.4, X.10.6, X.89.8) possess dhā́man-. Here Soma’s dhā́man- can be identified
with that of just-mentioned Varuṇa (so the publ. tr.) or anticipate Mitra (pāda c) in
addition to Varuṇa.

### 01
The explicitly conjoined loc. phrase mātúr upásthe vána ā́ca “in the lap of
the mother and in the wood” is a bit puzzling; the ca implies that the two terms
belong to a natural or reasonably comprehensible constructed class. Ge (n. 1d)
suggests that “mother” refers to the earth, that is, (he further specifies) the surface of
the ground or the Vedi, while “wood” refers to the wooden cup. The latter is quite
likely, but I prefer Ge’s 2nd suggestion for the former - that “mother” here refers to
Aditi. The phrase upásthe áditeḥ is found 3x in IX (26.1, 71.5, 74.5) as well as 2x in
X. Although the exact referent is not entirely clear (see JPB, Ādityas 238-41), it
obviously refers to something on the ritual ground or to the ritual ground itself. Aditi
is of course the archetypal mother, so “of the mother” is an easy substitute “of Aditi”
in the phrase. The referent would be more specific that simply “of the earth,” which
could cover a lot of ground, as it were. Alternatively, if the mother = earth, this could
be a reference to the soma plant growing on the earth, but the ritual setting of the vs.
seems too insistent to allow that - though see 2d.

### 02
Pāda a could also mean “the king has donned his garment of the rivers,” but
IX.86.33, which also opens rā́jā síndhūnām, where the constituency is clear,
eliminates that possibility.
Note the chiastic #rā́jā … rájiṣṭhām# opening and closing the first hemistich.
Pāda d contains one of the paradoxes beloved of RVic bards. The identities of
the subj.s and obj.s of the two duhé are disputed. Old, for ex., thinks that Father
Heaven yields Soma in the first clause, while Soma yields Dawn in the second -
because pitúr jā́m in X.3.2 refers to Dawn. But this seems to take us too far afield:
the strict parallelism of the two mini-clauses—duhá īm pitā́/ duhá īm pitúr jā́m—
sketches a closed loop, and introducing an entity not already implicit in the discourse
seems unlikely. Ge’s interpr. (n. 2d) seems closer. The subj. of the first duhé is in my
opinion Heaven (dyaúṣ pitā́), with half of his name represented by pitā́and the other
found earlier in the simile divó ná vṛṣṭíḥ “like the rain from heaven.” This simile is
also the clue to the identity of the object: soma as rain. Then this soma/rain is the
subject of the 2nd duhé; it yields soma itself, in the form of the plant whose growth is
due to rain. This soma(plant) or the soma juice itself can also be reckoned as the
“offspring of his father,” namely of Heaven. This could be a reference to the
heavenly soma or simply to the soma juice assimilated to rain.

### 03
Gr, Ge, and Old (flg. Lanman, Noun Inflec. 414) take mádhvaḥ as a nom. pl.
Lanman and Gr (supplying drapsā́s or sim.) identify it as masc. (Old says nothing
further), while Ge seemingly as a fem., since he supplies “Milchkühe.” This gender
switch (and adjectival interpr.) is unnec.; in all cases of supposed masc. or fem. pl.
mádhvaḥ (see the list in Gr) the form can be interpr. as a gen. sg. to the neut. noun. In
our passage Re supplies a pl. subj. “streams” on which gen. mádhvaḥ depends: “(Les
coulées) de miel …” But I simply take it as a gen. of material, dependent on siṃhám
(“lion of honey”). The cmpd. mádhu-pṛṣṭha- ‘honey-backed’, lit. ‘having a back of
honey’ (in my interpr., contra Gr/Ge ‘having honey on his back’) supports my
interpr., and note that 6d contains a mádhvaḥ that is universally taken as gen.
As subj. of nasanta I supply cows or waters, probably the former, since they
appear in c and implicitly in d.
Ge seems to take ayā́sam with pátim rather than siṃhám, but given that the
adj. appears in the same pāda with the lion and given that another animal, the horse,
is described as ayā́sam in the next vs. (4a), “unbridled lion” seems more likely.

### 05
The cátasraḥ … ghṛtadúhaḥ … níṣattāḥ “four (fem.), yielding ghee as milk,
set down …” is highly reminiscent of IX.74.6 cátasro nā́bho níhitāḥ “four hidden
(lit., ‘put down, deposited’) (streams) bursting out …” See comm. ad loc., where, flg.
Ge, I suggest that “four” is a metaphorical reference to the four teats of a cow’s
udder. In our passage I don’t understand what “set down within the same support”
(samāné antár dharúṇe) refers to, unless it’s the placement of the teats in/on the
udder, which would be the dharúṇa- here. I also don’t know if there’s a secondary
reference to some piece or pieces of ritual equipment from which (pitcher with 4
spouts? 4 pitchers?) the mixing milk is poured, or if an actual cow is stationed
nearby. But here, as in IX.74.6, I think the immediate physical referent is to the
streams of milk that emerge from the teats, rather than their source(s).
The īm in c was omitted from the tr., where it presumably expresses the goal
of arṣanti. I would now tr. “They rush to him while being purified …” The parens.
around “him” in the next pāda can be erased, since that pāda also contains īm. The
concentration of forms of īm in this hymn should also be noted: 2d (2x), 4c, 5a, 5c,
5d.

### 06
The placement of utá in b is unexpected: it should not break up the NP
víśvāḥ … kṣitáyaḥ, which it is conjoining to the two nominal expressions in pāda a.
We would expect #*utá viśvāḥ kṣitáyaḥ. Perhaps the metrically distasteful initial two
light syllables prompted a flip. Klein (DGRV I.330-31) does not discuss this
placement in his treatment of the passage.
Pāda c ásat ta útso gṛṇaté niyútvān is somewhat puzzling, at least on the
literal level: “your wellspring will be possessed of a team for the singer.” Ge’s
rendering, “Dein Quell sei freigebig …,” is overly free, but it probably captures the
sense fairly closely. The semantic pathway is clearer in Re’s “Que ta source …
procure un attelage (de biens).” Cf. III.49.4 … vásubhir niyútvān “teamed with
goods.” Perhaps the tr. should be altered to “will provide teams (of goods) …”
Although niyútvant- is also found in the preceding hymn (IX.88.2), its use there
seems unconnected with this one.

### 07
The dat. índrāya opening pāda b echoes the dat. indriyā́ya, which closes the
preceding vs. (6d). It is also piquant that Soma adopts “Vṛtra-slayer” (vṛtrahán-),
Indra’s own epithet, when he acts on behalf of Indra.
The two aims of Soma’s purification abhí devávītim and índrāya “towards
pursuit of the gods” and “for Indra” are grammatically non-parallel.
## 090

### 01
The fut. part. saniṣyán in b potenially contrasts with the desid. part. síṣāsan
in 4c, though I have tr. them the same, and it is not clear whether they are expressing
truly different nuances. Nonetheless the future part. here could be tr. “being about to
win the prize.”

### 02
As Re also notes, the vs. is strongly marked by v-alliteration, esp. in c: …
vṛ́ṣaṇam vayodhā́m (a), … avāvaśanta vā́ṇīḥ (b), vánā vásāno váruṇo … (c), ví …
vā́ryāṇi (d). Note also the parallel root-noun cmpds vayo-dhā́m (a) and ratna-dhā́(ḥ)
(d), which latter also alliterates with dayate. For vayo-dhā́- see also vs. 6 below.

### 03
This vs. also shows alliteration, this time of sibilants, esp. in pādas a
(śū́ragrāmaḥ sárvavīraḥ sáhāvān) and d (áṣāḷhaḥ sāhvā́n pṛ́tanāsu śátrūn). It also
contains forms from three different roots meaning (roughly) ‘conquer, win’: √sah
(sáhāvān, áṣāḷhaḥ sāhvā́n), √ji (jétā), √san (sánitā).

### 04
ábhayāni in pāda a is the only neut. pl. to this stem. The idiom ábhayaṃ √kr̥
is quite common (and cf. abhayaṃ-kará- 1x). This idiom is formulaically connected
with “broad pastures”; see esp. VII.77.4 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim ábhayaṃ krdh̥ ī naḥ “create
broad pastureland and fearlessness for us” and nearby IX.78.5 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim
ábhayaṃ ca nas krdhi ̥ “Make wide pasturage and security for us.” I have supplied
‘places’ because of the association with pasturage.
The apparent transitive value of sáṃ cikradaḥ … vā́jān “you have roared
together prizes …” is anomalous, but hard to avoid. The idiom is similar to IX.64.3
… cakradaḥ …, sáṃ gā́ḥ … sa̐árvataḥ. See disc. ad loc. In that passage I found a
way to avoid a transitive reading in the publ. tr., but in the comm. consider a
transitive alternate. In our passage here the publ. tr. has a transitive reading, but it
would also be possible to make maháḥ … vā́jān another object of síṣāsan and tr.
“Striving to win the waters, also the dawns, the sun, the cows, and great prizes, you
have roared at them all together.” Note vā́jaṃ saniṣyán in 1b, and see the disc. ad vs.
1.

### 06
Note that the VP váyo dhāḥ “impart vitality” reprises the cmpd. vayodhā́m
in 2a in the same metrical position.
In d sūktā́ya was omitted from the tr., which should be changed to “impart
vitality to our well-spoken speech” or, perhaps less likely, “… to our hymn [sūktá],
to our speech.”
## 091

### 01
As discussed in several places in the comm. (see lexical list), the root √vañc
refers to a number of types of non-linear motion: undulate, curl, coil, etc., with these
meanings also distributed among the derivatives of the root, esp. vákvan-. Here my
tr. ‘billowing’ refers to the motion of the waves of the liquid soma; cf. X.148.5 ūrmír
ná … vákvāḥ “billowing like a wave.”
The publ. tr. doesn’t adequately represent the two divergent derivatives of
√man ‘think, bring to mind’, manótar- and manīṣī́. The latter, by itself, means
‘possessing inspired thought, inspired thinker’. The former, a rarer derivative,
means, in my view, someone who pays mental attention, a ‘minder’. See comm. ad
II.9.4. I would emend the tr. here to “the minder, the foremost inspired thinker with
his insight.” The point here, I think, is that Soma not only has inspired thoughts of
his own but pays attention to those of the human celebrants.
The ten sisters are, as usual, the fingers of the officiant.

### 02
The main clause of this vs., pādas ab, contains a predicated aor. part.,
svānáḥ, while the rel. cl., pādas cd, may contain a predicated intens. part.,
marmṛjānáḥ. However, given the prá opening c, it’s quite possible that we should
supply a verb of motion “(go) forth” as the main verb, with the part. simply a
modifier (“the drop [goes] forth, being groomed …”). Howvever, I prefer the publ.
tr., which does supply ‘go’ but as an oblique expression of purpose. Alternatively prá
may actually belong with the part. marmṛjānáḥ, as Gr takes it - though there’s only
one other possible ex. of prá √mṛj that I know of, at X.96.9.
On nahuṣyà- see also IX.88.2.

### 03
Both Ge and Re take īrte as transitive (‘set in motion’, e.g., “… met en
branle … le blanc lait”), but this medial stem is standardly intrans., and the milk here
can be, as so often in IX, the goal of Soma’s motion.
In c vaco-víd- could of course also mean ‘who finds speech’. See Scar (487),
who allows both senses for the stem and tr. the occurrence here as “der die Reden
findet.” In this ritual context there is little difference between ‘knowing speech’ and
‘finding speech’.
Pāda d cannot be separated from IX.10.5 sū́rā áṇvaṃ ví tanvate “the suns
stretch out across the fine (fleece).”

### 04
The syntax of the 2nd hemistich, esp. pāda d, is clotted and has been
variously interpreted. Ge takes the problematic upanāyám as obj. of vṛścá (as I do),
but considers the referents of yé … eṣām to be the vā́jān of b: “… der sie sich holt,
mögen sie nah (oder) fern sein.” Sāy.’s interpr. (see also Ge’s n. 4d) seems a more
sensible version of Ge’s: he glosses upanāyám as ‘master’ (svāminam) and takes the
plurals to refer to demons. Re seems to make upanāyám an appositive or parallel to
the pl. yé … eṣām, which he (semi-)configures as the obj.: “Fends … (les démons)
qui sont près (ou) loin, le chef de ces (démons).” All of them take ánti durā́t as a
constituent, “near (or) far.” But the contrastive expression “near (or) far” generally
matches cases (or adverbial equivalents thereof): ablatival ántitaḥ (...) dūrā́t
(II.27.13, etc.) or locatival ánti dūré (I.79.11, etc.; see esp. IX.19.7 dūré vā sató ánti
vā, IX.67.21 yád ánti yác ca dūraké). Our passage, by contrast, has locatival ánti and
abl. durā́t, and I therefore separate them and assign them to different syntactic units.
I take yé ánti as a minimalist rel. cl. “who (are) near,” while durā́t is construed with
upanāyám. I take the latter as meaning ‘leader’, like simplex nāyá- (2x: VI.24.10,
46.11), and the whole sequence durā́d upanāyám eṣām to mean lit. “leader of those
from afar” (rendered in English as a rel. cl. “… the one who lead …” for the sake of
intelligibility). Cf. for directional durā́t with √nī VII.33.2 dūrā́d índram anayann ā́
… “From a distance they led Indra here.” In other words, I interpret upanāyám as
the obj. of the impv. vṛścá at the beginning of c, and it is preceded by a brief nominal
rel. cl. yé ánti, whose referent in the main cl. is eṣām. Nominal rel. clauses seem to
be exempt from the prohibition on embedding that is evident for full relative clauses.
It may be so positioned to allow ánti to be adjacent to durā́t though belonging to
different clauses.
Lowe (Part. 289) claims that tujánt- is a Caland adj. meaning ‘eager’ rather
than a participle ‘thrusting’, but the passages, esp. this one and I.61.6 (with two
exx.), favor a more dynamic rendering, and in particular tujatā́vadhéna “with your
thrusting weapon” recalls IX.57.2 tuñjāná ā́yudhā “brandishing his weapons,” with
an undoubted participle. I don’t actually see what is gained by reclassifying these
forms as Caland adjectives.

### 05
It is not entirely clear what to supply as the referent for the rel. in c; Re ‘les
succès,” Ge the vā̋jān from 4b. Pāda c closely resembles IX.63.11 yó dūṇā́śo
vanuṣyatā́“which is difficult to attain by one who craves it,” with instr. vanuṣyatā́
matching our vanúṣā and a different lexicalization of the ‘difficult to obtain’ (duṣ-
√naś/sah) compd. The referent in that passage is rayí- ‘wealth’, and note also the
cmpd brhád ̥ -rayi- (only 1x) and the regular use of bṛhánt- as a modifier of rayí-
(e.g., nearby IX.97.21). I therefore supply a pl. form of rayí-, though Ge’s vā́jawould also work.
## 092

### 01
The injunc sarji would probably be better tr. “has been sent surging,” per
IH.
In c ā́pac chlókam indriyám seems illuminated by X.94.1 (one of the pressing
stone hymns) ślókaṃ ghóṣam bhárathéndrāya “you bear your signal-call, your cry to
Indra.” The ślóka- ‘signal call’ is the audible sign to Indra that soma is being
prepared for him; in our passage I assume that the noisy journey of the soma after the
filtering produces this ślóka-, just as the noise of the pressing stones in X.94.1 serves
that purpose.
The lexeme práti √juṣ sometimes seems to mean what the simplex does:
‘enjoy’ with an acc. of the substance enjoyed, as in I.101.10 uśán havyā́ni práti no
juṣasva “(Indra,) being eager, take pleasure in our oblations” (cf. VII.34.21). But
sometimes this idiom takes a personal object, with the subject giving enjoyment to
the object - a reversal of the usual situation. See III.33.8, VII.54.1, 2. In the latter
hymn, we find in vs. 1 the dyadic yát tvémahe práti tán no juṣasva “When we entreat
you, favor us in return,” which suggests that práti √juṣ comes as a response to a
request of some sort. In vs. 2 pitéva putrā́n práti no juṣasva “Like a father his sons,
favor us in return,” the acc. putrā́n in the simile shows the case of the obj. of the
verb, which the enclitic naḥ conceals. The personal acc. is also found in our passage:
práti devā́m̐ajuṣata práyobhiḥ. As these tr. show, I have generally tr. this idiom
‘favor in return’, but ‘favor in response’ might be better. I confess, however, that
neither ‘in return’ or ‘in response’ quite works in our passage.

### 02
Note that this vs. contains the three most resonant “poet” terms: kaví, ṛ́ṣi,
vípra-. The first applies to Soma, the other two to the seven seers who approach him.
In b I take kavíḥ as a pred. nominative or an embedded quotation, providing
the name that Soma has acquired - though it must be admitted that we might expect
an acc. Both Ge and Re take kavíḥ as an independent descriptor (though see Ge’s n.
2b, where he allows the possibility of my interpr.). The name Soma assumes is, for
them, “Soma” itself, or so I understand it. By my interpr. Soma gets called “Kavi”
because of the noise he makes on his journey; at the end of the journey he becomes
(like a) “Hotar” when he sits down (/is installed) in the cups - another human ritual
participant. Ge (n. 2b) suggests that he has just become the Soma-drink (by virtue of
the pressing?) and thus takes on the name.

### 03
The periphrasis in c bhuvát … rántā, with the aor. injunc. (∾ subj.) to √bhū
+ root-accented -tar- stem, must be signaling some special nuance. Ge tr. “Er pflegte
… zu verweilen” (is accustomed to); Tichy (168-69) cites his tr. with apparent
approbation and characterizes the use of this periphrasis as expressing “eine
gewohnheitsmässig wiederholte Handlung.” Her own rendering (pp. 314, 336) is “er
pflegte bei allen Darbietungen der Seher haltzumachen.” My own “is one to take his
rest” is close to this view, but lays more emphasis on the agentive aspect of the -tarstem.
There is also the question of which sense of √ram is found here, the orig.
‘(come to) rest’ or the developed ‘be content, enjoy’. Re opts for the latter (and see
his n.): “qui se complaît …,” but given the emphasis on Soma’s taking his seat (vss.
2-3), it seems best, with Ge (/Tichy), to operate with the first.
Having been called kaví- himself in 2b, Soma now finds himself in the midst
of all kā́vya- -- presumably mostly the poetic effusions of the ritual participants, but
also the sounds that he made on his journey that afforded him the kaví- title. This
joining of different types of kā́vya- may account for the ‘all’.
Ge’s rendering of pāda d is quite free: “Der Kluge macht die fünf Völker zu
seinem Gefolge.” Tichy’s (336) is more accurate: “überall bei den fünf Völkern
nimmt der Weise seinen Platz ein.” A proper interpr. of this pāda must first
recognize that the lexeme is not ánu √yat, pace Gr: there are no other exx. of this
supposed combination in the RV (nor any other registered by Mon-Wms). Instead we
must be dealing with the fairly common expression jánām̐ánu (I.50.3, 6, 120.11,
etc.), though with flipped order, “through(out) the peoples.” The finite verb yatate
then has its normal sense ‘take one’s place, ‘arrange oneself’; here the point is that
Soma is common to the whole Ārya community, whatever limited place he occupies
on the ritual ground.
I render dhī́raḥ as ‘steadfast’ rather than ‘insightful, wise’, because of the
emphasis on Soma’s taking his seat.

### 04
As was suggested in the publ. intro., this vs. may constitute a weak
omphalos. In particular, the purport of the first hemistich is not clear to me: what
does it mean to say “the gods are in your secret”? Re supplies ‘domain’ with niṇyé,
but doesn’t elucidate. Ge floats two possibilities in his n. 4a. The first, which he says
is illuminated by IX.95.2, is that the gods are Soma’s secret, which only he can
reveal. This is not quite what IX.95.2 says; there Soma reveals the hidden names
(gúhyāni nāma) of the gods, with an acc. pl. not a loc. sg. I am more convinced by his
2nd proposal, that we supply loc. nā́mani with niṇyé, and interpr. it to mean that
Soma’s “secret name” is amṛ́ta- ‘immortal’ (‘ambrosia’), a word indeed regularly
used for soma. Since this word is also, of course, a standard descriptor for the gods,
they are/exist, in the verbal sense, “in your secret (name).” Although the loc.
nā́man(i) is not found in the RV, this seems an accidental gap. The multistep
mystery—1) figure out what, if anything, to supply with niṇyá-: nā́mani; 2) solve for
what the “secret (name)” is: amṛ́ta; 3) then apply the resultant name to the gods—is
worthy of an omphalos. To make the tr. clearer I would substitute “it is in your secret
(name [=(drink of) immortality]) that all these gods [=the immortals] are …”

### 05
Re tr. pāda a “Que cet (acte) de Pavamāna se réalise donc ...” I would prefer
this rendering of satyám to the “true” of Ge and the publ. tr., but it is even harder to
square with the augmented impf. akṛṇot (c) (and probably prā́vat in d, since √av has
no injunctives) that expresses the content of the satyám (“true” is bad enough).
Perhaps the poet is suggesting that some have expressed doubt that Soma
accomplished the deeds described in cd, even though kārú-s are agreed that he did,
and that he (our poet) wants them to be true. This covert skepticism might well be
justified, since all the deeds in cd are attributed elsewhere to other gods. On the other
hand, see nearby IX.94.5, where Soma is urged to “make broad light” (urú jyótiḥ
kṛṇuhi).
Another word for poet or the equivalent, kārú- ‘bard’, is added to the trio in
vs. 2.
I do not know if we should see a difference in nuance between the augmented
impf. ákṛṇot in c and the injunc. aor. kar in d; the latter is in the same clause as the
(probably augmented) impf. prā́vat.
The stem abhī́ka- ‘close quarters, face-to-face’ is elsewhere used in contrast
to ‘wide(ness)’, VII.85.1 … uruṣyatām abhī́ke, X.133.1 abhī́ke cid ulokakṛ́t, and this
contrast is evident here as well, with the positive ákṛṇod ulokám ending c, and the
negative kar abhī́kam in d.
As Old points out, kar would be better as a heavy syllable; he suggests
underlying *karr (< *kar-t). See comm. ad VII.75.1.

### 06
Pāda a contains one of the few technical references to the animal sacrifice in
the RV. See the almost identical expression in IX.97.1.
Note that satyá- returns here, where ‘true’ or ‘actual, real’ would both work.
## 093
This hymn is attributed to Nodhas Gautama, the skillful poet of I.58-64. This
hymn does not particularly display his verbal agility, but its last pāda (5d) is his
refrain, found in I.58.9, etc.

### 01
Notice the alliteration in b: dáśa dhī́rasya dhītáyo dhánutrīḥ.
The stem dhánutar- occurs 3x in the RV, twice as a fem. pl. dhánutrīḥ (here
and III.31.16), once as a masc. du. dhánutarau (IV.35.5). Although it is not strictly
relevant to our occurrence here, the surprising short suffixal vowel in that strong
form requires comment. The form occurs after an early caesura, thus producing a
break of three light syllables. Such a break is by no means uncommon (see Arnold, p.
188), but a reading *dhánutārau would produce Arnold’s “normal” break (light light
heavy). Old (Noten ad loc.) tentatively suggests that if the form is corrupt, it was
altered because it was perceived as a comparative in -tara- or a cmpd with -tara-
‘crossing, overcoming’. Old’s suggestion is tentatively accepted by Wackernagel
(AiG III.199), Gotō (1st cl., 179 n. 311). The misparsing of the form would of course
be aided by the fact that it is built not to the root, like most agent nouns, but to an
enlarged pres. stem *dhan-u-/-va-, which has spawned a secondary root √dhanv. See,
e.g., EWA s.v. DHANI
, Goto 178-80 with nn. By contrast, Tichy (-tar-stems, 58-59)
adduces nearby IV.38.4 sánutaraḥ, which is not originally a -tar-stem, but which,
like dhánutarau, modifies a horse. She suggests that since beside the comparative
sánutara- (whatever its source: see my comm. ad loc.) there exists an (independent)
fem. agent noun sánutrī- (I.123.2, X.7.4), dhánutarau was backformed to the parallel
fem. agent dhánutrī-. The suggested string of causation here seems stretched too thin.
As for our fem. pl. form, both Ge and Re take dhánutrīḥ here as effectively
transitive, with objective genitive dhī́rasya: “die den Weisen ablaufen lassen”;
“animatrices du (soma) habile.” But neither of the other occurrences of this stem
have such a sense; they simply mean ‘running’; Gotō (179 and n. 313) concurs with
the intrans. reading I see here. The fact that an intrans. form of the pf. to √dhanv,
dadhanve, is found in the next vs. (2b) supports this interpr. Another (weak) support
is the case of the supposed obj., since root-accented tar-stems ordinarily take acc.
However, there are enough counterexamples that this is not a clinching argument.
Ge takes dáśa with dhītáyaḥ “die zehn Gebete,” but, despite the pādaboundary, I think it goes with the sisters=fingers in pāda a, as usual. It has been
drawn into b because of the alliteration.
Contra Old, Ge, Re, and Schindler (Rt. Nouns), I analyze jā́ḥ as a nom. sg.
(with Gr), not an acc. pl. (Ge allows for the nom. sg. alternative in n. 1c). In their
interpretations, “the children of the sun” refers to the insightful thoughts of b. But
this is a distinctly odd way to refer to thoughts, and no convincing parallels are
given. Ge’s interpr. of the phrase “daughter of the sun” as a reference to hymns I
have discussed (and dismissed) ad IX.1.6 and esp. IX.72.3. Moreover, pāda c
describes Soma as dashing around these children, but in IX pári + VERB OF MOTION
normally, perhaps exclusively, refers to Soma’s journey around the filter. I do not
know what it would mean for him to “dash around” thoughts, much less “children of
the sun.” As a nom. sg., jā́ḥ in the phrase “offspring of the sun” makes perfect sense
as a description of Soma; Soma’s similarity to and often identification with the sun is
well attested, and the use of kinship terms to model such similiarity/identification is
also well known. If, nonetheless, we want to interpr. jā́ḥ as an acc. pl., I would take it
as a reference to the milk; cf. comm. ad IX.72.3, where I explain “daughter of the
sun” there as referring to the milk because of their shared gleaming color.

### 02
In d sám √gam is of course a euphemism of sex, a theme already broached
in c.

### 03
The tr. “prepare” for abhí śrīṇanti in b does not harmonize well with the
simile vásubhir ná niktaíḥ “as if with freshly washed goods.” Nor does the interpr.
put forth by Narten (“Ved. śrīṇā́ti …,” KZ 100 [1987] = KlSch 340ff., at 349),
“vollkommen machen” (complete, perfect). The developed sense of the root noun śrī́-
‘excellence, splendour, beauty’ and esp. the rt. noun cmpd abhiśrī́- ‘excelling in
splendour’ (etc.) seems to have affected the meaning of the verb, and I would now tr.
something like “they beautify his head …,” which is not far from ‘bring to
perfection’.

### 04
Ge takes vāvaśānáḥ in b to ‘desire’ (√vaś), but the same form in the same
metrical position in 2b to ‘bellow’ (√vāś). Given the formal identity of the
participles, I think they should be rendered in the same way (‘bellowing’; Ge’s n. 4b
recognizes this alternative). But the proximity of uśatī́‘desiring, eager’ in our pāda c
teases us with the other root, and it is quite possible that our form should be taken as
a pun. For a similar conjunction see IX.95.3-4.
The hapax rathirāyátām (3rd sg. mid. impv., with Old, etc., not gen. pl. pres.
part., with Gr) is baroque in formation. It’s worth noting that 3 of the 11 forms of its
presumed base rathirá- ‘charioteer, chariot rider’ are found in nearby IX.97 (vss. 37,
46, 48) with a further occurrence in IX.76.2.

### 05
The vs. shows a number of metrical disturbances; see Arnold p. 317, Old ad
loc., HvN p. 649. Arnold suggests reading *māsvā in pāda a, which would fix the
cadence. Pāda b has an opening of 3; note, however, that the apparently bad cadence
viśváścandram with four heavy syllables is not in fact a problem, since all cmpds in -
ścandra- are better read *-candra- (see comm. ad I.165.8), yielding the light
antepenult required. On the metrical shape of vātā́pyam see immed. below and
comm. ad I.121.8. Pāda c has 10 syllables. Pāda d, the Nodhas Gautama refrain
(I.58.9, etc.), has an unusual break.
The adj. vātā́pyam presents problems of both form and meaning. There are
three (or more) possible scansions of this stem—vāatā́pya- (or vaatā́pya-),
vātaā́pya-, and vātā́pi
ya—each of which has its champions. See comm. ad I.121.8.
The sense of the stem is likewise in doubt. It seems obviously related to the voc.
vā́tāpe ‘o friend of the wind’ in I.187.8-10, and in I.121.8 Ge tr. “… den
Windbefreundeten,” in X.26.2 “die mit dem Vāta befreundet (?) ist.” However, in
our passage and in X.105.1 he suggests a different analysis entirely, since (acdg. to
his n. 5b to our hymn) that sense “will hier nicht passen.” His alternative involves the
ppl. vāta- to √vani ‘long for, crave’ (otherwise attested only as 2nd cmpd. member),
with the sense “whose friendship is desired” (dessen Freundschaft begehrt ist). The
question is somewhat hard to decide (if it needs to be decided: a pun is also possible,
as displayed in the publ. tr.). On the one hand, giving up the connection with vātāpi-
(whatever its underlying accent would have been: vā́tāpe has voc. accent) is
unappealing. Moreover if the scansion should be vāata-, this would favor ‘wind’,
which can be so scanned, whereas the root syll. of the ppl. should not be distracted.
(However, that scansion is declared by Old to be the least likely one.) Ge’s certainty
that “wind-befriended” wouldn’t work here is also open to question. We are asking
for wealth - and “wind-befriended” wealth could be wealth that comes quickly, on a
powerful gust of air. All this favors the “wind” analysis. But there is another
consideration: accent. The cmpd is clearly an adj.; just as clearly it has a neut. noun
ā́pya- ‘friendship’ as 2nd member. Therefore it should be a bahuvrīhi “having X
friendship’ / ‘having the friendship of X’. If the 1st member is the ppl. to √vani
, it
should be accented *vātá- (though it actually never appears accented elsewhere).
This would allow an analysis vātá-āpya- with expected first-member bahuvrīhi
accent (of the sutá-soma- type). But ‘wind’ is accented vā́ta-, and so, if it contains
‘wind’, the cmpd. must be analyzed with 2nd member accent, vāta-ā́pya-, which is
not standard bahuvrīhi accent. Nonetheless, weighing these contravening factors, I
favor ‘wind-befriended’ as the 1st reading, with Ge’s ‘whose friendship is sought’ as
a 2nd punning reading—though I cannot explain the accent.
Although pāda d is the Nodhas refrain and therefore tacked onto the hymn in
some sense, note that dhiyā́responds to dhī́ra- dhītí- of 1b.
## 094
This hymn is attributed to Kaṇva Ghaura, the poet of I.36-43.

### 01
Note the unaccented asmin in pāda a, referring to Soma, who is the default
referent even without a previous mention in the hymn.
The vs. contains three similes, each of which presents at least some
interpretational challenges to the audience. The first two are in ab and match the
frame “the thoughts contend over him” (… asmin … spárdhante dhíyaḥ), which
preumably refers to the thoughts produced by poets at different and competing rituals
(see Ober I.407 and n. 64). The second simile, in b, is the easier to interpret: “like
clans over the sun” (sū́rye ná víśaḥ). Like the competing thoughts that each seek to
appropriate Soma, different clans all seek to secure their place in the sun, a symbol,
acdg. to Ober (I.457), of Leben and Lebenskraft, of Lebensraum.
The first simile, vājínīva śúbhaḥ, reads slightly askew. It should mean “as
adornments (contend over) a prizewinner” - but what would that really mean? The
passages adduced by Ge in n. 1a are not helpful, and no one else that I know of
attempts to elucidate it. I think the poet has deliberately misdirected us. To begin
with, although the loc. vājíni appears to match asmin in the frame as the object of
contention, I think that may not be the case or may not only be the case. The vs.
begins with ádhi, which therefore appears to be in tmesis with spárdhante in b, but
there is only one other instance of ádhi √spṛdh in the RV (VI.34.1, where - I must
admit - it seems to have the sense attributed to our passage: ‘contend over’ with loc.
índre as the object of contention). The word ádhi is more often an adposition, most
commonly with the loc., and so I think it is here. Although ádhi is separated from
vājíni, what intervenes is Wackernagel’s position material: subordinating yád, which
frequently takes 2nd position, and the enclitic asmin, which would lean upon it. So
effectively ádhi … vājíni can be a prepositional phrase interrupted by the
interpolation of those two Wackernagel’s position words. Under this interpr. the
prizewinner is no longer the object of contention but the locus of it. Now as to
śúbhaḥ: this root noun is quite well attested (over 40 occurrences, incl. the common
voc. śubhás páti-), but only two attestations are plural - our passage and V.54.11,
which describes the many appurenances and adornments found on the Maruts and
their equipage, incl. pāda b vákṣassu rukmā́maruto ráthe śúbhaḥ “ your breasts
brilliants, o Maruts, on your chariot charms” (per the publ. tr.). The śúbhaḥ here are
ornaments of some sort, quite possibly sparkly or otherwise eye-catching, that jazz
up the chariot to which they’re affixed. I suggest that our loc. (ádhi …) vājíni fulfills
the same function as ráthe in V.54.11, and that the śúbhaḥ in our passage are not
vying over or for the prizewinner, but, located on him, they are vying with each other
to best catch the eye of observers.
The phrase that opens the 2nd hemistich, apó vṛṇānáḥ “choosing the waters,”
is a little odd. The waters are surely the ubiquitous waters for mixing found regularly
in IX, but why would Soma “choose” them? In a soma context we would expect
rather apó *vasānáḥ “clothing himself in the waters”; this exact phrase opens the
pāda in IX.78.1, 86.40, 96.13, 107.4, 18, 26, and with acc. sg. of the participle
IX.16.2, 109.21. I suggest that our poet is knowingly playing on this standard
formula, using a different root but identical formation to throw the expression offkilter. Note that vásāna- (nom. pl.) is found in the same metrical position in 4c. The
identical expression, apó vṛṇānáḥ, is, however, found in V.48.1; on this opaque
passage see comm. ad loc.
Interpretation of the third simile in the vs. is complicated by the fact that it is
unclear which part of the clause to construe it with. The frame consists of an acc.
mánma ‘thought’ (à ‘poem’), which is compared to vrajáṃ ná paśuvárdhanāya “a
stable for raising livestock.” But where these acc. expressions fit in the sentence is
disputed: Ge (see n. 1d; also Tichy, dvitā́222 = KlSch 213) takes mánma as a second
obj. with vṛṇānáḥ. But the simile then makes little sense: although Soma might well
“choose a thought,” choosing a stable is a different proposition. By this interpr. the
domain of the comparison would only be the acc. mánma; it could not fit with the
verb (despite Tichy’s odd “wie (man) eine Hürde … [wählt]”). Although such
similes, detached from the syntax of the rest of the clause, do exist, syntactic
integration, esp. of non-nominative similes, is more usual and desirable. By contrast,
Old takes the acc. as the obj. (or semi-obj.) of pavate. This latter suggestion seems
particularly unlikely, given the stereotyped used of pavate in IX, and Old’s rendering
shows how he struggles to make it work: “er verwirklicht durch sein Sichreinigen
das m˚, wie (man) einen Stall …(reinigt).” Differing from both these interpr.,
following a remark of Re’s in his n. (“mánma dépendant librement de kavīyán …”),
which is not entirely reflected in his tr., I take it with the act. denom. part. kavīyán.
The stem kavīyá- occurs only twice in the RV (and nowhere else), once as an act.
part. (here), once as a middle part. kavīyámāna- in I.164.18. Nothing therefore
forbids us from assuming a direct obj. with the act. form, as I have done here. The
content of the simile, which compares the building of a stable or livestock enclosure
to the composing of a poem, rests on the commonality often asserted in the RV
between physical and mental craftsmanship and thus fits nicely with the verb.

### 02
The nom. part. vyūrṇván in pāda is sg., while the finite verb prathanta in b
is pl. Old and Ge attribute this to anacoluthon, with the nom. of pāda a coreferential
with the dat. svarvíde in b, while acdg. to Tichy (loc. cit., n. 35) the participle is the
predicate of pāda a (“Partizip im Nominative an Stelle eines Verbum finitum”). With
Re, I instead take pāda a as a continuation of vs. 1, with a new construction
beginning in b.
The referent of amṛ́tasya in the phrase amṛ́tasya dhā́ma is not clear. Ge: the
drink of immortality, Re: the immortal principle, Lü (257) and Tichy (loc. cit.):
immortality. By contrast I think it may refer to the sun (as I also suggest in the
nearby passage IX.97.32); the immediately following description of Soma as ‘finder
of the sun’ (svarvíd-) supports this interpr. “Disclosing the domain of the sun” may
refer to the Dawn-like behavior of Soma at the morning pressing (see Ge’s n. 2b
“Wie bei Sonnenaufgang”), or to his plunging into the milk mixture that is often
assimilated to the sun - probably the latter. The adv. dvitā́‘once again’ expresses the
regular repetition of the sacrifice.

### 03
This vs. does not contain a main cl., simply a subord. yád cl. in ab, extended
by a participial expression in cd. The vs. can depend either on the previous vs. or the
following one - or (though in my view less likely) the part. bhū́ṣan in c can be the
predicate of the main cl.
The cadence of pāda a is bad; Gr suggests reading subj. *bharāte, which
would fix the problem, but as Old comments, this is “natürlich ganz unsicher” - esp.
since both the opening and the break are likewise irregular (see HvN metrical comm.
ad loc.).
Note the emphatic return of the poet, with kavíḥ kā́vyā in pāda a picking up
kavīyán in 1a.
Pāda b and the simile it contains raise some problems. First, the nom. subject
śū́ro ná ráthaḥ. The stem śū́ra- is of course a masc. noun ‘champion’, here
juxtaposed with another such noun, rátha- ‘chariot’. Re renders them as distinct
subjects: “tel un héros, (tel) un char-de-guerre,” but I think a blended “champion
chariot” works better. The phrase also presents another possibility, which Old flirts
with but ultimately dismisses: śū́raḥ is phonologically almost identical to sū́raḥ, the
gen. sg. of svàr- ‘sun’, and the “chariot of the Sun” (sū́raḥ […] rátha-) is found
elsewhere (I.50.9 [see comm. ad loc.], V.31.11; also sū́raḥ […] cakrám
“(chariot-)wheel of the Sun” I.174.5, VI.56.3). Although I do not propose emending
śū́raḥ to *sū́raḥ, I do think that phrase is lurking in the background, esp. given the
presence of the sun in 2b (svar-[víde]) and, if I’m correct, also 2a.
Assuming this double reading of the subject of the simile helps interpr. the
rest of pāda b. Ge and Re take bhúvanāni víśvā “all the worlds” as belonging to the
frame, as a parallel obj. to kā́vyā in pāda a (e.g., “Quand le (soma) poète porte autour
de lui les pouvoirs-poétiques (et) tous les mondes …”). This leaves the acc. slot of
the simile unfilled: Re leaves it blank, while Ge supplies “(die Feinde?).” I instead
put bhúvanāni víśvā in the simile, matching kā́vyā in the frame. This interpr. is
facilitated by the “chariot of the *Sun” reading that I think is implied here, since the
Sun’s daily chariot journey across the heaven puts all worlds in his jurisdiction.
Soma’s journey across the ritual ground gives him the same kind of control over
poetic skill and its products, both his own and those of the officiants. It may also be
that “all the worlds” can secondarily be re-read into the frame. The bhúvanāni that
stretched out for sun-finding Soma in 2b (presumably both the cosmic worlds and the
worlds of the ritual ground) fall into this control in 3ab.
As pointed out by Old inter alia, in c the transmitted mártāya is best emended
to *márti
yāya, since a four-syllable reading is called for.
The dual focus on the cosmic and the ritual continues in c, where Soma exerts
himself “among the gods” (that is, in his cosmic dimension) on behalf of glory for
the mortal, presumably the priest or poet. The expression (yáśo) *mártyāya bhū́ṣan#
may play off amṛ́tāya bhū́ṣan# (III.25.2, 34.2) “exerting oneself for the immortal
(one).”
The rt. noun cmpd puru-bhū́(-tama)- is otherwise used of the Aśvins (4x); I
interpr. it to mean ‘appearing in many places’ (see comm. ad IV.44.4). The apparent
loc. pl. occurrence here has been variously and only tentatively interpr.; see Ge, Re,
Ober (II.229), Scar (362). Given the context, in a participial clause headed by
bhū́ṣan, I suggest that our purubhū́ṣu does not in fact belong to puru-bhū́- but rather
to an otherwise unattested puru-*bhū́ṣ- -- hence *puru-bhū́ṣ-ṣu, with the geminate
sibilant simplified to -ṣ-. Although a root noun to the secondary root √bhūṣ is not
found elsewhere, it would not be difficult to generate in this context.

### 04
In pāda a the Pp reads śriyé for the Saṃhitā śriyá ā́. Ge concurs, but Re tr.
“… est issu de la gloire,” with an apparent ablative - which is how I interpr. the
form. The lexeme nír √i ‘come out, come forth’ generally takes an abl., and the
gesture towards a versified paradigm (śriyé … śriyás [a], śríyam [b]) speak in favor
of the abl.
The pl. subj. of c may be the singers, the only plural entitiy overt in the vs. so
far. So Sāy. and by implication (see his n. 4c) Ge. However, I think that Re is correct
is supplying instead “les sucs-de-soma,” since vasāná-, common in IX, is applied
only to soma. The interchange between sg. and pl. in reference to soma and its
streams/drops, etc., is of course ubiquitous in this maṇḍala.
The final pāda is quite unclear and its interpr. depends in part on identity of
the ref. of the loc. mitádrau ‘of measured pace’. Ge and Re both take it to be Soma.
Acdg, to Ge, the loc. is to be construed with samithā́(“Die Kämpfe um ihn, der einen
festen Schritt hat …”), but as far as I am aware, samithá- is not found with a loc.
elsewhere. Re makes this loc. into a loc. absolute, by virtue of supplying a near
paragraph of extraneous matter, which has a whiff of desperation in it. My interpr.
begins with the fact that of the 5 occurences of the stem mitádru- the two other
singular ones both refer to Agni (IV.6.5, VII.7.1). I therefore suggest that he is also
the referent here. The “encounters” (samithā́) that are to be realized (bhávanti satyā́)
take place at the ritual fire; the loc. is simply recalling us firmly to the ritual ground.
The encounters in question I take to be the encounter of the soma streams/drops (etc.)
with the gods who are to consume them - or possibly the encounters with the water
and milk mixtures.
## 095
This hymn is attributed to Praskaṇva Kāṇva, the poet of I.44-50, the group of
hymns that follow those of Kaṇva Ghaura, the poet of immediately preceding IX.94.

### 01
Ge takes the participles in b (sī́dan … punānáḥ) as implicitly predicated (“er
läutert sich und setzt sich …”), but there seems no reason to do so. They are surely
parallel to the part. in pāda a (sṛjyámānaḥ) and detail the various circumstances
under which Soma keeps roaring.
The verb in b, 3rd sg. mid. janayata, seems to be a true middle with selfinvolvement of the subj. -- “he generates (his own) thoughts through his own
powers.” - not dependent on the purely formal 3rd pl. -anta replacement janáyanta
(see my “Voice fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd plural -anta in active
paradigms,” IIJ 21 ([1979] 146-69). The self-involvement of the subj. is even clearer
in the near-twin passage I.95.4 vatsó mātṝ́r janayata svadhā́bhiḥ “ The calf [=Agni]
begets his (own) mothers with his own powers.” See comm. ad loc.

### 02
The opening of this vs., háriḥ sṛjānáḥ, echoes 1a … hárir ā́sṛjyámānaḥ#. I
do not know if the root aor. part. here is meant to convey anterior value, as opposed
to the pres. pass. part. in 1a, or if it’s just a variant.
For the infinitival use of the dative of this rt. noun cmpd pravā́c- see Scar (470).

### 03
Pada b prá manīṣā́īrate sómam ácha “The inspired thoughts press forward
to Soma” is the intrans. equivalent of 2b íyarti vā́cam “He [=Soma] directs his
speech,” with act. transitive redupl. pres. íyarti corresponding to its weak form,
medial intrans. ī́rte. This connection is obscured by the Engl. tr.
The deployment of ca, first conjoining two preverbs enfolding their joint verb
(c … úpa ca yánti sáṃ ca), and then in the next pāda conjoining a new preverb, but
with a different verb (d ā́ca viśanti), is a striking effect. The contrastive preverbs in
c of course account for the accent on the main-cl. verb yánti.

### 04
The ‘back’ (sā́nā́) is the back of the filter; the fuller expression is sā́no ávye
“on the sheep’s back,” as in nearby IX.97.3 mr̥jyate sā́no ávye.
Ge renders vāvaśānám as “dem Verlangenden” (to √vaś ‘desire’), in contrast
to Re and the publ. tr., which take it to √vāś ‘bellow’. In actual fact it is probably a
pun. On the one hand, in this vs. Soma is strongly typed as bovine (a: mahiṣám
‘buffalo’, b: ukṣánam ‘ox’), which favors ‘bellow’. On the other, the end of the
previous vs. contains a reciprocal expression from √vaś: 3d uśatī́r uśántam “(they)
desiring, (him) desiring.” So both roots are in play here and equally applicable to
Soma. For a similar situation see nearby IX.93.4 and comm. thereon.
For Trita as the archetypal soma-preparer, see comm. ad IX.37.4. Here Soma
is identified with Varuṇa because of Varuṇa’s (developing) association with water
and the sea. See Lü (52, 268), Ober (II.100 and n. 406).

### 05
The Upavaktar priest prompts the Hotar to speak. On this priestly title and
its relationship to the Maitrāvaruṇa priest, see Minkowski, Priesthood in Ancient
India, 118-27. It may be no accident that this priestly title, found only 3x in the RV
(IV.9.5, VI.71.5, and here), occurs directly after a mention of Varuṇa.
## 096
On the structure of this hymn, see publ. intro. Although the larger structure
involves a series of independent four-vs. hymns, there are a number of echoes across
these hymns, noted below, that may have influenced their being grouped together

### 02
The publ. tr. doesn’t make it sufficiently clear that “without resting”
qualifies the “tawny (horse).”
Ge and Re construe gen. índrasya with the chariot, while I take it with the
comrade - and Ober vacillates (comrade II.100, chariot II.204). Since índrasya is
positioned between chariot and comrade, word order doesn’t help. In my view
‘comrade’ is inherently relational and generally needs to be defined with reference to
another being or beings, as comrade to someone, hence my tr. See also nearby

### 06
sákhéndrasya, which both Ge and Re construe together.

### 03
The phrase dyā́m utémā́m raises a number of questions. First, what is utá
conjoining? Although it is tempting to suggest “heaven and this (earth),” this would
produce the pragmatically unlikely “causing … this (earth) to rain.” Moreover, there
are numerous exx. of prthiv ̥ ī́ṃ dyā́m utémā́m “earth and this heaven” (III.32.8, 34.8,
X.88.3, 9, 121.1). It seems that the last part of that phrase, containing only the second
NP, has been extracted from the fuller expression and inserted here, with the utá
pleonastic, or loosely conjoining the participial phrases kṛṇvánn apáḥ and varṣáyan
dyā́m utémā́m despite its position within the NP. On the clash between the near
deictic ayám ‘this here’ and heaven, which is generally qualified by the distal deictic
asaú ‘that yonder’, see disc. ad VIII.40.4 - also for the fem. gender that dyā́m must
show here.
Ge tr. d as implicitly comparative, “mach uns die Bahn noch breiter als breit,”
presumably because of the abl. uróḥ. But ā́with preceding abl. almost always
expresses the source and is not used with a comparative. The few passages, grouped
in Gr’s 7) “vor andern, d.h. in höherm vorzuglichern Grade als andere” (p. 169), that
do show something like that sense (several in that category are best interpr.
otherwise) depend on ā́váram “the choice from among …” Moreover, varivasyádoes not have a comparative sense ‘make wider space’ but merely ‘make wide
space’. In our passage the point seems to be that Soma is already positioned in a wide
place, from which he can act to provide us with the same.

### 04
As Old points out, bṛhaté is a masc./neut. form apparently modifying two
(or at least one) fem. nouns, svastáye sarvátātaye. Re takes it as a third term: “pour
… le haut (rang),” but in his n. he acknowledges the Old/Ge acceptance of gender
mismatch here, noting also that that interpr. produces two pairs of paired datives, the
negated violence words in pāda a and the positive -ti-abstracts in b. In my view
pattern may trump gender here. It’s also worth noting that the cadence produced by
bṛhaté is bad, and it would be fixed by a fem. *bṛhatyai, so it is possible that bṛhaté
was introduced redactionally - but why?

### 06
Though the syntax is kept absolutely constant - nom. sg. + gen. pl. - there is
a shifting functional relationship between the head noun and its genitive in the seven
phrases here: the first two are roles Soma performs for the group identified by the
gen., the next three a particular, and superior, individual token from the group
(though the third pairing, “seer for/of the inspired poets,” is ambiguous between the
first type and the second), and the last is sort of a negative version of the role he
plays for the group.

### 07
In pāda a, along with Ge and Re (see also Old’s comm. ad loc.) I read ūrmím
twice, with both simile and frame; vācáḥ so accented should be gen. sg., not acc. pl.,
and is therefore not parallel to the two acc. pls. in b, gíraḥ … manīṣā́ḥ.
The standard tr. interpr. the vṛjánā phrase as obj. of antáḥ páśyan (e.g., Re
“Regardant à l’intérieur ces sectes (de fidèles) proches”). I instead take the part. in
absolute usage (“looking within”; cf. I.132.3) and construe the acc. with ā́tiṣṭhati
‘(sur)mounts’. This makes some spatial sense: if they are ‘below’ (ávarāṇi) it is easy
to mount them.
Re and Ober (II.211) think that pāda d refers to copulation. Cf. esp. Ober’s
“Der Bulle besteigt die Kühe, [die Kopulation] kennend.” Although “mount” is a
standard Engl. term for animal copulation, I am not at all sure that ā́√sthā serves the
same function, and I would esp. wonder about using the locative for the female
participant(s). And I also doubt that it would need to be added that the bull knew how
to do it!

### 08
Ge takes iṣaṇyán in d to mean ‘desiring’ (“nach den Kühen verlangend”) as
in the sim. passage he cites, III.50.3. But this verb stem always means ‘drive, send’
(see Re’s n. ad loc.) and is, one way or another, derived from iṣṇā́ti ‘impels, sends’.
### 08-09
Although these two vss. belong to two different hymns within the larger
structure of IX.96, it is notable that the a-pādas of both end with a form -vātaḥ; it is
not impossible that the hymn consisting of 9-12 was attached here because of this
concatenation, esp. given that the etymological figure in 8a is repeated in 11c of the
other hymn. But the -vāta-forms belong to two different roots: 8a (/11c) ávāta- to
√van ‘win, vanquish’ and 9a devávāta-to √vani ‘love, cherish, long for’. The root
affiliation of ávāta- is assured by the etymological figure in which it’s found,
vanvánn ávātaḥ “vanquishing but unvanquished” (cf. also VI.16.20, 18.1, IX.89.7 as
well as the two occurrences in this hymn, 8a and 11c). But √van is an aniṭ root, and
we might expect a ppl. *-vata-, which does not occur; -vāta- is only phonologically
proper to the seṭ root √vani
. Gotō (1st Kl. 283-84 with n. 656), fld. by EWA (s.v.
VAN), suggests that ávāta- (and, per EWA, other apparent seṭ forms of √van) are
analogic to the synonymous, rhyming but seṭ root √sani (sātá-, etc.). I certainly think
the parallel forms of √sani may well have contributed, but I think it’s a mistake to
discount potential confusion and conflation of forms of √vani and √van, esp. since
under certain circumstances ‘love, long for’ and ‘win’ can shade into each other.

### 09
In addition to its echoing ávāta- in 8, devávāte is reminiscent of devátāte in
3a.
My “for Indra’s exhilaration” is a somewhat loose rendering of the double
dative índrāya … mádāya “for Indra, for exhilaration.”

### 11  
As Ge (see n. 11c) and Ober (I.311 with n. 791) point out, the first
hemistich depicts the Vala myth, with “forefathers” (pitáraḥ) a reference to the
Aṅgirases - made clearer by a similar but more explicit passage in the next hymn,
IX.97.39. This mythic episode - the forefathers opening the Vala cave with the help
of soma - provides the model for the appeal in c, for Soma to open the paridhí-
(paridhī́m̐r áporṇu): paridhí- is used explicitly of the barriers of the Vala cave in
I.52.5. But as Ge suggests (n. 11c), the poet here is calling on Soma to open up the
livestock pens and provide us with the animals therein.

### 12  
As pointed out in the publ. intro., this vs. is strongly marked as a hymnfinal vs., with complementary yáthā ‘even as’ (ab) and evā́‘in just this way’ (cd)
clauses, bringing this 4-versed hymn to a close. The matches between clauses are
more expicit than in some such structures: the two finite verbs, impf. ápavathāḥ and
impv. pavasva, match exactly save for tense/mood, and the root noun cmpd. vayodhā́ḥ of pāda a is recast as a syntagm dráviṇaṃ dádhānaḥ in c with the same root
√dhā.
The final pāda consists of two brief clauses, both somewhat aberrant. The first
contains an idiom I have not found elsewhere, sám √sthā + LOC. My tr., “stand sideby-side by Indra,” is meant to capture this slightly off expression. The second clause,
“beget/generate weapons,” is syntactically fine but semantically odd.
### 12-13
The first vs. of the new hymn (13a) begins pávasva (see also pavasva
in 14a), just as the last vs. of the previous hymn ended with pavasva (12c). Again,
this concatenation may have led to the attachment of 13-16 at this point. Of course,
pávasva is hardly a rare form in this maṇḍala.

### 14  
The pavasva in this vs. is construed with an acc. phrase, vṛṣṭíṃ diváḥ. Ge
treats it as if it were a straight transitive: “Läutere ... den Regen ... herab,” while Re
supplies a participle to govern the acc.: “clarifie toi (nous donnant) la pluie.” It is
possible that something like Re’s solution is correct: that we should supply the
preverb ā́to form the lexeme ā́√pū ‘attract through purification’ (see comm. ad
IX.7.8); on occasion (see, e.g., IX.13.4 and comm. ad loc.), ā́is missing, but the
passage seems to require it. However, here I suggest that something different is
going on: it is not that we want Soma to bring rain through his purification, but to
become, turn into rain. See IX.97.44, 108.10

### 15  
I don’t know what íd contributes in b, beyond inducing accent on the verb
tárati.
The standard tr. (Ge, Re, Ober [I.232]) take “(the milk) of Aditi” as the frame,
with the simile limited to páyo ná dugdhám, e.g., “Tel le lait trait, (le lait) d’Aditi est
fort.” I find this puzzling because Aditi has little to do with soma and has no reason
to figure here. (On the phrase “in the lap of Aditi” in IX, see comm. ad IX.89.1.)
Instead I think that it is soma that is being compared to the milk milked from Aditi;
in other words, Aditi belongs to the simile. Since she is the archetype of motherhood,
the milk of Aditi would be esp. rich and nurturing - “mother’s milk”; indeed this
might be a reference to the beestings or “first milk” (pīyū́ṣa-), with which soma is
often compared (see comm. ad IX.85.9).
Old, Ge, and Re all make more of the gender mismatch in the simile urv ìva
gātúḥ than I think is justified. Since the target of the simile is milk (páyaḥ), and milk
is neuter, I see no problem with attributing the neut. urú to its “attraction” to the neut.
páyaḥ, even though, given the position of ná, the simile should rightly be “like a
broad way” rather than “broad like a way.” The masc. suyámaḥ in the next simile
may result from the more animate quality of the content of the simile itself, the
draught-horse.

### 16  
The bahuvrīhi sv-āyudhá- ‘having good weapons’ echoes the odd
command that ends the previous hymn in this structure, 12d janáyā́yudhāni “beget
weapons!” This echo may have contributed to the attachment of 13-16 at that point
in the text.
Soma’s goal in b, “the dear hidden name” (gúhyaṃ cā́ru nā́ma), has a
surprisingly large number of possible referents. Lü (526) suggests the sun, Ge (n.
16b) amṛ́ta- the drink of immortality. I would add Soma’s own name (see IX.92.2, 4
and comm. thereon), or the cows on the basis of IX.87.3 apīcyàm gúhyaṃ nā́ma
gónām, or the gods, as in the immed. preceding hymn IX.95.2 devā́nāṃ gúhyāni
nā́ma, or Indra on the basis of IX.109.14 bíbharti cā́rv índrasya nā́ma.
### 17-18
These two vss. outfit Soma with the lexicon of poetry, with 17c
concentrating on kaví- and 18a on ṛ́ṣi-, though with kaví- returning in pāda b

### 17  
I don’t know what the Maruts are doing here.
In c I have rendered the nom. pres. part. sán concessively, in its usual value,
but it’s not exactly clear what the concession would be. Perhaps the contrast is
between Soma as poet - so emphasized by kavíḥ … kā́vyena kavíḥ -- and the less
than melodious sound indicated by the root √ribh ‘squawk, rasp’ (see comm. ad
VI.3.6, IX.66.9).

### 18  
The publ. tr. does not render the rel. yáḥ since the rel. cl. is entirely
nominal. It is not clear how far it extends - perhaps the first hemistich, perhaps
through pāda c, perhaps only the first pāda - since Soma is nominative both in the
rel. cl. and in the main cl. The main cl. must constitute at least the last pāda because
the finite verb rājati is unaccented.
The phrase padavī́ḥ kavīnā́m is found also in 6a.
What the referent of the “third domain” (tṛtī́yaṃ dhā́ma) is is unclear. Lü
(273), not surprisingly, has precisely mapped the spatial geography and considers the
third domain to be heaven (1 earth, 2 midspace, 3 heaven), with the fourth, in the
next vs., the samudra-, which is higher than heaven. I think it more likely that these
are ritual references, quite possibly to locations on the ritual ground that Soma
traverses on his journey (see dhā́māni ā́ryā in IX.63.14 and comm. thereon). If
“gaining the sun” (svarṣā́ḥ) refers to Soma’s uniting with the milk mixture
(assimilated to the sun because of its gleaming whiteness), then the third domain,
which comes after, might be the vessels near the ritual fire. If the dhā́man- are not
spatial but temporal, this could be a ref. to the third pressing. Ge (n. 18c) takes it as
reference to the forms or phases of soma; Re tr. ‘structure’ without further
elaboration.
As generally noted by tr. (Ge, Re, also Scar [72]), pāda d involves a play on
the names of the Anuṣṭubh and Virāj meters. The publ. tr. fails to register the pun on
virā́jam, well captured by Scar “Soma herrscht nach Art eines Grosskönigs.” I would
now substitute a fuller (if more awk.) tr.: “Soma, as rhythm [/ the Anuṣṭubh meter],
rules as wide-ruling one [/regulates the Virāj (meter) according to rule].” This tr.
assumes that virā́jam represents not only the acc. sg. of the rt. noun cmpd. virā́j-, but
also the nom. sg. pres. part. *virā́jan to the them. pres. rā́jati. This seems preferable
to trying to construe it as an acc. sg. in the sense ‘wide-ruling’, and the interchange
of final nasals would be fairly trivial for a pun. Scar. (72 n. 97) notes that the lexeme
ánu √rāj is used in II.43.1 also of regulating meters, there Gāyatrī and Triṣṭubh. The
preverb ánu also has to be read with ṣṭúp, as a cmpd decomposed and flanking rājati
(ánu rājati ṣṭúp), for the meter name. The technical references to meters here may be
the culmination of the kaví- / ṛ́ṣi- theme of 17-18.

### 19  
I follow Ge in interpr. vibhṛ́tvan- as ‘spreading (wings)’, an interpr. that
Old finds at least possible and that Re accepts. It is noteworthy - though I’m not sure
where it gets us - that the Avestan Hom Yašt in Y. 9.14 contains the phrase
vībǝrǝϑuuaṇtǝm āxtūirīm supposedly “with pauses and repeated four times,”
describing the recitation of the Ahuna Vairiia prayer, with the equivalent of our
vibhṛ́tvan- (/-vant-) and turī́ya-. But the contexts are so different that it is hard to
know what, if anything, to make of it - though if there’s a covert reference to
recitational styles here it would continue the technical poetic vocab. of 18d.
The stem govindú- ‘cow-finding’ is found only here in the RV and nowhere
else in Skt. (though govinda- is of course quite common later). As Re notes, it is a
play on índu- ‘drop’ and is immed. doubled by the synonym drapsá-.
The weapons of 16a (and 12d) return here.
I follow Lü (273) and Re in taking samudrám in c as part of a double acc.
phrase with vivakti in d: “declares the sea to be the fourth domain” - rather than as
taking it as a 2nd obj. with sácamānaḥ as Ge does (“… der Meerflut sich gesellend”).
Accepting Lü’s interpr. of the syntax does not, however, require accepting his view
that this is the heavenly ocean, higher than heaven. Again, I think it’s a ritual ref. -
perhaps to the waters that accompany him in pāda c.

### 20  
Soma’s journey from the filter (vs. 17) and across the domains on the ritual
ground (vss. 18-19) reaches its end when he enters the two cups, presumably ready
for the gods to consume.
### 20-21
Again these two vss. belong to separate mini-hymns, but they are
clearly concatenated: kánikradat “constantly roaring” in 20d is repeated in the same
metrical position in 21b (and cf. krándan in 22d), and 20d camvòr ā́viveśa “he has
entered the two cups” is immediately echoed by 21c camvòr ā́viśa “enter the two
cups” (and cf. 22b kaláśām̐ā́viveśa).

### 22  
Given the play on names of meters in 18d, it’s quite possible that sā́man- is
a technical term here.
Although eti has a goal in its pāda (at least in the simile) and should therefore
be read as a lexical verb of motion, it may also be functioning as an auxiliary in a
periphrasis krándann eti “keeps roaring,” which would be an analytic expression
functionally equivalent to the “intensive” (that is, iterative-repetitive) kánikradat in
20d, 21b.

### 23  
The same double reading may apply to eṣi in pāda a, which has a goal
(again in a simile), but also could be read with the part. apaghnán “he keeps smiting
rivals.”
śakunó ná pátvā “like a flying bird” seems closely modeled on 19a śakunó
vibhṛ́tvā “a bird spreading (its wings). In itself the expression is a bit puzzling. If the
bird is “flying” it should not already be “sitting” (sī́dan), and it seems unlikely that
pátvan- is meant to distinguish it (as ‘flightful’) from a flightless bird like a dodo.

### 24  
A last pāda-init. form of √krand, ácikradat in d.
## 097
On the structure of this, the longest hymn in the RV, see publ. intro. It
consists of tṛcas with varying degrees of cohesion.
### 01-03
No obvious cohesion in this tṛca, though it ends with a clan refrain.

### 01
As Re points out, init. asyá is reflexive or pseudo-reflexive, referring to
Soma.
Gr attributes the instr. preṣā́to a root noun préṣ- (< pra-íṣ-). Scar (59-60)
discusses the form extensively, pointing out that a root noun analysis is dispreferred
because of the accent on the ending: root nouns generally keeping the accent on the
root even in the oblique. An instr. to a putative them. stem preṣá- is possible (at least
accentually distinct from préṣa- I.68.5).
Almost identical to IX.92.6a, pāda d contains one of the few technical
references to animal sacrifice (other than the horse sacrifice) in the RV.

### 03
The comparative (yaśástaraḥ) with gen. pl. (yaśásām) is a mixed
construction: we would expect either a splv. or an abl.
On the disputed etym. of kṣaíta(-vant)- see comm. ad VI.2.1. As was noted
there, both kṣaíta- here and kṣaitavant- there are associated with yáśas- ‘glory’.
The final pāda is the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, and the Anukr. attributes this tṛca
to Vasiṣṭha himself, rather than one of the Vasiṣṭhids responsible for vss. 4-30.
### 04-06
As Re points out (ad vs. 6), the key to this tṛca is the dative of purpose: 4b
dhánāya, 5b mádāya, 5d mahaté saúbhagāya, 6b bhárāya.

### 05
Ge and Re take ánu dhā́ma pū́rvam as referring to an earlier mode of praise
(e.g., “nach der früheren Weise”), but dhā́man- in soma hymns tends, in my view, to
refer to the physical domain(s) of the ritual ground, which Soma typically travels
across in the course of his ritual preparation. See, e.g., the exx. in the immediately
preceding hymn IX.96.18-19 and comm. thereon).

### 06
Like the first tṛca, this one ends with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain. The tṛca is
attributed not to Vasiṣṭha himself, but to one Indrapramati Vāsiṣṭha, who is not
known from elsewhere.
### 07-09
This tṛca is attributed to Vṛṣagaṇa Vāsiṣṭha, whose given name was
obviously extracted from vs. 8. All three vss. contain wild (or semi-wild) animals: a
boar in 7d, geese in 8a, and a “sharp-horned” (tigmáśṛṅga-) one in 9c, a descriptor of
vṛṣabhá-s generally.

### 07
In the expression kā́vyam uśáneva the first word is the acc. obj. of bruvāṇáḥ,
but it is also of course a play on the patrynomic of Uśanā, the differently accented
kāvyá-.
In d the publ. tr. takes padā́as neut. pl., based on IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás
padā́, … arṣati “Soma rushes towards the dear tracks of heaven,” adduced by Re.
However, it is also possible and, I now think, desirable to interpr. it as an instr. sg.
“along the track.” I would not interpr. the instr., with Ge, as “mit dem Fusse.”
On PREV eti rébhan# see IX.96.6=17, IX.97.1 (this hymn) and with emi
VII.18.22; “snorting” or “grunting” would be a better rendering of rébhan in the boar
context.

### 08
My interpr. of this vs. differs from the standard because I don’t interpr.
anything here as a PN, unlike Ge and to a lesser extent Re. In particular, tṛpálamanyú- is taken as PN by Gr, Ge, Re, Mayr (PN); Ge and (waveringly) both Old and
Mayr (PN) also so interpr. vṛ́ṣagaṇa-. As for the former, tṛpála- is also found in the
cmpd. tṛpála-prabharman- (X.89.5, where it is adjacent to ā́pānta-manyu-, with -
manyu- as here), both adj. applying to Soma. There is no question of a PN there. It is
also likely to be related to tṛprá- (VIII.2.5), also of Soma. See comm. ad loc., where I
accept Mayr’s (EWA s.v.) suggestion that tṛprá- means ‘sharp’. The other part of the
dyad, manyú-, is of course a well-attested common noun ‘battle fury’. I see no
obstacle to interpr. the phrase as “sharp battle fury,” referring to Soma’s martial
progress across the ritual ground.
In the standard tr. the geese of pāda a are in an unmarked simile, and the real
subj. is vṛ́ṣagaṇāḥ, which is either a PN (Ge) or a descriptor of officiants (Re: “Les
(officiants formant) un groupe mâle”). But again, nothing stands in the way of taking
the geese as the subj., modified by vṛ́ṣagaṇāḥ; after all, geese come in flocks! In my
view the geese are, metaphorically, the singers (so not too far from Re), who attend
the ritual in a flock. The point of comparison is the noise they make; cf., e.g., IX.32.3
ā́d īṃ haṃsó yáthā gaṇám, víśvasyāvīvaśan mátim “just as (the lead) wild goose
(sets) its flock (to honking), he has made the thought of everyone bellow.” The last
two vss. here (7-8) contrast the harsh noise made by Soma (compared to a boar, 7d)
with the equally harsh noise of honking geese, representing the ritual singers. This
may be far from the mellifluous singing we imagine, but, as I have long argued, the
root √ribh ‘rasp,’ etc. and its deriv. noun rebhá- do not flatter the sound of the
singers: they describe the squawking of birds of prey and the creaking of a wagon,
inter alia (see comm. ad VI.3.6, IX.66.9). Although the principal image here is of
noisily honking geese, the migratory travels of the geese (going from nearby us to
their [winter?] home) provide a secondary image. Because in real life the honking of
geese is generally perceived as they cross the sky in formation, the two images go
together.
Ge and Re take c with ab, with pávamānam another goal (beside Tṛpala
Manyu) of ayāsuḥ. I take it rather with d, and I think the 2nd hemistich softens and
repairs the uncompromising tunelessness of the noise in ab, by revising the depiction
of the singers. They are now “comrades,” and they speak forth (pra √vad, with
double acc.) to Soma “songful music” (āṅguṣyàm … vāṇám). Ge and Re take
āṅguṣyàm as modifying pávamānam, and in their favor the two words are adjacent.
But the only other occurrence of that stem modifies sā́man- ‘melody’ (I.62.2) and to
bleach it to ‘preislichen’ (for which there are already numerous other synonyms)
seems unfortunate. I would suggest that the prominent initial position of āṅguṣyàm in
c, far from its head noun at the end of d, results from this intention to re-cast the
harsh image of ab and do so as soon as possible.

### 09
This vs. presents a number of puzzles, esp. in pāda b.
The verb in pāda a, raṃhate, should be intransitive. I construe the acc. jūtím
loosely, as indicating the pace or speed at which Soma moves, which is compared to
that of Viṣṇu, who is regularly modified by urugāyá-, though the adj. is not exclusive
to him.
The phrase vṛ́thā krīḷánt- is also found in IX.21.3. It’s also worth noting that
vṛ́thā is also found with several instances of pā́jas- ‘face, dimension’ disc. below
(IX.76.1=88.5, 109.21).
The problems in pāda b center on the root affiliation of the verb mimate and
the function of ná. The phrase in question is mimate ná gā́vaḥ. The pāda is incisively
and persuasively discussed by Old, with whose analysis my own is in general
agreement. To begin with ná, both Ge and Re take it as neg., but as Old points out, its
position is against that. I think that it is the simile marker, but, unusually, marking
the verb that precedes it as to be read in two senses, rather than marking a nominal
phrase as the simile, as is its overwhelming use.
This brings us to the verb. Given the presence of cows, our first impulse is to
think ‘bellow’; cf., e.g., IX.33.4 gā́vo mimanti dhenávaḥ. But, though √mā ‘bellow’
does have the requisite redupl. pres. stem mímā-/ mím-, it is only active, as Old also
points out. I therefore think that ná here signals that mimate is an imperfect pun: it
gestures towards ‘bellow’, but cannot belong to ‘bellow’ because of the middle
voice. (Old also thinks the pun is present.) This accounts for my “as they seem to
bellow” in the publ. tr. The root to which the verb actually belongs is √mā
‘measure’, which also has a redupl. pres., which, however, is generally middle. The
voice of the verb in our passage thus favors √mā ‘measure’, though √mā ‘bellow’, at
least initially, seems to fit the context better. What can ‘measure’ contribute? This
question was ingeniously answered by Old: the cows, i.e., the milk mixture, “teilen
ihm das Mass zu.” They “give him their measure,” that is, provide him further
physical substance as he travels through the stages of his ritual preparation.
This image is continued in c, by the VP parīṇasáṃ kṛṇute. Although the acc.
is generally taken as a substantivized neut. to a them. adj. parīṇasá- derived from the
noun párīṇas- ‘fullness, profusion’ (so Gr; see AiG II.2.137), I consider it still an
adj., with which we should supply pā́jas- ‘face, dimension’. This has good support in
IX; cf. IX.76.1 = IX.88.5 vṛ́thā pā́jāṃsi kr̥ṇute “he deploys his full dimensions at
will” and with a different medial verb IX.68.3 pā́ja ā́dade “he assumed his full
dimension” (see also IX.109.21). The added milk allows him to expand and attain
ample size or measure. On the association of cows/milk with parīṇas(a)- see
VIII.45.24 gó-parīṇasa-, characterizing soma drinks. In the comm. ad VIII.45.24 I
suggest that the 2nd cmpd member is parīṇasá- as here (hence a 2nd occurrence of
that stem), not párīṇas- (per Gr, etc.).
Acdg. to Ge (n. 9cd), Re, Lü (267), pāda d depicts Soma as sun and moon.
This may well be, but I wonder if the source of the contrastive image is not the
Overnight (atirātrá) soma ritual.
### 10-12
This tṛca is attributed to Manyu Vāsiṣṭha, with the name possibly
extracted from the previous tṛca, where manyú- in 8a is taken by some as part of a
PN (see comm. above).
All three vss. contain a hemistich beginning índuḥ (10a, 11c, 12c); the verb
pavate appears in all three (10a, 11b, 12a), though this is hardly unusual. In addition
there is the presence of Indra (10b, 11c) or the gods in general (12b), as well as
shared vocabulary: hemistich-final mádāya (10b, 11d), √pṛc ‘infuse’ (11a, 12b),
\#devó devásya (11d) / #devó devā́n (12d). The net result is an impression of unity,
despite the lack of a striking shared theme and the unremarkable nature of the shared
material.

### 10  
The sense and derivation of gó-nyoghas- are disputed. Ge tr. “der die Kühe
würdigt” and tentatively connects the 2nd member with what he cites as ny òhate in
V.52.11. I do not construe ní with ohate in that passage (see comm. ad loc.), in part
because √uh does not otherwise appear with ní. The sense he attributes to the cmpd
is also rather jarring. He is followed in both sense (“respectant les vaches”) and
derivation by Re., who adds to the dossier of parallels I.180.5 gór óheṇa, which,
however, is too riddled with uncertainties (see comm. ad loc.) to provide good
evidence. By contrast Old considers BR’s conjectured emendation *gó-nyokas-
‘accustomed to cows’ (?—he doesn’t gloss) very likely. He rejects the view that the
cmpd as transmitted contains an s-stem oghas- ‘flood’, related to later Vedic ogha-,
aughá- ‘flood’ (even though he states that if we stick with the transmitted text he
would tr. “auf den die Kuh(milch) hernieder flutet”). This dismissal of a potential
*oghas- is shared by Mayr (EWA s.v. ogha-): “RV 9,97,10 gónyoghas- ist nicht für
ein ved. *oghas- ‘Strömung’ verwertbar.” Mayr instead tentatively follows the Ge/Re
interpr. (s.v. OH), “vielleicht ‘die Kühe preisend’ od. dgl.” I am puzzled by this
blanket rejection, esp. from Mayr, who cites (s.v. ogha-) with approbation Narten’s
positing (YH 221) of an Indo-Iranian root √*uag̯ h ‘fliessen’, found in ogha-, aughá-.
Admittedly, there is no independently attested s-stem *óghas-. But consider the
semantically and morphologically parallel gó-arṇas- (4x) ‘having a flood of cows’,
with the well-attested s-stem árṇas- ‘flood’. It is easy (at least for me) to imagine
that an s-stem *óghas- was coined in analogy to árṇas- for just this cmpd.

### 11  
The 2nd hemistich contains three pairs of phonological and (partly)
etymological figures: #índur índrasya, #devó devásya, matsaró mádāya#, with the 1st
two presenting matching nom.+gen. grammatical figures.

### 12  
The first pāda is alliterative: … priyā́ṇi pavate punānáḥ, while opening of
the 2nd is an etymological figure that matches the one opening 11d.
The referent of priyā́ṇi, the obj. or goal of abhí … pavate, is uncertain. In the
pub. tr. I supply ‘tracks’, on the basis of 7c padā́… abhy èti, as well as IX.12.8 abhí
priyā́divás padā́… arṣati “he rushes towards the dear tracks of heaven.” However,
as noted above, I no longer think padā́in vs. 7 is an acc. pl., and I am also more
moved by Ge’s cited parallel, IX.75.1 abhí priyā́ṇi pavate ..., nā́māni “he purifies
himself towards his own dear names.” But cf. also IX.57.2 abhí priyā́ṇi kā́vyā ...
arṣati. I would now be inclined to supply ‘names’ (“he purifies himself towards his
own dear names”), since Soma’s progress across the ritual ground to his names is a
trope (see comm. ad IX.75.1). But since there are a number of other referential
possibilities for the construction abhí priyā́(ṇi), it might be best simply to tr.
“towards his own dear (things).”
Pāda c is also puzzling: the phrase “clothing himself in his foundations”
(dhármāṇi … vásānaḥ) is not immediately interpretable, and there are no
illuminating parallels (at least that I have found). The adverbial ṛtuthā́“according to
the ritual order” suggests that the process of “clothing himself” involves following
the orderly steps of the sacrifice - which in turn suggests that Soma is making his
progress across the ritual ground, encountering first the waters, then the milk, before
arriving at his destination. I therefore think that the “foundations” here are the waters
and the milk - his supports, the materials of which the soma drink is built. But this
cannot be demonstrated.
### 13-15
No particular signs of cohesion in this tṛca, which is a collection of
soma tropes. If there is any unifying theme it is movement, with eti (13b), eṣi (14b,
c), arṣati (13d), arṣa (15d); for other repeated lexical items also pariṣicyámānaḥ
(14d), pári … siktáḥ (15d). Also the final vs. (15) begins with evā́, the common
hymn-ending summary particle - an effect that is muted in the publ. tr.
The poet is supposed to be Upamanyu Vāsiṣṭha, presumably following up on
the Manyu to whom the last tṛca was attributed.

### 13  
The part. nadáyan here (as well as the other 2 forms of this stem) is
universally taken as a trans.-caus. ‘causing to resound’ with Heaven and Earth as obj.
As I argue in my -áya-book (60-61), all 3 passages are better taken as intrans. In this
vs. the focus is on the noise that Soma makes; see esp. the parallel part.
abhikánikradat ‘constantly roaring’. And so intrans. ‘bellowing’ fits this pattern.
Note also IX.70.6 mātárā … nā́nadad eti “he goes bellowing to his two mothers
[=Heaven and Earth,” with the same config. of participle to √nad + eti + H+E.

### 14  
On saṃtaní- see comm. ad IX.69.2.

### 15  
As was noted just above, the hymn-summary quality of the evā́opening
this vs. is not sufficiently represented. I would now alter the tr. to “Just in this way
purify yourself …”
The etym. figure madiró mádāya is reminiscent of matsaró mádāya in the
previous tṛca (11d), and pāda-final mádāya is prominent in the first part of this hymn
(5b, 10b, 11d, 15a).
The identity of the ‘water-grabber’ (uda-grābhá-) is unclear. The best
suggestion, in my view, is Ge’s: Vṛtra. This interpr. entails an implicit identification
of Soma with Indra here, but this is not unprecedented: see for ex. the passages in
which Soma is called vṛtra-hán(tama)- (IX.1.3, 24.6), and note that in the 1st vs. of
this tṛca (13c) Soma’s voice is compared to Indra’s. Sāy. suggests ‘cloud’, but why
would Soma be fighting a cloud? Old has an ingenious, ritually oriented solution,
whereby udagrābhá- does not identify the (to-be-)vanquished enemy, but rather the
type of weapon Soma is using (the gen. thus depending directly on vadhasnaíh)-
namely the ritual ladle (Wasserschöpfer). He uses the power of water to vanquish an
unexpressed enemy, namely “die feindlichen Mächte.” Although Old rejects the
possibility that udagrābhá- refers to Vṛtra, in part because too much would need to
be supplied, in fact by his interpr. the hostile object itself would have to be supplied.
His solution also does not mesh with passages like I.165.6 víśvasya śátror ánamam
vadhasnaíḥ “I bowed with my weapons (those) of every rival,” which has the exact
syntactic configuration of our passage.
The expression in pāda c, “encompassing the glistening color,” presumably
refers to Soma’s incorporating the gleaming white milk - rendered clearly, if nonliterally, by Ge’s “weisse Farbe annehmend.”
### 16-18
This tṛca does seem to have a controlling theme and metaphor, esp. in
17-18 -- the passage through the filter, beginning in 16. Navigating among the curly
tufts is compared on the one hand to the triumphant progress of the Aryas (vs. 17)
and to a sort of moral progress in discriminating between the crooked and the
straight (18). Each vs. also contains a form of the impv. dhanva ‘run’ (16d, 17c, 18d).
The Anukramaṇī names Vyāghrapād (‘Tigerfoot(ed)’) Vāsiṣṭha as the poet, a
colorful name with no precedent in the text.

### 16  
The vs. contrasts easy travel (a: supáthā sugā́ni) with difficult travel (c:
duritā́ni); the contrast is signaled by su- / duṣ-, while two different roots for ‘go’
serve as 2nd cmpd. member, √gā (or √gam?) versus √i.
The part. kṛṇván in b should be supplied to govern supáthā sugā́ni in a.
Pace Ge and Re, I do not think naḥ should be construed with the ger. juṣṭvī́; it
is simply in Wackernagel’s position and goes better with supáthā sugā́ni.
For the loc. uraú see III.54.9 uraú pathí.
For ghanéva see comm. ad I.63.5.

### 17  
As Re hints, śaṃgáyī- is a species of univerbation of the common
expression śám + DAT “weal, luck for X.”
The 2nd hemistich of this vs. is very difficult. Decoding it is made somewhat
easier by recognizing the governing image: the progress of the Soma in and around
the tufts of wool on the sheepskin filter. The Soma is urged to ‘pull apart’ ví √ci the
bándhūn ‘bonds’; bándhu- is multivalent here. It refers on the one hand to the
physical bonds that exist between the wool tufts, blocking Soma’s progress. It is
notable that in VS 23.36 ví cinvantu has lóma ‘hair’ as object, and refers to the
separation of the hair of the sacrificial horse to mark the lines along which the
flaying knives are to follow. But bándhu- can also refer to bonds of kinship and
therefore to kin-groups. Here the 2nd sense of ví √ci, ‘discriminate’, is probably in
play, as Soma as representative of Ārya progress makes strategic alliances among
these groups.
Ge follows this 2nd interpr. still further by emending the unclear (indo) vāyū́n
to *indav *āyū́n, tr. “indem du … diese nächsten Freunde [=bándhū́n sj], die Āyu's,
aussucht.” In my opinion emending to Āyus doesn’t help much, and I don’t think
vāyū́n is as hopeless as he finds it - though I don’t think the path that Old and Re
follow is a convincing one either. They both take it, reasonably enough, as belonging
to the extremely well-attested stem vāyú- ‘wind’, and Old suggests that these winds
might be rain-bringing, thus relating to the vṛṣṭí- desired in the first hemistich. But
this takes us far from the fleece filter and the images it produces. I suggest instead
that it is a nonce formation to the pseudo-root √vā ‘weave’ (on which see, e.g., EWA
s.v. O, esp. p. 276), meaning ‘webs’ and again refers to the tangled non-linear paths
through the fleece. In this context the ‘weave’ sense would be available to the
audience. Re hints at a connection with ‘weave’ in his n., but his tr. doesn’t reflect it.
One of the curious features of this hemistich is that it is the simile that
contains the word that is closest to the actual physical object under discussion -
namely (*)stúka- ‘curl’, very close to ‘tuft’. Before discussing the meaning further, I
should comment on the form. The stem of this word is generally given as fem. stúkā-,
and there are certainly clear fem. forms (acc. stúkām AV VII.74.2, also by
implication the poss. adj. stukāvín- RV VIII.74.13, although the latter could show
lengthening at morpheme boundary [cf. dvayā-vín- and AiG II.2.917-18]). But
nothing forbids us from interpr. stúkā here as a neut. pl. to a them. stúka- (so already
Old), which immensely aids the interpr. of the passage, since a nom. ‘tuft, curl’
compared to the subj. Soma and commanded to run is close to senseless. One can
interpr. the relationship between fem. stúkā- and neut. stúka- in one of two ways.
Either the neut. stem was so common in bahuvrīhis modifying females - e.g., víṣitastukā ‘with unloosened curls’ of Rodasī in I.167.5 - that the 2nd member was
reinterpr. as fem. Or, again because of its presence in bahuvrīhis modifying females,
the originally fem. 2nd member was interpr. as -stuka-, with the fem. gender
appropriate only when a fem. was so characterized by a bahuvrīhi containing it.
Either way, I think we can confidently assume a neut. acc. pl. here, parallel to
bándhūn and vāyū́n. Soma is urged to pull apart the bándhūn “like straightened
curls/tufts.” That vītá- means ‘straight, straightened’ is clear from IV.2.11 cited by
Ge: cíttim ácittiṃ cinavad ví vidvā́n, pṛṣṭhéva vītā́vṛjinā́ca mártān “Insight and lack
of insight will the knowing one [=Agni] distinguish, like backs, straight and crooked,
(like) mortals,” where it is contrasted with vṛjiná- ‘crooked’, with both acting as
object of ví √ci as here. Cf. also the bahuvr. vītá-pṛṣṭha- ‘straight-backed’, vītá-vāra-
‘straight-tailed’. This adj. is likely derived from the root √vī ‘pursue’, as Gr suggests,
but seems synchronically distinct from the other uses of the ppl. to this root. Gr gives
it a separate lemma. Old suggests that stúkā … vītā́refers to “Kammwolle” or
worsted wool, that is (I learn from the internet), wool yarn that has been combed
rather than carded; carded yarn is fuzzier than worsted yarn. Whether this technical
interpr. is correct or not, it’s clear that the curls or tufts in question are easier to
navigate than those that are not vītá-.

### 18  
The “straight versus crooked” theme is continued here, and in fact the
expression vītā́vṛjinā́ca “straight and crooked” cited from IV.2.11 in the immed.
preceding comm. is lexically renewed (/clarified) by ṛjúṃ ca … vṛjináṃ ca, with a
better attested and unambiguous word for ‘straight’, ṛjú-. Again, Soma’s progress
across the tufted filter is the topic, made clearer by the use of gātú- ‘way’. Both Ge
and Re (also Ober II.60) take the verb ví ṣya only with pāda a and supply a new verb
(‘discriminate’ or the like) with b, relying perhaps too heavily on the model of
IV.2.11. I think literal unknotting is what’s at stake - finding a way between the
entangled wool tufts. Ge further suggests (n. 18a) that the unknotting refers to getting
rid of the stalk of the plant in the soma press, but the filter makes far more sense.
The two images in d seem oddly incoherent together: máryaḥ … pastiyā̀vān
“a man in his prime in possession of a dwelling place,” but a passage adduced by Ge
(n. 18d) demonstrates that the young man and the house go together: I.91.13 márya
iva svá okyè “(take pleasure) like a young man in his own home.” Perhaps the point
of the house-proud márya- is that a man in his prime, perhaps roughly the equivalent
of the later gṛhastha, should have achieved the goals of a mature life: a house and
household; Soma is implicitly likened to such a man after he has been purified and
acquired the water and milk that make him the fully prepared ritual substance, and
the pastyā̀- itself is the ritual ground. Ge’s parallel also neatly provides indirect
evidence for the semantic equivalence of pastyā̀- and okyà- ‘home’ and therefore
against the interpr. of pastyā̀- as ‘river’ (often indeed by Ge; see, e.g., IX.65.23,
though he tr. it here as Haus). See comm. ad I.40.7.
### 19-21
Attributed to Śakti Vāsiṣṭha, who, unlike most of the other Vasiṣṭhids
named by the Anukr. for this hymn, has other vss. attributed to him: VII.32.26,
IX.108.3, 14-16. The tṛca is more concerned with the gods’ consumption of soma
than previous ones; note the “divine conclave” (devátāte) in 19a, the invitation to the
gods to come to the sacrifice to drink soma in 20d, and the pursuit of the gods
(devávītim) in 21a. The final verse of the tṛca (21) also begins with a hymnsummarizing evā́and the type of plea for benefits that often end a hymn. The first
two vss. of the tṛca also contain forms of √dhanv: impv. dhanva (19b) and dhanvanti
(20c), thus continuing the repeated impv. dhanva of the previous tṛca - with this
concatenation suggesting a reason for attaching this tṛca here.

### 19  
Pāda b pári ṣnúnā dhanva sā́no ávye is identical to 16d ádhi ṣnúnā dhanva
sā́no ávye save for the preverb.

### 20  
The publ. tr. dispenses with the rel. prn. in pāda a, as tr. the hemistich as a
rel. cl. seemed clunky.
Note the alliteration of ab araśmā́no yé arathā́áyuktā, átyāso ná sasṛjānā́sa
ājaú.
.
### 22-24
Karṇaśrut Vāsiṣṭha, a name that has no source in the text and is not
otherwise found in the Anukr. This tṛca depicts Soma as a king on a royal journey,
and associates him with the resonant words ṛtá- (23b, 24d) and dhárman- (22b) /
dharmán- (23c) and the traditional roles they imply.

### 22  
I read yádī in pāda a as yád ī ‘when him’. Note the parallel īm in pāda c,
before a vowel (īm āyan), while our ī occurs before m (ī mánaso) and could in
principle represent a degeminated *īm mánaso (though I don’t think this is nec.). As
Ge (n. 22ab) implies, the point of this pāda is that the ritual speech of the priest-poet
essentially creates the sacral drink soma [/god Soma] from the mere juice of the
soma plant.
I do not, however, follow Ge’s interpr. (in the same n.) of b, as meaning that
this speech was roused by the prospect of the dakṣiṇā. I am in fact tempted to follow
Old’s rather despairing comment, “Der mystischen Verbrämung dieses Gedankens in
b weiss ich keine Deutung abzugewinnen.” He finds the other three pādas clear, with
the sense that when speech has fashioned soma (or the milk streams, also possible in
Old’s opinion), the milk streams stream to the soma. Accepting this as the overall
intent of the verse, I think there is some sense - at least structural sense - that can be
wrung from b. To begin with, we must focus on the vā. Insofar as I can follow his
rendering Ge implicitly interprets the vā as loosely contrasting the fashioning from
the mind of the seer with that fashioning under the circumstances set out in b, but his
tr. seems to me not really German (“So oft ihn die Rede aus dem Geiste des
schauenden (Sehers) heraus formte oder bei der Entscheidung angesichts des besten
Stückes Vieh”). Klein’s rendering (DGRV II.147), which seems to follow the
structure envisioned by Ge though with somewhat different content, does not seem to
me to be English either: “When speech (arising) from the mind of the seer fashioned
(it., viz. soma) or in the establishment (of the worship) in the presence of the best
cow.” Re at least tries to impose some parallelism between a and b, taking dhármaṇi
in b as an infinitive that is roughly parallel to the finite verb tákṣat in a: “Quand la
parole (née) de l'esprit du Voyant eut faconné (le soma), ou (quand il s'agissait d')
établir (le sacrifice) en présence du plus puissant bétail.”
None of these basically clausal or pseudo-clausal interpr. seems to me correct
(or even parsable). I instead think that the domain of vā is only pāda b, and that it is
conjoining two locative phrases: jyéṣṭhasya … dhármaṇi and kṣór ánīke. If I am
correct, we are dealing with an example of inverse vā (X vā Y), rather than the
standard X Y vā - a pattern that Klein (DGRV II.139) considers rare but existent. In
our case vā is inserted in the middle of the first, complex member, giving a pattern X
vā X’ Y Y’. But at least vā would be doing its usual job, conjoining parallel nominal
expressions, each consisting of a loc. plus dependent gen. Here each would define the
conditions or locations under which the fashioning of pāda a occurred. The first of
the choices is “on the foundation of the preeminent one”; in the publ. tr. I suggest
that the preeminent one could be either Agni or Indra, both of whom are elsewhere
characterized as jyéṣṭha-. I now think this is incorrect. Instead I would invoke the
two other expressions in IX with loc. to dhárman- + GEN, both ṛtásya dhárman
(IX.7.1, 110.4) “on the foundation of truth.” Although ṛtá- does not seem to be
qualified as jyéṣṭha- elsewhere, “preeminent truth” is hardly a jarring expression in
RV discourse. Here “on the foundation of preeminent (truth)” would refer physically
to the ritual ground and conceptually to the truth that governs the sacrificial
enterprise. See also comm. on the next vs.
The other loc. expression is harder to interpr. I will start by saying that I
accept the interpr. of kṣú- as ‘cattle’ (< *pśu-), going back to Bloomfield (IF 25
[1909]), rejected here by Old, but reaffirmed by Thieme (ZDMG 95 [1941] 347 =
KlSch 51), and now generally accepted (see all tr. cited above, as well as EWA s.v.).
But what does “face-to-face with the cattle” (publ. tr.) or possibly “at the forefront of
cattle” / “in front of cattle” mean in context (or even, indeed, out of context)? I have
two suggestions, though neither of them makes a neat disjunctive pair with the first
loc. phrase. The stronger suggestion is that this is a temporal expression, referring to
dawn. The stem ánīka- is several times used in this way; cf. VI.47.5 (with loc.)
uṣásām ánīke “at the forefront of the dawns,” V.76.1 uṣásām ánīkam “the face of the
dawns.” Esp. apposite for our passage is I.124.11 yuṅkté gávām aruṇā́nām ánīkam
“She [=Dawn] yokes the forefront of the ruddy cows,” with the cows a reference to
the reddish rays of dawn. Since Dawn and her rays are frequently assimilated to
cows and ánīka- is used to indicate the moment of the appearance of dawn / dawn’s
rays, a shorthand expression “at the forefront of the cattle” could, it seems to me, be
a way of saying “at dawn.” This would make the two locative phrases conjoined by
vā conceptually non-parallel (though still syntactically parallel), but I think this
looseness is within acceptable limits, as offering two alternative ways of identifying
the circumstances of the fashioning of Soma by speech: “on the foundation of
preeminent (truth) or at the forefront of cattle [=dawn].” I would now emend the tr.
in that way. Alternatively “in front of cattle” could refer to the place on the ritual
ground where Soma encounters the milk mixture - which milk then comes to him.
This would more narrowly define the location than the first locative phrase, which
gives the whole ritual ground as the locus. The 2nd possibility provides a better set of
parallels with vā - both locational - but I prefer the 1st because of the use of ánīkawith dawn elsewhere.

### 23  
Since √pū does not appear with prá, it’s best to supply a verb of motion
with the prá opening pāda a and take b (with pavate) separately. Note the alliteration
in pāda a … dānudó divyó dānu(-pinváḥ).
This vs. identifies Soma as ‘truth’ (ṛtám b) and also contains in c the
possessive internal deriv. dharmán- to dhárman-. If I am correct that jyéṣṭhasya …
dhármaṇi in the immed. preceding vs. 22b should be interpr. “on the foundation of
preeminent (truth -- ṛtásya), both resonant words, ṛtá- and dhárman-/dharmán-, were
already implicitly present in the previous vs. In 23 Soma is then depicted as the
embodiment of these words (cf. Ge’s “das (verkörperte) Gesetz” for ṛtám), and they
define his kingship (rā́jā in c, also in 24b). Unfortunately it does not seem possible to
signal the dhárman- / dharmán- connection in English tr., but ‘possessor of the
(royal) mandate’ may be too specialized for the latter. Perhaps better ‘founder,
foundation-giver, institutor, maintainer’. On Soma as “truth” see also IX.107.15 and
IX.108.8.
The ten reins are presumably the fingers of the presser, as is usual for ten
anything in IX.
### 23-24
These two vss. each contain the injunc. (/subj.) aor. bhuvat, which in
both cases I tr. as an immed. past: “he has become.” After considerable disc. with IH,
I now think that this particular form can also express a generic or habitual role or
behavior of the subject, which IH felicitously renders with the colloquial “he be-s
X.” I am therefore now inclined to alter the tr. of both vss. to “he is the king …” / “he
is, now as before, the wealth-lord …” In the absence of a non-colloquial Engl.
habitual/generic, “is” will have to do.

### 24  
The two words making up the VP in d, ṛtám bharat, appear also in vs. 23,
though not together (ṛtám ṛtā́ya b, bhāri d). As is pointed out by KH (implicitly:
Injunc. 122 and esp. n. 34) and Ober (II.121), this appears to be an Indo-Iranian
phrase, and it thus invests Soma with yet more traditional dignity. The pāda thus
deserves a more solemn tr. than I gave it in the publ. tr. - perhaps “the drop bears the
dear truth that is well worth the bearing.”
Although the morphological means are different, the lexical duplication in
both rayipátī rayīṇā́m (c) and ṛtám bharat súbhṛtam (d) gives the end of this tṛca a
stately and archaic air.
### 25-27
Like the tṛca 19-21, this one focuses in great part on the gods as
drinkers of soma and the desire to bring them to the ritual; the “pursuit” (vītím) of
Indra and Vāyu in 25b is reprised in devā-vī́- ‘pursuing the gods’ in 26a, while the
gods are mentioned twice in 27ab. The final vs. also begins with the typical hymnsummarizing evā́as three times elsewhere in this hymn (vss. 13-15, 19-21, 34-36).
The poet is named as Mṛḍīka Vāsiṣṭha, who is also the poet of X.150. In the latter
hymn his name is clearly drawn from the dat. mṛḍīkā́ya found in the refrain of every
vs., but there is no such basis here.

### 26  
The publ. tr. omits the enclitic naḥ; it should be revised to “Pursuing the
gods for us while …”
Ge takes kṣáyam in b as an Inhaltsakk. (“… sollen … ein Haus …
herströmen” (sim. but more elaborate, Re). But a dwelling place is a particularly
unlikely object to “stream,” and I prefer to see it as goal (as also Scar 398).
The hapax in d, diviyáj-, has (at least) two possible meanings: ‘sacrificing at
day(break)’ as I take it, and ‘sacrificing (to the gods) in heaven’ (so Ge, Re). See
Ge’s n. and Scar (398-99). There is nothing in the context that tips the balance one
way or the other; I prefer the temporal reading because the other one requires more
material to be understood. The word also appears in a metrically disturbed pāda; as it
stands it has 12 syllables and a cadence (- ⏑ ⏑ ×) that is bad for both Triṣṭubh and
Jagatī. Old suggests the possibility of reading the 1st member of diviyáj- as a
monosyllable, either *divyájaḥ or *dyuyájaḥ, which would at least produce an 11-syl.
line, and these possibilities are disc. in more detail by Scar without a firm conclusion.

### 27  
The summary evā́might be more emphatically rendered as “in just this
way” or sim. The “conclave of the gods” (devátāte) returns from 19a. As Ge points
out, the whole hemistich is almost identical to IX.96.3, save for evā́in place of sá
naḥ and devapā́naḥ for indrapā́naḥ.
The ppl. in the periphrasis in d, smási hitā́ḥ, could belong either to √dhā or to
√hi (so Sāy.). It is actually not clear to me which one Ge favors from his “denn wir
sind in grossem Wettstreit begriffen” (and his n. 27c doesn’t entirely clarify). Re
clear chose √dhā: “Avec ambition [maháś cid?] nous nous sommes en vérité placéś
dans la compétition.” I favor √hi: I think the point is that we are “driven” / “hardpressed” in the hostile encounter, and we need divine help - which we will only get
once they have partaken of our soma. But there are several logical steps missing in
every interpr.
### 28-30
Attributed to Vasukra Vāsiṣṭha, who is not otherwise known - though a
Vasukra Aindra is supposedly responsible for the devilish trio of hymns X.27-29.
The tṛca is marked by the repetition of ā́pavasva in the 2nd hemistich of each vs.
(28d, 29c, 30d) expressing the various good things we want Soma to bring us
through his self-purification. The root √sṛj ‘surge’ is also prominent in the 2nd two
vss. (29a, 30a).

### 28  
The opening of the vs., áśvo ná kradaḥ, is very close to 18c átyo ná
kradaḥ. The first hemistich contains three animals, incl. the fairly rare lion. Ge, fld.
by Re, identifies the bulls as the priests.

### 29  
I take the hapax sanítra- in its full lexical value, as a ‘means of winning’,
rather than the bleached Spende, Gabe (Gr), Lohn (Ge), le bénéfice (Re) that
prevails. On the accent of the word (and other -tra-stems to seṭ roots), see AiG
II.2.701-2, which also glosses the word as I do: ‘Mittel des Gewinnens’, flg. Ludwig.

### 30  
I take áhnām as a 2nd, unmarked simile dependent on sárgāḥ, rather than
supplying a different headnoun, as Ge and Re do. They are surely both right that “the
surges of/from heaven” are the rains. As for “the surges of the days,” this could
either refer to the passage of time or to an abundance of light; I favor the former.
In b ná should be read as both the simile particle and the negation; see Old.
Pādas b-c show a clever chaining of significant vocabulary. In b Soma is
compared to a king who doesn’t violate his alliance, with mitrá- in its common noun
usage. But d contains the part. yatāná- ‘taking one’s place, being put in place’, and
√yat is an action esp. associated with the god Mitra. Cf., e.g., VII.36.2 jánaṃ ca
mitró yatati “Mitra puts the people in their place” (sim. III.59.1). Although Mitra is
not explicitly present here, the lexical continuity might evoke him. It is indeed
possible that it is Mitra’s intentions (or those of the alliance itself) acdg. to which
Soma takes his place, rather than “ours” as in the publ. tr.
The vs. ends with yet another term relating to social life, namely víś- ‘clan’;
as king, Soma would exert himself on behalf of this social unit.
### 31ff.
As noted in the publ. intro., the tṛca divisions seem to continue in this
2nd half of the composite hymn, although the Anukr. attributes the remaining vss. to
just two poets, Parāśara Śāktya (31-44) and Kutsa Āṅgirasa (45-58), an apporioning
that does not conform to the presumed tṛca division (splitting the tṛca 43-45 between
the two). Both poets are known from elsewhere: Parāśara Śāktya is the poet of I.65-
73 and Kutsa Āṅgirasa of I.94-98 and I.101-15.
### 31-33
The first vs. of the tṛca contains a form of √sṛj, thus concatenating with
the previous tṛca. Both the first (31) and last (33) vss. contain a reference to the sun,
and I see one in the middle vs. as well; see comm. ad 32.

### 31  
The skeleton of pāda a, (prá te) dhā́rā (mádhumatīr) asṛgran, is identical to
29a (śatáṃ) dhā́rā (devájātā) asṛgran.
The publ. tr. renders pávase as if it were an imperative; correct to “you purify
yourself.”
I take “domain of cows” (dhā́ma gónām) in c to indicate that Soma is the
substance into which the milk is mixed. Since the milk is sometimes identified as the
sun, his swelling of the sun in d may refer to Soma’s providing more body and
amplitude to the milk.
As often, arká- can be read as a pun.

### 32  
The “domain for the cows” is echoed here by the “domain of the immortal
one” (amṛ́tasya dhā́ma). As with the same phrase in IX.94.2 (q.v.), I suggest that the
immortal one is the sun, and perhaps specifically milk as representative of the sun.
The role of the sun in the surrounding vss. (31d, 33d) supports this interpr. For
alternative interpr. of the phrase, see comm. ad IX.94.2. In our passage Re (sim. Lü
467) suggests that it is actually nom. and refers to Soma, but in IX.94.2 it must be an
acc. obj. (also acdg. to Re).
The cadence of c is bad as transmitted, but can be easily fixed by reading
*matsarā-vān with the common lengthening of the stem vowel -a- before -vant- and
-van-; see Old, in agreement with Arnold. The stem is a hapax, and it is clearly a
morphological variant of matsarín(-tama)- (4x), with a different possessive suffix. In
fact, our pāda is a nonce Triṣṭubh adaptation of the Jagatī line IX.76.5 sá índrāya
pavase matsaríntamaḥ. For further disc. see comm. ad IX.76.5. The
interchangeability of -vant- and -ín- for metrical purposes speaks against the two
possessive suffixes having crucial functional differences.
The initial sá in both our pāda and the one on which it is based does not
follow my rules for sá 2nd-ps. reference. On this aberrancy see comm. ad IX.76.5,
where it can be motivated. That pāda was then simply borrowed (and slightly altered)
here.

### 33  
The form cakṣi (also VII.3.6) is in both of its occurrences pretty clearly an
impv., but its formation is something of a puzzle. It appears to be a -si impv. (so
Baum, Imperative, 46, 107, with no disc.), but it has none of the standard supports for
such a form. Not only does it not have an s-aor. subjunctive, but it has no aorist
forms at all, and almost all the occurrences of its well-attested root pres. are medial.
And of course, assuming it belongs to √cakṣ, the form would have to be degeminated
from *cakṣ-ṣi (though that would not be hard). The parallel passage IX.71.9 has a
medial injunc. to the marginal thematic stem (see KH 122 n. 33): divyáḥ suparṇó 'va
cakṣata kṣā́m. I have no explanation for this aberrant form; it is true that the proper
med. impv. to the root pres. cakṣva (3x) would not fit this metrical slot, but that
doesn’t seem reason enough to invent cakṣi.
### 34-36
All three vss. concentrate on ritual speech and on the noisy approach of
both cows and poets to Soma. This theme takes up 32d, where Soma impels his own
speech in concert with the productions of the poets. The final vs., 36, begins with
hymn-summarizing evā́.

### 34  
On the “three voices” (tisró vā́caḥ) see comm. ad IX.33.4, 50.2.
The parallel expressions in c and d -- … yanti … PTCLE contrast the progress
of ritual substance (milk) and ritual speech (thoughts). As elsewhere, vāvaśānā́ḥ
could belong to both √vāś ‘bellow’ and √vaś ‘desire, be eager’ (cf. IX.93.4, 95.4).
Given the emphasis on noise in this tṛca, the former is probably primary, but both
can be meant - hence my tr. “bellowing eagerly.”

### 35  
The first two pādas of this vs. are variants of the last two of the previous
vs. (34cd), with the repeated yanti of 34 gapped, and redistribution of some of the
lexicon: the two participles in 34cd, prchámānāḥ and vāvaśānā́ḥ, switch positions,
with each paired with a more natural subject (cows bellowing 35a, poets asking 35b),
and the thoughts of 34d are relegated to the instr. in 35b with their producers, the
viprā́ḥ, taking over the subject role in 35b, again a more natural configuration. We
can consider 35ab as a complex poetic repair of 34cd.

### 36  
The hymn-summary evā́could once again be rendered more forcefully: “in
just this way” vel sim.
### 37-39
I do not see any signs of unity in this tṛca. All three vss. contain a
participle of √pū in passive function, pūnāná- in 37, 38, pūyámāna- in 39, but this is
hardly remarkable in the Soma maṇḍala.

### 37  
In pāda a vípraḥ … matīnā́m reprises víprā matíbhiḥ of 35b in concatenary
fashion. For further on this phrase see below.
Gr, Ge, and Re, as well as Lü (439), take ṛtā́as neut. pl., but this disturbs the
syntax, and the tr. all must supply a verb to govern it. I suggest that it is instead the
instr. sg. Re explicitly rejects this possibility on the grounds that it would be
morphologically isolated. If he means that it would be the only such instr. to this
stem, he seems to be correct, but given that the -ā instr. to them. stems is in retreat,
this isolation would not be surprising. If he means that them. neuters don’t have instr.
in -ā, this is not correct: Lanman (Noun infl., 335) considers them more frequent than
to the masc. and counts 77. Whether all his exx. would hold up under closer scrutiny
is irrelevant: 77 would be difficult to reduce to 0.
The standard tr. also construe gen. pl. matīnā́m with ṛtā́, whatever sense they
ascribe to ṛtā́, e.g., Ge “die rechten Wege der Gedanken,” Lü “zu den Wahrheiten der
Gedanken.” They may be correct, and I could revise my tr. accordingly: “In
accordance with the truth of the thoughts, Soma …” However, the association of
vípra- with matí- is very strong - I just noted it in 35b in the previous tṛca, and the
two words occur in the same pāda numerous times: I.82.2=VIII.25.24 víprā … matī́,
I.86.2 víprasya … matīnā́m, II.24.13 vípraḥ … matī́, III.5.3 vípraḥ … matīnā́m,
III.30.20=50.4 matíbhiḥ … víprāḥ, IV.3.16 matíbhir vípraḥ, V.80.1 víprāso matíbhiḥ,
VII.78.2 víprāso matíbhiḥ, IX.63.21 matī́víprāḥ, IX.85.7 víprāṇāṃ matáyaḥ,

> 107.24  
víprāso matíbhiḥ, X.6.5 víprāso matíbhiḥ, X.25.10 matíṃ víprasya,
X.64.16 matíbhiḥ … vípraḥ, X.123.1 víprā matíbhiḥ; cf. also IX.71.3, X.11.6 vépate
matī. 

I therefore construe matī̃nā́m with vípraḥ in the publ. tr., as a loosely
descriptive gen.
In cd the phrase mithunā́saḥ … adhvaryávaḥ is taken by Ge (fld. by Re) as
referring to the pair (or presumably multiple pairs, given the pl.) of Adhvaryu and
Hotar. Although at least I.83.2, which he adduces for this sense, does seem to refer to
that pair of two priests, in the dual, I think the pl. here instead refers to rivalrous
priests at competing sacrifices, which must be implicit in Ge’s rendering, given the
pl. They could be pairs of Adhvaryu and Hotar or (more likely in my opinion) just
multiple Adhvaryus, each performing in a separate sacrifice.

### 38  
The interpr. of this vs. is fairly straightforward, except for the 2nd part of
pāda a, sū́re ná dhā́tā. I have treated this simile at length In my Fs. Melchert article,
“Sū́re Duhitár's Brother, the ‘Placer of the Sun’: Another Example of -e <*-as in
Rigvedic Phrasal Sandhi,” 2010. I will not repeat the disc. here but will summarize
the conclusions. The major problem in this simile is what to do with the apparent loc.
sū́re ‘in the sun’ (to sū́ra-; or possibly, but less likely, dat. to svàr); this has led to
some outlandish and unpersuasive interpr. of the phrase. I argue that sū́re is actually
the old gen. to svàr, from *sū́raz before voiced dental stop, as in the well-known sū́re
duhitā́“daughter of the sun” in I.34.5. I start with an archaic formula *sū́re dhā́tā
“placer of the sun,” with the two words separated here by the simile particle ná and
the true interpr. obscured. The “placer of the sun” is most likely Indra, and Soma is
being compared to him in his cosmogonic role: filling the two worlds and revealing
them.
The word order in the 2nd clause of b, ví ṣá āvaḥ, is worth noting. Both
preverb in tmesis and sá seek 1st position, and sá overwhelmingly occupies 1st
position, as a glance at Lubotsky shows. Perhaps to maintain sá’s 1st position
tendency, often when a clause has both a preverb and sá, the preverb will remain in
position before the verb (e.g., I.105.4 sá tád dūtó ví vocati; also pāda d in this vs.: sá
… prá yaṃsat). But it seems from a rapid survey that when a preverb is in tmesis, it
regularly wins 1st position over sá -- e.g., III.59.2 prá sá …, VIII.20.16 abhí ṣá ... --
with Wackernagel’s position material imposed between—e.g., prá vaḥ sá …,
VIII.21.10 ā́tú naḥ sá … Our brief clause shows this PREV sá order.
As Old suggests, in c priyā́is governed either directly or indirectly by the 2nd
member of the cmpd. priya-sā́saḥ ‘winning dear things’: “those winning dear things
(win) dear things.” The effect is rather like the type gaṇā́nām gaṇápati- “troop lord
of troops” (II.23.1), though the means are different. As for priya-sā́saḥ, its stem is
given as them. priya-sá- by Gr., and it would have the doubled nom. pl. ending
familiar from devā́saḥ, etc. However, it seems possible (and in my opinion desirable)
to interpr. it as belonging to a root noun -sā́-. The rt. noun nom. pl. to -ā-stems is
ordinarily -āḥ, which is identical to the nom. sg. Though several cmpds in -sā́- do
have this nom. pl. (dhanasā́ḥ VIII.3.15, X.65.10; sadāsā́ḥ IV.16.21, sahasrasā́ḥ
X.64.6), the nom. sg. -sā́ḥ is far more common. In a passage like this, where there
are no other nom. pl. forms to support the nom. pl. interpr. (as there are in the -sā́ḥ
nom. pl. passages just cited), doubly marking the nom. pl. would make sense. Scar
(585) seems to be leaning in that direction, but doesn’t actually say so.
Parallel to the dative kāríṇe ná “as if to a victor” in the simile, we can assume
“to us” vel sim. in the frame. So Ge.

### 39  
Pāda a contains another etymological doubling, vardhitā́várdhanaḥ
“strengthening strengthener,” rather like the doubling of priyá- in 38c.
Note the allit. in c: … pū́rve pitáraḥ padajñā́ḥ.
The expression gā́ádrim uṣṇán “burned the cows out of the rock” is, to say
the least, unusual - and on those grounds disputed. A long tradition, going back to
Benfey, emends the text to *muṣṇán ‘stole’, with degemination in the sequence ádrim 
(m)uṣṇán. This emendation is accepted by, inter alia, Ge and Bloomfield (RR ad
I.62.2 and Conc.). There is one strong arg. in favor of the change: √muṣ ‘steal’ is
formulaically embedded in the Vala myth (see Ge’s n. 39d and, e.g., I.93.4 yád
ámuṣṇītam … paṇím gā́ḥ “when you two stole the cows from the niggard”). Other
possible args. are inconclusive: both √muṣ and √uṣ have a 9th class pres., though the
latter is only represented by one other form, part. uṣṇán in II.4.7 - but √uṣ is a
poorly attested root. The preverb abhí found in our passage does not appear with
either root. In the end the clinching arg. seems to me to come from Old, who does
not accept the emendation: the meter. The proposed change converts a good cadence
into a bad one. Bl. (RR) argues “that the change from ádrim muṣṇán to ádrim uṣṇán
was made by the redactor in deference to the meter.” But why would the poet have
produced a bad cadence in the first place? I think it more likely that the poet was
playing on the rhyming roots √muṣ and √uṣ, with full knowledge that the former is
the standard one in the Vala myth, and he is forcing us to invent a new and more
difficult image with the latter root. By supplying us with jyótiṣā he is providing us
with the means to do so. Old adduces X.87.12 jyótiṣā … ny òṣa “with light burn
down …,” comparable to our … jyótiṣā / yénā … uṣṇán and with a verb form of √uṣ.
A poet who could deploy the “placer of the sun” formula in the manner he did in the
previous vs. is surely capable of such a sly play on words.
### 40-42
No particular unity detectable in the tṛca, though the 2nd two vss. do
focus on Soma’s role in strengthening and exhilarating the gods.

### 40  
The verb vāvṛdhe in d concatenates with vardhitā́várdhanaḥ in 39a.
Ge’s tr. of pāda a, “Der Ocean hat gebrüllt bei seiner ersten Ausbreitung,”
seems to imply (though this is not a necessary interpr. of his tr.) that the samudrá- is
a different entity from Soma himself, and his cited IX.107.23 tváṃ samudrám
prathamó ví dhārayaḥ “You were [/are] the first to to spread out the sea” (with both
samudrá- and ví √dhṛ) certainly depicts them as separate. However, IX.86.29 tváṃ
samudró asi …, távemā́ḥ páñca pradíśo vídharmaṇi “You are the sea, …; yours are
these five regions in your [/their] expansion” (also with samudrá- and the -n-stem
loc. vídharman/-ṇi as here) asserts the identity of Soma and the samudrá-. Since
forms of √krand ‘roar’ in IX (like ákrān here) have Soma as their subject (incl. in
vss. 13, 18, 28, 32, 33 in this hymn), the identification of Soma and the sea seems
assured here.

### 42  
The infinitival dat. iṣṭáye is generally taken to mean “to hasten, for
hastening” here (Ge “dass er rasch komme”; Re “afin qu’il se hâte”; Klein GDGRV I.68 “for hastening”; and cf. EWA s.v. EṢ
2 citing Ge’s tr. for just this passage). But I
am puzzled as to which root √iṣ the sense ‘hasten’ is supposed to belong to: we have
√iṣ ‘seek, desire’ and √iṣ ‘send, set in motion’. It is to the latter that EWA refers this
form (and I assume that the others would also connect the two), but either there has
to be a de-valencing of the root (from ‘set in motion’ to ‘be in motion’ - but there are
no forms to this root with intrans. value) or the form has to be covertly passive (‘to
be set in motion’, hence ‘to move’). I think it belongs rather to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’ and
means ‘for seeking, for the quest’. In my view all 20 exx. of iṣṭáye can be united
under this rubric. See also comm. ad I.112.1 and VII.92.3. In this particular case
Vāyu’s quest is for soma, and upon having received it, he benefits us. So the double
dative iṣṭáye rā́dhase ca is a bit of a zeugma, in that these beneficial datives are for
the benefit of different parties, though the satisfaction of the second depends on the
success of the first.
### 43-45
The tṛca has a superficial unity from the (over-)abundance of forms of
√pū, esp. in the middle vs.: pavasva 43a, 44a, 44b, 44d; pávamānaḥ 44c; punānáḥ
45c (the only form of √pū in this vs., and belonging to a different stem). Otherwise
there is little to hold it together. The supposed transition between the poets Parāsara
Śaktya and Kutsa Āṅgirasa happens after vs. 44, but as noted in the publ. intro., this
change of poets seems unlikely.

### 43  
The first hemistich introduces a note of aggression, but this quickly
dissipates. The oppositional pair ‘straight’ (ṛjú-) and ‘crooked’ (vṛjiná-) recurs from
vs. 18, where, unlike here, it was a morally neutral description of the paths across the
sheep’s fleece filter.
I do not understand the doubling of abhí in pāda c, esp. since abhí seems to
add little to this idiom.

### 44  
Note the (s)va repetition: mádhvaḥ ... pavasva vásva ... pavasva ...
svádasva ... pavasva.
As in IX.96.14 (see comm. ad loc.), I take the acc. with pavasva as expressing
a transformation of soma into the substance expressed in the acc. This use of pavasva
with the acc. contrasts with that of ā́pavasvā in pādas b and d, where ā́adds the
sense ‘bring here by purification’ and the acc. expresses the materials thus obtained.
On sū́da- see comm. ad VII.36.3. I argue there that, contra most views, it
belongs with the ‘sweet’ words, and in fact that in this passage svádasva …
pávamānaḥ in c is a virtual gloss (or poetic repair) of sū́dam pavasva in a.
### 46-48
Again very few signs of cohesion as a whole, though the 1st and last
vss. have a few echoes: rathiráḥ (46c, 48a) and a satyá-X bahuvrīhi (satyá-śuṣma46c, satyá-manman- 48d), as well as camū́- (46b, 48b). Also, assuming that the
“daughter” in 47b is the Daughter of the Sun (as most do), both 46 and 47 have ref.
to the sun.

### 47  
In pāda b my interpr. differs significantly from that of Ge (fld. by Re) and
that favored by Old., though all of us assume that “daughter” is short for “daughter
of the Sun.” Ge takes duhitúḥ as abl. and assumes an idiom ABL X tiráḥ √dhā “hide
X from …,” an ex. of which he cites from the Kena Up., which seems a distant text
from which to harvest a parallel. He takes the várpāṃsi as Soma’s own forms, but
does not suggest why Soma would want to keep them hidden from the Sun’s
daughter. I instead take duhitúḥ as gen., dependent on várpāṃsi, which Old considers
the more natural construal. Since the acc. with medial tiráḥ √dhā expresses the
medium in which the subject hides himself (at least in my view: see comm. ad
IX.73.3), in our passage here Soma hides himself “in the forms of the daughter (of
the Sun)” - a designation of milk, since the gleaming white milk is often assimilated
to the sun. I see the same idiom in IX.72.3, though more disguised: see extensive
comm. there. The reference, of course, is to the mixing of soma with milk.
The following pāda provides a different but parallel image of the mixing of
soma with water, with the more widespread trope of “clothing himself in.”
The last pāda provides a clever multilevel play, as long as rébhan is properly
interpr. As I have often disc. (incl. ad vs. 8 above), √ribh does not mean ‘sing’ as it’s
usually glossed, but rather expresses a variety of harsh sounds: rasp, creak, squawk,
and crackle. In this pāda Soma is compared to a Hotar priest. But the quintessential
Hotar is actually the god Agni, the ritual fire - and fires crackle. So the comparison
is to the sound of a lively burning fire, but mediated through the priest.
### 49-51
In contrast to the tṛcas with faint or no signs of cohesion, this one is
over-determined. The verbal lexeme that dominates is abhí √ṛṣ: the preverb abhí
opens every one of the 12 pādas, and the impv. arṣa/ā is found in the first pāda of
every vs. (49a, 50a, 51a). The part. pūyámānaḥ ends the first hemistich of each vs.
Most of the rest of the material consists of acc. goals of motion. The goals in the first
vs. of the tṛca are gods, in the first half of the 2nd vs. the substances with which
Soma will be mixed, and in the rest of the tṛca those things that we want Soma to
provide us. The result is a tṛca of utmost banality, enlivened by a small play of words
in the last pāda.

### 49  
Old, Ge, Re identify the acc. goal in c as Pūṣan, because dhījávana-
‘quickening insightful thought’ is used in a simile comparing Soma to Pūṣan in

### 03
pūṣéva dhījávano ‘si soma, which is, of course, a good arg. But Pūṣan
doesn’t cut much of a figure in IX, does not really belong in this exalted company
(Vāyu, Mitra+Varuṇa, Indra - though see the list in IX.81.4-5), and is not an
appropriate referent for the other words in this pāda: náram … ratheṣṭhā̇́m. In the sg.
nṛ́- is almost always used of Indra, as are ratheṣṭhā́- and ratheṣṭhá-. I am therefore
certain that c, like d, refers to Indra.

### 50  
Ge adds “zu gewinnen” in pādas a and b (also d) with no textual support.
And surely these garments and cows are actually references to the milk mixture, as
so often in IX.

### 51  
Ge again supplies “zu gewinnen” in both hemistichs. I once again see no
reason to do so. He also takes the rel. cl. of c (yéna dráviṇam aśnávāma) as
dependent on ā́rṣeyám: “um … uns den Namen eines R̥ṣi zu gewinnen, durch den wir
zu Reichtum gelangen können.” This ignores the parallel abhí’s of cd and also
assumes an embedded rel. cl. (though not all that embedded). Re takes ārṣeyám as a
2nd obj. of aśnávāma: “afin que nous obtenions la richesse, afin l’état de Prophète
…” This is somewhat less disruptive than Ge’s, but assumes a purpose function for
yéna that has no good precedent, as far as I know. My own interpr. - supplying a
gapped acc. ‘that’ as antecedent for yéna -- seems minimally disruptive and assumes
that the insistent structure with abhí arṣa ACC continues in this pāda. The same
interpr. is found in Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 550-51): “(fliesse uns das) zu, wodurch wir
Reichtum erlangen werden.”
The interpr. of Ge and Re also minimize or ignore the only clever part of this
tṛca, which provides a climax of sorts. With the pattern abhí (…) arṣa “rush towards
…” inescapably established, the poet produces a phonological play on this phrase in
the last pāda: abhy ārṣeyám, where the acc. goal, beginning ārṣ-, plays on the impv.
arṣa (the play also noted by Ge, n. 51d). ārṣeyá- is found only here in the RV, though
it is extremely common in Vedic prose.
### 52-54
The simplistic repetition of the previous tṛca contrasts markedly with
the contents of this one, which is mind-bogglingly difficult and opaque. Old
pronounces it “grösstenteils hoffnungslos.” Thematically it seems to deal with the
distribution of wealth in a ritual/martial context, and it also shows signs of lexical
cohesion, esp. the hapaxes mām̐ścatvá- (52b) and mā́m̐ścatva- (54b), also vásūni
(52a, 53c), and of varied formulaic repetition: ayā́pavā́pavasvainā́(52a) / enā́
pavayā́pavasva (53a). My interpr. of this tṛca, in its many obscure details and in its
entirety, is very different from the standard ones. In places it pushes the morphology,
syntax, and semantics perhaps further than is warranted, and it may seems at times
far-fetched. But it has, I think, a richer semantics than the other accounts, and above
all it deliberately avoids the refuge taken by others, to make the difficult words into
proper nouns.

### 52  
The tṛca begins deceptively straightforwardly, with a call to Soma to
purify himself and bring goods. The pāda-final vásūni concatenates with the one
ending 51a. Given this acc. with pávasva we must assume the idiom ā́pavasva ‘bring
ACC through your purification.” The preverb ā́may be concealed in one of the
accented final long ā́-s in the pāda, most likely pavā́, which can be pavā́+ ā́, putting
the preverb in the standard position right before the verb, or enā́. Or perhaps, if enā́
is adverbial in the meaning ‘here’ (so Gr, s.v. enā́, col. 300; AiG III.524-25), it takes
the function of ā́in this lexeme. However, I am inclined, with Sāy. (see Ge’s n. 52a),
to take enā́as an aberrant neut. pl. with vásūni - hence ‘these goods’. See AiG
III.525, which hesitatingly allows the poss. of neut. pl. elsewhere.
The fun begins with the next pāda and with the first word in that pāda,
mām̐ścatvé; as was noted above, the word appears, differently accented, in 54b, and
these forms are obviously related to mām̐ścatóḥ in VII.44.3. In our vss. Ge and Re
take it as the loc. of a place name, coreferential with loc. sárasi: e.g., “dans le lac
Māṃścatva.” This is certainly the safest choice here, but a place name is essentially
excluded for the occurrence of the related word in VII.44.3 - and of course making
difficult words into otherwise unattested proper nouns is an interpretational cop-out.
As discussed at length in the comm. to VII.44.3 I return to the old notion that this is a
cmpd meaning ‘hiding the moon’. In all three passages I take it as a temporal
designation, originally ‘at dawn’. This perfectly fits our tṛca if it depicts the
beginning of the early morning soma pressing.
VII.44.3 also contains the word bradhná- ‘copper-colored’, found here in
pāda c. This word can sometimes refer to soma (VIII.4.13, 14; 69.7), sometimes to
Agni/fire (III.7.5, X.20.9), but sometimes, it seems, to the sun: I.6.1 and also the
occurrence in VII.44.3. In our passage I think it can be all three: the sun, coppery
colored at dawn, is appropriate to the early morning time period identified by
mām̐ścatvé, and Sūrya in X.170.1 is vā́tajūta- (like our vā́to ná jūtáḥ). As we have
often seen soma is frequently identified with the sun, and it is often urged to speed
along the ritual ground (and see IX.64.16 índavaḥ … jūtā́ḥ). But what is most often
described as vā́ta-jūta- is the fire or its flames. The ritual fire, the soma, and the sun
would all necessarily be present at the dawn sacrifice. Both Ge and Re take bradhnáas referring to a horse, which, in my view, distorts their view of the whole vs. and
indeed the tṛca.
In d both Ge and Re take the hapax táku- as referring to a horse (Renner,
coursier), the same one they see as the reference of bradhná- in c. Ge seems to think
d involves giving this horse a sort of superior groom (“ein tüchtiges Lenker”), with
dat. tákave the indirect obj. But as was recently noted (ad vs. 49), nṛ́- in the sg. is
almost always used of Indra, and I think it is here as well. Soma, by virtue of being
consumed by Indra at the sacrifice, brings Indra to the sacrifice and in effect bestows
him upon the human worshipers, and he does so for a particular purpose. I take
tákave as an infinitival dative of purpose: ‘to (make the) charge, to rush’ - Indra in
his capacity as our supporter in conflict. Old considers, but rejects, such an infinitival
interpr., in favor of what he considers the simpler indirect obj. with √dā.

### 53  
The mystery deepens in this vs.
The first pāda is superficially just a variant of 52a, but it poses several
problems. On the one hand pavayā́looks like an instr. sg. to a fem. pavā́-, whose
more archaic instr. pavā́is found in 52a. But the accentuation is wrong: it should be
*paváyā. AiG III.117 seems to dismiss the accent problem (sim. AiG II.2.247) and
simply accept it as an instr., but Old considers other possibilities, incl. adverbial
accent or analogy to ayā́in 52a. He rejects Lanman’s sugg. that it represents *pavā́yā́
(from *pavā́+ ayā́) on metrical grounds (bad break). I have a similar, but different
suggestion that avoids the metrical problem: it represents *paváyā́, namely instr.
*paváyā (with the correct accent) + ā́, the preverb we were seeking also in 52a,
which again would put the preverb directly before the verb. The need for ā́is less
acute here because there’s no apparent expressed obj. in the pāda, but vásūni can be
assumed on the basis of 52a and the 2nd hemistich of this vs. 53c. Moreover, as in
52a I suggest that enā́may be neut. pl. and therefore there is an expressed obj.
The other problem is enā́, which also appeared in 52a in a different position.
Here, directly before pavayā́, it appears to be an instr., filling the role of ayā́in 52a.
But enā́should be m./n., not fem. Though Ge (n. 53a) convinces himself it is fem.
(and AiG III.524 recognizes at least one possible case of a fem. enā́), I think this is
unlikely and, as in 52a, suggest that it is a neut. pl. This means that pavayā́
(/*paváyā) lacks an instr. demonstr. parallel to ayā́in 52a, but this is hardly a
problem. Putting all this together, I would thus emend the tr. to “By purifying
yourself with purification bring these (goods) here for us.”
The next pāda is syntactically unimpeachable: it consists of a loc. phrase
governed by ádhi with a gen. dependent on the loc. Moreover, all the words are
known and their meanings uncontroversial. The problem is what they refer to when
assembled into a phrase. They specify the place (or time) that the self-purification in
pāda a is to happen: “at the famous ford GEN.” Given the ritual context, it seems
unlikely that a real river ford is meant; instead it must be a metaphorical place or
moment in the sacrifice. Most comparable - but unhelpful - is the phrase ā́pnānaṃ
tīrtháṃ, which I interpr. as “opulent ford,” found at X.114.7, in a mystical hymn
about the sacrifice. I suggest that in our passage it refers to the place/time of the
distribution of goods. I further suggest that this refers to the transfer of goods from
gods to humans, hence the metaphorical “ford” for crossing the god/mortal divide. In
the next hemistich I suggest that it is Indra who is distributing vast numbers of
goods. The gen. śravā́yyasya supports this view, since this adj. generally modifies
vā́ja- ‘prize’ or rayí- ‘wealth’ (cf., e.g., IX.63.23 rayím … śravā́yyam), as Ge also
points out (n. 53b). Ge and Re simply take śravā́yyasya as a PN, again simply to
dodge the interpretational problem. Though the publ. tr. suggests it might be the
place for the distribution of dakṣinās, I no longer believe that the passage concerns
the dakṣiṇā, since I think this is a reference to Indra’s distribution of goods.
The 2nd hemistich is entirely clear, except for the nom. sg. subject, the hapax
naigutáḥ. This vṛddhi deriv. must be interpr. with ref. to its base, nigút-, which
occurs in the acc. pl. in the next vs., as the designation of overpowered, indeed
annihilated, foes; it is also found in X.128.6 (as nom. pl.), where it refers to enemies
of some sort who are repulsed and defeated by Agni. Both Ge and Re tr. as a PN in
our two vss. (though Ge ‘Schwätzer(?)’ in X.128.6). EWA (s.v.) suggests an
appealing interpr., as a rt noun cmpd to √gu (his GAV) ‘call upon’; with the preverb ní
‘*nieder-rufend, schmähend’ in a verbal contest. This interpr. seems to be tacitly
accepted by KH (KlSch 447), who tr. it in 54c as “Schmäher’; it is also presented by
Scar (112-13), though hesitantly - and like Ge and Re he tr. it as a PN. By contrast, I
find the suggestion quite plausible; I suggest the sense ‘challenger’ for nigút-. In
contrast to nigút-, its vṛddhi deriv. in our vs. designates a successful and positively
viewed figure, opposed to the nigút-s in the next vs. - hence my tr. ‘challengers’
challenger’ (Scar’s ‘Bezwinger der Niguts’, an interpr. that goes back to Sāy. and
Ludwig [see Ge’s n. 53c]). As in 52d, I take the unnamed referent here to be Indra,
though Ge (n. 53c) suggests Soma. The extravagance of the gifts and the apparent
militant nature of naigutá- seems better suited to Indra, though a militant Soma is not
out of the question.

### 54  
The difficulties do not let up here, esp. in the 1st hemistich. The clearest
thing here is the asya, which presumably, because of its lack of accent, must refer to
the naigutáḥ in 53cd. This same figure is also the subject of the verbs in c.
The first problem is the first word, whose very form is in question. The Pp.
separates máhīmé into máhi and imé, with the first then a neut. sg.; Gr takes it rather
as a du. máhī, with ? This is rejected explicitly by Old on accentual grounds: the
standard du. is accented mahī́. If it is neut. sg., it can modify nā́ma; if neut. du.,
vádhatre. I prefer the latter, despite the formal problems. Old, Ge, and Re take it as a
modifier of nā́ma.
Let us now turn to vṛ́ṣanā́ma, taken as a cmpd by Pp., despite its two accents.
The simple solution here is, as has long been known, to split into two words: vṛ́ṣa
nā́ma, with vṛ́ṣa a neut. agreeing with nā́ma. I take this as a naming parenthesis
“‘Bull’ his name,” though I recognize that we should probably expect the masc. *vṛ́ṣā
in that context (type nalo nāma). Perhaps better “‘Bullish’ is his name,” which more
easily accommodates a neut. vṛ́ṣa. (Before continuing I will point out that this is most
likely a reference to Indra, whose presence I see also in the preceding two vss. -
though Soma is possible as well.) A naming parenthesis is not the standard view,
which is that “bullish name” is one member of a nominal sentence equating the dual
entities (whatever they may be - see below) with this name (“these two Xs are /
make up” [ausmachen] his great bullish name” - so Old, Ge, and more or less Re;
Scar [112] also follows this interpr. but assumes a du. ‘great’). As that tr. shows, the
standard view also has the merit of providing a head noun to the putative neut. máhi
that opens the pāda.
Why then do I put myself in morphological difficulties, rejecting neut. sg.
máhi and struggling with neut. vṛ́ṣa? Because I don’t think that the two entities are
equivalent to his name, but rather belong to him and are deployed by him under
specific circumstances, as indicated in pāda b. I therefore assume a du. máhī, or
perhaps correctly accented *mahī́, which has been redactionally changed after the
passage ceased to be understood.
The next question: what are the dual entities. Ge (fld. by Scar) takes śūṣé …
vádhatre as a discontinuous dual dvandva: “sein Ungestüm und seine Waffe.” This is
clever, but to me unconvincing. Real dual dvandvas with two dual endings that
involve material or immaterial entities, rather than gods or at least animate beings,
are rare. And this would contain two entities that are not associated with each other
textually and do not form a natural semantic class, one of which is an immaterial
power, the other a material object. If there is an alternative, we should seek it. And
indeed there is: śūṣé can simply be the modifier of vádhatre. There are “two forceful
weapons of death.” Old’s “diese beide śūṣé vádhatre implies this solution, and Re
adopts it as well, though in his n. he claims that śūṣá- is ordinarily a masc. noun. I
think rather the reverse: that it is an adj. even though its head noun is often gapped,
esp. when it is the obj. of √ṛc ‘chant’ or similar verbs and refers to a “fortifying /
powerful (praise / thought - stómam / mánma, etc.).” The adjectival status of śūṣá- is
one more reason not to assume it’s one of a pair in a dual dvandva.
The next question after this: what are these two weapons. I suggest that it is
the two fatal activities described in c, both of which are slangy euphemisms: ‘put to
sleep’ (svāpáya-) and ‘snow’. The caus. stem svāpáya- and assoc. redupl. aor.
síṣvap(a)- are only used in this euphemistic sense of ‘put to death’, a sense that is
familiar of course in the Engl. equivalent. The parallel stem sneháya- is found only
here. It is clearly related to the IE words for ‘snow’, and, as I discuss in the -áyabook (91), the hostile / fatal nuance it projects in context can be derived directly from
‘snow’; the re-semanticization of the IE root to something like ‘stick together’
advocated by a number of scholars (see -áya-, p. 91 n. 32) is unnecessary. As I point
out there, the verb ‘snow’ is also found in Engl., meaning ‘overwhelm’, though (at
least decades ago) in a more or less positive sense. The verb sneháyat is accented
presumably because it opens a new (sub-)clause.
We must now return to pāda b, which contains a disjunctive vā … vā
construction: mā́m̐ścatve vā pṛ́śane vā. The first term, save for accent, is the same as
mām̐ścatvé in 52b. I confess I have no explanation of the difference in accent and
treat the two as identical, as, it seems, do most interpr. - there’s too much else going
on in this tṛca to focus on this! Since most interpr. take the form in 52b as a name,
either of a place or a person (person for Scar for the form in this vs.), pṛ́śane receives
the same interpr. Since I take mām̐ścatvé in 52b as a temporal designation, I want to
impose the same analysis on pṛ́śane. The stem pṛ́śana- is a hapax as a masc/neut., but
it is at least derivationally related to the fem. pṛśanī́- (3x: I.71.5, X.61.8, 73.2) with
diff. accent (see AiG II.2.184, 197), and the adj. pṛśanāyú- (1x: I.84.11) is based
upon it. The fem. stem is found in difficult passages, two of which (I.71.5, X.61.8)
concern the cosmic incest of Heaven with his daughter, which are perhaps cryptic by
design. However, all three forms seem to mean something like ‘caress, caressing’.
The -yú-adj. is by contrast in a straightforward passage that aids the interpr. of ours:
I.84.11 tā́asya pṛśanāyúvah, sómam śrīṇanti pṛ́śnayaḥ “ These dappled ones, eager
for caresses, prepare the soma for him,” with the subject dhenávaḥ ‘milk cows’. The
theme is the usual one, of the erotic desire of the cows (= milk) for the bull Soma, a
theme of course widely represented in IX. I therefore suggest that the loc. pṛ́śane
here as a temporal designation refers to “the time of caressing” - that is, to the ritual
moment in which Soma unites with the cows’ milk. Thus, pāda b names two key
times in the soma sacrifice: the early morning when the sacrifice begins and the
moment that the milk is mixed with the soma.
Even if my interpr. of the locc. is correct, why are these ritual times
embedded in a vs. that otherwise occupies itself with deadly weapons and hostile
encounters. I don’t have a totally satisfactory answer here, but if the subject is Indra,
as I have suggested, he may be eliminating rival sacrificers and rival sacrifices that
do not conform to the Ārya compact - or he may be deriving this strength to do
battle from the sacrifice, which is simply represented by two of its temporal stages.
Pāda d displays pleasing phonological play: cā́pāmítrām̐ápācíto acetáḥ,
where the first two sequences are mirror-images of each other: c-ā-p-ā vs. a-p-ā-c.
(Note that the first c is actually borrowed from the end of the last pāda.) It is esp.
cleverly designed because of the discontinuous verb ápa … aca - the impv. aca
needing to be extracted from acetáḥ (= aca itáḥ ‘turn away from here’). This acetáḥ
looks superficially as if it belongs to the stem acetás- ‘unperceptive’, but it does not.
That sense, and the same privative+√cit, is found instead in the negated rt noun
cmpd. acít- in the acc. pl. The pāda provides an exceptionally tricky end to a
dazzlingly frustrating tṛca.
### 55-58
The rest of the hymn consists of 4 vss. Old dithers about whether this
consists of an odd vs., 55, followed by a final tṛca, 56-58 - or a tṛca 55-57, with a
final independent vs. 58. At least to my mind, the latter analysis is clearly superior.
Vs. 58 has the “feel” of a hymn-summary vs., with the expression of “our” wish in
ab, and its 2nd half consists of the Kutsa refrain. Nonetheless, there are no clear signs
of cohesion in vss. 55-57, though one might point to the filters in both 55 and 56.
Happily none of the vss. presents us with the desperate difficulties of the preceding
tṛca.

### 55  
We meet the three filters also in IX.73.8, where their identity is not clear.
Needless to say, Lü (703-4) has a cosmic explanation.

### 56  
Note the phonological play in d: ví vā́ram ávyaṃ samáyā́ti yāti. The last bit
is reminiscent of 54d, in that the phonological agreement crosscuts the word
divisions: we have rhyming -yā́ti yāti, but the first yā́ti is to be segmented (samá)yā
áti.

### 57  
The simile in b is one of the best pieces of evidence for my interpr. of
√ribh as ‘squawk, creak,’ etc., rather than ‘sing’. The simile “like birds of prey” (ná
gṛ́dhrāḥ) only makes sense if the verb that expresses the sounds of the voices of the
poets (kaváyaḥ) is not a mellifluous one. Both Ge and Re struggle with this. Ge
reduces rebhanti to ‘become hearable/known’: “… werden die Seher lautbar wie die
Geier” (not the first quality one things of for a Geier); Re simply recasts the simile:
“sur sa trace ils psalmodient, comme des poètes avides (de gain).”

### 01
On the pattern set in motion by vāja-sā́tama-, see ad vs. 12.
On sahásra-bharṇas- see comm. ad IX.60.2.
In the rt. noun cmpd vibhvā-sáham Ge, Re, and Scar (609-10) take vibhvā- as
a PN, that of one of the Ṛbhus, and also interpr. this PN as having only an indirect
relationship to the 2nd member. The cmpd modifies rayím (also in its other
occurrence in V.10.7), and they render the phrase “wealth that surpasses that of
Vibhvan” - in other words with the actual 1st member implicitly a gen. dependent on
a supplied ‘wealth’ that is the implicit 1st member (suggesting a phrase *rayi-sáhaṃ
rayím - a similar cmpd. rayi-ṣā́h- does exist). Scar also suggests an alternative
analysis: “unter den vorzüglichen [Schätzen] siegreich,” that is, “der beste Schatz,”
as well as an even more elaborate analysis by way of the phrase vibhvataṣṭá- rayí- in
IV.36.5 (based on Ge’s nn. to V.10.7, IV.36.5), in which they see the Ṛbhu PN as
well (but see my comm. ad V.58.4). All of this seems to me a result of over-thinking
the cmpd. First of all, I think we would do well to leave the Ṛbhus out of this: they
have almost no presence in the IXth Maṇḍala, and taking vibhvā- here as a PN seems
to complicate rather than simplify the interpr. of the cmpd. The stem víbhvan- is
attested as an adj. meaning ‘extensive, distinguished’, and I see no reason why that
meaning can’t fit this cmpd. in a more direct way than Ge/Re/Scar envision: it can
either mean ‘overcoming/prevailing over (even) distinguished (wealth)’ or (more
likely in my view) ‘overcoming/vanquishing (even) the distinguished
(person/people)’ - that is, we want wealth so overwhelming that we can dominate
our rivals.
It is possible that vibhvā- does signal a pun on the Ṛbhu PN, but only as a
secondary reading. One of the other Ṛbhus is named Vāja, and vāja- is the 1st
member of a different rt. noun cmpd in this vs., also with a root meaning ‘win’ in the
same semantic sphere as √sah: vāja-sā́tama- ‘best at winning prizes’. No one to my
knowledge suggests that vāja- in that cmpd has the primary reading ‘PN, one of the
Ṛbhus’, but vāja- may have enabled a pun on vibhvā-. In fact, it’s worth noting that,
as Scar points out (609 n. 875), vibhvāsáham gives a bad cadence, and *vibhū-ṣáham
(as in vibhū́-vasu- ‘having distinguished goods’) would be better. So perhaps that 1st
member *vibhū- was altered to vibhvā- to allow this punning reading.
### 02-03
These two vss. share vocab. and structure. Both begin pári ṣyá s(u)vānáḥ,
and both have a pāda-final akṣāḥ (2d, 3a), in addition to índuḥ (2c, 3b), dhā́rā(bhiḥ)
(2d, 3c). The meter in both vss. shows some disturbance, esp. in 2d and 3a, and there
are several different ways to resolve these disturbances. The HvN solutions as
represented by their restorations do not seem to be the most satisfactory ones. As just
noted, the initial pādas of both vss. begin in the same way, but though in 2a HvN
read the med. part. svānáḥ with contracted root syllable, in 3a they read suvānáḥ. It
seems unlikely that in this patterned repetition in successive vss. the participles
would have different metrical realizations; moreover, as Gr points out, that
participle, which is quite common, is always elsewhere read svānáḥ. A further
consideration is that by their reading 3a has a disfavored cadence: (su)vānó akṣāḥ (-
⏑ - x, with shortening of o in hiatus), rather than the more usual iambic cadence of
dimeter vs. As for 2d they read med. part. hiyānáḥ; this part. appears both with and
without contracted root syllable: hyānáḥ is found, for ex., in IX.86.3. Given
contracted svānáḥ in 2a and (contra HvN) 3a, contraction better fits the contextual
pattern. And as in 3a their reading also produces a disfavored cadence, (dhā)rābhir
akṣāḥ (again - ⏑ - x). The most likely solution is given by Arnold (metrical comm.,
as well as p. 99 §151 (i)) and Old: distracted akṣãḥ, which provides the right no. of
syllables even with the contracted participles and also fixes the cadence.

### 02
On the instr. drúṇā and the phrase drúṇā hitá- see comm. ad IX.1.2. One of
the problems with the standard interpr. of this phrase, that it refers to the wooden cup
into which the Soma is poured, is that it would be out of sequence, since the vs.
otherwise describes the early part of Soma’s journey across the ritual ground.
The pāda-final avyáyam (a) and avyata (b) echo each other.
The actual target of the simile in b, the nominative equivalent of Soma in the
frame, is gapped, being represented only by the adjuncts ráthe and várma: “like (a
man/warrior) on a chariot his armor.” In the publ. tr. “a man” should be in parens.

### 03
The transmitted akṣā at the end of pāda a before i- should have appeared as
akṣār in sandhi; the Pp. reads akṣār íti. Wackernagel (AiG I.1.334-35) considers it a
misunderstanding of original akṣāḥ by the redactors.
The simile in d has the same structure as the one in 2b: gapped nominative
target whose identity is signalled by an adjunct, in this case bhrājā́‘with flame
(/flash/light)’ - most likely pointing to Agni (Ge, Re [tr.], Ober [II.56]), though
possibly Sūrya, who is also associated with forms of the root √bhrāj (alt. given by
Re in his n.).

### 04
The standard tr. take this vs. as a single clause, and it is certainly tempting.
However, there are several problems. First, despite the hí the main verb vivāsasi is
unaccented. It is true that this verb comes only at the end of the vs., while hí is in 2nd
position in the first pāda. Old notes the problem but suggests that it’s the result of
sliding into being a main clause, presumably because of distance. But the
conditioning of verb accent by hí is a robust effect, which does not depend on
proximity of the verb to the particle. Another problem is the sá … tvám that opens
the vs. As I have demonstrated at length (“sa figé”), sá (+/- tvám) with 2nd ps.
reference is ordinarily found only with imperatives, and the desid. pres. vivāsasi is
therefore anomalous.
On these two grounds I therefore divide the vs. into two clauses, ab and cd,
with the former an equational nominal cl.: tvám … vásu “you are good(s).” This may
seem an outlandish or tortured expression, perhaps a cure worse than the disease.
However, note that the next vs. enables just this identification: in 5b Soma is
addressed as “o good one” (voc. vaso), of whose goods (vásvaḥ) we want a part. So
the line between good thing(s) and a good (one) is presented as permeable, and Soma
may well be both.
This interpr. solves the (lack of) verbal accent problem, but what about sá …
tvám. I suggest that this is a syntactically conditioned variant of *tad … tvám …,
vásu “you are that, namely good(s).” The neut. tád has been “attracted” to the
(underlying) gender of tvám by the well-known syntactic rule of gender attraction of
predicated pronouns in nominal equational clauses (see, e.g., Speijer, Vedisch u.
Sanskrit-Syntax, §95b; other examples and sec. lit. citations collected in Brereton
1986: 99-191 and n. 6 ). On the supposed exception, which is not (tat tvam asi in Ch
Up), see Brereton “tat tvam asi in Context” (ZDMG 136 [1986]).
śatā́tman- occurs 3x in the RV (I.149.3, X.33.9, and here); in all cases it
seems to mean ‘having 100 forms or embodiments’; in X.33.9 it is almost of the
“cats have 9 lives” variety. Here it presumably refers to as many varieties of wealth
as we can acquire.

### 05
On váso vásvaḥ and its relation to vs. 4, see comm. there.
This vs. is supposed to contain the lexeme ní √as (#ní …, syā́ma). Gr glosses
this lexeme ‘Theil haben an [G.]’, and Ge and Re both so tr. But ní is found nowhere
else with √as (in the RV or in the rest of Skt, as far as I can see), and neither the
additive semantics of ní + √as nor any plausible extension of it would produce ‘have
a share in’, at least to my mind. RIVELEX (I. 634, 641 n. 71) agrees with me and
instead glosses it ‘jmd ist im Dienst von etw.’ (628), which would yield the not very
likely “may we be in service of your goods … of your refreshment and favor.” I
therefore think it likely that ní is not a part of a verbal lexeme as a preverb in tmesis.
I suggest, quite tentatively, instead that it is a sort of pseudo-reduplication with the
doubly marked splv. nédiṣṭhatama- ‘most nearest’, which it immediately precedes
(#ní nédiṣṭhatamāḥ) or that it provides a further directional specification to that splv.:
“down nearest.” I construe the various genitives with this splv. - though I recognize
that this does not seem to be a standard usage. They are unlikely to go with syā́ma
even in the absence of ní, because, as Re points out in his n. (though he tr. flg. Gr and
Ge), √as + GEN generally means “être le lot de (qq’un),” which should produce “may
we belong to your goods …”
On adhrigo see comm. ad I.61.1, VIII.22.11.

### 06
This vs. is entirely a rel. cl., which is resumed by vs. 7, where tyám (7a)
picks up yám (6a).

### 08
This vs. presents a number of small interrelated difficulties. We can start
with pā́ntaḥ. As was discussed ad I.122.1 (q.v.), forms of the shape pā́nt(a)- belong
to two different stems; the better attested is the them. noun pā́nta- ‘drink’, but there
are two exx. of the act. root aor. part. to √pā ‘drink’, at I.122.4 and in our passage
here. Both stems often show distraction of the root syll., and that scansion is required
here. The participle is pl.; the question then is what case it’s in. Ge takes it as a voc.,
coreferential with vaḥ in pāda a, with dakṣasā́dhanam the subj. of both the main cl. in
ab and the rel. cl. in cd, or so I read his tr.: “Denn durch seine Gunst wird euch, ihr
Trinkenden, ein kraftwirkendes Mittel, der den freigebigen Herren hohen Ruhm
verschafft.” However, this is syntactically impossible: if dakṣasā́dhanam is the subj.
of ab, it must be neut., in which case it cannot be the antecedent of masc. yáḥ in c. It
is also somewhat perverse not to construe dakṣasā́dhanam, which always refers to
soma (IX.25.1, 27.2, 101.15, 104.3), as the obj. of pā́ntaḥ. Re’s tr. suffers from a
different syntactic solecism. Like Ge, he takes pā́ntaḥ as coreferential with vaḥ, but,
it seems, as a modifier of vaḥ and therefore an acc. or even dat. pl.: “Pour vous en
effet qui buvez (ce soma) réalisateur de la force-agissante …”
The problems in both interpr. arise from their assumption that pā́ntaḥ must
qualify vaḥ one way or another. But the most likely referent for the part. is “all the
gods” of 7c, around which Soma circled with his máda- just previously, as was
clearly seen (in his usual way) by Old: “(die Götter, v. 7), den dakṣasā́dhana
trinkend.” If we detach pā́ntaḥ from vaḥ, things go more smoothly. I take pā́ntaḥ as a
predicated participle with the gods as supplied subj.: “(the gods) are drinking …”
So then, what to do with vaḥ? This has two possible solutions, neither of
which is flawless, but both of which are better than the knots Ge and Re tie
themselves in to construe it with pā́ntaḥ. In the publ. tr. I take it as referring to the
poets/ritualists generally (as so often) and construe it with the rel. cl. in cd, in
particular with sūríṣu “among (your) patrons.” Old’s solution is similar, though he
actually takes pāda a as part of the rel. cl. beginning in c, which I would prefer not to.
So my publ. solution is to take vaḥ as being in a sort of extreme Wackernagel’s
position, leapfroging two pādas (and the main cl.) to reach its host. This seems a little
extreme, but at least the main cl. is syntactically sketchy - consisting of a predicted
aor. participle. A different solution is suggested by the meter of pāda a, which lacks a
syllable. Old suggests reading asi
yá, and Gr also lists it with this scansion. But this
distracted form, if it exists at all, is extremely rare, and I think we should avoid
positing it if possible. The lack of a syllable and the problem of vaḥ (vo in sandhi)
may well be connected. I suggest that the pāda hasn’t been properly transmitted and
vo is the remnant of something else entirely, though unfortunately I don’t have any
suggestions for what might have fallen out. The transmitted vo may have been
modeled on vām in the next vs.
One remaining problem with ab: if asyá refers to Soma in the gen. (“with his
help”), what about acc. dakṣasā́dhanam, which as I just said is always used of soma.
I suggest that the máda- ‘exhilarating drink’ of 7d is the referent for this adj.,
substituting for soma. But in fact there is no real problem even if both the gen. and
the acc. refer to Soma/soma.
The 2nd hemistich is considerably more straightforward, though there is one
place where I differ from the standard tr. Both Ge and Re take svár as nom., with the
simile turning on haryatáḥ: “delightful like the sun” (e.g., “wie die Sonne begehrt”).
I instead take haryatáḥ as an independent modifier of Soma and svár as acc., parallel
to śrávo bṛhát, as obj. of dadhé. This is another instantiation of the formula “place
the sun (in heaven),” of which I saw a disguised ex. in the preceding hymn, IX.97.38.
See comm. there and my 2010 Fs. Melchert article (this passage and the formula
disc. pp. 163-64).
Note that since svàr may invoke sū́rya-, there may be indirect phonetic play
between sūríṣu ‘in the patrons’ and the ‘sun’ word.

### 09
The referent of the 2nd ps. du. encl. vām is clearly the World-halves in the
repeated fem. voc. phrase mānavī …rodasī / … devī. The vocc. are somewhat
contradictory, identifying the World-halves as both goddesses and as related to
mankind (or Manu). Ge (n. 9ab) ingeniously and persuasively suggests that the dual
referent is the soma-press with its two jaws. In IX.75.4 the World-halves are called
the mothers of Soma, and our passage depicts his birth as related to them. Ge
supplies “son” for vām to depend on; Re seems to take vām as a dative (or datival
gen.): “… est né … pour vous deux,” which loses the maternal relationship. I take the
vām as indicating the oblique source with pass. janiṣṭa “was born of,” which avoids
Ge’s need to supply a head noun. However, there is no serious semantic distinction
between my interpr. and Ge’s.
The final pāda lacks a verb, but contains an apparent obj. tám most likely
referring to Soma. The negated nom. part. ásredhan demands a masc. sg. subj.; the
adverbial neut.acc. sg. or loc. sg. tuviṣváni ‘very noisily / in/at the very noisy one’
(?) suggests a verb of sound or speech: “I praise’ (Ge) / ‘he [priest] praises” (Re)
would fit these conditions fine without imposing itself.

### 10  
The identity of “the god sitting on the seat” is unclear, though Sāy.’s
suggestion (see Ge’s n. 10d) that it is the Yajamāna seems unlikely. I’d suggest
rather Agni, on the basis of IX.92.2 sī́dan hóteva sádane camū́ṣu “taking his seat in
the cups like a Hotar on his seat,” since Agni is the archetypal Hotar and √sad is a
regular part of the Agni lexicon. Of course in IX it is Soma who is regularly sitting /
seated, but he cannot be the indirect object here.

### 11  
There is considerable phonological play, esp. in the 2nd hemistich -
apaprothantaḥ … prātáḥ … ápracetasaḥ, but anticipated by ab pratnā́saḥ …
pavitre …
The root √pruth uncompounded simply means ‘snort’; it is ápa that licenses
the acc.
The rt. noun cmpd huraś-cít- is found once elsewhere, in I.42.3, where the
context is more diagnostic than this one. There it is parallel to paripanthínam
muṣīvā́ṇam “highwayman (and) robber.” The 1st member huras- belongs to the root
√hvṛ ‘go crookedly’ (see, e.g., EWA s.v. híruk). As often (and not only in Skt.),
‘crooked’ has moral implications; here the enemies to be banished are those who
actively know/perceive the ways to go wrong as well as those who simply lack
perception (ápracetasaḥ). Since both cmpds contain a form of √cit, it would have
been better to capture this etymological play in the tr. - perhaps “those who discern
the crooked ways and those who lack discernment.” Scar (123) in his disc. of this
passage somehow convinces himself that the form must modify the soma drinks and
is therefore not acc. pl. (as it is usually taken) but nom. pl. I don’t follow his
semantic reasoning, but it did, by chance, suggest another possibility to me.
Elsewhere in IX forms of √hvṛ can refer to the curly wool on the sheep’s fleece filter
and the crooked path the soma must follow across the filter. So here I suggest that the
morphologically ambiguous huraścítaḥ can be both nom. pl. and acc. pl. As the
former, it means ‘knowing/perceiving the crooked ways (of the filter)’ and refer to
the clever navigation of the soma drinks. As acc. pl. it refers to those who know
morally crooked ways and deserve to be banished. I would represent this, somewhat
awkwardly, in a revised tr. “discerning the crooked ways (of the filter), snorting
away into the distance those who discern crooked ways and those without
discernment.” Of course, since huraścítaḥ can serve for either, the Skt. lacks the
clumsiness necessary to spell out the different Engl. readings.

### 12  
The hymn ends with two pāda-final cmpds whose first member is vā́ja-
(vā́ja-gandhi
yam [c], vā́ja-pasti
yam [d]), just as its first pāda ends with the same
(save for accent): 1a vāja-sā́tamam - thus producing a satisfying ring encompassing
the whole poem.
This rhetorical pattern, the pressure to produce matching 1st member vā́jacompds, accounts for some disturbance in the cmpd formation in 12c. The cmpd in
1a is a standard rt. noun type (in the splv.). The cmpd in 12d, vā́ja-pasti
ya-‘having a
house with prizes in it’, is likewise properly formed: it is a bahuvrīhi of the type of
vájra-bāhu-, vájra-hasta ‘having an arm/hand with a mace in it’. With this same 2nd
member, see áśva-pastya-, vīrá-pastya- ‘having a house with horses/heroes in it’.
But the hapax vā́ja-gandhi
ya- in c is a different matter. Here the 2nd member appears
to be a gerundive to the root √gadh ‘seize, secure, hold fast’, though the independent
gerundive to that root is gádhi
ya- (see below). No other forms of the root have a
nasal, and the source of it is unclear, since the etymology is likewise unclear (see
EWA s.v. GADH and below). It is worth pointing out that without the nasal the cmpd
(and the pāda) would end with 4 light syllables (*vājagadhi
yam) due to the distraction
of the cluster -dhy-, and the influence of a similarly shaped root with similar
meaning, √ba(n)dh ‘bind’, might account for a nonce nasal insertion for metrical
purposes.
Despite the difference in shape, it is quite clear that independent gádhya- and
our -gandhya- are essentially identical, because the former is found primarily as a
modifier of vā́ja- in the phrase ‘prize(s) to be seized’ (IV.16.11, 16, VI.10.6, 26.2).
Only in IV.38.4 does it appear without vā́ja-, but in the same type of context. So our
cmpd. replicates this phrase, though with an intrusive nasal in the root syllable.
Before going further, I should note the interpr. of the word(s) that prevails
throughout Ge’s tr. and to some extent Re’s. For all attestations of the phrase vā́jagádhya- Ge tr. “die deckenhohe Beute [/Gewinn]”; for the attestation of gádhyā in
IV.38.4 without vā́ja- “bis an die Wagendecke reichende (Beute)”; and for our cmpd
“der wagenhohe Lohn bringt.” Re in VI.10.6 (EVP XIII ad loc.) “un prix-de-victoire
emplissant le chariot” (though just “les butins” in IV.38.4 [EVP XV.162]); our cmpd.
“qui a une charge de prix.” To my knowledge Ge never explains how he came to this
narrowly precise rendering, ‘reaching to the top/roof of a cart’, but Re (ad VI.10.6;
XIII.131) provides us with the source for it, namely the word gadhā found in late
Vedic (ŚSū) referring to some part of a cart, possibly the roof (see Sparreboom,
Chariots, p. 123, with lit.). The connection seems to have been suggested in passing
by Caland. See in contrast EWA s.v. gadhā-, where Mayr. comments “Schwerlich zu
GADH.” Given the large chronological gap in attestation between the supposed
derivative (gádhya- RV) and its supposed base noun (gadhā- Sū) and the not entirely
compelling semantics, I think we can safely drop this interpr., despite its somewhat
puzzling hold on Ge, and interpr. the forms as gerundives, as above.
But we must now confront the issue of the cmpd type. By accent vā́jagandhya- is a bahuvrīhi. Given the independent phrase “prize(s) to be
seized/secured” consisting of the same two elements, we should expect the sense of
the bahuvrīhi to be “possessing prizes to be secured,” as in the publ. tr. “whose prizes
are to be secured.” But the order of the elements seems opposite to what we would
expect: the 2nd member of a bv should be a noun; if there is an adj., verbal or not, it
should be the 1st member. Hence we expect *gádya-vāja-. Ge seems to ignore the
problem (see his tr. above), as does Gr (‘dessen Gaben zu ergreifen, festzuhalten
sind’). But others try to press the cmpd into a more orthodox bv mode. See Re’s
“who has a load of prizes,” turning gandhya- into a makeshift noun; differently, but
responding to the same problem, Scar (457) “dessen Beute in Siegespreisen besteht
(?),” interpr. gadhya as the noun Beute, developed from ‘was es festzuhalten, zu
ergreifen gilt’ (n. 647). This scrupulousness about the cmpd. type is praiseworthy,
but in this case I think it is misplaced. The rhetorical pattern I noted above - the ring
compositional use of vā́ja- cmpds at the beginning and end of the hymn - has
imposed itself, allowing a technically improper nonce bahuvrīhi to be formed with its
elements in the wrong order. The cmpd with which it’s paired in this final hemistich
of the hymn, vā́ja-pasti
yam, has the same shape: vā́ja-Xi
yam, and though they are
different types of bahuvrīhis and the 2nd member -pastyā̀- is in fact a noun, they
appear superficially to be exactly parallel formations.
The formation of the hapax vā́ja-gandhi
ya- may have been aided by the fact
that “proper” bahuvrīhis with corresponding elements are rare to non-existent. That
is, examples of bahuvrīhis of the shape GRDV + NOUN are surprisingly difficult to find
(at least surprising to me), though bahuvrīhis with verbal adjective 1st members are
common - when the verbal adj. is a ppl. Cmpds like sutá-soma- ‘having pressed
soma’, vṛktá-barhis- ‘having twisted ritual grass, vṛddhá-śavas- ‘having increased
power’ are ubiquitous and easily formed, but a search through Gr for bahuvrīhis with
gerundive 1st members came up short. The only such cmpds I found are the hapax
avāryá-kratu- ‘possessing unobstructable resolve’ (VIII.92.8), with a negated grdv.,
and váreṇya-kratu- ‘whose resolve is worthy to be chosen’ (VIII.43.12) - save for
an-avadyá-rūpa- ‘possessing faultless form’ (X.68.3) with the lexicalized negated
grdv. avadyá- ‘fault’.

### 01
The stem mahīyú- is found also in IX.65.1, also with a fem. pl. subj. There it
is quite clearly the fingers of the officiants, and there is no reason why it can’t refer
to the fingers here as well (as indeed is the standard view). The adj. is generally
rendered ‘considering themselves great’ vel sim., but in both passages ‘seeking the
great’ works just as well and better fits the usual sense of -yú-stems (gavyú- ‘seeking
cattle’, etc.). I don’t see why the fingers would “pleins d’orgueil” as Re has it.
As Ge points out (n. 1c), by “glowing / bright garment” (śukrā́m … nirṇíjam)
the milk is meant.
“At the forefront of the inspired words” (vipā́m ágre) sets the time as the
beginning of the sacrifice.
### 02
kṣapā́‘by night’ is somewhat surprising in the context of a soma sacrifice,
since the beginning of the sacrifice is supposed to coincide with earliest morning.
Sāy. deals with this problem by advancing the time into morning, glossing ádha
kṣapā́with rātreḥ … anantaraṃ prātaḥkāle “immediately following night at the time
of early morning.” Ober (I.405 with n. 57) suggests that sacrificers fearing the lure to
the gods of their rival sacrificers get a jump on them by preparing the soma at night,
but given how regulated the ritual day is, at least in middle Vedic śrauta texts but
also seemingly in the RV, this premature anticipatory step seems unlikely to be
ritually sanctioned. As for the soma sacrifice that does take place at night, the
Atirātra, it employs previously prepared soma. I wonder if kṣapā́should be taken not
literally, but metaphorically. In the 2nd hemistich “the insightful thoughts of
Vivasvant” (vivásvato dhíyaḥ) propel Soma on his ritual journey. Though Vivasvant
seems to be the prototype Soma sacrificer (see IX.66.8 and Old on our passage), his
name lit. means ‘having the shining forth’, and he is in some ways the image of the
sun. See esp. IX.10.5, where Vivasvant is associated with the Dawns and the sun
images produced by the soma poured across the filter. I suggest that here “the
thoughts of Vivasvant” that give Soma a push represent the beginning of the verbal
portion of the sacrifice as a metaphorical dawn, and therefore anything that happened
prior to that in the ritual happened in the metaphorical night. For further on
Vivasvant, see publ. intro. to I.139 and comm. ad X.14.5.
In c yádī (‘if’) should be read yád ī (‘when him’).
### 03
I am not certain of the referent of asya in pāda a. Ge and Re seems to interpr.
it as Soma, implicitly dependent on máda-, which they take to be the referent of tám,
on the basis of mádo yáḥ in b. I see the point, and it would solve the asya problem.
But I have several objections. First, the object of √mṛj ‘groom’ is unlikely to be
exhilaration or the exhilarating drink (máda-) conceived of as separate from Soma
him/itself. Moreover, in the central part of this hymn, vss. 3-5, each vs. begins with
tám, and I find it difficult to believe that this tám has a different referent from the
other two, which refer to Soma. And finally, vss. 6-7 each begin with sá, again
referring to Soma, and in 7 sá is the subj. of mṛjyate ‘is groomed’, the passive
version of our tám … marjayāmasi “we groom him.” For all these reasons I think
tám must be Soma, with mádaḥ in b equated with him. In this case asya can only
refer to Vivasvant, who is the only other singular entity previously mentioned.
The 2nd hemistich contains a striking conceptual reversal: the “cows” suck
soma, though ordinarily it is the (conceptual) calf that sucks its mother, the cow. This
may accompany another conceptual reversal: in IX “cows” are almost always a
reference to the milk mixture added to the soma, but here Ge (n. 3cd) plausibly
suggests that here they are the pressing stones, sucking the soma out of the plant
stalks.
On the configuration of pāda d see Klein, DGRV I.95-96.
### 04
The idiom nā́ma √bhṛ ‘bear the name(s)’ generally means “to have that
name, to be so called” (cf., e.g., I.103.4). However, I find it unlikely that the thoughts
have—that is, are called by—the names of the gods (this thought is called “Indra,”
that one “Agni”). Rather, I think there are two possibilities. The thoughts=hymns
directed to Soma contain the names of the gods who are to drink the soma (of the
type ubiquitous in IX, “O drop, flow for Indra”). A more elaborate suggestion starts
from IX.109.14 bíbharti cā́rv índrasya nā́ma, which means, in my view, not “he
bears the dear name of Indra” (so, e.g., Ge), but rather “he bears the name dear to
Indra,” namely “Soma.” Here, if we supply cā́ru, the passage could mean “the
thoughts bear the name (dear) to the gods”; again that name is “Soma.” In this case
the thoughts would not be called “Soma,” but would instead contain numerous
instances of the name Soma in the hymns directed towards him. I prefer the former
solution, as it does not require supplying additional material.
### 05
Ge and Re (flg. Sāy.) take ukṣámāṇa- to √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’, not √vakṣ / ukṣ
‘grow strong’. I prefer the latter, because even medial forms of ‘sprinkle’ are
transitive (cf., e.g., V.59.1 ukṣánte áśvān) and this one would be passive, but
‘sprinkle’ is not excluded.
The publ. tr. of the 2nd hemistich - “Those of insightful thought hope for him
to be like a messenger, (for them) to be first in his thought” - is, at the very least,
awkward, but, more to the point, opaque. I now think I interpr. it wrongly. In
particular, like Ge and Re (also Lü 208), I 1) take the implicit acc. obj. of ā́śāsate,
corresponding to dūtám ‘messenger’ in the simile, to be Soma, and 2) interpr. the
verb as meaning ‘hope’. Although both interpr. can be amply justified, what they add
up to is not sense. To begin with, though ā́√śās can mean ‘hope’, it can also have the
more literal and additive sense ‘direct (towards)’, with a variety of objects.
Particularly telling in our case is VIII.24.1 ā́śiṣāmahi bráhméndrāya “we direct our
formulation to Indra,” with a verbal product as object.
This now brings us to the simile. The skeleton of the clause means “They
direct (X) like a messenger …” Let us focus now on dūtá-; what can be being
compared to it here? This is the only occurrence of this well-attested word or its
derivatives in IX. The overwhelmingly standard referent of dūtá- is of course Agni;
however, there is a subset of passages in which the dūtá- is a hymn, praise-song, vel
sim. Cf. V.43.8 … gī́r dūtó ná gantv aśvínā huvádhyai “let the hymn come like a
messenger to invoke the Aśvins”; IV.33.1 dūtám iva vā́cam “my speech like a
messenger”; VI.63.1 dūtó ná stómaḥ “our praise-song like a messenger” (sim.
VIII.26.16 stómo dūtáḥ). I suggest that in this hymn, so focused on the mental and
verbal products of the poets, the object that “those of insightful though” (manīṣínaḥ)
are directing is some variety of thought or hymn. Just trolling through the previous
vss. provides a number of candidates: víp- ‘inspired word’ (1d), dhī́- ‘insightful
thought’ (2c), gā́thā- ‘song’ (4a), dhītí- ‘insightful thought’ (4c), and manīṣā́-
‘inspired thought’ (extracted from manīṣín- in our 5d). Although none of these is
masc. to match dūtá-, the genders of simile and frame do not have to agree (note fem.
gír- in V.43.8, vā́c- in IV.33.1, both cited above).
Finally, what about the purpose dat. pūrvácittaye? This form, occurring 8x,
only in the dat., in all of its occurrences can mean “for X to be first in (s.o.’s)
thoughts.” See comm. ad I.112.1. In two of its occurrences (VIII.3.9, 6.9) it is a
formulation (bráhma) that we want to be first in Indra’s thought: e.g., VIII.3.9 tát tvā
yāmi suvī́ryam, tád bráhma pūrvácittaye “I beg you for a mass of good heroes and for
the sacred formulation to be first in your thought.” I suggest that this is the exact
configuration we have here, if we supply a verbal product as the obj. of ā́śāsate, as
the parallel to dūtám in the simile, and as the subject of the infinitival pūrvácittaye. A
supplied “hymn / thought / formulation” works well with all three of these nested
elements and yields sense: “Those of insightful thought direct (a
thought/formulation) like a messenger to be first in his thought.” I would now
substitute this tr.

### 06
Ge and Re (also Ober II.43) attach c to d as a new sentence, but this makes
the already somewhat difficult simile in c all the more puzzling: what does
depositing his seed have to do with displaying his eloquence? Whereas b and c work
better together: in b “Soma sits in the cups” - that is, the liquid soma is poured into
receptacles, expressed in the loc. (camū́ṣu). In c this same transfer of liquid is
compared to depositing seed/semen (réta ādádhat) in an animal, also in the loc.
(paśaú). So the structural parallelism between simile and frame is exact. The
problem is the loc. paśaú, for morphologically this should be masc. or at best neut.,
but the image is of impregnation, and for that we want a fem. My ad hoc solution is
to assume that paśú- here is used as a collective ‘livestock’, in reference to stockbreeding as a general practice.

### 07
The sense of pāda c is not immediately apparent; its interpr. develops from
an appreciation of the idiom inherent in the noun saṃdadí-. As discussed esp. ad
I.139.1 (but see also IX.10.8, 79.4), the lexeme sám √dā belongs to √dā ‘tie’ and is
used in the quite narrow idiom ‘tie/attach navel [ACC] to navel [LOC]’, generally as a
metaphor to assert or display a family tie between something human and earthly and
something divine and in heaven. In Re’s words (n. to our passage): “partout dit du
nombril comme point d’attache entre terre et ciel; on pourra donc ici même suppléer
nā́bhiḥ” - though his tr. “quand il se reconnaît dans les (eaux que) voici, s’unissant (à
elles)” reflects that interpr. only darkly, at best. The earthly/heavenly connection, in
lapidary shorthand, seems to be the intent of our passage, though ‘navel’ is absent. In
this particular case I would accept Lü’s constantly asserted conception of the
heavenly waters and their connection to Soma. Here because Soma’s umbilical tie to
the heavenly waters (represented by the prn. āsu fem. loc.) is well known, he plunges
into the ritual waters - though Lü (23-39) identifies the two sets of waters exactly
oppositely: the āsu are the earthly waters, and the “great waters” (mahī́r apáḥ) the
heavenly ones. The other occurrence of saṃdadí- at II.39.7 is more attenuated even
than this one.
Note that ví gāhate here forms a ring with prá gāhate in 2b, which might
support my view that the great waters are the ones at the ritual.

##  100
On the structure of this hymn, or rather two twinned hymns (1-5, 4-9), see
publ. intro. The hymn also has an even higher percentage of repeated and partially
repeated pādas than usual in the Soma maṇḍala. See Ge’s nn. for some of them.

### 01
abhī́with lengthened final may conceal the enclitic acc. ī, anticipating the
accs. in b. In fact, because of its position before nasal (abhī́navante) it might
represent a degeminated *īm.
The mothers without deceit are, as noted by Ge and Re, the hymns.

### 04
With Ge and Re (who follow Sāy.) I supply ‘horse’ as the headnoun on
which jigyúṣaḥ (‘of the one having won / of a victor’) depends in the simile marked
by yathā. This seems reasonable, even though there is little positive evidence for it.
The pf. part. jigiváṃs- / jigyúṣ- doesn’t enter into a similar construction elsewhere,
and the subj. of (pári) √dhāv is overwhelmingly Soma. Otherwise we occasionally
find cows (VIII.22.4, IX.66.6, X.145.6), but “runs like the cow of a victor” does not
impose itself. In IX.87.7 we do find a steed (árvan-: … pári sómaḥ pavítre …
adadhāvad árvā), and that parallel will have to do. The simile in the 2nd hemistich,
vājī́va sānasíḥ “like a winner bringing prizes” reinforces this interpr., since vājínregularly modifies ‘horse’, but of course similes in the same vs. don’t have to have
the same content.

### 05
Note the matching krátve … kave beginning and ending the 1st pāda.
### 06-09
As noted in the publ. intro., these vss., constituting a separate hymn,
echo and vary the 1st hymn, vss. 1-5.

### 06
The first vs. of the new hymn matches the final vs. (5) of the previous one:
6ab pávasva … dhā́rayā sutáḥ enlarges on 5b pávasva soma dhā́rayā, with 5c
containing sutáḥ. The 2nd hemistichs of both vss. consist primarily of datives of the
gods who will drink the soma, both beginning with Indra: 5cd índrāya …, mitrā́ya
váruṇāya ca; 6cd índrāya … víṣṇave, devébhyaḥ … There is also a strong echo of vs.
4: 6a vājasā́tamaḥ ‘best winner of prizes’ incorporates in a single word the simile in
4d vājī́va sānasíḥ “like a winner possessing prizes.”

### 07
This vs. replicates most of vs. 1 in a different order. I will cite here only
the repeated elements: 1 … adrúhaḥ … / vatsáṃ ná … jātáṃ rihanti mātáraḥ
7 … rihanti mātáraḥ … adrúhaḥ / vatsáṃ jātáṃ ná …
On the repeated pāda (d) pávamāna vídharmaṇi see comm. ad IX.64.9 and
also Ober II.152.

### 08
This vs. has nothing in common with its match, vs. 2, until the end, where
the two d pādas are identical: víśvāni dāśúṣo gṛhé “all (things) in the house of the
pious man.” The two pādas are adapted to two very different themes: in 2 ‘all’
modifies vásūni ‘goods’ (c), which Soma will make flourish in the house of the
pious, whereas in 7 the context is darker: ‘all’ modifies támāṃsi ‘dark shades’, which
Soma smashes away in the same location.

### 09
The contents and phraseology of this vs. are furthest from its match, vs. 3,
but as noted in the publ. tr., dyā́ṃ ca … pṛthivī́ṃ ca in 9ab recalls 3cd (vásūni)
pā́rthivā divyā́ca “heavenly and earthly goods.”

##  101
On the division of this hymn into tṛcas and the structure of the hymn in
general see publ. intro. The Anukramaṇī assigns each tṛca to a different poet, in
roughly reverse (conceptual) chronological order. The last tṛca plus appended vs.,
vss. 13-16, is credited to Prajāpati, the Middle Vedic creator god, with no
patronymic. The poet of the 2nd to last tṛca, vss. 10-12, is given as Manu
Sāṃvaraṇa. This poet is in fact referred to, with the patryonymic Sāṃvaraṇi, in the
first Vālakhilya hymn, VIII.51.1 yáthā mánau sāṃvaraṇau, sómam indrā́pibaḥ sutám
“Just as at Manu Sāṃvaraṇi's you drank pressed soma, Indra …” But even if the
reference is just to a revered ancient poet, the name Manu, as the ur-man and ursacrificer, resonates in the context of Prajāpati. Moreover, there’s a missing step: the
Anukr. attributes V.33-34 to one Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya, who would be the gapped
generational link between Prajāpati and Manu Sāṃvaraṇa (/i). The names of the next
two poets display the proper generational relationship: the third tṛca from the end
(vss. 7-9) is by Nahuṣa Mānava, with his patronymic from Manu; the fourth tṛca
from the end (vss. 4-6) by Yayāti Nāhuṣa, again taking his patronymic from the next
poet in order. The first tṛca (vss. 1-3) does not participate in this generational chain;
it is attributed to Andhīgu Śyāvāśvi, a patronymic that links him to the skilled poet of
the Marut hymns of V (52-61), Śyāvāśva Ātreya (for further on this attribution see
comm. ad vs. 1 below). Leaving Andhīgu aside, it seems that the Anukr. takes the
hymn from a presumably contemporary poet Yayāti back through the ages (and 4-5
generations) to the primal god Prajāpati, whose primacy is signaled by his lack of
patronymic.
### 01-03
There is no particular unity visible in this tṛca, and vs. 1 in particular
stands apart from the rest.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro. the appearance of the sacrifice-defiling dog in
this vs. and vs. 13 sketches a ring. The content of the vs. and its reason for inclusion
here are puzzling. Our long-tongued dog (acc. śvā́nam … dīrghajihvyàm) is clearly
connected with a story widely attested in Vedic prose of an female demon, an Asurī
called “Long-tongued” (dīrghajihvī́), who licks (and thus defiles) the sacrifice. The
story is found in texts belonging to all three ritual Vedas: RV: AB II.22; YV: MS
III.10.6, KS XXIX.1; SV: JB I.161-63, PB XIII.6.9-10, though it is most developed
in the JB, where it takes a distinctly and entertainingly sexual turn. The story is
treated extensively by Oertel in a number of publs. (see reff. in O’Flaherty, JB, pp.
124-25) and tr. by Caland in JB in Auswahl and his ed. of PB (incl. an Engl. tr. of the
JB version ad PB XIII.6.10); see also W. D. O’Flaherty, Tales of Sex and Violence:
Folklore, Sacrifice, and Danger in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa (1985), 100-103.
Whether the long-tongued demoness of prose is identical with or was inspired by our
long-tongued dog is unclear, but at least the JB connects its account, perhaps
secondarily, with our vs. After Indra set a certain Sumitra to seduce the demoness
and get her into his power so that Indra could slay her, Sumitra calls upon Indra with
our vs. (quoted in the JB text I.162), which Indra then makes into his vajra, raises as
his weapon (etām anuṣṭubhaṃ vajram udyatya), and smites her. The same vs. then
figures in the immediately following story (I.162-63), in which Śyāvāśva, rather
nastily tricked by his Sattra mates, recites the verse (now named the Śyāvāśva
sāman), to get himself to heaven. And this story involving Śyāvāśva himself is
followed soon after (JB I.165) by one whose main character is Andhīgu (see also PB
VIII.5.8-12). So at least serially Andhīgu and Śyāvāśva connect to Dīrghajihvī -
remember that the poet of this tṛca is given by the Anukr. as Andhīgu Śyāvāśva.
Unfortunately nothing in the prose narratives provides any help in interpreting
our vs., esp. the hapax cmpd. purójiti-. Both Ge and Re take the instr. purójitī as
expressing purpose: “auf dass euer Trank zuvörderst siege”; “afin qu'il y ait victoire
de votre jus.” I do not understand the case syntax of this (instr. of purpose?), esp. as
the standard dative of purpose appears in the next pāda (sutā́ya mādayitnáve), and,
with the omission of vaḥ, a similar dat. *purojitáye would have fit this vs. line. Old
takes the instr. seriously and construes ándhasaḥ with sutā́ya, which is certainly
possible: “Durch euren vor (in lokalem Sinn) ihm gewonnenen (und ihn so
beschützenden) Sieg schlagt dem berauschenden Saft des ándhas den langzüngigen
Hund, ihr Freunde, hinweg.” My own interpr. instead takes ándhasaḥ with purójitī:
the “advance victory over the stalk” is by this interpr. the priests’ initial victory over
the stalk, by pressing it for its juice, leaving it mangled and spent. This initial victory
may provide the model for the violence against the encroaching dog. But I am not at
all certain of this interpr.
### 02-03
These two vss. are quoted in JB I.163 just after Indra’s use of our vs. 1
to kill the demoness, and the set of vss. is prescribed for the smiting of haters, rivals,
demonic power, and evil. These are the only two Gāyatrī vss. in this Anuṣṭubh hymn.

### 02
Rather than making c a nominal main clause (with Ge and Re), I think it
better to take the whole vs. as a rel. cl., dependent on tám, which opens the next vs.

### 03
On the impossible word duróṣa(s)- see comm. ad VIII.1.13. This is the
only one of its three occurrences where it qualifies soma, though in Avestan dūraošais only used of haoma. Ge refuses to tr. (though he discusses it extensively in n. 3a);
Re ‘difficile à mouvoir’ (see his n. for disc.).
The lengthened ī́of abhī́may represent abhí + ī, the enclitic acc., as I suggest
for the same form in the preceding hymn, IX.100.1. In fact, just as in 100.1, it could
represent a degeminated īm before the nasal of náraḥ.
Both Ge and Re take yajñám as the direct obj. of hinvanti rather than the goal,
as I do (Ge “Soma … als Opfer”). It is certainly true that yajñám √hi is found
elsewhere (see Ge’s n. 3c) and that the dat. is more often used for goal or purpose
with √hi. Still, the sacrifice is so often the goal of motion, the goal of motion is so
often in the acc., and soma is so often the obj. of √hi that I prefer to keep soma and
the sacrifice as separate entities.
### 04-06
No particular unity in this tṛca unless the mention of Indra in each vs.
counts. After the difficulties of the 1st tṛca, this one is blessedly simple.

### 05
On the double sense of makhá- and its denom. and deriv., see I.18.9,
III.31.7.

### 06
The phrase samudró vācamīṅkhayáḥ recalls the variant compds in IX.35.2
and 5: samudramīṅkhaya (2a) and vācamīṅkhayám (5a).
Note that all 4 pādas begin with s-.
### 07-09
Again, quite straightforward and not particularly cohesive.

### 07
bhū́man- generally means ‘earth’ (as opposed to heaven) or ‘world’. Here
it seems a little outside its usual patch, as a metrical driven variant of the common
phrase víśvasya bhúvanasya “of all creation”; see esp. IX.86.5 pátir víśvasya
bhúvanasya rājasi matching our pátir víśvasya bhū́manaḥ, but also occurrences in
I.164.21, II.27.4, 40.1, III.46.2, V.85.3, IX.86.28, 36, 97.56, X.45.6, 168.2, all but
one straddling a late caesura, where the two light init. syllables of bhuvanasya fit
well; bhúvanasya of course fits the cadence of no Vedic meter.

### 09
Both Ge and Re supply ‘wealth’ (rayím), found in d, as the referent of all
the previous nom. and acc. forms. I think rather of Indra. The splv. ójiṣṭha- regularly
modifies Indra (and never wealth). Though Ge is correct (n. 9a) that śravā́yya- is a
“beliebtes Beiwort” of wealth, Indra is hardly unworthy of fame, and see V.86.2b,
where du. śravā́yyā characterizes Indra and Agni. In the same vs. (V.86.2c) both
gods are described as yā́páñca carṣanī́r abhí (though variants of this pāda are
usually applied to Agni alone: IV.7.4=V.23.1, VII.15.2), exactly like our c save for
the number of the rel. prn. The clinching arg. against rayí- as the referent seems to
me to be pāda d. Ge and Re clearly take the rel. cl. there as consisting only of yéna
vánāmahai, with pāda-init. acc. rayím part of the main cl.: the referent for tám back
in pāda a and the antecedent of immed. flg. yéna in its own pāda. But this would be
an unusual syntactic configuration for several reasons. First, there’s a rel. cl. (in c)
intervening between the acc. tám and its distant referent in pāda a (and acc. modifier
in b). Moreover, in a pāda with the structure #X REL …, the rel. is usually postposed
and the pāda syntactically self-contained - that is, the X is part of the rel. cl. The type
of intra-pāda clausal break envisioned by Ge/Re is rare. Moreover, Ge and Re are
required to interpr. vánāmahai in absolute usage (“… wir Sieger werden”; “nous
serons vainqueurs”), but √van ordinarily takes a direct object, on occasion, in fact,
rayím (e.g., VI.38.1). For all these reasons I think it’s clear that rayím and yéna in d
cannot be coreferential and we need a different referent for the tám and yá- forms -
with Indra the most obvious one, for the reasons just given.
In c I supply a form of √as with abhí in the meaning ‘surmount, dominate,
prevail over’.
### 10-12
Again no particular signs of cohesion, save for the X-víd- ‘finding X’
cmpds in 10b, 10d, and 11d.
### 11
This vs. shows a few minor disturbances. To begin with, the employment
of the preverb / particle ví is unclear. Gr takes it with the pf. part. suṣvānā́saḥ, which
it immed. follows, but √su is not otherwise found with ví. Moreover, tmesis of
preverbs with participles is fairly rare, though at least here the two forms are
adjacent. Re construes it with the aor. part. cítānāḥ in b; here the problem is
opposite: ví √cit is indeed an idiom, but not only is tmesis in participles rare, but the
position of ví, if it’s a preverb in tmesis, would be anomalous: mid-pāda and not only
separated from its participle, but also intrusive in a consituent: suṣvānā́saḥ …
ádribhiḥ “having been pressed by stones.” I don’t have a real solution, but I wonder
if it’s meant to evoke the “through/across the sheep’s fleece” expression, found, e.g.,
in nearby IX.100.4 … vy àvyáyam (cf. also IX.13.6, 49.4, 61.17, 67.5, 85.5, 97.56,
109.16). It is also possible that ví .. cítānāḥ somehow anticipates vipaścítaḥ in the
next vs. (12a), but this seems a long shot.
The part. cítāna- is another bit of a problem. It is the only form to this part.,
which seems to belong to a root aor. otherwise found mostly in the well-attested pass.
aor. áceti / céti. The semantics works fine, but for a root aor. part. its root accent is
anomalous (expect *citāná-), and in fact a root-accented zero-grade is peculiar
whatever the formation. It could of course have voc. accent - but there’s no place for
a voc. in this 3rd ps. context. Perhaps it received its root accent redactionally in
imitation of vipaścítaḥ in 12a.
Both Ge and Re take the verbal idiom in cd as transitive, or at least construe
iṣám as a species of Inhaltsakk. (e.g., “nous ont en résonnant assemblé de toutes parts
la jouissance-rituelle”). But Re’s invocation of the idiom abhí … sám √svar as the
basis for our abhítaḥ, sám asvaran seems quite apposite, and that idiom is intrans.
with an acc. of goal. See, e.g., IX.110.8 índram abhí … sám asvaran “ They cried out
in unison towards Indra” (sim. IX.106.11, 67.9). The conversion of the preverb abhí
into the adverbial abhítaḥ would not be responsible for transitivizing the idiom. Cf.,
e.g., X.27.8 hávā íd aryó abhítaḥ sám āyan “The cries of the Stranger came together
from all sides.” I agree that íṣam is an unexpected goal for this idiom, but I think we
have to live with it.
### 13-15
The dog returns from the first tṛca in the first vs. of this one. The tṛca
is also more rhetorically ambitious than those in the middle of this hymn, with an
abundance of similes (13b, d, 14b, c, d, 15b). Vss. 14 and 15 end identically.

### 13  
Ge takes ná in b as the neg. (flg. Sāy.) and asserts (n. 13), contra Old, that
the presence of the mortal and the dog in this vs. (and the VS vs. Old cites) is an
accident. But the position of ná in the pāda is that of the simile particle (though at
least it would immed. precede the verb), and the wealth of similes in this tṛca
supports a simile reading here as well. The point of the hemistich is that, like the
human, the dog is attracted to the sound of the soma ritual, particularly the sound of
the soma pressing, and invades it.
The 2nd hemistich begins like 1c: ápa śvā́nam …
The simile in d, “as the Bhr̥gus did the Battler” (makháṃ ná bhṛ́gavaḥ), refers
to what Ge calls an otherwise unknown saga. The makhá- is found as a defeated
enemy of Indra in X.171.2, a hymn attributed to one Iṭa Bhārgava, the patronymic of
the victors in our vs.. Note that the denom. verb makhasyate occurs in our vs. 5c.

### 14  
The d pāda (varó) ná yónim āsádam is almost identical to 15d (vedhā́) ná
yónim āsádam, both expressing the endpoint of Soma’s ritual journey.

### 15  
The isolated summary vs. The cow’s hide (gávye ádhi tvací) closely
matches gór ádhi tvací in 11b, but the sheep’s fleece is found nowhere else in the
hymn, unless the ví of 11a gestures towards it. See comm. ad loc.

### 102-06
The following 5 hymns are in Uṣṇih, technically 8 8 / 12 or 8 8 / 8 4 (see
Arnold, p. 8). In some hymns, esp. IX.102, the latter variant prevails; that is, there is
a word break before the last 4 syllables, which can seem like a syntactic afterthought.
In others, the last 4 syllables are not detachable, and we must assume a 12-syl pāda;
see, e.g., IX.103.2 … kṛṇute háriḥ, with 5-syllable finale.

##  102
On the structure of this hymn, see publ. intro. As just noted, the 8 8 / 8 4
variant of Uṣṇih is found throughout the hymn.

### 01
On krāṇā́as instr. see comm. ad IX.86.19. It is echoed by the instr. krátvā
in the ring-compositional final vs., 8a. As noted ad IX.86.19, with Lü and Re (see
also Tichy Kl.Sch 210) but contra Ge, I construe mahī́nām with śíśuḥ here.
As noted in the publ. intro., the phrase hinvánn ṛtásya dī́dhitim in b forms a
ring with the same phrase in the final vs. of the hymn, 8c. Both occurrence fill a
pāda, but the repetition in 8 is followed by the 4-syl. extension prā́dhavaré (i.e., prá
adhvaré), which needs to be integrated into the clause.
It is not entirely clear what “all the dear things” are that Soma encompasses in
c, but on the basis of vs. 2 they may be Soma’s domains (dhā́man-) or places, i.e., the
various stations on the ritual ground that the soma passes through.
The 4-syl. extension in this vs., ádha dvitā́, has the look of a new syntactic
unit, since ádha is almost always pāda/clause initial, but it also has to be integrated
into what precedes.
### 02-03
Trita figures in these two vss. Although the name Trita has several
different referents, or at least several different roles, in the RV, in Maṇḍala IX he is
the archetypal soma presser: see esp. comm. ad IX.37.4. In these two vss. there is
also a play on the literal sense of tritá- ‘third’, which is played off against the dual
pāṣyòḥ in 2a and the numeral trī́ṇi ‘three’ in 3a. The Anukr. ascribes this hymn to
Trita Āptya, a mythical figure most prominent in X.8, but this ascription is
presumably based on the occurrence of tritá- in vss. 2-3. Trita Āptya is credited with
several other hymns in the RV, incl., in this maṇḍala, IX.33-34.

### 02
On pāṣī́- see comm. ad I.56.6, the only other occurrence of this stem. In
both instances it is dual and seems to refer to a twinned body part. Under this
analysis in this passage the body part is metaphorical, referring to the two “jaws” of
the soma press, a metaphor also found in the later ritual literature. See Ge (n. 2a) on
this interpr., also fld. by Re.
The syntax of the vs. as a whole is very puzzling, and the publ. tr. differs from
the way Ge/Re (also Klein DGRV II.128-29) configure its parts - though I recognize
the problem inherent in my old interpr. The overarching question that will govern
how the details are interpr. is what to do with pāda b. In particular, is ábhakta the
verb of the main cl., with immed. flg. yád gúhā padám a self-contained nominal rel.
cl. dependent on the main cl, or is ábhakta part of the yád cl., with postposed
subordinator yád? Either of these is syntactically possible; Ge/Re opt for the former,
I for the latter. Cf. for the former Re’s “Entre les deux machoires de T., (le soma) a
eu part au séjour (qui est) dans la cachette.” Ge’s tr. simply elides the yád: “In des
Trita Kinnladen (?) hat er seine geheime Stufe erreicht.”
There are several problems with this interpr. First (and perhaps least
problematic): úpa at the beg. of the vs. then appears to be a preverb in tmesis with
ábhakta, but úpa √bhaj is not found anywhere else, either in the RV or elsewhere in
Skt. (to judge from MonWms). For a small set of passages incl. this one, Gr allows
for úpa with following loc. in the sense “bei, auf,” and this is probably the way to go
if one accepts the Ge/Re configuration—to take úpa as a preposition, rather than
positing an otherwise unattested lexeme úpa √bhaj. For my interpr. of úpa in the
publ. tr., see below.
The sense that must be attributed to ábhakta (usually ‘have a share, share in’)
under their interpr. is stretched. Ge simply tr. “hat ... erreicht,” which is hard to
reconcile with the normal usages of the root. In this he follows Gr: “6) me. einen Ort
oder Gegenstand [A.] erreichen, hingelangen,” but Gr assigns this contextually
generated usage to this passage alone. Re’s “a eu part au séjour” is attentive to the
meaning of the root, but what does the tr. actually mean?
Then there is the question of what to do with the rest of the verse after these
1st two pādas, which in Ge/Re/Klein’s various renderings gets loosely attached to
what precedes with no logical or syntactic connection. Cf., e.g., Klein’s tr. of the
whole vs.: “In the two stones of Trita (Soma) has taken for himself a place (of
refuge) which is hidden, together (with) the seven orders of the worship, and dear."
My publ. interpr. starts with the other configuration of pāda b sketched above,
that the pāda is a syntactic unit, a subord. cl. marked by yád with ábhakta as its verb.
I further take ábhakta … padám to be an instance of the rare idiom PATH + √bhaj
(med.) ‘take to the path’, found in VII.39.1 bhejā́te … pánthām, VII.18.16 bhejé
pathó vartaním; see comm. ad VII.18.16. Taking padá- as ‘track’, we arrive at a tr.
of b “when he took to the hidden track” - meaning, in my view, when Soma set out
on his journey of ritual preparation after being pressed.
As for verse-initial úpa, elsewhere in IX it's almost always used with a verb of
motion (usually √yā) with acc. goal: cf. esp. the repeated phrase GEN úpa yāti
niṣkrtám̥ “he goes the rendezvous with X.” I therefore supply a verb of motion here,
with the goal reached only at the end of the vs. in acc. priyám “his own dear
(place/domain [perhaps supply dhā́ma]).” The intermediate instr. phrase yajñásya
saptá dhā́mabhiḥ is, by this interpr., an instr. of extent of space and indicates the
course of his journey, “through the seven domains of the sacrifice.” The 4-syllable
extension ádha priyám, like ádha dvitā́in vs. 1, puts some syntactic distance between
priyám and the rest of the vs. Here it might help indicate the arduous nature of the
journey and the achievement of arriving at the goal, as my “now right to his own
dear (place)” is meant to convey.
This interpr. seems to me to provide a more satisfactory account of the vs.
than the other alternative. However, it has one major drawback: the yád clause of b is
embedded within the main clause, which occupies pādas a, c (/d). If I follow this
interpr., there is no way of avoiding this violation of standard practice, whereas in
the Ge/Re/Klein interpr. yád gúhā padám is a nominal cl., which is permitted
internally. Weighing the two alternatives, I still find myself inclined to my own,
though I don’t have an explanation for the problematic embedding. That there
appears to be a parenthetic inserted clause in the next vs. may indicate that this hymn
is somewhat more lax about the combination of syntactic units than we usually meet
with.

### 03
This vs., too, gives the initial impression of a random series of elements
strung together, which are difficult to construe with each other. Note, for ex., that ab
contains five different nominal forms in four different cases, which cannot easily be
connected. I take the vs. as a whole as a restatement of vs. 2, or an extension of it -
describing the progress of Soma through his ritual preparation. The vs. is discussed
at length by Old, in part responding to a treatment of it by Macdonell in JRAS 1893.
With trī́ṇi I supply ‘filters’, on the basis of IX.73.8 and IX.97.55 (see comm.
ad locc.); see also the three seats (trī ṣadhásthā) in the next hymn (IX.103.2) in the
same verse with sheep’s fleece filters. The same interpr. is shared by Old
(tentatively) and Re, while Ge construes trī́ṇi with yójanā in c, which has the merit of
not requiring supplied material, but the referent is fairly distant from its adj. (the
basis of Old’s objection to this interpr.).
The next question is on what does gen. tritásya depend. I take it with pṛṣṭhéṣu
‘on the backs’ on the basis of IX.37.4 tritásyā́dhi sā́navi “on the back of Trita” (with
a different word for ‘back’). See comm. ad IX.37.4. So also Old, while Re construes
it with both trī́ṇi and pṛṣṭhéṣu and Ge with trī́ṇi. The displacement of tritásya from its
headnoun can be easily explained by the desire to juxtapose ‘three’ and (lit.) ‘third’:
trī́ṇi tritásya.
The real problem in this hemistich, however, is what to do with the impv.
érayā and the acc. rayím. The verb doesn’t fit easily into the ritual context nor does
the acc. ‘wealth’. See Old for various possibilities, none of which he particularly
likes. Re makes a valiant attempt to make ab into a single cl., but the semantically
and syntactically ill-suited awkwardness is apparent: “Stimule avec (ton) jet les trois
(filtres) de Trita, (pour procurer) la richesse sur les (trois) dos (de Trita).” For one
thing ‘stimulating’ or ‘rousing’ the filters isn’t a standard (or even non-standard)
action at the soma sacrifice, and his parenthetic “(pour procurer)” glosses over the
fact that rayím has no syntactic connection to the rest of the clause.
For this reason I reluctantly accept Ge’s solution (considered but disfavored
by Old), to take the impv. as part of a parenthetical clause, though I restrict that
clause more than he does. He takes all of b as parenthetical: “—auf deinem Rücken
bringe Reichtum her—” while I would limit it to the impv. + ACC.: —“rouse
wealth!—” Although I am loath to solve syntactic problems by a wholesale positing
of parentheticals, this seems the least objectionable way to deal with ab. It is not
clear to me who the addressee of the impv. is, nor do any of the standard interpr.
seem to worry about this question. I very much doubt that it is Soma, who is
otherwise referred to only in the 3rd ps. throughout the hymn, until the final vs.; I
find it unlikely that this hymn-length consistency and the dramatic contrast created
by the switch in persons in the final vs. would be violated by a seemingly irrelevant
impv. just here. The most likely addressee is a ritual officiant of some sort. On a
possible interpr. of the short impv. phrase see comm. on the next vs.
The 2nd hemistich is, by contrast, relatively straightforward and, like 2cd,
sketches the length of the territory Soma traverses, with the verb ví √mā ‘measure
out’ and yójana-, a measure of distance. The preverb ví is in tmesis and takes its
position after the verb at the beginning of the final, short pāda.

### 04
The “seven mothers” (saptá mātáraḥ) are presumably the rivers (contra Ge
n. 4ab, who prefers dhītí- or ‘sisters’), which we also met in vs. 1 as the “great (fem.)
ones.” Their appearance here strengthens the likelihood that mahī́nām in 1a is
dependent on śíśuḥ; see comm. there.
On vedhā́m instead of expected vedhásam see comm. ad IX.26.3.
The other two occurrences of śriyé in IX (IX.94.4, 104.1) are associated with
birth/child: IX.94.4 śriyé jātáḥ and, in the next hymn, IX.104.1 śíśuṃ ná ... śriyé. I
therefore construe jajñānám … śriyé together, despite their polarized positions at the
two ends of the hemistich.
As Ge points out (n. 4c), dhruvá- can modify rayí- (IV.2.7 and, in this
maṇḍala, IX.20.4). I therefore think dhruvó rayīṇā́m is abbreviated from dhruvó
*rayír rayīṇā́m. Unfortunately in Engl. “enduring wealth of wealths” is too awkward
to be parsable, hence my “(treasure) of treasures.” Even more unfortunately the
switch in the Engl. obscures the relationship of this vs. to the preceding one. In the
context of this vs. the imperative clause “rouse wealth!” (érayā rayím) in 3b can be
reinterp. as tantamount to “rouse Soma!” since Soma here is identified as rayí-, in
fact the best rayí-.
The 4-syl. addendum pāda is a self-contained subordinate clause, cikéta yát,
as is the identically structured juṣánta yát in the next vs. (5d). The poet uses the
unusual metrical pattern to his advantage in this hymn. Both Ge and Re think that
‘wealth’ is the understood complement of cikéta, and this would find some support in
VII.95.2 rāyáś cétantī “taking note of wealth.” However, as just disc., I consider
rayīṇā́m in c as part of a phrase describing Soma. Moreover, as Ge points out (n.
4ab), cíketa responds to aśāsata ‘they instructed’ in b, and I therefore think that the
point is that Soma paid attention to his mothers’ instruction.

### 05
My unsignalled addition, “your,” to the nominal cl. of c is unsupported
and, I’m now sure, wrong. (It mindlessly follows Ge.) As noted ad vs. 3, Soma is
always in the 3rd ps. in this hymn till the final vs. And the initial asyá of pāda a
reinforces this. I would now change the tr. to “… are his joys.”
As in the previous vs., the 4-syl. last pāda is a self-contained subord. cl.,
juṣánta yát, with víśve devā́ḥ of b as its subj. Note that juṣánta picks up sajóṣasaḥ in
a, which modifies víśve devā́ḥ. The etymological responsion might have better
conveyed by a more literal tr., such as ‘of joint pleasure, sharing pleasure’.

### 06
This vs. consists of a rel. cl., which is implicitly picked up by the following
vs.
The extra four-syllable pāda here consists of a single acc. adj., which is
entirely integrated into the rest of the vs., in contrast to the slight syntactic distance
the metrical boundary creates in other vss. in this hymn.

### 07
This vs. does not contain an overt referent for the rel. cl. of the previous vs.
Ge, Re, and the publ. tr. all supply both this antecedent and a verb: “to him come.”
This makes sense, but the only (indirect) support for it is abhí ‘towards’. I would be
more comfortable if abhí were initial.
There are several candidates for the identity of the “two mothers of truth”
ṛtásya mātárā. The exact phrase yahvī́ṛtásya mātárā refers both to Night and Dawn
(I.142.7, V.5.6) and to the two World Halves (VI.17.6, X.59.8). In IX.33.5 in the
plural it refers to sacred formulations configured as cows. On the phrase see Lü
(631), who rightly disputes Ge’s “… (Tochter) und Mütter”; Lü thinks the ref. here is
to the World Halves, but gives no evidence that I could see. However, this
identification is likely to be correct, in that samīciné in all three of its other
occurrences, incl. 2 in this maṇḍala (IX.74.2, 90.4, X.44.8), is used of the World
Halves.
The 2nd hemistich changes subject abruptly without a signal, beyond the
change in number/gender from fem. du. (samīciné … yahvī́… mātárā) to masc. pl. in
cd. In fact the plural number only becomes clear with the last word, the 3rd pl. verb
añjaté; the part. tanvānā́(ḥ) that opens the hemistich could be du., given its sandhi
position, tanvānā́yajñám - but it would have to be masc. du. The identity of the
masc. pl. is not clear, but the default, esp. given the meaning and usage of both the
part. and the finite verb, would be the ritual officiants.
The fourth, short pāda superficially looks like those in vss. 4 and 5, though in
opposite order—yád añjate—but it is not self-contained like them but belongs to the
clause in c. Nonetheless, the positioning of yád at the beginning of the little pāda
provides the same bit of distance we’ve found in most of the vss. of this hymn.

### 08
As noted several times above, this is the first and only time that Soma is
referred to in the 2nd ps. in this hymn, and only in the injunc, verb ṛnór ápa ‘you
unclosed’. The switch in person is particularly noteworthy because this vs. forms a
ring with vs. 1, sharing the pāda 1b, 8c—so the switch in person and the unity
implied by the ring are, as it were, at odds with each other.
On ṛṇóti + ápa / ví see comm. ad I.58.3. In our passage Soma has been made
the protagonist of the Vala myth (see Ober II.217).
In the publ. tr. I tr. the verb as a preterite, but I would now be inclined to
render it as a general pres. (sim. to KH’s view, Injunk. 122), as a repeated ritual
action performed by Soma reenacting the Vala myth.
On the 4-syl. afterthought pāda prā́dhvaré, which is found several times in
Uṣṇih or its equivalent, see comm. ad VIII.12.31-33. I argue there that it is a
truncated version of the fairly widespread loc. absol. prayaty àdhvaré “while the
ceremony is pro(ceeding).” I would now change the tr. here to “… spurring the
visionary power of truth while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).” Once again the final
pāda is a semi-separable unit.

##  103
On the structure of this hymn and its relationship to the previous hymn
IX.102, see publ. intro. Unlike IX.102, the variant of Uṣṇih employed here seems to
be 8 8 / 12: in two of the six vss. the configuration of words makes a separable 4-
syllable final pāda impossible (2c: … kṛṇute háriḥ#; 3c … saptá nūṣata#), and
though the other four vss. end with a 4-syllable word, only in vs. 1 does this show the
syntactic distancing found throughout IX.102.
As was noted in the publ. intro., IX.102 and 103 share thematic and lexical
material. A list of the most obvious includes
vs. 1: vedhás- / 102.4
 jújoṣate / juṣánta 102.5
vs. 2: “three seats” reminiscent of trī́ṇi in 102.3, not to mention the two tritá's
in 102.2, 3.
vs. 3: vā́ṇīr ṛ́ṣīṇām saptá / 102.4 saptá mātáraḥ
vs. 4b: viśvádevo ádābhyaḥ / 102.5b víśve devā́so adrúhaḥ
This pattern breaks down in the latter part of the hymn. Moreover, IX.103 is
considerably more straightforward than 102, and it also possesses a different, quite
salient structuring device, the fronted preverb that opens each vs.: prá (1), pári (2-6).
As was also noted in the publ. intro., pári has less and less integral connection to the
rest of the vs. as the hymn goes on.

### 01
Ge takes ab as a nominal sentence, separate from c, with vácaḥ the nom.
subj.: “… wird eine Rede angehoben.” Re takes ab independently as well, but
supplies a 1st ps. verb, which introduces needless complications. Although I was
tempted by Ge’s interpr., there are two problems: 1) It leaves the opening preverb
prá orphaned. Though Gr lists a prá úd √yam ‘die Stimme erheben’, in fact he
registers it only for this passage, which does not inspire confidence in the lexeme,
and furthermore having one of two preverbs in tmesis with a ppl. might be unusual.
If we do not separate ab from c, prá can be construed with the verb bharā in c in the
common lexeme prá √bhṛ. 2) The vácaḥ in b has to be resupplied in c to provide the
frame for the simile bhṛtíṃ ná, whereas if there is no break, acc. vácaḥ is readily
available.
In c the verb bharā can be either 1st sg. subjunctive or 2nd sg. impv. There
are no implications either way. With Ge/Re/Ober I go for the 1st ps. subj.
As noted above, it is only in this vs. that a separable 4-syl. final pāda seems
likely: the 3rd sg. pf. subj. jújoṣate forms a single-word clause, with decisive change
of subject. As also noted above, this verb echoes juṣánta in the 4-syl. final pāda
juṣánta yát (5d) in the twinned hymn IX.102. This echo may account for the middle
voice of jújoṣate; the well-attested pf. subj. jújoṣa- is otherwise only active, while the
them. aor. juṣá- is overwhelmingly middle. The unexpected voice of jújoṣate is disc.
by Old and probably accounts for why Gr (also BR; see Old) interprets it rather as a
dat. sg. act. part. to an otherwise unattested pres. stem, even though we should expect
a weak stem *jújuṣant-. Not to mention that such a participle would require that the
stem had been reinterpr. as a present. Though this is not a difficult leap, since the
subjunctive has accent on the redupl., as opposed to the finite pf., which has standard
pf. accent (jujóṣa, jujuṣúḥ), nonetheless, in the absence of unambig. present forms, it
seems best to assign the subjunctive to the existing pf. stem. Ge, Re, Lub all take it as
a finite verb, not a part.

### 02
See IX.102.3, where it’s suggested that the trī́ṇi in that vs. corresponds to
the “three seats” (trī́ṣadhásthā) here and refers to the filters.

### 03
As noted above, the “seven voices” (vā́ṇīḥ … saptá) remind us of the seven
mothers in IX.102.4. As Re points out, Lü (681-82) identifies the saptá vā́ṇīḥ as the
heavenly rivers (though not mentioning this passage). If this identification is correct,
it is even closer to 102.4, where we identified the seven mothers as rivers. (Gr
construes saptá with immediately preceding ṛ́ṣīṇām [“wo weniger gut mit vā́ṇīs
verbunden”], which of course evokes the group of the Seven Seers, much more
prominent in later texts than in the RV, where they are mentioned only four times,
primarily in late hymns: saptá ṛ́ṣayaḥ [IV.42.8, X.130.7], saptaṛṣáyaḥ [X.82.2,
109.4]. However, in that case we might expect overt gen. saptānā́m to modify the
gen. pl. ṛ́ṣīṇām). Gr’s objection to taking saptá with vā́ṇīḥ does not seem to have
merit, since the phrase saptá vā́ṇīḥ, without the seers, is found elsewhere.)

### 04
Starting with this vs., the pári has no organic connection to the rest of the
vs. Here I supply arṣati on the basis of vss. 2-3. So also Re, KH (133).
On viśvádevo ádābhyaḥ as a clever variant on IX.102.5 víśve devā́so ádruhaḥ,
see publ. intro.
Ge takes injunc. viśat as model (“… möge sich … niederlassen”), but with Re
and KH (133-34) I take it as a general present referring to Soma’s standard ritual
action.

##  104
As with the immed. preceding hymn, the Uṣṇih here is of the 8 8 / 12 form,
with some vss. not allowing a 4-syllable final because the word breaks don’t coincide
(1c, 3c, 5c) and the others not showing a syntactic or semantic break.
For the similarities with the flg. hymn, IX.105, see publ. intro. and comm. on
105.

### 03
Pāda b seems to mix two kinds of expressions of purpose: the datival
infinitive (śárdhāya vītáye) and a clause introduced by yáthā, in which we expect a
subjunctive. In the absence of such a verb, the yáthā appears pleonastic. The next
pāda begins the same way, with yáthā followed by a dative referring to gods (mitrā́ya
váruṇāya). The datival gods appear to be exactly parallel to śárdhāya in b, and we
would expect vītáye to follow as there, or at least be supplied. But instead we find the
nom. śáṃtamaḥ, which suggests that the yáthā in this pāda should be taken seriously
and we should supply a subjunctive: “so that he (will be) most wealful for M+V.”
(The publ. tr. renders b and c as more parallel than they are and should perhaps be
changed.)

### 04
Pāda b, abhí vā́ṇīr anūṣata is a variant on the more elaborate abhí vā́ṇīr
ṛ́ṣīṇāṃ saptá anūṣata in the immed. preceding hymn, IX.103.3c, which occupies the
long pāda of Uṣṇih, rather than one of the shorter ones, as here.

### 05
Because of the 2nd ps. reference of vs.-init. sá, which is only appropriate
with imperatives, I take devápsarā asi as a parenthentical insertion, with sá to be
construed with vs.-final bhava. This has the advantage of allowing naḥ in pāda a,
which would have no function in ab, to be construed with gātuvíttamaḥ in c, where it
most naturally belongs. See asmábhyam gātuvíttamaḥ in two nearby hymns

### 10  
and IX.106.6. My interpr. of b is supported by the parallel vs. in the
twinned hymn, IX.105.5, which has no intermediate clause and has the same
configuration #sá naḥ … / …. bhava# with polarized vs.-init. and vs.-final elements
as here.
The Anukr. credits this hymn to Parvata Kāṇva and Nārada Kāṇva or,
alternatively, to “Kaśyapa’s two Apsaras daughters Śikhaṇḍinī”: śikhaṇḍinyāv
apsarasau kāśyapyau. It seems likely that this second - unusual - ascription is based
on a misparsing of the cmpd. devápsarā(ḥ).

### 06
On sánemi see comm. ad VII.38.7.
I do not understand why kṛdhí is accented.

##  105
As noted ad IX.104, this hymn has a very palpable twinned relationship with
104, though extensive exact repetition is avoided. What follows explicitly traces the
parallels and the variations.

### 01
The init. voc. sákhāyaḥ in 104.1a is postponed in 105.1a till after táṃ vaḥ.
The 2nd pāda begins with the same middle participle, punāná-, but in diff. case
forms: 104.1b dative, 105.1b acc. The rest of b is identical save for the preverb:
104.1b prá gāyata, 105.1b abhí gāyata. The final pādas begin identically, śíśuṃ ná,
but go their own ways.

### 02
Pāda a in both hymns has both the calf (acc. in 104, nom. in 105) and its
mothers (both instr.), as well as the init. preverb sám and a simile particle (ná in 104,
iva in 105). The b pādas are quite different. The c pādas begin with the same two
words, devāvī́- máda-, acc. in 104, nom. in 105. Again the rest of the c pāda diverges.

### 03
The a pāda in 105 decompounds dakṣa-sā́dhana- in 104 to dákṣāya
sā́dhanaḥ. The two yáthā’s beginning 104.3b and c are replaced by ayám’s (also in
a). The rest of b consists of the same datival purpose expression as in 104.3b. A
superlative plus dative of benefit is found in both c pādas: 104.3c mitrā́ya váruṇāya
śáṃtamaḥ, 105.3c devébhyo mádhumattamaḥ.

### 04
The first two pādas of this vs. in the two hymns diverge from each other.
The third pāda contains cows and color (várṇa-) in both hymns and refers
metaphorically to the same ritual action in both, the mixing of the soma with milk,
but the metaphors differ as do the verbs. It is in this vs. that the two hymns are most
distant from each other.

### 05
The first pāda in each begins sá no, followed by a GEN.PL. + pate voc.
expression, with deaccented gen. pl. The second pāda begins with voc. indo,
followed by the cmpd. devá-psaras-, in the splv. in 105, but the simple nom. sg. in
104. See disc. ad 104.4 for the parenthetical nature of 104.4b. The structure of c in
both is sákheva sákhye … bhava. In 104.5c in between we get a splv., perhaps a
delayed match to the splv. in 105.5b. The filler in 105c is different.

### 06
The two versions redistribute some of the lexical material, while keeping
other parts constant. Both begin the verse with sánemi and end it with asmád ā́; only
the two syllables in between differ. Both b pādas end káṃ cid atríṇam; 105 borrows
ádevam from the c pāda of 104, while 104.6b begins rakṣásam, not found in 105. The
ápa … dvayúm found at the beginning of 104.6c appears at the end of 105.6c. What
precedes has no parallel in 104.6.
The sequence pári bā́dhaḥ was emended to paribā́dhaḥ, here as well as in
VIII.45.40 (see comm. there) by BR, fld. by Gr and Old, with Ge skeptical but not
entirely opposed (see his n. 6c). I suggest in both passages instead to assume a
haplology of the impv. bādhasva in a putative sequence pári *bādhasva bā́dhaḥ, a
suggestion made also by Re on our passage here, as it turns out. In our passage we
must also assume the gapping of *yuyodhi with ápa, based on 104.6c ápa … dvayúm
… yuyodhi.

##  106
On the structure of the hymn, see publ. intro. See also Old’s assessment of the
Uṣṇih variants, by tṛca.
### 01-03
All three vss. in this tṛca contain final 4-syllable sequences that could be
syntactically distanced from what precedes, hence a likely 8 8 / 8 4 Uṣṇih type (so
also Old). In vs. 1 this piece is svarvídaḥ, the signature word that recurs in the same
metrical position in 4 (as svarvídam) and 9.
Vss. 2 and 3 are also lexically linked: sānasí- (2a, 3b), jaítrasya (2c) / -jít
(3d).

### 01
As Re points out, the exact nuance of śruṣṭī́is hard to pinpoint, but Ge’s
recessive adverb “willig” does not seem sufficient. Re also adduces II.3.9 śruṣṭī́…
jāyate, similar to our śruṣṭī́jātā́saḥ. I interpr. both passages to mean that the right
ritual birth happens because of a/the god’s attention to the process (Tvaṣṭar in II.3.9,
Indra here).

### 02
Both Ge and Re take jaítrasya as a noun ‘victory’, but with Gr I supply
Indra as the referent for this vṛddhi adj. This would provide a thematic reciprocity
between vss. 1 and 2: in 1 the soma drops are born because of Indra’s attentive
hearing (in my interpr.), while here Soma repays Indra’s attention with his own.

### 03
The etym. figure grābháṃ gṛbhṇīta seems to belong to dicing vocab.; see
comm. ad VIII.81.1 and Lü (Würfelspiel, 49-50).
Ge seems to take gṛbhṇīta as opt. (which, of course, it can be), but this
reading makes it even less compatible with the already loosely connected injunc.
bharat conjoined by ca (see Klein, DGRV I.233). The publ. tr. takes both verbs as
preterital injunctives, but I would now be inclined to see them, with KH (Injunk.
124), as general presents describing a regularly recurring situation: Indra’s behavior
when(ever) he is under the influence of soma. Hence “he grabs … and he carries …”
On the phrase sám apsujít, which constitutes an independent 4-syl. pāda in all
3 occurrences (here, VIII.13.2, VIII.36.1-6), see comm. ad VIII.13.2 and Scar’s
views cited there.
### 04-06
Old classifies this tṛca as a third variety of Uṣṇih in which the last four
syllables are technically separable but form part of a larger Jagatī pāda with the 8
syllables that precede. Although there is not the same semantic or syntactic distance
as with some Uṣṇih vss., I’m not sure that Old’s distinction between the two types is
nec. As for tṛca unity, all three vss. concern themselves with Soma’s ritual journey
and the paths he takes. See esp. pathi- in 5c and 6c and the deconstruction of the
bahuvrīhi sahásra-yāman- in 5c into the VP sahásraṃ yāhi, with the addition of
pathíbhiḥ to substitute for the noun yā́man-. In this figure there's a nice little
phonological interchange: sahásrayāmā : sahásraṃyāhi The dat. índrāya is also
found in both 4b and 5a.
### 07-09
Because of the distribution of word boundaries, the first two vss. of this
tṛca make a separate 4-syllable pāda impossible (7 … soma naḥ sadaḥ; 8 … amṛ̥́tāya
kám papuḥ), though vs. 9 ends with the signature svarvídaḥ. Therefore this must be
the 8 8 / 12 Uṣṇih variety. No striking thematic unity.

### 07
On imperatival sadaḥ, see comm. ad IX.2.2.

### 09
The pair of cmpds. vṛṣṭí-dyāvo rīty-āpaḥ is found in the same order in the
dual in V.68.5 vṛṣṭídyāvā rīty-ā̀pā of Mitra and Varuṇa. In our passage the 2nd cmpd
is unaccented and therefore a voc.; in V.68.5 it is accented and nom. Old suspects
that our form should also have the accent, but of course there’s no way to tell. (In any
case the publ. tr., for simplicity, renders them as if both nom.). The more pressing
question is what kind of cmpds they are. AiG II.1.320 analyzes them as having a
verbal 1st member governing the second, of the bharád-vāja- type (whatever that
ultimately represents), except with -tí-, and as transformations of the VPs riṇánn
apáḥ (e.g., IX.109.22), varṣáya- dyā́m (V.63.3, 6; IX.96.3). Scar (526) provides the
more plausible (to me) analysis of vṛṣṭí-dyu- as a bahuvrīhi orig. meaning ‘der
Himmel mit Regen hat’, developing into ‘den Himmel regnen lassen’. A similar
analysis would produce for the other cmpd. ‘having waters with streaming’ >
‘making the waters stream’. In other words, a bv of more or less the vájra-bāhutype, ‘having an arm with a mace’. The same elements in the same order are found in
syntagms in nearby IX.108.10 vṛṣṭím diváḥ (pavasva) rītím apā́m “purify yourself
into the rain from heaven, the streaming of waters,” with our 2nd members appearing
as genitives depending on the first. As far as I can see, these syntagms cannot
directly underlie the cmpds here, because the members would have to be in opposite
order. E.g., a bv. meaning ‘having the rain of/from heaven’ would perhaps be
expected to be *dyú-vṛṣṭi- or *divó-vṛṣti-. But the problems with making cmpds with
those root-noun-like first members may have led to a flip, and perhaps we should
render “having /providing the rain of heaven and the streaming of waters.”
### 10-12
In all cases it’s possible to detach the last four syllables, but Old
considers this tṛca to belong with those in which those syllables are integrated into a
Jagatī line. As for thematic unity, all three vss. concern Soma’s journey (but then
what vss. do not?), and the 1st two mention the sheep’s fleece filter. All three also
concern the role of the verbal portion of the ritual and Soma’s relation to it: he is “at
the forefront of speech” (ágre vācáḥ) in 10c and begets speech (vā́caṃ janáyan) in
12c, while insights (dhī-) are used to impel him in 11a and thoughts (matí-) sound
towards him in 11c.
### 13-14
The last two extra vss. do not allow a detached 4-syllable unit,
because the word boundaries don’t coincide.

### 13  
The well-loved pun haryatá- ‘delightful’ and hári- ‘tawny, fallow bay’ is
found here.

### 14  
The fem. instr. ayā́opening this final vs. seems to fulfill the same role as
evā́in other hymn-summary vss. Both Ge and Re supply a noun with it (Laüterung /
clarification), but though the use of the fem. seems to invite something more than a
semi-adverbial ‘in this way’, the model of hymn-summary vss. seems to me to
outweigh that consideration.

### 107-08
The next two hymns consist of pragāthas made up of various mixed lyric
meters: in 107 mostly Bṛhatī (8 8 / 12 8) alternating with Satobṛhatī (12 8 / 12 8), in
108 mostly Kakubh (8 12 / 8) alternating with Satobṛhatī.

##  107
### 01-03
The first metrical unit in the hymn has a third vs. appended to the
pragātha with a 2-pāda configuration of 12 8, identified by the Anukr. as Dvipadā
Virāj Bhurij. Arnold (248, E72) analyses vss. 2-3 as simply an extended Satobṛhatī
(12 8 / 12 8 / 12 8). See Old (Proleg. 104-5) on the types of extensions of pragāthas,
incl. this one. Since vs. 3 simply hangs off vs. 2 and need not be syntactically
independent, the “extension” suggestion is quite plausible.
The vss. are knitted together by lexical repetition and variation. A sample of
the lexical evidence: apsú is found in 1c, 2c; uttamám (1b) is picked up by úttaram
(2d); the three instr. pl. ádribhiḥ (1d), ávibhiḥ (2a), góbhiḥ (2d) echo each other - the
first two phonologically, the 2nd and 3rd semantically.

### 01
The vs. begins with a most unusual sandhi: párītó ṣiñcatā. Ge (n. 1a; cf.
ZDMG 65: 307) suggests that it is Prakritizing. Old and Re, less dramatically,
consider it to be based on IX.63.10 párīto vāyáve sutám, where the sandhi of itás is
correct. (Ge also cites this vs.) Re points out that that vs. ends with siñcata and
suggests that the unusual sandhi here “résulte de l’assemblage des extrémités du v.
63,10.” Although the invocation of 63.10 seems apposite, it doesn’t entirely explain
the sandhi we find here. The -o of párītó can be explained as the adoption of this
word sequence from its position before vd. C in 63.10, but the retroflexion in ṣiñcatā
does not follow. In fact, in 63.10, though siñcata occurs after -u (vā́reṣu siñcata),
there is no ruki-induced retroflexion over morpheme boundary (nor do we expect it).
Instead I think we must explain the retroflexion as an effect of the preverb pári. By
far the greatest number of the retroflexed initials of this root occur immediately after
pári, esp. the passive stem (pari) ṣicyá- (15 exx.), but also the ppl. páriṣikta- (8x);
see also, in the next hymn (IX.108.7), our exact 2nd pl. act. impv. pári ṣiñcata. There
is also retroflexion after the preverb ní (5+), and after the particles tū́(2x) and hí
(1x). All of these are contact-induced, unlike our example, where the preverb is
separated from the verb. Under these circumstances, there is ordinarily no
retroflexion (see pári … siñcata X.32.5, pári … siktáḥ IX.97.15). However, here I
think either the numerous exx. of pári √ṣic in IX (15+) imposed distant retroflexion
here where it was phonologically unmotivated, or an unretroflexed initial was
changed redactionally under the influence of pári ṣiñcata in the next hymn.

### 02
The 2nd hemistich of this vs. is intricately interwoven with constituents
overlapping; see Old’s sensible treatment at loc. The initial loc. expression consists
of suté cit … apsú, with tvā interspersed in modified 2nd position. This tvā is not to
construed with the nearby verb madāma (pace Gr), because máda- without preverb is
almost never construed with an acc.; here that verb goes with the instr. ándhasā. The
tvā finally finds its governing verb form in the participle śrīṇántaḥ beginning pāda d;
it is so distant from it, with parts of two different constituents in between, because it
took Wackernagel’s position in the clause. The adj. úttaram at the very end of the vs.
modifies it: the soma is “higher” or “better” at this point presumably because the
mixing with milk, the last step depicted, improves it.

### 03
Both Ge and Re make this vs. a separate cl., supplying a verb (“fliesst,”
“coule”), generated from pári srava in 2a, suggested by the init. pári in 3a. This is
certainly possible, but since this vs. is an afterthought to the pragātha, I take it as
dependent on vs. 2, specifically 2ab, simply stringing together more descriptors of
soma.
Note cákṣase … vicakṣaṇáh.
### 04-05
Both vss. describing Soma taking his seat (4c, 5b). There is also
concatenation between pragāthas: the final word of 5, vicakṣaṇáḥ, matches that of vs.
3, the final word of its metrical grouping. And the first word of vs. 4, punānáḥ, is
reprised as the beginning of 6 (and echoes the same participle in the 2nd position in
2a).

### 05
Gr, Ge, Re all take dhūtáḥ to √dhū ‘shake’, but given apsú dhūtá- in
IX.62.5, X.104.2, I prefer √dhū, dhāv ‘rinse’.
### 06-07
The c pādas of these two vss. are identically constructed: tváṃ vípro [6]
/ kavír [7] abhavo SPLV. Vs. 7 repeats the word vípra- along with ṛṣí- in 7b, so the
pragātha seems to have a preoccupation with the varieties of poet.

### 06
The impv. mimikṣa probably belongs to √myakṣ ‘provide, etc’. See Kü
(387-88).

### 07
The two splvs ending the a and c pādas show a nice phonological
relationship: (gātu-)vít-tama- and (deva-)vī́-tama, with interchange between long
vowel + single cons. and short vowel + geminate in otherwise identical phonetic
seequences, an effect reminiscent of MIA quantitative trade-offs.
### 08-09
The 2nd hemistich of vs. 8 and the first of vs. 9 have a refrain-like
structure reminiscent of the echo pādas in Atyaṣṭi, which is unusual for this meter:
8cd … harítā yāti dhā́rayā, mandráyā yāti dhā́rayā#; 9ab … góbhir akṣāḥ, …
dugdhā́bhir akṣāḥ#.

### 08
Since áśvayā is fem., the tr. should be emended to “with a golden mare.”
See Ge’s disc. (n. 8cd) and dismissal of Roth’s proposed emendation (also rejected
by Old), to bring out the comparison of the stream of soma to the urine stream of a
horse, which, as Ge points out, is still possible without emendation.

### 09
Both instances of akṣāḥ should probably be read with distracted 2nd
syllable, to provide the right no. of syllables in b and the right cadence in both pādas.
In addition, pāda a is metrically deficient, even with this distracted reading. We
expect a 12-syl. pāda in the Satobṛhatī that provides the 2nd vss. of the pragāthas in
this hymn; the Anukr. simply identifies the vs. instead as a Bṛhatī, which should have
an 8-syl. pāda in this position. Even without distracted akṣāḥ, it would have 9
syllables, and with the distraction 10. Best to consider it a deficient Satobṛhatī, which
is the vs.-form expected, than an over-abundant Bṛhatī. As for ways to make up the
deficiency, see Old. A distracted reading of anūpé would provide at least one more
syllable as well as a standard 4-syl. opening; however, neither etym. (*anu-Hp-á-;
see EWA s.v.) nor the other occurrence of the stem (X.27.23) favors this distraction.
Old rather exasperatedly suggests that the metrical disturbances in this vs. (see also
the Triṣṭubh cadence of c in a 12-syl. pāda) may result from “mangelhaftes
Formgefühl des Vfs.”
### 10-11
Little overt cohesion. The adv. tiráḥ ‘across’ referring to the filter is
found in both vss. (10b, 11a). And the part. s(u)vāná- in 10a echoes the occurrences
in vss. 3 and 8.

### 10  
With Ge, Re, KH (133), in the publ. tr. I supply a verb in ab. I now think
this may be unnec. The impetus was the apparent change of person between the first
hemistich and the second: with voc. soma in pāda a but a 3rd ps. verb (viśat) with
Soma as subj. in c. However, as in vs. 12 the 3rd-ps. verb may result from attraction
to the simile (jáno ná purí … viśat “as a man enters a fortress”), and the underlying
person could be 2nd throughout; see dadhiṣe in d. It is hard to convey the change in
Engl. but something like “O Soma, while you are being pressed by the stones here
across the sheep's fleeces, as a man enters a fortress, as tawny one (you enter) into
the two cups. You have established …” KH (133) argues that the changes of ps. mark
pāda c as parenthetic, allowing it to be interpr. in his “general” sense. This sense
should be possible even without branding the pāda as a parenthesis.
### 12-13
No particular signs of cohesion. River(s) appear in both vss., but with
different words (síndhu- 12b, nadī́- 13d). jā́gṛviḥ in 12c echoes the one in 6a.

### 12  
The first hemistich of this vs. is structured exactly like the more
expansive 10a-c above: with a vocative soma in the 1st pāda and a following 3rd ps.
verb (pipye), which owes its 3rd ps. to attraction to the simile surrounding it, síndhur
ná … árṇasā. Ge (n. 12b) explicitly attributes the 3rd ps. pipye to “Attraktion an den
Vergleich,” though he keeps the 2nd and 3rd ps. strictly separate in vs. 10. The 2nd
ps. in the publ. tr., “you have swollen forth,” should, strictly speaking, be in parens.
Ge and Re make heavier weather of the 2nd hemistich than I think nec. or
desirable. Because they strictly break the syntax at the end of b, they need to find
something to do with the instr. phrase that opens c, aṃśóḥ páyasā, which then leads
them to interpr. jā́gṛviḥ as (unprecedentedly) transitive, which then leads them to
supply an obj. for it - way too much machinery for something that can be far more
simply interpr. The impetus for all this, the instr. phrase in c, can easily be taken as
part of the simile/frame construction starting in b, with páyasā corresponding to
árṇasā in the simile.
Now, as to their transitive jā́gṛvi-. To be fair, it is not only the instr. phrase at
the beginning of the pāda but also the apparent ineptness of the simile madiró ná
jā́gṛviḥ that lead them to their baroque interpr. The problem with the simile is that it
seems to be a straight description of Soma, not a simile: the apparent meaning
“wakeful like an exhilarating drink” or “like a wakeful exhilarating drink” is a fine
literal (or as literal as we get in the RV) characterization of soma. Both madirá- and
jā́gṛvi- regularly modify Soma, the latter even in vs. 6 in this same hymn. As Ge says
(n. 12c), “ná als Vergleichswort macht Schwierigkeit.” And so both scholars search
for ways to make this a real simile, which requires both words to be given senses
they don’t ordinarily have. They take madirá- as referring to alcohol or some
inebriating drink other than soma - even though it is never so used in the RV. And
then, though jā́gṛvi- only means ‘wakeful’ in the RV as far as I can tell, including in
vs. 6, they take it as expressing the effect that this other drink has on its drinkers:
making wakeful, invigorating. And this all adds up to “Avec le lait de ta tige, toi (qui
rends l’homme) vif comme (fait l’alcool) enivrant …” / “Mit der Milch des Stengels
munter (machend) wie der berauschende (Branntwein) …” Although I realize that
the simile is awkwardly comparing soma with a standard description of itself, the
cure suggested by Ge/Re seems worse than the disease. I have several, not
particularly satisfying suggestions for why we get a simile here. It may be that it is
part of a simile chain: soma compared to a river, which in turn is compared to soma.
See VII.103.7ab (the frog hymn), where the frogs are compared to brahmins, who are
in turn compared to frogs. Or else the animatized Soma the god is compared to soma
the drink. But in any case, I prefer to accept the simile at face value, however
clumsy, rather than erecting a fantastic superstructure by reinterpretating standard
somic descriptors.
### 14-16
Like vss. 1-3, this pragātha has a two-pāda addition (vs. 16), also 12
8. Both 14 and 15 contain the part. pávamāna-; all three vss. contain forms of
samudrá-, samudríya-, while 16 repeats the phrase rā́jā deváḥ from 15b. In 16
haryatáḥ recalls the same word in 13a, and vicakṣaṇáḥ those in 3b, 5d. The voc. of
this stem is found in vs. 24.

### 15  
On Soma identified as “truth” (ṛtám), see IX.97.23, IX.108.8, and Lü
581-82. Although ṛtáṃ bṛhát could be an acc. goal here, the parallels, esp. the
identical pāda in the next hymn, IX.108.8, support a nom. identification. In
IX.97.23-24 Soma is also identified as a king (rā́jā 24b) as here and as ‘possessing
dhárman’ (dharmā́23c), reminiscent of dhármaṇā here.
The Pp. analyses árṣan opening c as injunc. árṣat, while the publ. tr. assumes
a nom. sg. pres. part. árṣan. Either is of course possible, but the parallelism with vs.
initial tárat may support the finite verb interpr., as Old points out. So an alt. tr. would
be: “he rushes …” See Hoffmann (117) on this vs.; he is surely right that the two
injunctives should receive the same interpr., rather than Re’s indic. pres. tárat, modal
árṣat, and Hoffmann’s “general” pres. interpr. seems apt here for both.
### 17-18
No particular internal cohesion, but a number of ties with other parts
of the hymn. The Āyus are found in 17d as the groomers of Soma, while in 14a they
were identified with him. The verb arṣati (17c) returns from 15c (see also 4b, 5c),
and avyata (18d) from 13a. The phrase apó vásānaḥ (18c) is also found in 4a, and see
disc. of the rest of 18c below.

### 17  
The enclitic ī in d could stand for *īm in this sandhi position before
mṛjanti with degemination.

### 18  
Soma as úttara- is also found in 2d, where it is also associated with cows:
śrīṇanto góbhir úttaram “preparing you [tvā 2c] with cows as the higher (oblation)”;
see comm. there. I supply ‘oblation’ in both instances because of 1b sómo yá
uttamáṃ havíḥ.
### 19-20
This is the first and only place in the hymn in which the 1st person is
found. The speaker’s eagerness for fellowship with Soma, who is addressed directly,
and his admission of his troubles give an intimate and almost confessional tone. Both
vss. have the 1st sg. prn. ahám, a form of sakhyá-, a form of dív- ‘day’, and the voc.
to babhrú- ‘brown one’ and are tightly connected, also structurally (see disc. ad 20).

### 19  
The indic. pf. of √ran is presential in value; see Kü (413). The form here
echoes raṇyati in 18b.
The lexeme ní √car (or ní áva √car) is found nowhere else in the RV or later.
The context clearly requires a negative sense; I’ve used the colloquial English idiom
“get (s.o.) down,” meaning ‘discourage, demoralize’. There are two ways to interpr.
áva at the end of the pāda. With Gr (and implicitly Ge and Re), I take it as a 2nd
preverb with caranti. Since ní and áva both mean ‘down’, it reinforces by variation,
hence my “—way down.” As Ge reports (n. 19c), Ludwig takes áva rather as the
impv. to √av ‘help’, accented because it starts a new clause. This is perfectly
possible and would fit the context, but I prefer the more unusual semantic doubling
of the preverbs in this emotional context.
There are various suggestions about what to supply with purū́ṇi: Sāy.
rákṣāṃsi, fld. tentatively by Ge (“böse Geister?”), Re “choses (dangereuses).”
Leaving it open seems to me the better solution: the poet is besieged by multiple
things he cannot even name.
In the last pāda it is Soma who is urged to “go past the barriers” (paridhī́n);
we might have expected the poet to ask Soma for help in getting past them himself
(but see next vs.). For Soma’s journey past the paridhī́n Ge and Re cite IX.96.11
paridhī́m̐r áporṇu “open up the barriers.” In both passages the paridhí- are
presumably obstacles to Soma’s progress on his ritual journey, perhaps the tufts of
the fleece filter.

### 20  
This vs. is identical in conceptual structure to 19. The first hemistich
expresses the 1st-ps. speaker’s constant close relationship to Soma, using the word
sakhyá- ‘fellowship’ and an “every day” expression (divé-dive in 19b, náktam utá …
divā́in 20a). The 2nd iteration is more intimate than the first: in 19 the poet simply
rejoices in his fellowship, but in 20 he is “at your udder for fellowship” (sakhyā́ya …
ū́dhani, suggesting a mother/child suckling relationship.
As for this ū́dhani: because this occurrence is followed by the phrase ghṛṇā́
tápantam “scorching with its heat” and because ū́dhar / ū́dhan- is found in V.34.3 in
opposition to ghraṃsá- ‘heat’, Re suggests that the two passages need to be interpr.
in conjunction with each other. For Re this means rejecting the existence of an
independent (ū́dhar /) ū́dhan- meaning ‘cold’ (accepted by Ge, EWA, and me), since
‘cold’ does not work in our passage. But I do subscribe to the two ū́dhan- view—see
comm. ad VIII.2.12—with the one here belonging to the dominant ‘udder’ stem. I
simply consider the mention of scorching heat in the next hemistich to be
coincidence.
The 2nd hemistich matches that of 19. In 19 the poet complains about his
afflictions and then invites Soma to pass beyond the barriers. In this vs. the escape
presumably effected by Soma in 19 provides the model for the one made by “us.”
Just as Soma was to go “beyond the barriers” (paridhī́ṃr áti) so did we fly (paptima)
“beyond the sun” (áti sū́ryam)—far beyond it (párah). The sun scorching with its
heat, described in c, corresponds to the many things that got me down in 19c, and in
both d pādas these troubles are overcome, passed beyond. Soma’s presumably
successful journey beyond the barriers—barriers that are probably ritually related
(see above)—makes it possible for us to overcome our own difficulties with
triumphant flight.
### 21-22
Lexical cohesion: mṛjyámānaḥ opening 21a echoed by mṛjānáḥ
opening 22a; pávamāna 21d, 22a, c; arṣasi 21d, 22d.

### 21  
Both Ge and Re construe samudré with mṛjyámānaḥ (e.g., “Im Meer
sauber gemacht”), but surely our passage can't be separated from IX.12.6 prá vā́cam
índur iṣyati, samudrásyā́dhi viṣṭápi “The drop sends forth his speech upon the surface
of the sea,” a passage adduced by Ge (n. 21b) without comment.
### 23-24
Both vss. contain the impv. pávasva (/ pavasva), and the mention of
the sea in 23 is balanced by the earthly and heavenly realms in 24. Still, little
evidence of cohesion.

### 23  
The injunc. ví dhārayaḥ in c, in conjunction with prathamáḥ, invites a
dual reading, both cosmogonic in the past and the ritual present. Hoffmann doesn’t
cite this passage.

### 24  
Notice the number disharmony in pā́rthivaṃ rájo, divyā́ca “the earthly
realm and the heavenly (ones).”
### 25-26
No particular signs of cohesion.

### 25  
Pāda c is a clever twist on 17ab índrāya … marútvate sutáḥ “pressed for
Indra and the Maruts.” In 17 the recipients of the soma are straightforwardly
expressed, but in our vs. the expression is oblique. Indra is present not directly, but in
the adj. indriyá- ‘Indriyan, suitable for/associated with Indra (and Indra’s powers)’,
which modifies the soma drops identified as horses. The adj. marútvantaḥ also
modifies these drops/horses. On the one hand, I think this is meant to associate the
Maruts with Indra, as usual, and identify them as the prototypical recipients of soma;
on the other hand, however, the drop-horses are metaphorically associated with the
Maruts in full gallop on their regularly described journeys. The double sense would
be better conveyed by a transl. “the exhilarating courses, accompanied by the
Maruts, fit for Indra along with the Maruts …”
The fem. stem medhā́- of course means ‘wisdom’ and is so interpr. here by
everyone (incl. me). But its explicit coordination with práyāṃsi “pleasing offerings’
(medhā́m abhí práyāṃsi ca) invites, to my mind, a secondary reading associating it
with médha- ‘ritual offering/meal’. For other possible conflations of medhā́- and
médha- see EWA s.v. médha-.

### 26  
apó vásānaḥ returns from 4b, 18c, along with the verb árṣa-, ubiquitous
in this hymn.
gā́ḥ ‘cows’ needs to be read with both c and d. In the former it is the referent
of the hapax mandánāḥ (whose sense is, however, easy to divine) and the obj. of the
caus. redupl. aor. ‘causes to bellow’; in the latter it is the obj. of kṛṇvānáḥ and the
target of the simile: “making the cows as if into his garment” (a simile that of course
depends on a metaphor: cows = milk). I consider the ná to be displaced - we might
expect *nirṇíjaṃ ná. This pāda, in this order, is also found in IX.14.5; for variants on
the phrase without simile particle see IX.86.26, 95.1, all adduced by Ge (n. 26d).

##  108
On the structure of the hymn see publ. intro. It consists of pragāthas
alternating Kakubh (8 12 / 8) with Satobṛhatī (12 8 / 12 8). The Anukr. attributes the
hymn to seven different poets, but the vss. assigned to them generally violate the
pragātha division, which, as the publ. intro. indicates, is often reinforced by syntactic
structure. The Anukr. also identifies vs. 13 as Gāyatrī Yavamadhyā, but it can be
analyzed as a reasonably well-behaved Kakubh.
### 01-02
There is syntactic dependence between the two vss., at least by my
reading: 2ab depends on vs. 1, while 2cd consists of a new cl., with a change of
person. The Anukr. attributes the two vss. to Gaurivīti Śāktya; there is some support
for this, in that V.29 (one of the three other hymns attributed to him [also X.73-74])
has an allusion to the myth involving Etaśa, the sun’s horse (V.29.5), who appears in
our 2d.

### 02
This vs. presents us with a syntactic trap of sorts. It appears to consist of a
standard REL / COREL construction, with 2a beginning yásya te and 2c beg. sá. And
indeed the rel. and the sá are coreferential; however, the grammatical person has
changed from 2nd to 3rd. I therefore prefer (contra Ge/Re) to attach 2ab to the
previous vs., in which Soma is also 2nd ps. Pāda b acts as a transition from Soma as
2nd ps. to Soma as 3rd ps., with asyá referring to him, but the parallelism between
the two “drinking” expressions keeps it within the syntactic domain of the rel. clause.
I have silently converted yásya into yád, since “upon drinking of which - of
you --” is unparsable, or at least exceptionally awk., in English.
The gerund pītvā́in a is echoed by the i-stem loc. pītā́in b.
On the unexpected accent of supráketa-, as opposed to supraketá- (4x), see
Old, who has no good explanation (nor do I).
### 03-04
Vs. 4 is clearly syntactically dependent on vs. 3, with a series of three
rel. cl. introduced by yéna referring to Soma, the 2nd ps. subj. of 3.

### 04
Although pāda a treats the mythological past—the opening of the Vala
cave (Navagva) and Dadhyañc’s presumably similar exploit (see his connection with
cow pens in X.48.2)—the verb is present tense aporṇuté, where we might expect an
impf., a pres. injunc., or a pf. The two parallel yéna clauses have perfects. Hoffmann
does not comment on this usage.
The pf. āpiré in b takes the partitive gen. amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇaḥ in c. As in the
other occurrences of this phrase (IX.70.2, 4, 110.4) with Ge I take this as a reference
to the heavenly soma, with the nominalized neut. amṛ́ta- ‘(drink) of immortality’.
See comm. ad IX.70.2 and, on supposed masc. cā́ruṇaḥ, VIII.5.14. Re supplies
instead ‘principe’: “au beau (principe) immortel.” This is the only finite med. form of
the well-attested pf. to √āp, beside two occurrences of the part. Kü. (118) asserts that
the medial forms have the “inattingent” sense ‘have success’ (implicitly interpr. our
form here without the partitive gen. obj.), but he does not cite this passage. Ge (n. 4c)
seems to suggest something of the same thing as an alternative, but making amṛ́tasya
cā́ruṇaḥ dependent on sumné as he suggests does not seem to me to work. Although
it might seem circular for the poets to acquire a share of (heavenly) soma through
(earthly) soma, this is exactly the point also of IX.70.2. See comm. ad loc
I cannot detect the semantic nuance between √āp ‘acquire’ (āpiré b) and
√(n)aś ‘attain’ (ānaśúḥ d). In this passage the first has a more material object, the
second an immaterial one, but this distribution does not hold elsewhere.
I take the pl. śrávaṃsi as distributive: each one of the pl. subj. acquires his
own śrávaḥ.
### 05-06
The 1st hemistich of vs. 6 is a relative cl. in the 3rd ps. dependent on vs.
5, also in the 3rd ps. The 2nd hemistich of 6 switches to 2nd ps.

### 06
Ge suggests that pāda a concerns the Vṛtra myth and b the Vala myth,
based primarily on ápya- ‘watery’ as a descriptor of the cows in the former. This
does not seem to me sufficient evidence, esp. because ápya- is not elsewhere used in
connection with the Vṛtra myth. In his n. (6b) Ge appears amenable to a unitary
interpr. of ab, as only depicting the Vala myth, as I also take it, though why the cows
are ‘watery’ isn’t clear to me. Ge’s alternative explanation, involving X.67.5, does
not seem terribly strong. It suggest it may be connected with the waters used in the
ritual preparation of soma; see vs. 7.
On abhí √tan see comm. ad VIII.6.25.
### 07-08
Once again the 2nd vs. is syntactically dependent on the 1st in this
pragātha: 8ab is couched in the acc., continuing the acc. phrase in 7bc, and 8cd is a
rel. cl. whose antecedent is the acc. phrase.

### 07
This vs. contains two sleight-of-hand manoeuvres. The first involves the
simile and frame with pári ṣiñcata ‘sprinkle around’. This verb ordinarily takes an
acc. of the liquid sprinkled; see for ex. the immed. preceding hymn with the same
lexeme: IX.107.1 pári … ṣiñcata sutám “sprinkle around the pressed (drink).” But
the acc. in the simile, áśvaṃ ná is the target of the sprinkling, not the liquid. So
although the cases agree (implicitly: there is no expressed acc. in the frame), they
have different syntactic functions (the opposite of my “case disharmony”). So Ge
explicitly (n. 7a). For horses as obj. with √sic, see IV.43.6 síndhur ha vāṃ rasáyā
siñcad áśvān “The Sindhu River sprinkles your [=Aśvins’] horses with the Rasā.”
The 2nd sleight of hand follows immediately. Both the verb and the string of
acc. that follow demand the obj. *sómam, but instead we find the near rhyme form
stómam ‘praise’. Rather than emend this to the easier reading (as Old seems inclined
to do, along with numerous others; see his comm.), it is better to accept the implicit
equation of the two ritual elements: the offered liquid and the offered words. This is
not the only place in the RV where this trope is found.

### 08
On Soma as truth see IX.97.23, 107.15.
### 09-10
These two vss. are syntactically independent but linked by the theme of
rain.

### 09
The impv. didīhí in b is accented because it follows the pāda-init. complex
voc. phrase íṣas pate. On the impv. and its twin dīdihí with switched quantity, see
Old ad loc. The well-attested redupl. formation(s) to √dī, a perfect transitioning to a
redupl. pres. (see, e.g., my “The Vedic Perfect Imperative” [Fs. Lubotsky, 2018]: 58-
59), show a long ī in the root syllable only in the impv. didīhí (1x accented, 11x
unacc.); the weak forms otherwise show only dīdi-, incl. the competing impv. dīdihí
(1x accented, 17x unacc.). They are mostly distributed metrically: dīdihi is found
almost exclusively in final position in a Jagatī or iambic dimeter line; didīhi regularly
takes final position in a Triṣṭubh line. But a few examples of both forms are found in
metrically unfavorable places. E.g., in VIII.60.6 dīdihi occurs after a 5-syl. opening;
although HEAVY LIGHT is an attested break, LIGHT LIGHT (*didihi, to an unattested
stem form) would be better. Likewise, our form, found after a 4-syl. opening,
presents an unusual L H L break, though neither *dīdihi nor *didihi would give the
most favored break. (Old states that we would expect *dīdihi here, but does not
suggest emending because there are several other exx. of L H L breaks in this hymn.)
It is also worth noting that didīhi is found several times in the curious phrase … sám
íṣo didīhi (naḥ)# “illuminate our refreshments entirely” (III.3.7, 54.22, V.4.2), and
our passage contains the voc. íṣas pate “o lord of refreshment,” so that the presence
of íṣaḥ may have triggered the didīhi variant here. As for the source of the variation,
it’s possible that transposing the Jagatī/iambic-final dīdihi into a Triṣṭubh cadence
may have led to an almost mechanical balancing of quantities (on the model of
alternations like vavardh- / vāvṛdh-), and then both forms were sometimes used
outside of their original places (including didīhi in Jagatī/iambic cadences, with the
addition of final naḥ [III.3.7, V.25.2]), though this seems too convenient an
explanation.
The notion that “the middle bucket” (kóśa- madhyamá-) is the rain cloud goes
back to Sāy. and makes good sense, esp. given the explicit rain in the next vs. (10c).
It is possible that the impv. didīhí ‘illuminate’ in the first hemistich is meant to evoke
lightning in this context, although it is not otherwise found in this usage, as far as I
can tell.

### 10  
On this usage of ā́√vañc see comm. ad IX.2.2. This same phrase ā́
vacyasva (…) camvòḥ is found in IX.97.2.
I take viśā́m … viśpátiḥ to be a syntagm like gaṇā́nām … gaṇápatim “trooplord of troops” (II.23.1), with the simile váhnir ná interposed. The expression in
II.23.1 also has an interposed word, though just a Wackernagel enclitic tvā. Ge takes
the viś- words as part of the simile, “wie ein zu Wagen fahrender Clanfürst” (and
folds the gen. pl. viśā́m into its headnoun). He suggests an alternative (n. 10b) closer
to mine, though again with the gen. elided: “wie ein Wagenross, du der Clanfürst.”
And, with the aid of parentheses, Re gets three separate NPs out of it: “tel un chef de
clan, (maître) des clans, conducteur (du char).”
The syntagms vṛṣṭím diváḥ … rītím apā́m exactly replicate the problematic
compds vṛṣṭí-dyāvo rīty-ā̀paḥ in nearby IX.106.8. See comm. there. Whether there is
any direct functional relationship between the cmpds and the syntagms, the two
sequences must be considered together.
### 11-12
These two vss. are syntactically independent but both concern Soma
as bull (vṛṣabhá- 11b, vṛ́ṣan- 12a).

### 11  
The accentuation of dívaḥ poses problems. Pace Ge (n. 11b), who
considers dívaḥ a gen. sg. with unusual accent, I take it as acc. pl. (flg. Old, in turn
fld. by Re and Lü 202). Given the correctly accented gen./abl. sg. diváḥ in the
immediately preceding vs. (10c), it is hard to believe that the poet would get the
accent wrong, esp. in this exceptionally common form. As Old suggests, √duh takes
a double acc. here. On dívaḥ as acc. pl., see also AiG III.226-27.

### 12  
On the “threefold” (tridhā́tu) nature of Soma’s clothing, see comm. ad
IX.70.8.
### 13-14
The main cl. in these two vss. consists of the first two words of 13, sá
sunve “he is pressed,” followed by a series of rel. cl. that fill the rest of 13 (four yáḥ
clauses, all nominal, with a single predicate ānetā́and four dependent genitives) and
all of 14 (three yásya clause, one yéna, with one finite verb for the yásya cl. and one
for the yéna).

### 14  
The nom., acc., voc., and gen. pl. of marút- do not fit any standard RVic
cadence. It is not surprising then that though instr. marúdbhiḥ and dat./abl.
marúdbhyaḥ are regularly found in cadences, the other forms are almost entirely
absent. Pāda b has a nom. pl. in the cadence (made worse by the fact that the word is
preceded by a light syllable, (yá)sya. VII.32.10 has the same sequence, also in a
double yásya construction. Most of the few other cadential forms are found in
dimeter vs. (e.g., VIII.3.21, VIII.7.30).
### 15-16
No particular signs of cohesion, but see the ring compositional
elements connecting vs. 15 to the 1st vs. of the hymn.

### 15  
As pointed out in the publ. intro., the beginning of vs. 1, pávasva
mádhumattama, índrāya soma …, recurs here, framing the vs., which begins índrāya
soma and ends with the pāda pávasva mádhumattama.

### 109-14  
These last hymns in the maṇḍala are composed in a variety of meters; the first
three are assorted; the last three are in paṅkti.

##  109
### 01-03
No particular signs of cohesion, beyond the mention of Soma’s divine
recipients in vss. 1-2. Vs. 3 begins with a possibly summary evā́.
### 04-06
All three vss. contain the impv. pavasva. Vss. 5-6 both contain śukrá-,
also found in 3. And pīyū́ṣaḥ in 6 reprises the same word at the end of 3.

### 06
On Soma’s expansion (vídharmaṇ(i) see comm. ad IX.4.9, 64.9.
### 07-09
Unlike the previous tṛca with repeated pavasva, each vs. of this tṛca has
a different form or √pū: 7 pávasva, 8 pūtaḥ, 9 punānáḥ. The person switches from
the 2nd sg. that has prevailed throughout the hymn to 3rd ps. in vs. 8.

### 07
The morphological identity of mahā́m is uncertain: it could be acc. sg. (m.)
(see AiG III.251, etc.) or gen. pl. to máh- (so Gr) - or, in my opinion, nom. sg. masc.
to mahā́nt-. Most (Old, Ge, Re, Lub) take it as an acc., supplying ‘fleece’ or ‘back’,
hence “along the great (fleece) of the sheep.” For detailed disc. see Old ad loc. and
ad II.24.11. Although this is certainly possible, the filter is not usually so described.
A similar problem arises with a gen. pl. interpr., acdg. to which it would modify
ávīnāmi “of the great sheep.” Since the most likely entity to be called ‘great’ in this
vs. is Soma (cf., e.g., mahā́n samudráḥ in vs. 4, I think it likely that the form is nom.
sg. In this sandhi position (before vowel) we would expect mahā́m̐(cf., e.g., IX.66.16
mahā́m̐asi), but I suggest that the anunāsika was redactionally changed to m because
the form was reinterp. as a gen. pl. modifying immed. following ávīnām.

### 08
It is not certain how to construe víśvāni with kṣarat, and how this is
decided will also determine what to supply with the adj. Forms of √kṣar ‘stream’
without preverb generally do not take an obj. or an Inhaltsakk. (though cf. IX.35.3,
61.3, 86.37 for the latter), though it is found with an acc. of goal or extent of space
(e.g., IX.33.2, 63.14). In vss. 16, 17 in this hymn, akṣāḥ has intrans. value, though in
vs. 16 with accusatives of the space traversed. If we take the verb in that sense,
víśvāni could pick up víśvā … dhā́ma in vs. 4, with the sense “stream to/across all
(domains).” However, the phrase víśvāni dráviṇāni “all goods” might give us pause,
and suggest that kṣárat here takes an Inhaltsakk., “stream all (goods).” There is no
way to decide, and both may be meant. Ge, Re, and KH (123) all opt for the latter.

### 09
In all clear cases urāṇá- is passive, ‘being chosen’ (see comm. ad IV.6.3).
Gr, Ge, and Re all take it as trans. with prajā́m as obj., but there is no reason why this
acc. can’t be taken as an obj. of kárat, parallel to víśvāni drávaṇāni.
kárat opening the 2nd hemistich rhymes with kṣárat in the same position in
vs. 8. Nonetheless they are morphologically divergent, with kárat a subjunctive and
kṣárat an injunc. Despite their parallelism kṣárat is unlikely to have modal value
anticipating kárat; KH (123 and n. 26) convincingly takes kṣárat in “general” sense.
### 10-12
Once again, three different forms of the root √pū: 10 pávasva, 11
punánti, 12 pavítre, all hemistich-initial. The washing/grooming of Soma as horse is
found in vss. 10 and 12. The phrase krátve dákṣāya (10) is repeated from vs. 2,
though in different metrical position.
### 13-15
The adj. cā́ru- ‘dear’ occurs in 13 and 14. The gods as recipients of
soma figure in 14-15.

### 14  
This vs. presents a double ambiguity. On the one hand cā́ru índrasya
nā́ma can mean either “the dear name of Indra” (as Ge/Re take it) or “the name dear
to Indra”; the question is whether the name Soma bears is “Indra,” as the first
alternative implies, or “Soma,” with the second. I prefer the second, since
constructing a plausible reason why Soma would be called Indra is difficult: Ge’s (n.
14) “er wirkt in Indra and führt so dessen Namen” doesn’t seem sufficient to me.
The second ambiguity is located in the 2nd hemistich and has two parts:
what/who is the referent of yéna and who is the subj. of jaghā́na? The Ge/Re interpr.
seems to take the referent of yéna to be “the name Indra” and the subj. of the verb to
be Soma (though neither is explicit about it). I recognize that this would be a pleasing
paradox, since Indra is the default agent in this formula. But I wonder if instead Indra
is the subj. of his signature verb, and yéna refers to soma, with the name equivalent
to the substance.
### 16-18
Vss. 16 and 17 contain the sequence akṣāḥ sahásra(-dhāraḥ / -retaḥ)
in the same position in the vs. All 3 vss. concern Soma’s journey. The various
phrases with agentive instr. in 17 and 18 reprise and reshuffle those in 15: góbhiḥ
śrītásya (15) is echoed by góbhiḥ śrīṇānaḥ (17); nṛ́bhiḥ sutásya (15) gets divided and
refitted into two phrases, nṛ́bhiḥ yemānáḥ and ádribhiḥ sutáḥ (18).

### 18  
On kukṣí- ‘cheek’ see comm. ad III.36.8, VIII.92.24.
### 19-21
No particular signs of cohesion, though assembled from the usual
assortment of soma clichés.

### 19  
This vs. repeats vājī́from 17, tiráḥ pavítram from 16, and sahásradhāraḥ
from 17.

### 21  
for vṛ́thā pā́jase see comm. ad IX.76.1. The phrase here is a truncated
version of what is found in IX.76.1 and IX.88.5.

### 22  
An extra vs. in a different meter. Old suggests either 12 8 or 8 4 8, HvN
either 12 8 or 8 12. Although the opening of the vs. contains 5 syllables and could
therefore be a Dvipada Virāj pāda, the following finite verb tośate is unaccented and
cannot start a new pāda.

##  110
On the rare meters and their deployment in the hymn see publ. intro. Likewise
for its thematic structure and its connections to the previous hymn, IX.109. It is
probably not an accident that the six middle verses, in a meter otherwise not found in
the RV (see Old, Proleg. 130), are the conceptually challenging ones, flanked by
three vss. at the beginning and three at the end that are fairly straightforward. An
omphalos structure signalled by meter.

### 01
As noted in the publ. intro., the opening of this hymn is a variant on the
opening of the immediately preceding one, IX.109.1, adjusted to fit the meter:

### 01
pári prá dhanva …, IX.110.1 páry ū ṣú prá dhanva
The primary reading of the verb īyase is, no doubt, ‘you speed’, with the
standard interpr.; however it may also have a secondary reading as the passive to √yā
‘implore, beseech’.

### 02
The b pāda consists of two words ending in -e, which are construed
together by the standard interpr. (e.g., Ge “im grossen Reiche des Wettstreits”). But
since -rā́jya- is thematic and a loc. sg., this requires mahé to belong to the rare and
secondary them. stem mahá-, rather than the primary and very well-attested root
stem máh-. I prefer to separate the two words and take mahé as the dat. to that stem.
There are four other occurrences of clear dat. mahé in IX.108-110 (including our vs.
7), each with a different head noun: ávase (108.14), kṣáyāya (109.3), dyumnā́ya
(109.11), vā́jāya (110.7). Both because that last phrase appears in our hymn and
because of the vā́jān in c of our vs., I supply ‘prize’, though other datives are
possible.

### 03
I tr. b as if vidhā́re has verbal rection, with páyaḥ as obj.: “in spreading
your milk.” In this I follow Ge (“wenn du mit Kunst deine Milch verbreitest”), but I
now think that this is wrong. Although vidhā́re is a hapax and so its usage elsewhere
cannot be compared, I doubt that the loc. of such a stem could be so used (and
Bartholomae’s datival infinitive, mentioned by Old, seems morphologically very
unlikely). Instead I think it is used in the same sense as loc. vídharman / -ṇi, found 7x
in this maṇḍala (3 are identical), incl. the immed. preceding hymn (IX.109.6). In all
these passages it refers to the spreading or expansion of the soma liquid as it passes
across the filter, and metaphorically to other expansions through space. See comm.
ad IX.64.9. If páyaḥ is not dependent on vidhā́re it is most likely a 2nd object to
ájījanat (as Re takes it, though not in the same way I will suggest). Ge (n. 3b)
adduces IX.34.3 duhánti śákmanā páyaḥ ‘They milk out its milk with their skill,”
where páyaḥ refers to the soma juice milked from the plant, not to the cows’ milk
with which it is mixed. I think páyaḥ has the same referent here, and the hemistich
means “by your skill you have begotten (your) milk as the sun in your expansion.”
What this means is that the soma juice (=milk) takes on the look of the sun as it goes
across the filter, golden-colored with rays (=rivulets of juice) spread across the
fleece.”
The 2nd member of the hapax gó-jīra- is universally (Gr, Ge, Re) interpr. as
transitive, governing the 1st: e.g., Gr ‘die Kühen zueilend’. But jīrá- both
independently and as 1st cmpd member (e.g., jīrā́śva- ‘having lively horses’) is never
transitive, but simply means ‘lively, nimble’. One occurrence of the independent adj.
is also generally taken as transitive: I.48.3 jīrā́ráthānām with a supposed objective
gen., but see comm. ad loc. Since I do not see attributing an otherwise unattested
usage to the word in just this compd, however convenient, we must find an
alternative path to sense, made more difficult by the fact that there are no other Xjīra- cmpds and this one is a hapax. The cmpd modifies the somewhat shadowy
goddess Puraṃdhi, who is associated with plenty and esp. with plentiful gifts. Cf., in
this maṇḍala, IX.93.4 rathirāyátām uśatī́púraṃdhiḥ … dāváne vásūnām “Let
Plenitude come eagerly on her chariot … for the giving of goods.” In our cmpd I
suggest an instr. relationship between the first member and the second: “lively with
cows,” capturing both her quickness (as indicated by her “hastening” here and the
eager journey in 93.4) and the presumed accompaniment of a profusion of (living)
cows as gift. This type of cmpd — NOUN + INTRANS. ADJ. — seems relatively rare and
the relationship between the two members is quite variable. See AiG II.1.233-38. It
is also possible, as suggested as a last-ditch alternative by Ge (n. 3c), that the cmpd is
an inversion of a straightforward bahuvrīhi *jīrá-go- ‘having lively cows’ (like
jīrā́śva- cited above). Though a fem. instr. sg. *jīrá-gavā should not have been
difficult to build, it is noteworthy that there are no instr. sgs. to the ‘cow’ word in the
RV (for V.30.7 see comm. ad loc.).
### 04-06
A very challenging tṛca, esp. the last two vss.

### 04
Though the meter changes here, vss. 3 and 4 are knit together by initial
ájījanaḥ. Here the obj. is left unspecified and presumably re-supplies the obj. of 3.
Re notes the play between ā́m̐ṛtásya and amṛ́tasya, which might suggest that
the anunāsika sometimes inserted after final vowels at the end of a pāda to prevent
coalescence with the following initial vowel is not merely a redactional addition, as
Old (Proleg. 470) asserts.
Ge (n. 4b) identifies amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇaḥ as a reference to the drink of
immortality, namely soma. In this I think he is correct; see comm. ad IX.70.2.
However, he also wants it to be a type of partitive genitive (“eine Art von Genit.
partit.”) dependent on ájījanaḥ; it is difficult to imagine what sort of partitive gen.
could be construed with ‘beget’. I see no reason why this gen. cannot depend on
dhárman as ṛtásya does (Sāy.’s solution).

### 05
I don’t quite know what to do with śrávasā. Ge and Re bleach it into an
adverb (rühmlich, glorieusement), which I am reluctant to do, but it also seems
unlikely that it was Soma’s fame that enabled him to do this drilling. Perhaps it is
shorthand for a famous deed, referring to this very act of drilling, or it simply
characterizes Soma without reference to the action at hand. It may also be a sly
allusion to a well-known formula: the adj. ákṣitam ends the hemistich, and śrávas
ákṣitam (in sandhi śrávo ákṣitam) is of course the most famous Indo-European verbal
formula.
I seem to have misdistributed the elements in pāda b. Because of their
proximity I construed janapā́nam ákṣitam together (“inexhaustible drink for men”),
but ákṣitam most likely goes with útsam (as well as notionally with śrávasā; see
above), because “inexhaustible wellspring” is itself a minor formula: see I.64.6 and
VIII.7.16 (both polarized at beginning and end of pāda as here and both obj. of √duh
‘milk’, with Maruts as subj.) as well as III.26.9 útsam ákṣīyamāṇam “a wellspring
never becoming exhausted.” In the first two quoted passages the phrase must refer to
the sky or some feature in it, which the Maruts milk for rain (the third passage
characterizes Agni in a somewhat opaque metaphor).
Thus the hemistich seems to compare Soma’s drilling towards the drink for
men (which also must be soma) with drilling for (rain)water in the sky. Or so I would
take it; Ge, Re, and Lü (384) do not separate pāda b into simile and frame, as I do,
but take the whole phrase together with ná marking it as some sort of approximative
- e.g., Ge: “gleichsam einen unversieglichen Born …, der von Menschen getrunken
wird.” I prefer to distinguish two separate entities being compared, and I suggest that
the “drink for men” (janapā́nam) is the earthly ritual soma, while the inexhaustible
wellspring contains the heavenly soma. How would Soma be drilling for the ritual
soma? what kind of action does this involve? I suggest tentatively that it might refer
to the pressing of the juice out of the plant.
But there is another factor to take into consideration: the lexeme abhí √tṛd. In
all clear cases (VIII.77.5 is impenetrable) the object of this verb is the Vala cave or
the contents thereof, cows or “prizes” (referring to cows). There are a number of
such passages: II.24.4 (where in another part of the vs. the Vala cave is referred to as
an útsa-), III.31.5, VI.17.1-3 (on vs. 1 see comm. ad loc.), VIII.103.5
(metaphorically of Agni), X.74.4. If we plug this stable association into our passage,
we need to ask another question: what could stand for the cave full of cows here?
And the obvious answer is the container that holds the milk mixture.
What this adds up to is a set of overlapping and partly contradictory images:
the ritual soma drink being drilled out of the plant, but also the inexhaustible
wellspring standing for not only heaven which contains the heavenly soma, but also
the metaphorical Vala cave containing the milk mixure (remember that útsa- is used
of the Vala cave in II.24.4) - both of which could be drilled out for their respective
contents. I would suggest that this welter of images is responsible for the oddly
tentative and indefinite presentation of the action, first with the āmreḍita-ed preverb
abhy-àbhi, which I render as “ever closer” (which I now think is not so good) and Ge
as “immer wieder” (Re with “toujours” and Lü not at all). I now think it is objectdistributive, as it were: there are several targets of the drilling. I do not quite know
how to convey this in English. This is reinforced by the indefinitizing káṃ cid
characterizing the útsa-: “some kind of wellspring, some wellspring or other,” which
would be appropriate if útsa- in the simile is meant to call to mind both the heavenly
holder of the heavenly soma and the Vala cave full of cows.
I would now emend the publ. tr. to “Because you with your reknown have
drilled through to the drink for men as if through now to this inexhaustible
wellspring [=the container of heavenly soma], now that one [=the container of milk
compared to the Vala cave].” An unfortunately awkward unpacking of a very dense
couple of pādas.
And this is only the first hemistich; the final pāda poses its own difficulties,
consisting of another condensed simile cum frame.
Both Ge and Re take the whole pāda as the simile, comparing Soma to an
archer. Both have to supply a considerable amount of material, including an object
for bháramāṇaḥ and a verb and another object to construe with śáryābhiḥ; cf., e.g.,
Re’s “tel (un guerrier) tenant (l’arc) en ses deux mains (perce la cible) avec les
flèches.” His “perce” and, more clearly, Ge’s supplied “das Ziel durchbohrt” pick up
abhí tatárditha in pāda a, but ‘drill through to’ is an odd action to perform on a
target, and as I just said, a lot has to be supplied. (Kü’s interpr. [216] supplies less
but also connects less with the rest of the vs.: “wie einer, der mit Pfeilen etwas (=den
Bogen) in seinen Händen trägt.”) My interpr. of the pāda depends on a double
reading of bháramāṇaḥ, as both passive (in the frame) and self-beneficial transitive
(in the simile). I also read gábhastyoḥ in both simile and frame. Some material has to
be supplied, but less than in the Ge/Re interpr., and it also has the merit of
connecting the arrows and the hands: Old points to X.61.3 śáryābhiḥ … gábhastau
“with arrows in his hand” as a potential clue to our passage. To deal with the frame
first: this participle is found in passive usage, also with soma as subj., in I.135.3, 6
adhvaryúbhir bháramāṇā ayaṃsata … śukrā́ḥ “the gleaming (soma drinks), being
carried, have been guided by the Adhvaryus” (or “being carried by the Adhvaryus,
have been guided …”). The agents there are the priests, and here I would take the
gábhastyoḥ in the frame as referring to the priest’s hands that bring the soma
forward. In the simile I take med. bháramāṇaḥ as self-beneficial and supply ‘booty’
(or some other desirable material benefit) as the object. Such a usage is found in
IX.79.2, containing one of the few medial forms of √bhṛ in IX: vayáṃ dhánāni
viśvádhā bharemahi “May we always bear away the stakes.” Here the material borne
away was clearly won by the arrows in the winner’s hands. I have recast the simile as
passive in English, but more literally the tr. would read “while being carried in the
(priest's) hands, as (someone) with arrows in his hands carries away (booty).” If I am
correct, this is an implicit example of my “case disharmony in similes,” though
neither the passive subject nor the transitive direct object is actually expressed.

### 06
This vs. seems to follow from vs. 5; it begins ā́d ‘just after that, because of
that’, which signals temporal or logical nexus - though what that nexus is remains
unclear to me. The indefinite ké cid of pāda a also echoes the káṃ cid of 5b, but,
again, the reasons why escape me. The vs. isn’t as desperately difficult as 5 but it has
more than its share of problems.
The part. in pāda a, páśyamānasaḥ, is one of the few medial forms to this
extremely well-attested pres. stem. The same phrase páśyamānāsa ā́pyam is found in
VII.83.1. In both passages it describes the subject(s) as “seeing” (that is,
contemplating?) the friendship between themselves and another being or beings, in
this case Soma. So much is reasonably clear. Also reasonably clear is what action
they took or have taken: they (have) roared to him (īm … abhy ànūṣata).
Who the subjects are is harder to determine and in part depends on the
grammatical identification of the rt. noun cmpd vasurúcaḥ. This is ordinarily taken as
a nom. pl. and either a qualifier of the other nom. pl. divyā́ḥ or as implicitly
conjoined with divyā́ḥ as a joint subject. For the former, cf. Re’s “certains (êtres)
célestes, brillants (de l’éclat des) Vasu”; for the latter, e.g., Scar’s (457) “gewisse
Leute, deren Pracht [für uns] Gut bedeutet [und auch] Himmlische (?).”
As for vasurúcaḥ, I prefer to take it as gen. sg., dependent on ā́pyam and
referring to Soma (a possibility mentioned by Scar). The next hymn (IX.111) has
several forms of √ruc referring to Soma: instr. sg. of the rt. noun rucā́(IX.111.1a)
and the pres. stem forms rocate (1d), rócamānaḥ (2g), and in IX.111.2a it is said of
Soma vido vásu “you found that good (thing).” Moreover, most of the forms of the
uncmpded rt. noun rúc-, found here as 2nd member of our hapax cmpd., appear in IX
(10 out of 13), again in connection with Soma. In other words, the default association
of -rúc- would be with Soma, not some indefinite set of beings. (For various interpr.
of the sense of this cmpd. see esp. Scar 457-58; my ‘radiant with goods’ is hardly the
only one, and many involve a PN in one way or another.)
If we accept my interpr. of the grammatical identity of the cmpd., this leaves
us with ké cid … divyā́ḥ “some heavenly ones, these heavenly ones and those ones,”
as the subj. of abhy ànūṣata. Because of the close connections between vss. 5 and 6,
it would be desirable to interpr. the indefinitizers in both vss. in the same way. In vs.
5, as I argued, káṃ cid signals that there’s more than one referent for útsam. I think
we should pursue the same interpretive strategy here. In other words, we should
expect that divyā́ḥ should have several different referents appropriate to the context.
Unfortunately divyā́ḥ and abhy ànūṣata point in different directions: the verb is
generally used of cows, or entities configured as cows - primarily hymns, priestly
voices, and the like. But these would not generally be qualified as ‘heavenly’ -
though see IX.86.4, where I supply “hymns” with divyā́ḥ. The adj. also qualifies
‘drops’ on occasion (IX.86.1) and soma itself, so perhaps the heavenly Soma here.
And another well-established referent is ‘waters’ (VII.49.2, 103.2; cf. X.98.5),
“heavenly waters” being rain. These are all possible, but not particularly compelling,
referents here, esp. because they would have to be contemplating friendship with
Soma as well as roaring to him. What divyá- does not generally seem to qualify is
heavenly beings in the form of gods (except possibly in contrast to pā́rthivāḥ -
‘earthly’ [=humans?]), which seems to be the default interpr. of the standard tr.
(including mine); my remark in the publ. intro. about “the gods’ yearnig for soma” in
vs. 6 is therefore probably incorrect. I’ve reached an impasse. Although I think I’m
asking the right questions, they don’t produce satisfactory answers.
My interpr. of the final pāda differs from the standard, which takes deváḥ
savitā́as solely constituting the simile: “he uncovers a desirable thing like god
Savitar.” But this seems pretty flat. Moreover, the simile particle ná is to the left of
both parts of the putative simile ( … ná deváḥ savitā́). A better constructed simile
would include the portion to the left of ná, namely vā́ram. And I think it does: in my
view vā́ram is a perfect pun; the word means both fleece (filter) and desirable object.
In the frame, the first reading is the filter: Soma uncovers the fleece - that is, the
juice passes beyond it; “desirable thing” is the reading in the simile, and in fact a 2nd
reading in the frame. The tr. should be slightly emended to “He uncovers the fleece
(/desirable thing) as the god Savitar uncovers a desirable thing.”
### 07-09
Considerably clearer than the previous tṛca.

### 07
Ge and Re take naḥ as the obj. of codaya in c, but I think rather dhíyam
from b, with naḥ genitive. Cf. III.62.10 dhíyo yó naḥ pracodáyāt, VI.47.10 codáya
dhíyam.

### 09
On niṣṭhā́- see comm. ad III.31.10.
### 10-12
This very straightforward final tṛca concerning the ritual preparation
of soma harps on the root √pū, with punānáḥ 10a, pávamānaḥ 10b, punānáḥ 11a,
pavate 11b, and pavasva 12a.

### 11  
Note the alliteration in c: vājasánir varivovíd vayodhā́ḥ. The first word
vājasániḥ forms a ring with vā́jasā́taye in vs. 1a.

### 12  
The c pāda also shows alliteration: s
u
vāyudháḥ sāsahvā́n soma śátrun.

##  111
On the characteristics of Atyaṣṭi meter see comm. ad I.127-39, the only series
of Atyaṣṭi hymns in the RV, which are attributed to our poet’s father Paruchepa.

### 01
To achieve 8 syllables in pāda c we need to read sū́raḥ as trisyllabic, as
Old points out - a fairly rare scansion for this word.
On “all forms” see comm. ad IX.64.8.
Ge (n. 1fg) suggests that the “versifiers with their seven mouths” refers to the
Aṅgirases, since the same word saptā́sya- is used of Bṛhaspati with ref. to the
Aṅgireses in IV.50.4 and with direct ref. to Aṅgira in IV.51.4. This is quite plausible,
given that the next vs. conerns the Vala myth - but the phrase must simultaneously
apply to the current ritualists.

### 02
As indicated in the publ. intro., at least the 1st part of this vs. touches on
the Vala myth (as did 1g), but with some twists. In pāda a “that good thing of the
Paṇis” (tyát paṇīnā́m … vásu) must be the herd of cows concealed in the Vala cave.
The only other ref. to the Paṇis in IX is IX.22.7 ... paṇíbhya ā́vásu gávyāni dhārayaḥ
“You secured from the Paṇis the good things of cattle,” which specifies the vásu
(there pl.) as bovine.
As indicated in the publ. intro., problems arise in pāda b, with the verb
marjayasi. The morphology of this form is absolutely clear, as is the normal sense of
this well-attested -áya-formation: it is transitive and active (save for a fair number of
mechanical -anta replacements, which are also transitive). The clarity of its form
collides with the expected sense: if Soma is the subject (and who else would it be?),
Soma is normally the object of √mṛj (or subj. of passive forms). We do not expect
Soma to be the groomer, not the groomee (as it were). It is somewhat distressing to
observe fine RVic scholars override the morphology in order to obtain their desired
sense. Re simply renders it as reflexive (“tu te nettoies”) without comment; even the
usually severe Old, after some disc. of previous suggestions, simply declares that
here (as, acdg. to him, often) the active “im ungefähren Sinn des Mediums steht.”
Ge, however, holds the line (see his n. 2b rejecting Old’s suggestion), and tr. it as an
absolute, without obj. (“mit den Müttern machst du im eigenen Haus sauber”),
suggesting that it depicts a child cleaning along with its mother -- producing the
somewhat comic image of Soma as an especially tidy child. He then takes back his
admirably austere approach to the morphology by remarking “Natürlich ist die
saubere Herstellung des Soma gemeint …” I think it must be meant as a real
transitive, and the object to supply lies ready to hand: the vásu (so also Gr under
√mṛj + sám 4), i.e., the cattle, of the Paṇis, which can also stand for the milk to be
mixed with the soma juice. Here Soma acts as agent in the preparation of this milk
“in his own house,” that is, the ritual ground. He performs the grooming along with
the mothers (b), immediately specified (c) as “the insights of truth” (ṛtásya
dhītíbhiḥ), the hymns accompanying the ritual.
After this preparation (/grooming) of the milk, the soma is mixed with it and
acquires vitality thereby (fg). On the possible sense of tridhā́tu- see comm. ad
IX.70.8. It may refer to three ingredients but exactly which ones aren’t clear; in the
publ. tr. I suggest that they are identified with the three forms of ritual speech, as
casually suggested by Re, although I am not sure I stand behind that view now.
As for pāda d, both Ge and Re take sā́ma as part of the frame, not the simile,
which for them consists only of parāváto ná (e.g., “Wie aus der Ferne (kommt)
dieser Gesang”). Ge (n. 2d) suggests it’s the sound of the trickling soma. By contrast
I take sā́ma as part of the simile and suggest that it could refer to the song with which
Bṛhaspati/Indra and the Aṅgirases opened the Vala cave. The sā́man- is not a
prominent feature of the Soma maṇḍala, occurring only once elsewhere (IX.96.22).
I take yátra as standing for yásmin, as the loc. regularly found with √ran, so it
need not refer to a place or time. Both for the loc. with √ran and for the sā́man- as
locus of pleasure, cf. I.147.1 rtásya s ̥ ā́man raṇáyanta devā́ḥ “the gods delight in the
melody of truth.”

### 03
There appears to be a pun on raśmíbhiḥ in b; the word means both ‘reins’
and (metaphorically) ‘rays’, and in fact the extended meaning is more common in the
RV than the original literal one. Here both Ge and Re render only the sun’s rays
sense (e.g., “avec les rayons (solaires)”), and this sense is certainly there, prompted
by Soma’s eastern journey in pāda a, as well as the comparison to the sun in 1c. Cf.,
with the same verb, V.37.1 sáṃ bhānúnā yatate sū́ryasya “He aligns himself with the
radiance of the sun.” But the repeated phrase darśató ráthaḥ (b, c) “chariot lovely to
see” suggests that the ‘rein’ sense is also here. But the distinction is somewhat
muddled in practice, since the “heavenly chariot” of c is most likely the sun, with
which Soma is being identified.
Pāda f contains a non-overt Vāyav Indraś ca construction: vájraś ca yád
bhávathaḥ “when (you) and the mace become …” The 2nd du. verb bhávathaḥ
presupposes a 2nd ps. Soma (expect voc. soma), conjoined with the nom. vájraḥ by
ca.

### 112-114  
On these three paṅkti hymns that close the maṇḍala, see Old (Proleg 202):
“Diese Paṅkti-lieder werden durch das Versagen der Anordnung, durch ihren von
den übrigen Pavamânaliedern sich weit entfernenden Inhalt und durch die
Characteristica der Sprache und des Metrums als Zusätze erwiesen.” Among other
things, all share the refrain índrāyendo pári srava “O drop, flow around for Indra” as
the fifth pāda of every verse.

##  112
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn has no apparent connection with soma
except for the refrain.

### 01
The first word of the vs., the hapax nānānám, is an adjectival derivative
built to the adv. nā́nā ‘various’, used as an adverb (though for simplicity I have tr. as
if an adj.). As Thieme suggests (Unters. 54), it’s a rhyme form to samāná- ‘same’,
and nā́nā and samāná- appear together contrastively elsewhere (cf. II.12.8, III.54.6
adduced by Thieme). In our passage it also provides a polarized mirror-image to the
word ending the hemistich: #nānānám … jánānām# with reversed vowel quantities
(ā ā a … a ā ā) but matching consonantal structure (save for the initial), though the
necessary distraction of the last syllable of jánānām disturbs the pattern somewhat.
Pāda c provides a nice example of chiasmus, with the nom. agents at each end
and the acc. goals, with similar shape, in the middle: tákṣā riṣṭáṃ rutáṃ bhiṣák.

### 02
On the vs. see esp. Old’s comm. It is couched somewhat as a riddle, though
the solution is included in the vs.

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. contains informal nursery words for
father (tatá-) and mother (nanā́-). The latter is not found elsewhere in the RV or
indeed elsewhere in Skt. (though similar forms are well established in other IA lgs
and in Iranian), while the former is found twice in the Apālā hymn (VIII.91.5-6) and
is widespread later (also in the vṛddhi voc. tāta). Of course nanā́plays off the
immediately following nā́nā(-dhiyaḥ) beginning pāda c, as well as nānānám opening
the hymn.
For upala-prakṣíṇī I’m afraid in the publ. tr. I gave in to my baser inclination
towards an alliterative colloquialism: “pushing a pestle.” In fact, upala is of course
not a pestle, but the upper millstone of a hand mill, and the standard tr. are more
accurate at least for the first member: Ge “… füllt den Mahlstein auf”; Re “…
alimente la meule”; Doniger (235) “a miller with grinding stones.” The 2nd member,
prakṣíṇī, is obscure. The older association with √pṛc ‘mix’ (see Gr, Old’s citation of
Pischel, and AiG I Nachtr. 118) seems unlikely on both semantic and morphological
grounds. Similarly the connection (see AiG II.2.346, citing but rejecting Re) with
upaprakṣé ‘in copulation’ in V.47.6, which appears to be an s-enlarged from of √pṛc
and again not a good semantic fit. Thieme’s etym. (cited in EWA I.220 [s.v. úpara-]
and II.185-86 [s.v. práṣṭi-]) connecting it with a PIE *plenḱ- ‘dance’, with verb
forms only in Balto-Slavic (these forms differently explained in LIV), is too
gossamer to consider. I do not have a good alternative, but suggest a possible
derivation from √kaṣ ‘scratch, scrape’, a reasonable characterization of the action of
manipulating the upper stone on a handmill (see YouTube). Whatever its ultimate
source (see EWA s.v.), verb forms to √kaṣ begin to appear in the AV and it is also
widespread in MIA and NIA (see Turner nos. 2970-73, 2979), often associated with
testing on a touchstone (perhaps requiring motions similar to manipulating a
handmill). Though it does not seem to show up with prá, this combination would not
seem surprising. We probably need to assume a zero-grade thematic noun *kṣ-á-
‘scraping’ (vel sim.) from which the -ín-stem was derived. All of this is very
tenuous, but at least provides another possible source to evaluate. In any case I would
now tr. this pāda as “mama scrapes away with a millstone.”

### 04
In TS (etc.) úpa mantrayate means ‘summon, invite near’, but also seems
to have the sense of persuading by tricky, hence ‘beguile, seduce’. I base my interpr.
of hasanā́- on the frequent transitive-causative value of the -ana-suffix; here
something that provokes laughter, that is, a joke. Ge/Re simply laughter, Old
specifically the laughter of a woman.

##  113
On the structure and thematics of the hymn see publ. intro.

### 01
Pāda a lacks a syllable - no obvious fix. Distraction to *śari
yaṇā́vati would
produce three light syllables at the beginning of the pāda, which would be highly
unusual, and the stem is not otherwise found distracted. On the word see comm. ad
VIII.6.39.

### 02
Although in the idiom ā́pavasva the preverb ā́generally governs an acc.,
with the meaning “bring X through your purification,” here it seems identical in
usage to the simplex.
On ārjīká- see comm. ad VIII.7.29. The appearance of śaryaṇā́vant- (vs. 1)
and ārjīká- in two successive vss. recalls their appearance in the same vs. in
VIII.7.29 (see also śaryaṇā́vant- in the preceding hymn VIII.6.39).
Note the appearance of both ṛtá- and satyá- in the phrase ṛtavākéna satyéna.
Contrary to Ge/Re, who take them as two parallel entities, I construe them as a single
NP with satyá- as adj. The interpr. of Ge and Re may be supported by vs. 4, where
ṛtá-, satyá-, and śraddhā́- are treated separately and in series, following the order in
which they are found here. I therefore propose an alternative possible tr. here “With
speech of truth, with what is real, with trust …”

### 03
The buffalo (mahiṣá-) that is the object of all 4 clauses should be the rain,
perhaps configured as the heavenly soma. It is not clear to me what the Gandharvas
(c) have to do with the production of rain and its transformation into soma sap.
Pāda b has 9 syllables. Old half-heartedly suggests reading duhitā́with
slurring (Verschliefung) of the 1st two syllables, but then remarks that the author of
this hymn is “kein exakter metrischer Techniker.”

### 04
As noted ad vs. 2, the first three pādas of this vs. pick up the series ṛta(-
vākena) satyéna śraddháyā and devote a pāda to each - each one as obj. of vádan
‘speaking’ and the first two also incorporated into bahuv. vocatives: ṛta-dyumna,
satya-karman.

### 05
This vs. strikes me as very nearly doggerel. Although RVic poets enjoy
indulging in etymological figures - and are skilled at deploying them - those in
pādas b and c seem to display neither imagination nor skill: b sáṃ sravanti
saṃsravā́ḥ (the pāda missing a syllable, to make it worse), c … rasíno rásāḥ.
Moreover, after the solemn use of satyá- ‘reality, what is real’ in vss. 2 and 4, the
cmpd satyámugra- in pāda a seems to have downgraded the word to an adverb (so
AiG II.1.67, 237) in a word with the banal sense ‘really strong’ (AiG II.1.37
‘wahrhaft kräftig’, 237 ‘wahrhaft gewaltig’; sim. Ge/Re) and that awkwardly uses the
neut. adverbial acc. as first member (so AiG II.1.67), to provide a makeshift hiatusbreaker. And there is also an apparent lapse in grammatical agreement, with sg.
punānáḥ in d modifying the plural subjects of bc, even though pl. punānā́(ḥ) would
have been metrically identical. Ge and Re rescue the poet from this lapse in different
ways: Ge construes d with the refrain (as he does in other vss: 2, 4, 6), but given that
the refrain serves not only for this hymn but for the previous and following hymns
and is generally independent syntactically, this seems unlikely. Re implicitly takes
the subj. of d from the genitive phrases of pādas a and c.
In c rasínaḥ could be either gen. sg. or nom. pl., and either would fit. Gr and
the standard tr. (including mine) take it as gen. sg., presumably because the other two
occurrences of rasínaḥ (VIII.1.26, 3.1) are. A gen. also makes the phrase less
pleonastic: “the juices of the juicy one” is marginally better than “the juicy juices.”
### 06-07
On the relationship between these vss. and their function in the hymn,
see publ. intro.

### 06
Despite the hemistich boundary and the tr. of Ge/Re, I take grā́vṇā in c
with vádan, immediately preceding it in b, because the grā́van- regularly “speaks”
elsewhere (cf. VIII.34.2, X.36.4 grā́vā vádan, V.37.2 grā́vāṇaḥ … vádanti). Ge and
Re need to supply material in order to construe it with pāda c.
### 08-11
In addition to the fifth pāda refrain found throughout the hymn (as well
as IX.112 and 114), these four vss. add a refrain in the fourth pāda: tátra mā́m
amṛ́taṃ kṛdhi “there make me immortal,” each time serving as the main clause for a
set of yátra clauses.
### 08
The standard view of avaródhanam is that it defines a closed or fortified
place (Ge “der verschlossene Ort des Himmels”; Re “le rempart du ciel”; Doniger
[133] “where heaven is enclosed”) - deriving ródhana- from √rudh ‘confine, hem
in’. But I take it instead to the other √rudh (/ruh) ‘grow’ and interpr. it as ‘means of
ascent’, exactly like róhaṇaṃ diváḥ in I.52.9 (q.v.). So my vision of heaven is a more
welcoming place, that extends a ladder down for us to make the ascent.

### 10  
Re renders kā́mā nikāmāś ca as “les désirs (avoués) et les désirs-secrets”;
although ni- might suggest something hidden or deposited in secret, but the related
bahuvr. níkāma- (8x) seems just to mean ‘desirous’ without any special nuance.
The phrase bradhnásya viṣṭápam is found also in VIII.69.7, where I take it to
refer to the surface of the soma (see comm. ad loc.), but bradhná- ‘coppery colored’
can also refer to the sun (see comm. ad VII.44.3, IX.97.52) and in fact to both
simulataneously, with soma identified with the sun. What the phrase is trying to
convey here is totally unclear to me.
As Old and Ge (n. 10c) point out (see also Doniger (134 and n. 5), svadhā́-
and the root √tṛp ‘satisfy’ are associated with offerings to the Pitars (dead ancestors).

##  114
### 01
Acdg to Ge, it is Soma’s mánas that the poet will satisfy, while Re takes
the mánas as the poet’s. Re is no doubt correct; cf. VIII.61.9 avipró vā yád ávidhad, 
vípro vendra te vácaḥ “If without inspiration or if inspired, someone has dedicated
his speech to you, Indra …”

### 02
The Anukr. ascribes this hymn to Kaśyapa Mārica, along with the previous
one (IX.113), along with several others in IX and a few in other maṇḍalas.

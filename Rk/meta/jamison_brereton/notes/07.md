Commentary VII
[VII.1–17 JPB]
## 18
Indra (Battle of the Ten Kings)
I have little or nothing to contribute to the interpr. of this famous hymn, esp.
of its historical or quasi-historical aspects. The hymn has been extensively treated by
a number of scholars both fairly recently, esp. H.-P. Schmidt (Indica 17 [1980], 41–
47) and M. Witzel (in The Indo-Aryans in Ancient South Asia [1995], esp. 333-37),
and in the past, and I will therefore limit my comments. See the publ. intro. for
structural and contextual disc. I am certain that many puns, wordplays, and snide
asides are completely unrecoverable today and respectfully suggest that we put our
energies into interpreting parts of the RV where we have a chance of success.

### 1  
Pāda c contains two parallel nominal clauses. Both should be in the causal
domain of the hí, but it is located only in the 2nd of the two. We might have expected
*t
u
vé hí gā́vaḥ sudúghās tvé áśvāḥ, which would have been just as good metrically.
On the pun in d see publ. intro. and comm. ad vs. 4.

### 2  
As I interpr. it, the first hemistich presents us with a causal hí clause
followed by an imperatival non-sequitur. What is immediately striking is that it is
emphasized that Indra is dwelling in peace and domestic harmony -- not always the
first picture of Indra we conjure up -- in a hymn that is about to become very very
martial. In the imperatival clause of b, he is also identified as a wise kaví, again not a
militant role for Indra. Perhaps the connection between the causal hí clause and the
imperatival ones that follow is that Indra has the leisure to pay due attention to our
hymns and reward our poetic offerings (which, as a kaví, he has the connoisseurship
to appreciate) with aid and material goods.
The interpr. just given assumes that áva opening b and piśā́opening c are both
imperatives. Both of these identifications have been questioned. Some (e.g., Lub)
take áva as the preverb (Gr by implication, since he does not list it under √av), but
both Ge and Old (the latter after some hesitation) interpr. it as an impv. to √av ‘help’.
As for piśā́, Gr takes it as the instr. of a root noun, but most subsequent interpr. as the
impv. to an otherwise unattested them. aor. to √piś ‘adorn, ornament’ (see, e.g., Old,
Ge, Schindler [Rt. Noun], Lub). Our form could well be a thematic substitute for a
form of the root aor., found once in the part. piśāná-, since the expected root aor.
impv. should be the quite opaque *pīḍhí.
As indicated ad I.71.10, I do not have an independent view about the
morphology of vidúṣ, which occurs in the same phrase in both passages (abhí vidúṣ
kavíḥ sán). I do think that it is a nom. sg. (with Old), not a haplologized acc. pl. as Ge
takes it (see his n. 10b ad I.71.10). (Debrunner [AiG II.2.471] seems weakly to assign
it to a -u-stem [but possibly to -uṣ- instead] and interpr. as a nom. sg., while
Wackernagel [AiG III.300, which publication of course long predates II.2] accepts
Ge’s acc. pl.) To me the form looks as if it is a truncated form of the weak form of
2
2
the pf. part. vidvā́ṃs-, though it could of course belong to a u-stem vidú- instead --
but whether it is archaic or innovative I wouldn’t venture to say. It is also curious
that in neither passage is the pres. part. sán concessive, though that is the usual
function of the nom. forms of this participle. However, here the sán is by my interpr.
in tmesis with abhí, which opens the repeated phrase, in the sense ‘be preeminent’
(so also Ge), even though participles in tmesis are rare.
The apparent close sandhi with following kavíḥ that vidúṣ exhibits seems to
me not to support the haplology explanation, though the sandhi issue is complex.
Mark Hale (in “Preliminaries to the Study of the Relationship between Syntax and
Sandhi in Rigvedic Sanskrit” [MSS 51, 1990], as well as the unpubl. Wackernagel’s
Law: Phonology and Syntax in the Rigveda [1995], 33–36) insightfully discusses the
general problem of irregular sandhi of -s before k-. The great majority of the
examples occur before forms of √kṛ, and Hale plausibly accounts for this
phenomenon by pointing out that kṛ has an s-mobile doublet √skṛ and that the
unusual -s sandhi outcomes can result from the doubled -s s- that would be
underlying. The single example of such a result before the PN káṇva- can also be so
explained, since we have a synchronic doublet -skaṇva. However, Hale’s invocation
of the s-mobile explanation for the exx. before kaví- is not supported by internal
evidence for a *skaví- or by solid evidence of s-mobile cognates outside of Indic, and
I therefore think the kaví- examples require a different explanation -- though I don’t
know what that is. We should first note that they form a more limited set than Hale’s
presentation (1995: 36 n. 28) makes clear. The two vidúṣ kavíḥ passages are identical,
and paś́uṣ kavíḥ occurs in our same hymn (8d) and is most likely responsive to the
earlier example; vásuṣ kavíḥ (I.79.5) is nearby vidúṣ kavíḥ in I.71.10 (though
admittedly not attributed to the same poet) and could be based upon it. brahmaṇas
kave (VI.16.30) is in a voc. phrase where close sandhi effects are at home; cf. the
very similar brahmaṇas pate (I.18.3). Of Hale’s collection, this leaves V.59.4 kás
kā́vyā [sic, not Hale’s kāvyāḥ] and ṛtás kavíḥ (VIII.60.5). The latter is problematic for
a different reason: it contains one of only two exx. of a masc. ṛtá-; the other is in the
same phrase (IX.62.30) but with standard sandhi ṛtáḥ kavíḥ. In fact most occurrences
of kaví- (kā́vya-, etc.) preceded by -s do show the standard visarga (e.g., among the
many, I.76.5 kavíbhiḥ kavíḥ). I don’t know what to make of all this. I am inclined to
think that the irregular sandhi originated in the morphologically problematic phrases
vidúṣ kavíḥ and ṛtás kavíḥ and is a dark reflection of their troubled morphology. It
then had a very limited spread. But since I don’t understand what the morphology is
or how this could affect the sandhi, this is not much of a theory! In any case, the poet
of this hymn seems to showcase this sandhi anomaly, by not only including the two -
uṣ ka- examples (2b, 8d), but also adding the correct āśúś canéd (9b) and close
sandhi rāradhuṣ ṭe (18a); cf. also suṣupuḥ ṣáṭ (14b).
The cows and horses attributed to Indra in 1c reappear here in c as his
ornamental gifts to us.

### 4  
The desid. part. dúdukṣan is mildly notable because 1) it does not exhibit
reverse-Grassmann (*dúdhukṣan) unlike the s-aor. ádhukṣat (also, however,
3
3
adukṣat); 2) it is a real part., not the u-adj. often substituting for the part. in the desid.
(*dudukṣú-).
Because of the overt switch to the 1st ps. in c, I take the pf. sasṛje in b as 1st ps.
(flg. JPB p.c.), with vásiṣṭhaḥ doubling the underlying subject. The pf. form is of
course ambig. between 1st and 3rd.
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. exhibits a kind of ring comp. via an
anagrammatic pun: 1c vásu ... vániṣṭhaḥ “best gainer of goods” is compressed into
the name of the poet vásiṣṭhaḥ (vás[u]… [ván]iṣṭhaḥ). This brings the first section of
the hymn to a close; the battle scene erupts abruptly in the next vs.

### 5  
My tr. of the 2nd hemistich follows Old’s, contra Ge.

### 6  
The first hemistich contains two ironic reversals, based on what are
presumably personal names or plays on them. In the first pāda yákṣu-, perhaps a pun
on Yadu, can be rendered as ‘sacrificer’ (so Schmidt, from whom I adapted the tr.),
and he himself becomes the sacrifice, or a part of it: puroḷā́ḥ ‘offering cake’.
The presumed underlying form of this nom. sg., puroḷā́s (also found in
III.28.2), is unexpected: to the stem puroḷā́ś- we might rather find *puroḷā́ṭ. See Scar
(221) with lit. It is worth pointing out in this case, as well as with equally unexpected
sadhamā́s in the next vs., that the final of both forms matches that of sudā́s, our hero
the king Sudās, and so there may have been some adjustment in that direction, esp. in
a hymn given to phonological manipulation. Unfortunately this doesn’t explain the
occurrence in III.28.2.
In b the name of the ill-fated enemy mátsyāsaḥ is also the common noun ‘fish’,
and this word should be read in both the simile and the frame. Following Old (and
Ge, who adopted Old’s suggestion), I take ápīva as containing not only the particle
ápi ‘also’ but also a putative loc. sg. to áp- ‘water’. Although there are vanishingly
few singular forms to this stem in the RV, they do exist (also in Avestan). The loc.
should also be accented *apí, but in puns accentual fluidity is common. The “fish”
pun cries out for the “water” interpr., though Schmidt seems to reject it. He then
introduces a pun that isn’t supported by the text, rendering rāyé … níśitāḥ as
“hooked on wealth (like fishes on bait).” Though this is appealingly cute, it is hard to
push ní √śā ‘whet (down)’ to ‘hook’, and dat. rāyé is also hard to fit into that idiom.
Moreover, (ní) √śā is a sort of signature verb in this hymn; cf. 2d, 11c, 24d, and in
particular the positive 2d śiśīhi rāyé asmā́n “whet us for wealth” appears to be the
polarized counterpart of our negative rāyé … níśitāḥ. I wish I could find a clever
expression to capture the image, but so far I have been unable to.
There is a diversity of opinion on what is happening in d as expressed by the
verb atarat. Ge thinks that friend is helping friend, though this requires √tṝ to mean
‘help’, not a usage I’m aware of; Old that the enemy ranks were divided into two
parts, both fleeing but one faster than, and therefore overtaking (√tṝ), the other. This
seems also to be Schmidt’s view, though his “crossed (overcame)” shows a nonidiomatic usage of English ‘overcame’ (meaning ‘overtook’?). The Old/Schmidt
view seems possible, but I interpr. it in the light of VIII.1.4, where I take tartūryante
4
4
to refer to the crisscrossing movements of people in opposite sides of a conflict. I
suggest that here sákhā sákhāyam refers to former comrades who are now fighting on
opposite sides and crossing each other’s path in the battle line: the shifting alliances
of the participants in the Ten Kings battle are notorious and much discussed (see esp.
Witzel’s treatment cited above).

### 7  
Ge (fld. by Gotō, 1st Kl., 222) takes bhananta as reflexive (“… nannten
sich”) with śivā́saḥ as pred. nom., but the responsive pairing of act. 3rd pl. pres.
bhananti and mid. 3rd pl. injunc. bhananta in adjacent vss. in the same metrical
position in IV.18.6–7 (see comm. ad loc.) marks bhananta as a text-book case of -
anta replacement, as disc. in my 1979 article. Flg. Schmidt, I take cd as the direct
speech implied by bhananta. Old also rejects the Ge interpr.
The l’s of the names bhalānás- and álina- and the unmotivated retroflex -ṣ- in
viṣāṇín- suggest peoples outside of the Ārya mainstream, although of course they
could also show the kinds of deliberate phonological deformation found elsewhere in
the hymn. It’s possible that bhalānás- reflects a form of √bhṛ, hence my ‘raiders’. It
is not clear whether śivā́saḥ should be interpr. as the usual adj. (‘kindly’) or as the
name of another group of fighters. The publ. tr. reflects the former (flg. Schmidt), but
I am now inclined to consider the latter more likely, primarily because it’s not
phonologically outlandish. In this case I’d tr. “The Pakthas and the Bhalānases spoke
out, and the Alinas and the Viṣānins -- (all) ‘kindly’ --” This would be a sarcastic
aside about the martial forces ranged against us.
If we accept the Schmidt/Witzel distribution of the allegiances of the various
named forces, those named in ab are complaining about the defection of the
sadhamā́d- who led them to the battle but has now gone over to the Tṛtsu (/Sudās)
side and has turned to attack the nṝ̥́n (‘superior men’), by which they mean
themselves. The sadhamā́d- is most likely Indra, and so losing him as an ally would
be a serious blow.
On the unexpected form sadhamā́s, if the nom. sg. to sadhamā́d-, see Scar
(381) with lit. I think it unlikely that it’s an acc. pl., a possibility Old considers by
assigning it to a diff. root. As noted above (vs. 6) with regard to puroḷā́s, the rhyme
with king Sudās may have played a part.
Ge’s interpr. of the syntax of cd is impossible: it contains an embedded main
clause! His rel. cl. consists of ā́yó ‘nayat … yudhā́nṛ́̄n “… der seine Mannen unter
Kampf heranführte” -- the beginning of c and the end of d. While his main clause is
the end of c and the beginning of d, … sadhamā́ā́ryasya, gavyā́tṛ́tsubhyo ajagan …
“Der Mahlgenossen des Ariers … ist aus Verlangen nach Kühen den Tr̥tsu's (zu
Hilfe) gekommen.” My tr. follows Old’s, which is slightly adjusted by Schmidt.

### 8  
Both this vs. and the following one concern the Paruṣṇī river, known from
elsewhere in the RV and later. In the 2nd pāda the VP ví jagṛbhre páruṣṇīm, lit. “they
grasped apart the P.,” is generally taken to mean ‘divert’ the course of the river (so
already Gr, also Ge; Schmidt slightly differently ‘divided’). The lexeme ví √grabh
occurs only once in the RV, but this seems a reasonable interpr. -- though I’m not
5
5
exactly sure how this feat of engineering would be accomplished. Perhaps so many
bodies accumulated in the river that it either had to flow around them (hence
Schmidt’s ‘divided’) or switch its course altogether. The use of the middle jagṛbhre
might support the former interpr.: they themselves [i.e., their own bodies] parted the
river. One is reminded of Iliad 21.205ff., where Achilles drives his enemies towards
the Scamander river, which berates and then fights with Achilles for filling the river
with corpses.
In the preceding pāda áditi- is also sometimes taken to be a river (Ge n. 8a,
Schmidt), but this seems much less likely to me. Aditi is, of course, a well-known
goddess, and her miscarriage is also a well-known mythological incident, in the
narrative of the sequence of her twin births ending with one miscarriage and one live
baby -- found already in the RV (see the clear passage X.72.8). It therefore seems
wiser not to make her capriciously into a landscape feature, but to start with the
mythological facts that might match the VP áditiṃ srevayántaḥ “making Aditi abort.”
Now, as is often related in middle Vedic texts, when the eighth embryo of Aditi
aborts, it becomes first the discarded Mārtāṇḍa (‘stemming from a dead egg’), but is
then fixed up and becomes Vivasvant, a name for the sun (see my Hyenas, pp. 204-8;
this identification is already implicit in the RV, pace Hoffmann). I wonder if
“causing Aditi to abort” refers to her aborted son, the sun, and in this case, by
metaphor, to an eclipse of the sun -- or at least something that could pass for one. If
the dust of a pitched battle got thick enough it could rise to blot out the sun’s rays
temporarily. Rising dust is often elsewhere a sign of intense fighting in the RV, and
flights of arrows so thick that they obscure the sun are a feature of battles in the epics
(e.g., MBh IV.53.26, 31). This loss of light could render the combatants acetás- (b),
lit. ‘without perception’ in b.
The durādhyàḥ ‘ill-intentioned ones’ are probably the same faction as those
referred to, probably sarcastically, as ‘kindly’ (śivā́saḥ in the previous vs., 7b).
Apparently alone of all tr. and comm., I do not have an opinion about who the
personnel are in cd. See the various suggestions, esp. those of Schmidt and Witzel.
As for cā́yamāna-, I assign it the intrans./pass. sense ‘being perceived as,
appearing as’, rather than, e.g., Schmidt’s “receiving due respect.” Gotō’s interpr. (1st
Kl. 137) is closer to mine, but he considers it reflexive: “sich als ... betrachtend, sich
für ... haltend.” He does not tr. this passage (or the other participial form in X.94.14).
Whoever the subject is -- Schmidt and Witzel think it’s Vasiṣṭha, the purohita of
Turvaśa, but I remain agnostic -- in my view this kavi has been felled, at least
temporarily, and therefore gives the impression of being a paśú-, in this case a
sacrificial, or already sacrificed, animal. Note the main verb aśayat (√śi ‘lie’), which
is the signature verb describing the slain Vṛtra in I.32. Note paśúṣ kavíḥ, which
shows the same sandhi before kavíḥ as vidúṣ kavíḥ in 2b; see disc. there.

### 9  
With Ge (etc.), I take ná in pāda a as a simile marker, not a negative; the
simile and frame participate in a pun on (-)ártha-. What they reached was a ni-àrtha-
‘failed goal’ (see, e.g., VI.27.6, X.107.8), which is like but tragically not their real
goal.
6
6
In b note āśúś (canéd), which echoes paśúṣ (kavíḥ) in the previous vs. (8d)
also pāda-initial. Here the sandhi is of course standard.
The adj. sutúka- occurs 7x in the RV; acdg. to EWA (s.v.) its meaning and
etymology are unknown, though it is generally translated in the ‘quick, swift’ realm
(like so many other unclear RVic adj.), e.g., Gr “rasch dahin eilend,” Ge (this
passage) “spornstreichs fliehend.” On the basis of X.42.5, where it appears parallel to
sváṣṭra- ‘easily goaded’, I suggest that it means ‘easily thrust/thrusting’ and is
ultimately derived from √tuj ‘thrust’. Under this analysis, of course, the voiceless -kis a problem. Easiest would be to extract it from the unattested nom. sg. of the
reasonably well-attested root noun túj-, which should be *túk, supported by pre-C
forms like *tugbhís, *tukṣú. This is essentially a variant of Re’s (EVP XII.108)
suggestion that it belongs to a root √tuc, a doublet of √tuj, but it avoids the
awkwardness of positing this extra root to explain one stem. In fact, Re suggests in
passing that it could start from an athematic nom. sg. *sutuk (he gives no accent), but
he prefers the √tuc hypothesis.
In view of the disorderly rout of these forces described in the next vs.,
presumably due to the collapse of their alliance, I now wonder if amítrān refers not
to their non-alliance with us (as in the publ. tr.), but to the lack or loss of unity
among themselves.
In d Ge takes mā́nuṣe as a place name (“in Mānuṣa”), on the basis of JB
III.244, which identifies it as the place of the Ten Kings battle. But, as Ge admits (n.
9d), the JB rendering could easily result from a misunderstanding of our passage.
Old suggests (not very enthusiastically) that it refers to (all) the enemies “in der
Menschenwelt.” Schmidt’s interpr. is somewhat puzzling, putting it in an
(unexpressed) simile contrasting the “castrates” of vádhri-vāc- to a (presumably
virile) man expressed by mā́nuṣa-: “who were talking like castrates in the world of a
man.” I think rather that it refers to Manu’s race or people: all other loc. singulars of
this stem modify jáne (save for I.12.8.7, where it qualifies the semantically close
vṛjáne). I take the expression as concessive “(though) in Manu’s (race)”: the point is
that the opponents belong to the larger Ārya community though they are fighting
against us. They therefore in principle share the same sacrificial practices, including
ritual speech, but their ritual speech is ineffective (or so we hope), like that of a
castrate. The extensive ritual references in the account of the battle only work under
these conditions.
The cmpd. vádhri-vāc- ‘possessing gelded/castrated speech’ provides another
parallel to the famous Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32, whose vs. 7 likens Vṛtra to a vádhriwishing to become a bull.

### 10  
The vs. begins īyúr gā́vo ná, very similar to the opening of the preceding
vs. 9 īyúr árthaṃ ná. The simile of the cows without a cowherd (gā́vo ná … ágopāḥ)
presumably depicts the disordered flight of the troops that have lost their leader.
I have now considerably changed my interpr. of the 2nd pāda. In the publ. tr. I
take citā́saḥ as belonging to √ci ‘perceive’, meaning ‘perceived as, seeming’, rather
than to √ci ‘gather’, the usual interpr. I now think the standard root assignment is
7
7
correct, but that it means not ‘assembled, gathered’ (so Ge, Schmidt) but ‘piled up’.
In other words, the panic-stricken troops, running pell-mell without an overall leader,
hit an obstacle and pile up on top of each other in a heap of bodies.
The object they run into (abhí) is the opposing side, which is acting as allied
forces under a properly concluded agreement: yathākṛtám … mitrám. The standard
view of this phrase is that it describes the situation of the subjects, the fleeing
fighters, construed with citā́saḥ and therefore referring to an accidental or on-thespot alliance; so Ge “zu zufällig geschlossener Freundschaft geschart,” Schmidt “...
assembled for an alliance made on the spur of the moment.” But as Old points out,
mitrám √kṛ is the standard phrase for concluding an alliance in the normal fashion,
not for one made under pressure or by chance. It therefore better describes the wellorganized forces the subjects are confronting, and as I said in the comm. to the
preceding vs., the adj. amítrān there may well describe the lack of alliance among
these fighters going to defeat, here contrasted with our side, which is acting in
concert under a functioning alliance. I would therefore alter the publ. tr. to “They
went … piled up against an alliance properly concluded [=their enemies].”
In c the pl. pṛ́śnigāvaḥ may well be the name of a clan, as Old suggests; the
PN interpr. is followed also by Ge and Schmidt as well as the publ. tr. But it of
course has a straightforward bahuvrīhi interpr. (‘having dappled cows’) and, more to
the point, echoes the cow simile of the first hemistich, with -gāvaḥ in the same
metrical position as gā́vaḥ in a. That the first member pṛ́śni- is immediately repeated
in the cmpd pṛ́śni-nipreṣitāsaḥ calls further attention to the cmpd analysis. As for the
2nd cmpd., I am drawn to Ge’s suggestion (n. 10) that pṛ́śni- is a pun on the river
name Paruṣṇī.
In d ránti- is problematic. In its other occurrence, IX.102.5, it clearly means
‘joys’. But that makes no sense here. Ge refuses to tr.; Old tentatively suggests that
the word has developed into a “sakral-poetisch” term for cow, presumably starting
from ‘joy’. Schmidt tr. “supply lines” (< ‘refreshment’ < ‘enjoyment’), but this
seems a semantic chain too tenuous, esp. since the logistics and support for the battle
do not otherwise figure in this hymn (unless in 15cd). I take it as ‘battler’, assuming
that it shows the same semantic bifurcation as ráṇa-, both ‘joy’ and ‘battle’.
The phrase śruṣṭím cakruḥ opening d, “they followed orders,” forms a ring
with the same phrase in 6c. This is, at first, puzzling, since vss. 6-10 do not appear to
form a discrete section. However, on 2nd glance we can note that these five vss. mark
out the most intense and name-heavy portion of the battle. Starting with the next vs.
Indra takes over the fighting, and the hymn turns to the celebration of Indra and his
victorious feats; vs. 5, preceding this section, also attributes the whole victory to
Indra. The god is absent from 6–10, with the combatants on their own and engaged in
pitched battle.

### 11  
The king who is the subj. of ab may be Sudās (so Ge, flg. Sāy.) or Indra,
who appears by name in d, or Sudās identified with Indra. Given the ringcompositional structure discussed ad vs. 10, I favor either Indra or Sudās=Indra.
8
8
The relationship between the simile of c and the first hemistich is intricate and
partly unclear. The first hemistich portrays the destruction by a king of a large force
belonging to an otherwise unknown pair (the Vaikarṇas), using the aniṭ root ní √stṛ
(root aor. ny ástaḥ) ‘strew down’ found also in other hostile encounters (e.g.,
II.11.20). Pāda c by contrast sketches a ritual incident in a simile, but the simile is
slightly “off” for several reasons. For one thing, the predicate phrase sádman …
barhíḥ “the ritual grass on the seat” suggests that the verb to govern it should also be
‘strew down’, though in its seṭ form (cf., e.g., VII.43.2 stṛṇītá barhíḥ). The actual
verb of the simile, ní śiśāti ‘whets down’, is far less appropriate to its object, and we
must assume a metaphorical use of this verb in the simile -- a piling of figurative
language on figurative language, made all the more peculiar by the fact that the verb
of b would be better suited to the simile of c and vice versa. (Recall also that [ní] √śā
is the signature verb of this hymn; see comm. ad vs. 6.) It is almost as if the simile
had been turned inside out or the two clauses had swapped out verbs. Also disturbing
the simile is the fact that the subject of the clause, which, as agent of a verb
governing ritual grass, should be a priest or ritual functionary, is identified as dasmá-
‘wondrous, wonder-worker’, an adj. otherwise only applied to gods, esp. Indra (e.g.,
in nearby VII.22.8). So it too seems more at home in the main clause of ab than in
the simile of c, an association made stronger by the fact that dasmá- several times
occurs with rā́jan- in a simile (IX.82.1 rā́jeva dasmáḥ, X.43.2 rā́jeva dasma) and
rā́jā is the subject of ab. The interconnections become even more tangled when we
consider the 2nd of those just-cited similes: X.43.2 rā́jeva dasma ní ṣadó 'dhi barhíṣi
“Like a king, wondrous one [=Indra], sit down upon the ritual grass,” which contains
the grass and the root √sad ‘sit’, but there realized as a verb rather than as the loc.
nominal sádman.

### 12  
Old suggests that we read ánuṃ, not ánu, in b -- thus a PN, not a preverb -
- given the co-occurrence of the PNs ánu- and druhyú- elsewhere, incl. 14a, I.108.8,
etc., as well as the vṛddhi deriv. ā́nava- in the next vs. (13c). I have adopted this
suggestion; note that it does not affect the meter, as the next word (druhyúm) begins
with a cluster.
The relationship between the two hemistichs is loose and unclear. On the
basis of vs. 11, esp. 11d, and the epithet vájrabāhuḥ in 12b, we are entitled to assume
that the 1st hemistich has Indra as subject and is couched in the 3rd ps. But the 2nd
hemistich refers twice to ‘you’ (d tvāyántaḥ … tvā), manifestly referring also to
Indra, and the verb in the first hemistich, ní vṛṇak is ambig. between 2nd and 3rd -- a
typical modulation point. I would keep the publ. tr. (“he wrenched down”), but with
the awareness that the transition to 2nd ps. reference may already be underway.
The 2nd hemistich has Indra’s followers as subj., with d containing a rel. cl.
with nom. pl. yé. How to construe it is the question. Although there is no overt (or
indeed covert) representation of this plural group in the first hemistich, Ge takes the
whole of cd as an improper relative, tr. “während deine Anhänger, Freundschaft für
Freundschaft erwählend, dir zujubelten.” This not only reinterprets yé as a general
subordinator rather than a rel. prn., but it also has this subordinator placed very
9
9
deeply in its supposed clause. I prefer to take pāda c as containing a predicated root
aor. part. vṛṇānā́ḥ [“(They were) choosing your partnership … (those) who …”],
which allows the rel. cl. of d to have a more standard configuration, referring to the
pl. subj. of the nominal clause of c.

### 13  
With nom. índraḥ this vs. seems to return to 3rd ps. reference—though it’s
worth noting that both verbs of which índraḥ is subject are ambig. between 2nd and
3rd ps. (dardaḥ b, bhāk c), and so an appositive 2nd ps. reading “(you,) Indra, …” is
barely possible.
The adv. sadyáḥ ‘in an instant, all at once’ seems to clash semantically with
its verb dardaḥ, given the usual function of the “intensive” as a frequentative. It
would probably be better here to render sadyáḥ with Ge as ‘in a single day’,
indicating that Indra could destroy multiple fortifications in a limited time span.
The 1st pl. jeṣma is generally interpr. these days as a precative: see esp.
Hoffmann (Injunk. 254), Narten (Sig.Aor. 119–20), and Ge’s tr. “Möchten wir …
besiegen.” Certainly the other two occurrences of this form in the RV (VI.45.12,
X.156.1) have clear modal value. But in this context, in a long narrative set in the
past, though carried in part by injunctive forms like dardaḥ and bhāg in this vs., a
modal would be jarring and would interrupt the narrative by suddenly expressing a
hope for the future. I therefore follow, for this form here, the older interpr. of jeṣma
(see reff, in Hoffmann and Narten) as an irregular injunc. (for expected *jaiṣma; cf.
ajaiṣma VIII.47.18=X.164.5).

### 14  
Pāda b is notable for its alliteration, making full use of all three sibilants:
ṣaṣṭíḥ śatā́suṣupuḥ ṣáṭ sahásrā. The sums are tautological, as Old points out: sixty
hundred and six thousand amounting to the same number. Both ‘sixty’ (ṣaṣṭíḥ) and
‘six’ (ṣáṭ) reappear in the next pāda. The standard interpr. is that these sixty-six in c
are just an addition to the six thousand enumerated in the previous pāda. However,
Old suggests that they constitute the opposite side, the ‘heroes’ (vīrā́saḥ) ‘seeking
favor’ (duvoyú), who are fighting against those enumerated in pāda b. This interpr.
has the merit of not requiring those two words to be used ironically (on the latter, see
Ge’s n. 14c), and it also makes the victory that much more impressive, that this small
number, with Indra on their side, could defeat many multiples of themselves. The
same point is made more forcefully in vs. 17. The same balance between the good
guys and the bad guys, as it were, is found in the next vs., 15, where the Tṛtsus of ab
are Indra’s allies, but their opposite numbers are found in cd.

### 15  
As just noted, the vs. is divided into two, with the Tṛtsus of Indra’s party
in full flood in ab (on the attack, one presumes) and their enemies abandoning their
possessions under the pressure of this attack. These enemies are identified as
durmitrā́saḥ; as with amítra- of 9c, this descriptor seems meant to signal the fraying
or loss of the alliances that bound them and perhaps also to identify these alliances as
badly formed in the first place. The other example of this form as a full adj. is nearby
10
10
in VII.28.4; durmitrá- in X.105.11 is used as a PN in a quite possibly independent
play on the PN sumitrá-.
The first hemistich is straightforward; the second has its puzzles, starting with
the form prakalavíd (or, theoretically possible, -vín) in c. See, first, Old, who rejects
several previous suggestions and hesitantly follows what is found in Gr, as does Ge
(as do I): a root-noun cmpd. with √vid ‘know’, a 1st member related to kalā́- ‘small
part’ (VIII.37.17), used adverbially (Gr ‘die kleinsten Theile berechnend’ à
‘kleinlich’). Scar (486) discusses in somewhat more detail but reaches the same
hesitant conclusions. The universal uncertainty has much to do with the difficulty of
fitting this sense into context. I take the cmpd as implicitly contrasted with víśvāni in
d. By my interpr., the enemy forces measure their supplies precisely and
parsimoniously, “knowing every little piece” (Old “mit Kunde jedes kleinsten Teils”)
-- hence my idiomatic “with a miser’s eye.” But when confronted by the Tṛtsus’
attack, they profligately abandon everything and flee.
Kü (608) interpr. mímānāḥ as reflexive/intrans. ‘die kleinlich sich messen’,
though with ?, but, despite the middle voice, the other forms to this stem are
consistently transitive.

### 16  
Pāda c is notable for the alliterative and etymological figure manyúm
manyumyò mimāya, with the middle term manyu-mī́- containing the noun to its left
(manyú-) and the root noun of the verb to its right (√mī). Though mimāya
phonologically echoes mímānā(ḥ) at the end of 15c, they of course belong to
different roots.
Pāda d contains a rare and curious idiom PATH √bhaj; cf. VII.39.1 bhejā́te …
pánthām, possibly IX.102.2 ábhakta … padám, which I take (with Ge) to mean “set
out on the road,” similar to, though with a different idiomatic verb, Engl. “hit the
road.” The expression is complicated here by the question of how to construe pathó
vartaním. Is patháḥ acc. pl. and direct object of bhejé, with vartaním the obj. of
pátyamāṇaḥ? Such is the interpr. of Ge and Kü (334, 368) -- Ge with an idiomatic
interpr. of bhejé patháḥ, Kü with a more literal one. However, I think it more likely
that patháḥ is a gen. sg. dependent on vartaním on the basis of IV.45.3 ā́vartaním
mádhunā jinvathas patháḥ “You quicken the course of the path with honey.”

### 17  
If my interpr. of 14c is correct in taking the small number (66) as the
allies of Indra facing off a much larger force, this vs. continues the same theme, first
as a straightforward statement (a), then with two different metaphors (b, c): Indra
easily prevailed despite the relative insufficiency of his tools.
In b, if the standard interpr. of pétva- as ‘castrated ram, wether’ is correct (see,
e.g., EWA s.v.), the pairing of target and instrument is esp. striking: a fierce but
female wild animal, the lioness, and a castrated but (originally) male domestic one, a
wether, with opposition of both animal-type (wild/domestic) and gender, with the
latter complicated by the emasculation of the male representative.
The same thematic and syntactic template prevails in c, but neither the target
nor the tool is clearly identified. veśī́- (in the instr. veśyā̀) is a hapax; the standard tr.
11
11
‘needle’ derives from Sāy., but in fact this doesn’t make much sense. sraktí- has
better representation: it’s found in the cmpd. náva-srakti- ‘9-srakti-ed’ (also VS
cátuaḥ-srakti) and has an Aves. cognate sraxti-, �raxti- ‘edge, side’. EWA connects
it with sṛká- ‘fang’. To figure out what must be going on, we need to turn to the verb,
áva … (a)vṛścat. The lexeme áva √vraśc ‘hew down’ is found only once elsewhere,
in I.51.7, where it is used figuratively. But ní √vraśc, with the semantically similar
preverb ní, twice appears with a concrete image: hewing down trees with an axe. See
esp. I.130.4fg táṣṭeva vrk̥ ṣám vaníno ní vrś̥ casi, paraśvéva ní vrś̥ casi “like a carpenter
a tree from the wooden one [=forest], you cut down (the serpent) -- as if with an ax
you cut (him) down” (sim. VI.8.5). The acc. pl. sraktī́ḥ in our passage matches the
role of the trees in the passages just cited. I suggest that as ‘edge’ it refers to the
edges of a tree trunk or to something that is, as it were, pure ‘edge’ -- a pole. As the
instr., veśyā̀should correspond to the axe. A needle doesn’t work, but perhaps a pin -
- a small, sharp-pointed object that would ordinarily not have much success in felling
tall poles. I agree with Old that the expression is probably proverbial.
The ending of d, bhójanā sudā́se, is identical to the end of the last vs., 15d,
preceded by víśvāni (15d) and víśvā (16d) respectively. The bhójanā that the enemies
abandoned in 15 are here given to Sudās by Indra.

### 18  
I follow Ge in taking this vs. as direct speech.
Although Ge’s tr. of rándhi- in b as “schwache Stelle” is appealing, I
preferred to register the etymological figure between the verb of pāda a, rāradhuḥ,
and this noun.
Note the close sandhi rāradhuṣ ṭe, which reminds us of vidúṣ kavíḥ (2a) and
paśúṣ kavíḥ (8d), as well as correct āsúś canéd (9b).
The rel. prn. yáḥ is too deep in its clause, following both direct objects of
kṛṇóti: mártān … stuvatáḥ and énaḥ. I have no explan. for this violation.

### 19  
This is the last vs. with direct reference to the battle. The following two
(20–21) provide general praise of Indra’s aid and generosity, leading up to the 4-vs.
dānastuti.
Ge (n. 19d) insightfully suggests that pāda d is an ironic reflection on the
horses that died in the encounter.

### 20  
Ge takes pū́rvāḥ … nū́tnāḥ as qualifying sumatáyaḥ … rā́yaḥ: “Deine
Gnaden und deine Reichtümer, die frühere und die neuesten, sind nicht vollständig
aufzuzählen, so wenig wie die Morgenröten.” I prefer to take them with uṣásaḥ, for
several reasons. First, the word order, with uṣásaḥ nestled between the two temporal
adjectives, favors this interpr. Also my interpr. allows the ná … ná … ná sequence to
be entirely negative, rather than requiring the last to be a simile marker. Moreover,
the contrast between former and current dawn(s) is a standard trope in the RV, with
pū́rva- qualifying dawn in a number of passages. And finally morphology is against
it: Ge would need to explain why a fem. nom. pl. pū́rvāḥ, rather than the masc. pū́rve,
was used to modify a mixed feminine (sumatáyaḥ) and masculine (rā́yaḥ) NP;
12
12
ordinarily the default would be masc., esp. in this case where the masc. is closer to
the adjectives. (He could of course invoke the supposed occasional use of rayí-, rāyas feminine, but these exx. are vanishingly rare, if they exist at all.) I take the whole
dawn phrase as an acc. of extent of time. It would be possible to assign the temporal
adjectives to uṣásaḥ but interpr. that phrase as a simile in the nom., as Scar (167)
does: “Nicht sind deine Gnaden, nicht deine Gaben zu überschauen, genausowenig
wie die vergangenen und jetzigen Morgenröten.” I still prefer mine, since Scar’s
interpr. again requires the third ná to be a simile marker, even though it does avoid
the problems raised by taking the temporal adjectives with the NP in pāda a.
In c dévaka- is a lovely ex. of the use of the -ka- suffix both in a pejorative
sense and as signal of a lower register. Edgerton’s (-ka-suffix, 43) tr. is rather nice:
“the wretched little fellow who thought himself a godling.”
The form mānyamāná- is of course peculiar, though its source is clear: it is a
vṛddhi deriv. of the middle part. mányamāna- ‘think oneself to be …’ Although Ge
takes it separately from dévaka- as two distinct pejorative epithets (“…den Götzen,
den Dünkling”), I find it hard not to think that the participial usage is not still present
and that dévaka- is the de facto predicate nominative. The vṛddhi is perhaps used to
turn the typical subject of this participle into a category characterized by blind
arrogance (“the type of blowhard who would think himself …”) -- well captured by
Edgerton’s tr.
The verb in d, bhet (√bhid), recalls the enemy Bheda targeted by Indra in vss.
18–19.

### 21  
The sense of the first pāda is disputed, primarily because it is unclear how
to construe the abl. gṛhā́t. Old discusses at length without a definite decision; Ge has
his own idiosyncratic view: that in this context, with the abl. gṛhā́t, prá √mad means
‘to go on a pilgrimage’ (“die … von Hause fortgepilgert waren”), a bizarre interpr.
(rejected by Old), which he connects to abhí … pramandúḥ in VII.33.1, where his
pilgrimage interpr. seems equally odd. The phraseology here needs to be considered
in the context of similar expressions, not only VII.33.1, but also VIII.61.9 sá prá
mamandat tvāyā́and vs. 12d in this hymn tvāyánto yé ámadann ánu tvā (and consider
the immediately preceding pāda 12c vṛṇānā́átra sakhyā́ya sakhyám, which
resonantes with our c ná te … sakhyám mṛṣanta). Because of their proximity in the
same hymn, I think vs. 12 needs to be weighted more heavily than the other passages,
despite the difference in preverb (ánu there versus prá here). That vs. states that the
men devoted to Indra cheered him on -- in other words, Indra was the recipient of an
overt expression of their devotion -- and in turn they acquired a partnership with him.
I now think that prá … ámamaduḥ in this vs. should also be transitive, with Indra as
the object. Perhaps by haplology *tvā tvāyā́. I would therefore alter the publ. tr. to
“… who exhilarated (you) in devotion to you,” with a different type of overt
expression of devotion, here the soma. Pāda c then indicates that by doing so they did
not neglect the responsibilities of their side of the partnership and (d) happy days
ensue as a result. Interpreting prá … ámamaduḥ here as transitive also has the merit
13
13
of matching the use of abhí … pramandúḥ in VII.33.1, where there is an overt object
mā. The similar expression in VIII.61.9 is more equivocal; see disc. there.
This reappraisal of the verbal complex does not, however, solve the ablative
problem. My proposed solution, already found in the publ. tr., is quite simple: the
individuals named in pāda b (who include Vasiṣṭha) are relatives, “from the (same)
house” -- a use of ‘house’ similar to that in expressions like “the House of Atreus.”
Under this interpr., there is no physical movement out of or location away from an
actual dwelling. As this is the only abl. form of gṛhá- in the RV, it is difficult to
know if such an idiomatic usage is possible, but given that the verb in its clause is not
a verb of motion and cannot be made one without damage to its normal semantics,
this seems like a reasonable alternative.
bhojá- ‘provider, benefactor’ is used of Indra elsewhere on a number of
occasions (e.g., VI.23.9), but it is also used explicitly of a human sūrí- ‘patron’ in
VIII.70.13, as well as being repeated densely in X.107.8–11, the hymn devoted to the
dakṣiṇā and the bhoja-s who give it. So I suggest in our vs. that its appliication to
Indra in c is an attempt to transfer the epithet to the sūri-s in d.

### 22  
The first two pādas begin the enumeration of the Paijavana’s dā́namentioned in c -- an enumeration continued in 23.
The simile in d, hóteva sádma páry emi, is one of the few clear references to
the animal sacrifice, with this depicting the Paryagnikaraṇa; cf. IX.97.1, where the
animals are explicit.

### 23  
On smáddiṣṭi-, see comm. ad III.45.5.
In ab I supply vahanti on the basis of d, with Ge.

### 24  
The śrávas- in pāda a echoes the one in 23d.
Ge, flg. Sāy., takes ab as separate clauses, supplying “(sich ausbreitet)” as the
verb in pāda a. This is unnecessary: the hemistich can be a single clause, with the
accent on vibabhā́jā in b conditioned by the rel. yásya in a. (Ge considers this
possibility in n. 24ab.) Kü (333) also follows the single clause interpr.
Note the lengthened 3rd sg. pf. ending in babhā́jā, guaranteed (and required)
by the cadence. On lengthening of the pf. endings see the brief remarks by Kü (42),
though without any indication of the relative frequency; it is my impression that
lengthening of the 1st/3rd sg. -a is quite rare in the RV, but I haven’t made a count.
The fame being distributed is presumably that of Sudās, though covertly
assimiliated to Indra’s; note the explicit comparison of the praise he receives to
Indra’s in the simile in c. The āmreḍita “every head” (śīrṣṇé-śīrṣṇe) must refer to
every person, or rather every person eligible for fame (excluding women and nonelite males), in Sudās’s entourage: they all get a piece of the fame-pie that he
acquired by himself. The geographical extravagance of “every head between the two
wide world halves” -- that is, every eligible person on earth -- is presumably part of a
totalizing claim about the outcome of the Ten Kings’ Battle, that the whole world
was brought under Sudās’s sway.
14
14
The loud sound of rivers in flood is the point of the comparison in c. One of
the words for ‘river’, nadī́, is folk etymologically (and probably etymologically; see
EWA s.v.) connected with √nad ‘roar’, as in the explicit etymological statement in
AV III.13.1 yád adáḥ saṃprayatī́r áhāv ánadatā haté / tásmād ā́nadyò nā́ma stha
Wh “Since formerly (? adás) going forth together, ye resounded (nad) when the
dragon was slain, therefore ye are streams (nadī́) by name.”
The signature verb ní √śā ‘whet down’ that we have met a number of times
before (see comm. ad vs. 6) now implicitly takes Sudās as its subject, as a sort of
climactic usage.
The PN yudhyāmadhí is obviously a speaking name, with some form of
√yudh ‘fight’ embedded in it. See Old for various possibilites for its formation. It is
tempting to see as its base a 1st pl. middle *yúdhyāmahi “let’s fight,” with the older
expected 1st pl. ending *-madhi before de-occlusion.
## 19

### 1  
Rhetorically interesting to begin a hymn with a syntactically nonindependent verse. This verse consists only of relative clauses (pace Ge; see below),
which find their main clause referent in the first word of the 2nd verse (and indeed
subsequent verses), namely tvám. Although ‘you’ clearly is the referent, the first
relative clause of vs. 1 has a 3rd ps. verb (cyāváyati), though the second one switches
to the 2nd person (prayantā́si). It might be possible to attribute the 3rd ps. in ab to
attraction to the simile, but such a switch would be very rare.
The simile marker ná in pāda a is wrongly placed, after the 2nd member of a
three-word simile, not the first (tigmáśṛṅgo vṛṣabhó ná bhīmáḥ). Ordinarily, given
such a structure, the first word would be interpreted as the common term and
therefore not a part of the simile proper (“sharp-horned like a fearsome bull”), but
Indra doesn’t have horns, which should certainly belong to the bull. The wrong
position may result from the fact that X ná bhīmá-, where X = an animal, appears to
be a formulaic structure, esp. mṛgá- ná bhīmá- (I.154.2, 190.3, II.33.11, etc.; also
siṃhá- ná bhīmá- IV.16.14, IX.97.28 and others). This smaller fixed phrase would
then be fitted into a simile containing another term.
Ge takes pāda d as a main clause, following the Pp., which analyses
prayantā́si as containing unaccented asi. But this requires him to invent a verb for the
relative clause of c (“raubst”) for which there is no support – and no need. Already
Old suggested accenting ási contrary to the Pp.
Old (see also Tichy) also notes the nice example of case disharmony, where
both gen. gáyasya and acc. védaḥ are objects of the agent noun prayantā́. As has
often been noted, suffix-accented -tar-stems generally have genitive complements, as
opposed to root-accented ones, which generally take accusatives. But enough
exceptions exist to allow prayantā́to take both. That gáyasya is parallel to védaḥ and
not to ádāśuṣaḥ is shown by passages like IX.23.3 … ádāśuṣo gáyam and VIII.81.7
ádāśūṣtarasya védaḥ. It is possible, but not necessary, that prayantā́si is a
periphrastic future.
15
15
I have no explanation for the comparative súṣvitara- ‘better soma-presser’,
beyond the occasional use of the comparative for emphasis or intensification, without
comparandum.

### 2  
Pāda b is repeated in IV.38.7, there of Dadhikrā the racehorse. (This
repetition is not noted in Bl RR.) Re at IV.38.7 and Ge here (but not there) take
śúśrūṣamānaḥ as meaning something like “putting oneself at the disposal (of
someone else, here Kutsa).” I assume that they are thinking of the enlarged root
√śruṣ ‘be obedient’, but the two meanings seem quite distinct to me – I can’t see
Indra being obedient to any man – and formally our participle is a well-formed
desiderative to √śru. In both places I take it as meaning “desiring to be heard/famed’;
here Indra also helps out Kutsa, but at least part of his aim is to ensure his own fame.
In IV.38.7 there is no subsidiary beneficiary, and so the focus on the subject and his
fame is ever clearer. Heenen is similarly puzzled by Ge (238 n. 263) but tr. “(toi qui)
en personne as la volonté d’écouter au combat,” attributing an active sense to the
middle participle.
The word dā́sam beginning c plays off both (á)dāśuṣo in 1c and sudā́sam in
3b.

### 3  
Trasadasyu and the Pūrus also appear in IV.38 (vss. 1, 3), which contains
the pāda in common with our 2b.

### 4  
This verse puts into analytic (that is, syntactically independent) form some
expressions met as compounds in the previous verse. Most obvious is (bhū́rīṇi) vṛtrā́
… haṃsi, which realizes vṛtrahátyeṣu in 3d. (Notice that both refer to plural events,
handling their grammatical plurality in different ways.) A real dásyu- is destroyed in
4cd, plucked from the name Trasadasyu in 3c. In a slightly different relationship,
devávītau ‘in pursuit of the gods’ here contains a form of the root √vī ‘pursue’ found
as 1st compound member in vītahavyam ‘whose oblation is worth pursuing’ in 3a.
And within this verse nṛ́bhiḥ doubles the first member of the next word, nṛmano.

### 5  
This verse presents some interlocking syntactic and lexical problems.
Unlike Ge, I take pādas b and c together. Splitting them requires him to supply a verb
for b (“brachst”) again lacking support or necessity. Presumably again he is
following the Pp, which analyzes śatatamā́viveṣīḥ as containing unaccented aviveṣīḥ.
I prefer to accent it and thus allow it to be the verb of the yád clause beginning in b.
In either case śatatamā́is a problem. Everyone wants it to be the 100th thing
(probably púr- ‘fortification’) that Indra destroys (after the 99 in b). Gr suggests
reading śatatamā́m, which would provide the desired feminine accusative (agreeing
with púr-), but among other things would damage the meter (since, s.v. viṣ, he is still
reading an augmented aviveṣīḥ). Ge suggests that it [what is unspecified, presumably
the sandhi agglomeration] is to be dissolved (“aufzulösen”) into masc. śatatamám,
and the 100th thing that Indra destroys is Śambara himself. He makes no mention of
meter, though this dissolution would cause the same metrical problem. Old suggests
16
16
supplying neut. pl. cyautnā́ni (without translating), but I don’t see how an ordinal
“hundredth” can qualify all hundred items in the plural. There is a much simpler
solution: to take śatatamā́as a feminine instrumental with the old ending -ā.
Although Old claims (in arguing against Gr) that the fem. stem should be śatatamī́-,
this is simply wrong. See AiG II.2 §457, which establishes -ā as the rule and -ī as the
rare exception. Cf. for -tama-stems purutámā- of Uṣas and mātŕ̥tamā-, and for
ordinals the well-attested feminine prathamā́-. Or, if Ge is correct that the reference
is to Śambara himself, śatatamā́can be a masculine instr. sg. In either case the text
can stand as it is, with no metrical or sandhi problems, and the syntax can be rescued.
Ge takes nivéśane in c as ‘at evening’. The word generally means ‘causing to
settle down’ (the usual association of -ana-nominals with the transitive-causative
áya-formations) or, as a noun, ‘settling down’, and is sometimes associated with
Savitar’s bringing the world to rest in the evening (IV.53.6, I.35.1, VI.71.2), an
association that must have led to Ge’s tr. But the word never otherwise means
‘evening’. I read it with its full lexical value, but with a sinister edge. “Bringing them
to rest” is a euphemism like ásvāpayaḥ ‘you put to sleep’ in 4d. Old mentions the
“going to rest” possibility, but opts instead for “in the dwelling place (of the enemy).”
Again, there seems to me no reason for this attenuation of the meaning.
The root √viṣ means ‘work, work over’, or here ‘work to the end’, again used
in a slightly euphemistic sense. Note the phonetic echo between nivéśane and
(a)viveṣīr.
The d pāda is a perfect chiasmus, even to the positioning of a conjunction
between verb and object: áhañ ca vṛtrám námucim utā́han. The mixture of ca and utá
is curious. Klein (DGRV I.186–87) is not sure how to analyze it; he suggests either
that it’s a “both … and” type of construction, with each conjunction appearing 2nd in
its phrase (or so I interpr. his lapidary disc.), or that “ca is a sentential conjunction
adjoining d to the rest of the stanza, and utá conjoins the clauses of d.” I prefer the
former.

### 6  
sánā is generally taken (Gr, Ge) as a neut. pl. adj. ‘old’ agreeing with
bhójanāni, and this is certainly possible. I find the sentiment somewhat odd,
however: to announce to Indra that the delights he has given to his client are “old”
seems slighting. I prefer to interpret the word as the 2nd sg. act. impv. to √san ‘win’;
exactly this form occurs several times in initial position elsewhere. What gives me
pause, however, is I.178.4, which contains very parallel phraseology, sánā tā́te indra
návyā ā́guḥ, and where I do interpret sánā as ‘old’. The difference there is that the
poet contrasts the old deeds of Indra with the new ones (návyā) that have come and
so avoids insulting the god. In any case, either the ‘old’ or the ‘win’ interpretation is
possible here, though I have a preference for the latter.
The oblation of Sudās’s that was worth pursuing (vītáhavyam) in vs. 3 has
now been given by him (rātáhavyāya) here, tracking the progress of the sacrifice
to the point of mutual benefit of man and god.
The phrase dāśúṣe sudā́se “for the pious Sudās” displays syllabic metathesis,
dā-śū / su-dā, with neutralizing play on all three sibilants. The poet seems to like this
17
17
collocation: see comment above on vs. 2 for connections across three verses and
below on VII.20.2.

### 7  
My construction of the first hemistich differs from Ge’s, both with regard
to the syntactic role of te and the sense of páriṣṭau and leads to a very different
interpretation of the meaning. The latter word, literally ‘encirclement’, is generally
taken as always negative, a tight spot or constriction (Ge’s “in dieser Klemme”), but
I find this interpretation hard to reconcile with the hic-et-nunc deictic asyā́m, since
the poet has given no indication that he is currently in distress. (Ge’s note suggests
that this is a memory of the situation in VII.18, the Ten Kings battle, but this seems
to me an ill-supported attempt to account for the deictic.) I therefore think the páriṣṭihere is positive – Indra’s encirclement (that is, protection) of us now – and te is to be
construed with páriṣṭau: “in this enclosure (that is, protection) of yours.” Weak
support for this may be provided by the first pāda of the next verse, 8a, where … te
… abhíṣṭau# matches … te … páriṣṭau# here, with rhyming forms and identical
morphology – and a parallel positive sense: “in your charge.” There is also a parallel
in the next hymn, in roughly the same part of the hymn, with te asyā́m as here and a
string of locatives: VII.20.8 … te asyā́m sumataú …várūthe … nṛ́pītau “in this
benevolence of yours, in your defense, in your protection for men.” In our passage
Ge (followed by Scar 207) instead takes te as the subject of the infinitive parādaí; in
order to make this work he has recast the sentence from one with 1st person subject
(mā́… bhūma “may we not be…”) to one with 2nd ps. subject: “Nicht sollst du uns …
dem Bösen preisgaben.” Scar’s tr. maintains the syntactic structure of the original,
but otherwise follows Ge’s interpretation. Better is Keydana’s (Infinitive im Ṛgveda
156, 203) interpretation of parādaí as a passive infinitive, as I take it – though he still
takes te as the ultimate agent of the handing over. Again, I don’t see that the poet has
expressed any fear that Indra will betray them; rather, he hopes that the protection
Indra provides them will keep any such ill-fortune from befalling them, a hope that is
repeated in the next pāda.
The poet’s penchant for case disharmony (see 1cd above) recurs in pāda d,
where I read priyā́saḥ both with gen. táva and with loc. sūríṣu.

### 9  
I take pāda c with ab, since all three have 3rd ps. subjects referring to
Indra’s worshipers and clients, with pāda c a rel. cl. beginning with yé. Ge, by
contrast, connects c with d, although d now refers to the same people in the 1st ps.
(asmā́n vṛṇīṣva “choose us”). He does not, however, take asmā́n as coreferential with
the yé of c, but rather apparently interprets the relationship between the clauses as a
kind of improper relativization: “for the same alliance (yújyāya tásmai) as (those)
who (yé)…” This has the advantage of providing some reason for the final tásmai,
which I find hard to account for, though I find his way of linking the clauses too
tricky. Scar takes the first pāda as a temporal subordinate clause (“As soon as they
are in your charge, the men…”). This is worth considering, although I am dubious
about the subordinating quality of sadyáś cid. In the end, although I am not entirely
18
18
certain of my own way of putting together the various elements in this verse, I have
not been convinced by those of other tr. either.
Note the poet’s playful variation on 8a … te maghavann abhíṣṭau with … té
maghavann abhíṣṭau, where the simple addition of an accent turns the 2nd ps. sg. into
a 3rd ps. pl.
náraḥ śaṃsanti recalls the epithet nárāśáṃsa, and then participates in an
interweaving of two words for ritual speech: śaṃsanti ukthaśāsa ukthā́.
The lexeme ví √dāś occurs only here, as far as I know. Like the idiom ā́√yaj
‘attract by sacrifice’, it combines a directional preverb with a root of ritual activity,
producing a portmanteau “(send) away by perfoming ritual service’. So Old
‘hinweghuldigen’, which he paraphrases as “honor the god such that the Pāṇis
become distant.”
On the syntagm yújyāya √vṝ see comm. ad IX.88.1.

### 10  
We might have expected an unaccented gen. pl. *narām in the voc. phrase
with nṛtama, but don’t get it. There are no unaccented occurrences of this genitive. It
would be possible instead to read narā́m with eté stómāḥ (“these praises of men”),
but nṛ́tama- + gen. pl. of nṛ́- is a fixed phrase, though usually with nṛṇā́m (I.77.4,
III.51.4, IV.25.4, etc.). I am now inclined to read narā́m with both stómā(ḥ) and
nṛtama. It is positioned between them, adjacent to both. The publ. tr. could be
modified to “These praises of men are for you, o most manly of men.” The first gen.
is subjective. Note the co-occurrence of narā́m, the older gen. pl. to nṛ́-, and the
newer one nṛṇā́m in this verse.
Ge takes b as an independent nominal clause, while I consider it a sort of
definitional relative clause manqué, that is, lacking the relative pronoun yé which
would find its referent in the initial téṣām of c.
Although d looks to contain a simple conjoined NP, each of whose members
consists of two members, sákhā śū́raḥ and avitā́nṛṇā́m, each with a ca between the
two members (so Ge, JSK I.195), I prefer to take śū́raḥ as the principal predication
of Indra, with the other two terms, sákhā and avitā́nṛṇā́m, secondarily predicated of
Indra as śū́ra-. Although this introduces a minor complication in word order, the fact
that śū́ra- is overwhelmingly a noun and is used independently of Indra in the very
next pāda (11a) persuades me that this analysis is correct, especially since both
“comrade” and “helper of men” are terms that explicitly encode Indra’s relationship
to men, while “champion” is of a different order. The distribution of ca’s makes no
problems for this analysis.

### 11  
The finals of pādas a and c echo each other: … ūtī́# … úpa stī́n #
I think it quite likely that mimihy out of sandhi should be accented (mimihí)
contra the Pp., given the balanced clausal-type constructions before and after (úpa no
vā́jān … úpa stī́n), a possibility Old raises but considers uncertain.

This hymn shows some stylistic tics, esp. a penchant for oddly placed particles
(vss. 2, 4, 5) and for final enclitics (1d, 7d, 8b, 9a, 9d, as well as the refrain 10d).

### 1  
A grammatical figure in the pāda-initial reduplicated i-stems, b cákriḥ, c
jágmiḥ, both functioning as verbs (cákriḥ takes acc. direct object ápaḥ; jágmiḥ an acc.
goal nṛṣádanam). For this type see Grestenberger 2013 (JAOS 133).
ápo náryaḥ is reminiscent of ápāṃsi … náryāṇi in the next hymn (VII.21.4),
though there the words form a phrase and here they are in two different cases and
numbers.

### 2  
Continuing the focus on nominal forms with verbal rection, the poet picks
up the pāda-initial agent noun trātā́of 1d and deploys three more pāda-initial
nominative tar-stems in 2a, c, d: hántā, kártā, and dā́tā, each with an acc. object
(vṛtrám, ulokám, and vásu respectively). Although pāda b lacks a subject tar-stem, it
does have one as object: jaritā́ram. The stem that began it all, trātā́in 1d, contrasts
with those in vs. 2 by being suffix-accented, and it should therefore, according to
general practice, have a genitive complement. I suggest that it’s not an accident that
its object is the enclitic naḥ, which could be accusative (and thus parallel with the
objects in vs. 2) or genitive (and thus conform to the usual rule). Recall this poet’s
tricky case syntax with the tar-stem prayantā́in VII.19.1.
The occurrence of parallel datives sudā́se (c) and dāśúṣe (d) recall their
collocation in VII.19.6; see comments there.
The phrase áha vaí (áha vā́in sandhi) interrupting the VP is very peculiar. It is
easier to account for the vaí than the áha: the particle vaí, rather rare in the RV though
very common in Vedic prose, is often found directly before the particle u. In this
hymn it occurs twice (also 4d), in both cases before u, though not the particle u. Here
before ulokám, which by most accounts is a haplology of *urú [*ulú] lokám, and in 4d
before the perfect uvoca. I have no explanation for áha, whose function is also opaque
to me in general. Although áha often takes Wackernagel (or modified Wackernagel)
position, it is more flexibly positioned than most RVic particles, so showing up in the
middle of the pāda as here is not as anomalous as it might be. My exclamatory tr. is
meant to signal the interruptive quality of the phrase, but makes no claims as to its
semantic accuracy. I suspect that the poet is indulging in phonological play (one faint
possibility: áha vā́u mimics the opening of the next pāda, dā́tā vásu) or
morphological or lexical manipulation, but it’s too deep for me.

### 3  
khaja- lacks an etymology (see EWA s.v. khaja-kṛ́t-), but embedded in an
epithet of Indra in martial contexts like this, ‘tumult’ serves as well as anything else.
The particle īm here lacks its usual accusative function (see Jamison 2002) and
does not take its usual Wackernagel position; it therefore reminds us a bit of the
similarly irrational áha vaí of the preceding verse. However, īm does serve to forestall
a hiatus between janúṣā and áṣaḷḥaḥ and its position immediately after the former can
be taken to signal that janúṣā áṣaḷḥaḥ are to be construed together. For another
example of janúṣem see the next hymn (VII.21.1).
20
20
Note the sibiliant play beginning with samádvā and continuing through the end
of the hemistich.

### 4  
Again the poet plays with case disharmony, construing both inst. ándhasā
and loc. mádeṣu with uvoca.
Note again the apparently functionless vaí and see disc. above ad vs. 2.

### 5  
Once again a particle is positioned oddly: ádha in the middle of the relative
clause (versus properly positioned ádhā in 3d). Klein (II.130) suggests the ádha here
“is either a subclausal conjunction [but conjoining what? sj] or weakly conjoins the
second distich with the first,” but neither explanation accounts for the mid-pāda
position.

### 6  
The final pāda has two linked uncertainties: the identity of the verb and the
case form of rāyá. Though the Pp. reads dat. rāyé, gen.-abl. rā́yaḥ is equally possible.
The choice depends in great part on the analysis of the verb kṣáyat: whether it
belongs to √kṣi ‘dwell’ or √kṣi ‘rule’. If the former, it would be a subjunctive; if the
latter, an injunctive. The immediate context favors a subjunctive (dádhate in the rel.
clause attached to this main clause, plus bhreṣate [on this form as an s-aor. subj. to
√bhrī, see EWA s.v. bhrī, with ref. to Hoffmann], reṣat probably, and āvívāsāt in ab),
but this does not necessarily decide for an affiliation to ‘dwell’, because there are no
overt subjunctives to the Class I present of ‘rule over’ (no *kṣáyāt) and the injunctive
might function modally here. Parallel passages cut both ways. On the one hand, ‘rule’
regularly takes the gen. of ‘wealth’: cf. I.51.14 (of Indra) rāyáḥ kṣayati, VII.93.2
kṣáyantau rāyáḥ (Indra and Agni), X.106.7 kṣayad rayīṇā́m (though in an otherwise
incomprehensible verse); on the other, a form of ‘dwell’ appears in a parallel passage
with the material from the end of the pāda: VI.3.1 … sá kṣesad rtap ̥ ā́r̥tejā́ḥ. Old,
having considered both possibilities, opts (slightly) for the latter; Ge’s tr. also
assumes an affiliation with ‘dwell’ and a dat. rāyé: “der wird im Frieden lassen, um
zu Reichtum (zu gelangen).” The publ. tr. instead chooses ‘rule over’ and gen. rāyáḥ,
though I recognize that both possibilities were probably in the poet’s mind. One
slender support for my choice may be the parallel phrase in 9d … vásva ā́śakaḥ…
“you hold power over goods,” with gen. vásvaḥ reprising the gen. rāyáḥ that opens
9c.

### 7  
By my interpr. (and Ge’s) śíkṣan is a predicated pres. participle, parallel to
the subjunctive áyat in the 2nd clause; it seems to have adopted the modal sense of
this parallel finite verb.
Note the play between the two initial words of pādas a and b: yád and áyad
(áyaj in sandhi), where the second is actually a subjunctive to the root present of √i
‘go’.
The question in c is not overtly marked, but I follow both Old and Ge in
taking it as such.
21
21

### 8  
ághnataḥ is a gen. sg. negated act. pres. part. modifying te ‘of you’ in the
preceding pāda; the heavy modal tr. is a concession to English.

### 9  
stāmú- is a hapax and there is no agreed upon etymology or interpretation.
Gr takes it as belonging to √stan ‘thunder’ and meaning something like ‘sighing’
(with no explanation of the semantic distance), and he is followed implicitly by
Oberlies (II.210). KEWA also registers this idea, but in EWA it seems to have been
abandoned, without anything to replace it. Ge, on the other hand, connects it to the
root √stā ‘steal’, a suggestion I find very appealing. However, his further
interpretation does not seem compelling: “und verstohlen hat (der Sänger) geklagt.”
The structure of the hemistich, with two clauses joined by utá, each with a verb of
noisemaking, whose subject in the first clause is an animal, suggests that an animal
should be the subject of the second as well. I therefore suggest that stāmú- means
‘thieving’ and it is a well-known characteristic of some animal or other. I suggest
‘monkey’: monkeys are of course well known for thievery and Vṛṣākapi, Indra’s
monkey pal in X.86, steals “the goodies of the Arya” (X.86.1). Monkeys are also
know for their sharp cries. The presence of vṛ́ṣā (recalling Vṛṣākapi) in pāda a may
support this idea, but of course all of this is very tentative, and in particular I have no
explanation for why configuring his praise as a screeching monkey would please
Indra (unless, again, to remind him of his friend Vṛṣākapi). An alternative animal
possibility is the magpie, which has a reputation at least in the West as a thief (cf.
Rossini’s opera “The Thieving Magpie” [La gazza ladra]), although the internet tells
me that this reputation is undeserved. There are species of magpies in northern India
and they do make sharp cries.
While it is impossible to be certain about the meaning and etymology of the
hapax, as often with hapaxes and other rare words it is possible to suggest reasons
why it appears in just this passage. Its position in its pāda is identical to that of stómo
in the preceding pāda, and it echoes that word phonologically. In fact, the
phonological play is quite subtle: underlyingly stoma = s t a u m a, and stāmu = s t a
a m u, with the vowels around the m simply reversed.
The old idea that stāmú- is cognate to Grk. στωμυλός ‘talkative, loquacious’
was revived with considerable discussion by Ch. de Lamberterie (Les adjectifs grecs
en -υς, 1990: 704–14 [esp. 704–5]) and recently considered anew and more or less
dismissed as impossible to demonstrate by Brent Vine (“Greek στωμυλός ‘chatty’,”
Indo-European Linguistics 7 [2019]). Although the coincidence of form and possible
semantics is suggestive, I think it unlikely that an entirely isolated stāmú- (no root,
no related nominal forms) would have been preserved in this sense from hoary
antiquity, and although it might have inhabited a lower register and therefore
generally not surface in “high” Vedic, I know of no possible MIA correspondents.
Furthermore, the anagramatic word play noted above makes it more likely that the
word is semi-artificial, though based on attested material -- hence my favoring of the
√stā ‘steal’ connection.
The return of the singer (jaritár-) in the last two verses of this hymn (9c, 10c)
forms a faint ring with his appearance in 2b.

### 1  
Some recycling and recombination from the last hymn: janúṣem uvoca
combines janúṣem (20.3b) and uvoca (20.4d), each in its metrical position, and
ándhaso mádeṣu echoes ándhasā mádeṣu of 20.4d.
devám appears to be one of the few adjectival forms of the stem, modifying
neut. ándhaḥ. Although I would like to reduce the number of these supposed
adjectival forms to zero, it is difficult to see what else to do with it here.

### 2  
In the -áya-book (Jamison 1983: 50), I take vipáyanti as intransitive, in
keeping with its vocalism, supplying a form of √sad, which is extraordinarily
common with barhís-: “(Sitting on) the barhis, they become inspired.” However, the
publ. tr. takes vipáyanti as transitive, despite the vocalism, both to avoid supplying
extraneous matter and because I did not think the pressing stones that are the verb’s
unexpressed subj. should sit on the barhis. I failed to note that in V.31.12, adduced
by Ge, the pressing stone “will be brought down to the vedi” (áva védim bhriyāte).
Since the vedi is where the barhis is strewn, the passage seems to put the stone in a
position actually to “sit on the barhis.” See also VIII.27.1 agnír ukthé puróhito
grā́vāṇo barhír adhvaré “Agni has been set in front while the solemn speech (is
being recited), as have the pressing stones and the ritual grass while the ceremony (is
going forth),” which has the stones and the barhis set out together, and III.42.2,
which describes soma as barhiṣṭhā́ṃ grā́vabhiḥ sutám “stationed on the ritual grass,
pressed by stones.” The transitive interpr. found in the publ. tr. has the merit of not
requiring an extra verb to be supplied, but what ritual event it might depict is unclear.
I suppose that the vigorous activity that pressing required would make the material
on which the pressing apparatus was placed (presumably the barhis) tremble. But I
now tentatively favor my old 1983 intransitive interpr., which takes better account of
the vocalism. Moreover, since what is most often emphasized about the pressing
stones is the noise they make, “become inspired” (like vípras ‘inspired poets’) would
express this well-known characteristic of theirs. Note in the next hymn, VII.22.4ab,
where the call of the pressing stone (hávam … ádreḥ) is parallel to the thought of the
inspired poet (víprasya … manīṣā́m). Indeed in that passage the vípra might refer to
the pressing stone itself. On the vedi as the place where the soma pressing apparatus
is placed, see Oberlies, Der Rigveda und seine Religion, 254.
Ge takes gṛbhā́d ā́as “bis zur Handhabung,” but in that use of the ablative
with ā́(“all the way to”) the noun follows the ā́(see Gr s.v. ā́). Better to interpret it
as a standard ablative expressing the place/person from which the pressing stones are
being brought to the ritual ground for use (so, e.g., Scar 591). Old argues
persuasively that gṛbhá- is an agent noun. For √grabh with the pressing stones, see
grāva-grābhá- (I.162.5), the title of a functionary, “Handler of the Pressing Stones.”
dūráüpabdaḥ must be nominative plural, so, although the stem is universally
(Gr, EWA, AiG II.2.75) given as thematic, this form (versus upabdaíḥ VII.104.17)
23
23
must belong to a root noun. Gr suggests instead reading -upabdās, an emendation
Old rejects as unnecessary without commenting on the stem.

### 4  
Ge supplies a second, accusative, form of ā́yudha- as object of viveṣa and
supplies “enemies” as the referent of eṣām ‘of them’, while making the accusative
phrase in b the object of vidvā́n ‘knowing’: “Der Fürchtbare hat mit den Waffen ihre
(Waffen) abgetan, der aller mannhaften Werke kundig ist.” But there are several
reasons to reject this interpretation in addition to the necessity of supplying a
significant word. The root √viṣ ‘labor, bring to fulfillment’ does not mean ‘abtun’
(dismiss, brush aside). Moreover it regularly takes ápas- ‘work’, a form of which
appears in pāda b, as object; see esp. IV.19.10 ápāṃsi ... náryā́viveṣīḥ. By contrast,
the participle vidvā́n is usually used absolutely, without object. As for the referent of
eṣām it would of course possible to supply “enemies,” although they are not
mentioned previously in the hymn: the only preceding masc. or neut. plurals are the
pressing stones (subject of the whole of vs. 2), the “finely made (fortifications)” of
3d, and, in a simile, the charioteers in 3c. Because the pressing stones are
extravagantly celebrated in vs. 2 and called Indra’s “companions,” I think it likely
that they are the referents here: the soma they produce is their weapon, and this soma
fuels Indra’s labors. This is also Caland-Henry’s solution (L’Agniṣṭoma, p. 285 and n.
3).
I supply “fortifications” (púraḥ) from c as the obj. of jaghāna in d. It is
possible that we are meant to think instead (or in addition) of the archetypal obj. of
this verb, the serpent Vṛtra, who is concealed in the instr. (m)ahi(nā́) directly before
the verb. Cf. áhinā in 3b.
The first word of the verse, bhīmáḥ, picks up the last word of vs. 3, bhīṣā́.

### 5  
A verse with several rare words. The neut. pl. vándanā in b is unclear; the
neut. sg. vándanam in VII.50.2 appears to be some medical condition, and in AV

### 2  
it refers to some sort of negatively viewed plant (a parasitic plant, acdg. to
Gr; see also EWA s.v.), neither of which is helpful here. I think it better to start with
the root √vand ‘praise, extol’ and give it a negative twist appropriate to the context,
hence my ‘sycophant’: praise gone wrong. A similar negative interpretation is
needed for the usually positive term vedyā́- in the same phrase. Why vándanā is
neuter and not masculine isn’t clear to me; perhaps a better tr. would be “sycophancy,
sycophantic (words).” With sorcerers and flatterers in this first hemistich we then
have two different ways in which rtḁ́ can be undermined within our own community,
while the arí- ‘stranger’ whose ways are contrary to ours and the phallusworshippers in the second hemistich represent external threats to ṛtá-.
In c víṣuṇa- ordinarily means ‘variable, various’, which here shades into
‘variant’ and, with the negative reading prevailing in this verse, ‘contrary’.
The lexeme ápi √gā occurs in the RV only here, but ápi √gam can have a
sexual sense (“inire feminam” as Gr chastely phrases it), and that image would be
appropriate here, given the grammatical subject.
24
24

### 6  
I take the injunc. bhūḥ in the first pāda as imperatival, although Ge’s
preterital value is also possible.
The particle ádha is once again oddly positioned; cf. VII.20.5. In this case,
however, it seems a mistake for (or a play on?) ádhi, which regularly appears with
locatives (esp. cosmological locatives) in just this metrical position – including a
number of times with the phonological variant of the endingless loc. jmán here,
namely the i-loc. kṣámi: … ádhi kṣámi# (5x, e.g., I.25.18). See also nearby pādainitial ádhi kṣámi in VII.27.3b.
Pāda b contains one of the standardly cited examples of neut. pl. subject with
singular verb: … vivyak … rájāṃsi.
The verb in d, vividat, is morphologically slightly problematic. Following Gr I
interpret it as a subjunctive to the act. pf. of √vid ‘find’, but we ought then to have
full-gr. root syllable *vivedat. Kü (493) takes it as an injunctive “in komprehensivem
Gebrauch,” but the perfect injunctive ought not to be thematic, but rather *vivet (like
vivyak in b). In the end I take it as a wrongly formed subjunctive.
Ge. construes the enclitic te with ántam: “… dein Ende finden,” but the
enclitic seems wrongly positioned for this interpretation (insofar as we understand
the positioning of adnominal enclitics – but see te asuryā̀ya in 7a), and at least one
parallel passage suggests that it is the end of his śávas- that is at issue: I.100.15 ná …
śávaso ántam āpuḥ.

### 7  
Note the juxtaposition of the gods (devā́ḥ) and Indra’s “lordship”
(asuryā̀ya).
For the meaning of the idiom ánu √mā, see Kü (279). It parallels the
concessive sense of ánu √dā ‘concede’ and ánu √dhā ‘id.’
### 8–9
Final varūtā́of 8d is matched by final tarutra in 9b.

### 8  
The “man like you” (tvā́vataḥ) is the human patron because he, too,
distributes largesse. So also Ge (n. 8d).

### 9  
vanvántu ‘let them combat’ and vanúṣām ‘rapacious ones’ are presumably
derived from the originally separate roots van ‘win, vanquish’ and vani ‘love, desire’,
but since these roots have become synchronically entangled, the pair presents itself
like an etymological figure, like I.132.1=VIII.40.7 vanuyā́ma vanuṣyátaḥ “may we
win against those who seek to win.”

### 10  
This verse is identical to the final verse of the last hymn (VII.20.10), but
in this case maghávāno junánti “the bounteous ones incite (us)” is the positive
equivalent of the negative ná … jūjuvur naḥ “They do not incite us” in vs. 5, where
the internal enemies served as subject.

### 2  
I tr. ásti as an existential (“exists to be yoked”) rather than simply a copula
with the predicated gerundive yújyaḥ (“is to be yoked”) because the 3rd sg. pres. of
√as is almost always an existential, given that the copula is almost always gapped.
However, this may be too emphatic a tr., and it is the case that a surface copula is
more likely to be found in subordinate clauses than main clauses. See Jamison 1990
(“Tense of the Predicated Past Participle …,” IIJ 33: 1–19) pp. 4-–5. The gerundive +
asi in 7c (hávyaḥ … asi “you are to be invoked”) supports a simple copula interpr.
here.

### 3  
The position of ā́in the middle of the NP vā́cam … imā́m is worth noting.
Gr takes it as a preverb with bódhā, but √budh does not otherwise occur with ā́, and
its position would not be normal for a preverb in tmesis. Note also that bódhā +
SPEECH is found in the next vs. (bódhā … manīṣā́m) and in the preceding hymn
(VII.21.1d bódhā … stómam), both times without preverb. I am tempted to assume
that the poet inserted an unnecessary adverbial ā́‘here’ to produce a proper cadence.
Pāda-final vā́cam émā́m is also found in IX.97.13, a verse attributed to Upamanyu
Vāsiṣṭha, again without obvious function.

### 4  
The lexeme ví √pā in later Vedic is regularly found in specialized sense in
the Sautrāmaṇī ritual, and there it refers to the feat of separating the surā from the
other liquid (milk or soma). This sense and context are already found in the late RVic
hymn X.131.4 in the med. part. vipipānā́. See Old ad loc. (and NGGW 1893, 348–
49). Though it has been suggested that this usage belongs to a separate root √pā ‘go’
(see, e.g., EWA s.v. PĀ3
), this seems unnecessary and somewhat perverse. Although
the other ví √pā passages (all medial) don't have a Sautrāmaṇī association, I think
they (or most of them) belong to this same lexeme, though Old is less certain. Here
the stones are separating the soma juice from the stalk. In IV.16.3 the pressing stone
is also the subj., and there is a pressing stone association in III.53.10. However,
I.112.15 is more enigmatic. The subj. there is an ant (or someone called “ant”),
vamrá-, and the vignette occupies half a pāda in a list of the Aśvins’ helpful deeds.
For further on that passage, see disc. ad loc.

### 5  
A nice example of the potential iterative-repetitive value of a reduplicated
present (vivakmi) reinforced by an adverb (sádā ‘always’).

### 7  
The first pāda could also be another obj. of kṛṇomi in b.

### 8  
Ge seems to take the participle mányamānasya as a functional reflexive
‘think oneself to be’, with the added sense of self-conceit (“der du dir darauf etwas
einbildest”). Although I would certainly not ascribe to Indra excessive modesty, in
this context, where the poet is emphasizing the poets’ inability to capture all of
Indra’s greatness, I think it unlikely that he is focusing on Indra’s egotism. I instead
take the participle in a passive sense ‘be thought to be’, as sometimes elsewhere –
pace Kulikov (339–40), who follows Gotō.
26
26
### 8–9
The subject of the verb in 8b, úd aśnuvanti, is not specified. In my view
the subject is postponed to 9ab: neither the older nor the younger poets are capable of
expressing all of Indra’s powers in their formulations. Although this interpretation
requires enjambment over a verse boundary, the main clause in 9c to which 9ab is
supposedly subordinate has no appropriate referent for the relative pronoun (asmé
works awkwardly at best), whereas 9ab neatly completes the thought of vs. 8.

The publ. tr. interpr. asmé as a dat. But the parallel in IV.10.8 śivā́naḥ
sakhyā́sántu ... devéṣu yuṣmé, where the -mé pronominal form is anchored as a loc.
by devéṣu, makes a loc. reading more likely. Cf. also VI.18.5 tán naḥ pratnáṃ
sakhyám astu yuṣmé. I would therefore change the tr. to “Let there be friendly
fellowship of you among [or, with] us.”

I follow Ge in taking upaśrotā́as a periphrastic future (contra Tichy, 189,
364).

### 2  
Note the echoes at the beginning and end of the first pāda: áyāmi …
(dev)ájāmi(r). As often, the local patterns created by the use of hapaxes (as devájāmiis in the RV) may help account for their deployment.
I don’t understand Ge’s rendering of pāda b, where he seems to take singular
ghóṣa(ḥ) of pāda a as the implied subject of plural irajyánta. I take the verb as a
contrastive passive/reflexive to the otherwise active stem, more or less following
Old’s interpretation, with śurúdhaḥ as subject.
The root noun cmpd vívāc- echoes the redupl. pres. vivakmi in the preceding
hymn, VII.22.5, though of course the vi’s have nothing to do with each, being the
preverb and the reduplicating syllable respectively.

### 4  
‘Teams’ (niyút-) often appear in context with Vāyu and his driving. Often,
of course, they are his teams, but here and frequently elsewhere the ‘teams’ clearly
stand for our poetic thoughts. Cf., e.g., I.135.2, VI.47.14, X.26.1. Therefore, it is
unnecessary to supply, with Ge, a verb of guiding or yoking to make the teams into
Vāyu’s.
The instr. dhībhíḥ is taken in the publ. tr. as an instr. of accompaniment, but it
could also be an instr. of price/exchange: “in exchange for (our) visionary thoughts.”

### 5  
The syntactic frame of dáyase here is wrong: it ordinarily takes an
accusative of the material distributed and a dative of recipient on the rare occasions
on which the recipient is made explicit. A clear example is found in the preceding
verse, 4d … dáyase ví vā́jān, also nearby VII.21.7 maghā́ni dayate. The position of hí
is also anomalous, though note that it exactly replicates the position of ví in the
phrase in the preceding verse just cited and may well owe its position to this rhyme.
27
27
Despite the syntactic aberrancy I think that mártān must represent the recipient, and
the parallelism of the dáyase phrases in the adjacent verses has imposed the
accusative recipient. (There is also an apparent double accusative, of goods and
recipient, in one other passage: VI.37.4 maghā́… dáyase ví sūrī́n “you apportion
bounties to our patrons.”)
## 24
Indra

### 1  
The conjoined phrase avitā́vṛdhé ca is not syntactically parallel in the strict
sense, but both the agent noun avitár- and the purpose dative vṛdhé are properly
construed with the 2nd sg. copula, subjunctive ásaḥ. For the latter, cf., e.g., I.89.5 …
yáthā … ásad vṛdhé, and for the cooccurrence of the two terms VI.33.4 … avitā́
vṛdhé bhūḥ.

### 2  
The striking expression “your mind … has been captured” presumably
indicates that our successful preparations for the ritual have forcibly brought Indra to
the soma sacrifice, with the implication that he is prevented from going to the
sacrifices of others.
In pāda a dvibárhāḥ appears to be a masc. nom. sg., though I take it (as Ge
does) as modifying neut. mánaḥ. Gr, by contrast, suggests that it belongs with masc.
sutáḥ sómaḥ in the following pāda. Although Gr’s solution might seem to be
grammatically more satisfactory, on several occasions dvibárhā(ḥ) does seem to
modify a neut.: I.114.10, VII.8.6, possibly IV.5.3, and AIG III.288 allows neut. sg. to
-as-stem adj. in -āḥ. In most instances, as here, the -āḥ is pāda-final, and so the long
vowel isn't metrically guaranteed.
Gotō (1stCl., 226 n. 483) interprets bharate in c not as a passive (with Gr, Ge,
and me; also H-P Schmidt, Fs. Nyberg), but as a self-involved middle: “Lobpreisung,
deren Milchstrom losgelassen ist, bringt [ihre Milch] dar,” on the basis of his
principle that medial Class I presents cannot be used passively. But in my opinion at
least, this principle cannot be maintained in general, and certainly in this context,
with passive expressions dominating the first hemistich, a passive reading is most
natural and the image of the praise hymn bringing its own milk borders on the comic.
With others I take pāda d as an extension of c, with iyám … manīṣā́an
appositive to suvṛktíḥ. However, it would be possible to take it independently: “this
inspired thought is constantly invoking Indra,” since, though fairly rare, predicated
present participles do exist, and the short staccato clauses of the earlier part of the
hymn may invite an independent reading here.

### 3  
Despite its position, tavásam should not modify āṅgūṣám, though that is
grammatically possible, but tvā, since the adjective is a regular epithet of Indra.

### 4  
The intens. part. várīvṛjat can only be intransitive here, as there is nothing
overt or latent that could serve as object (so also Ge “zu uns einbiegend,” Schaeffer
[191] “immer wieder (zu uns) einbiegend” -- though with a different nuance from my
28
28
tr.). However, forms to the root √vṛj ‘twist’ are otherwise always transitive,
including the other ex. of the intens. part. (VI.58.2). I do not have an explanation.

### 5  
Uncompounded vṛddhied vā́h- to √vah ‘convey’ is attested only here, but it
is common in compounds, e.g., indra-vā́h- (4x). See Scar (473-80; for the grade of
the root, esp. 479).
The two different simile markers in b (iva … ná) may be highlighting two
different aspects of the complex simile.
The genitive of goods with √īḍ ‘invoke’ is somewhat aberrant. Although for
this root Gr allows acc., dat., or gen. of the material desired, the only other genitive
passage he cites is VIII.31.14, where the genitive is otherwise to be construed.
However, there seems nothing else to do with vásūnām, and the construction is
reminiscent of nearby VII.32.5 ... śrútkarṇa īyate vásūnām “he of listening ears is
implored for goods.” Moreover, in X.20.2 agním īḷe bhujā́m, the gen. pl. bhujā́m is
best interpr. this way (“I invoke Agni for delights”), contra the standard interpr.
Alternatively we could assume the gapping of a noun like sambháraṇam ‘assemblage’
as in the next hymn, VII.25.2d sambháraṇaṃ vásūnām, but this seems less likely.
In d the śrómatam is presumably the ‘hearing” that gods extend to men’s
hymns. See VII.32.5 just cited for a similar sentiment.
The simile divī̀va dyā́m is opaque to me. Ge tr. “Wie Tag auf Tag,” but neither
of these case forms of div-/dyu- is used temporally, but only spatially of ‘heaven’.
Placing “heaven upon heaven” must refer to Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, but the
connection with Indra’s activity in the frame is vague. Old believes that setting
heaven on heaven means that Indra is fixing heaven in its proper place.

### 6  
For pūrdhi see EWA s.v. PARIī2 ‘give’.
## 25
Indra

### 1  
Although mahá(ḥ) in the first pāda is a genitive, I have tr. it in the vocative
phrase to avoid the awkward “(Be) here with the help of you, the great one, o strong
Indra.”
Ge supplies ‘mind’ from d as the subject of the first pāda, but this seems
unnecessary.
I take pāda c as a clause parallel to b, with the yád in b having domain over
both, hence accented pátāti in c. By contrast, Ge (see also Old) takes it as a
circumstantial clause dependent on d and supplies “(Wenn).” This is certainly
possible, but my solution seems simpler.
The threatened possibility of Indra’s wandering mind may account for the
capturing of his mind in the previous hymn, VII.24.2.

### 4  
The prohibitive clause ná mardhīḥ is of course grammatically incorrect.
We expect mā́with the injunctive in prohibitives, and in fact find it with this same
stem several times: mā́no mardhīḥ IV.20.10, mā́no mardhiṣṭam VII.73.4, 74.3,
29
29
always with the 1st pl. enclitic following the mā́. Non-prohibitive forms of √mṛdh
almost always occur with the negative ná, e.g., ná mardhanti (I.166.2, III.54.14);
there are no positive attestations of this verb. Our passage must be an odd conflation
of the prohibitive passages with enclitic no and the non-prohibitive passages with
negative ná. Or alternatively, and in my opinion less likely, this is a non-prohibitive
use of the injunctive: “you do/did not neglect.” That, however, is Hoffmann’s
solution (Injunk., 101), taking it “als allgemeine Eigenschaft” of Indra’s: “du lässt
nicht im Stich.” See his discussion, where he also points out that that *mā́mardhīḥ
would be metrically bad.

### 5  
The opening of my tr. of this verse is meant to capture the odd order of
noun and demonstrative, kútsā eté …
With Ge I supply a form of √ṛc ‘chant’ as the main verb of the first hemistich,
since this verb takes śūṣám as object in a number of passages (e.g., I.9.10, X.96.2).
Cf. nearby VII.23.6 vásiṣṭhāso abhí arcanty arkaíḥ, with the nom. pl. subj. of a group
of contemporary singers and the verb √ṛc in the last vs. of the hymn (VII.25.6 is
repeated from VII.24.6).
## 26
Indra

### 1  
nṛvát in d may, as frequently, be adverbial (“I manfully beget…”) or, as in
the publ. tr., a neuter acc. sg. modifying ukthám.

### 3  
On ní √mṛj see comm. ad II.38.3. The idiomatic sense ‘drag down
forcefully’ (as in I.140.2, where Agni drags down trees like an elephant) allows the
idiom to develop a sense not only of coercion (on the part of the agent) but of
submission (on the part of the object), which is probably responsible for its use of a
husband’s action towards his wives.
The use of sárva- rather than víśva- for ‘all’ may be a sign of lateness.

### 4  
The utá of pāda a is echoed by ūtáyo in c, which in turn is picked up by
ūtáye in 5a.
Pāda b opens with ékaḥ ‘one, single’ and c ends with pūrvī́ḥ ‘many’, a
contrast that appears to be hightlighted.
The verb saścata in d is morphologically ambiguous. My publ. tr. follows Ge
in rendering it as a modal (Ge “… sollen … zufallen,” SWJ “will be companions”).
Ge does not, however, comment on the form. Gr identifies it as a 3rd pl. to an
athematic redupl. stem saśc-; since this stem precedes and is distinct from his
“schwaches Perf. saśc-,” he must consider it a redupl. pres., as Whitney and
Macdonell (VGS) do; Hoffmann (Injunc. 260) likewise calls our form an injunctive.
A 3rd pl. mid. injunc. is certainly possible here, but if we wish to maintain the modal
value (which, in fact, is not actually necessary), the injunctive is a small
embarrassment, since modal value is fairly rare, and generally limited to particular
forms like dhā́s for the injunctive. An alternative would be to take it as a 3rd singular 
30
30
subjunctive, possibly built to the perfect stem. The neut. pl. bhadrā́ṇi … priyā́ṇi
could serve as subject to the singular verb in the well-known inherited construction,
though it is not overwhelmingly common in the RV. Of course, we would far prefer
a primary -te ending for the middle subj., but I do not think secondary -ta is
impossible. Alternatively, with an analysis as 3rd plural injunctive, the tr. could be
changed to “… are companions to us.”
## 27
Indra

### 2  
The relative clause in the first pāda has no overt referent in the main clause
of b, but I supply an instr. téna (see also Ge’s n.; his first alternative, to supply tám, is
less attractive because śikṣa- doesn’t ordinarily take an acc.).
I interpret c as containing an implicit pun. The form vícetā(ḥ), masc. nom. sg.
of vícetas-, derived from the root √cit ‘perceive’, means ‘discriminating’, hence my
‘tell things apart’, and is regularly applied to Indra (and other gods). But this leaves
dṛḷhā́with no verb to govern it. (It cannot be object of ápa vṛdhi in d, because the hí
in c should trigger verbal accent.) I suggest that vícetā (in sandhi) might also be
secondarily construed as the agent noun of ví √ci ‘pile apart, pull apart’, governing
dṛḷhā́. Of course we would expect the Saṃhitā text to show coalescence of the final
vowel of the agent noun and the initial vowel of the next pāda, but the recitational
text would not reflect that. Although most agent nouns compounded with preverbs
take suffix accent, compare nícetar- (I.184.2) to a different root √ci ‘perceive’. If
this suggestion seems too radical, it would also be possible to detach the preverb ví
from vícetā(ḥ) and supply a form of √vṛ ‘cover’ (found in ápa vṛdhi in d), producing
the familiar lexeme ví √vṛ ‘uncover’.

### 3  
The cid in d is somewhat surprising: cid generally means ‘even’, but “even
when praised” (úpastutaś cid) is the opposite of what we should expect. Both Ge and
I have avoided this problem by tr. cid almost as a subordinator or at least a
circumstantial (Ge “zumal da …,” SWJ “just when”). I now wonder if it expresses
anticipatory polarity with nū́cid in the following pāda (4a). Since nū́cid means
‘never’, cid in 3d could mean ‘always’.

### 4  
Note the rhyming pāda-final … (sáh)ūtī (a), … ūtī́(b).
In b Ge takes dānáḥ as gen. sg. of dāmán-, dependent on vā́jam: “… den Lohn
der Gabe.” This is possible, though it would be more natural to have vā́jam as object
of some form of √dā (esp. given the parallel he cites, VI.45.23 dānám vā́jasya, with
vā́jasya dependent on dānám). I therefore prefer to take dānáḥ as the ablative
singular of the mán-stem, with verbal rection, or, possibly (but somewhat farfetched)
the nom. sg. of an otherwise unattested medial root aorist participle of √dā.
The combination of abhí with √vī ‘pursue’ would occur only here in the RV
(and the other saṃhitās); Ge renders it as ‘willkommen’. I suggest that it belongs
rather to √vyā ‘envelop’ and continues the theme of confinement found in 1d and 2d.
The idea here is that the cow was once enwrapped or enclosed but freed by Indra to
31
31
swell for us. It is possible that abhívītā is actually a pun on both those roots, and the
tr. should reflect this ambiguity: “… gift-cow swells …, (previously) enclosed, (now
to be) pursued by his comrades,” vel sim. The presence of vyántaḥ ‘pursuing’ in 5c
supports this possibility.
## 28
Indra

### 1  
The 2nd hemistich begins and ends with a form of víśva- ‘all’: #víśve …
viśvam(-inva)#.

### 2  
Pāda a continues the theme of competitive invocations embodied in the
lexeme ví √hvā in 1c vihávanta with hávam … ví, even though the two words are not
to be construed together.
“Your greatness” as an agent may seem odd, but consider “your majesty, your
highness,” which pose no such problems in English.
I interpret bráhma in b as plural rather than singular because of pl. bráhmā in
1a and because there are multiple seers in 2b.
I take c with ab, contrary to Ge, who takes it with d. His is technically
possible, but it seems to imply a backwards sequence of events: Indra is born only
when he has taken the mace in his hand. Ge avoids the problem by radically
bleaching the meaning of janiṣṭhāḥ to make it an auxiliary or copula substitute
(“wardst”) with áṣāḷhaḥ: “so wardst du unbezwinglich.” This seems too high a price,
esp. as jajñé appears in the next verse, where Ge gives it its full lexical value (“er ist
… geboren”).
With janiṣṭhā áṣāḷhaḥ compare VII.20.3 janúṣem áṣāḷhaḥ.
Although nominative forms of the pres. part. to √as ‘be’, particularly sán, are
ordinarily concessive, I cannot see a concessive force here. Perhaps it is here almost
as a place-holder, to match the yád forms in the same position in surrounding pādas
(2b, c, 3b [whose yán in sandhi rhymes with sán]).

### 3  
I take ab as dependent on the previous verse, 2d, describing Indra’s
cosmogonic deeds right after birth. For a novel, but not ultimately persuasive
interpretation of this hemistich, see Old. Note that forms of √nī open and clause this
half-verse: #táva praṇītī … ninétha#.
The position of yád in this dependent clause is somewhat disturbing. It occurs
in Wackernagel’s position in the second pāda (b), but the a-pāda is part of this same
clause and is intimately interwoven with the elements in pāda b: note esp. the acc. pl.
jóhuvānān, which modifies nṝ́n, the third word in b. Although superficially late
position of subordinating elements is not uncommon in the RV (see, e.g., hí in pāda
c), what precedes is generally syntactically unified, belonging to a single constituent
(as in pāda c), but this is not true of the assorted material found in pāda a. I have no
explanation.
For the oppositional pun in sám … ninétha, standing for ví (… ninétha), see
the publ. intro. As I explained there, since sám and ví are preverbs of opposite
32
32
meaning that frequently pattern together, the sám here evokes the ví of the lexeme ví
√hvā earlier in the hymn (with √hvā present here in the intensive part. jóhuvānān)
and the various expressions of Indra’s pushing apart the two world-halves. E.g.,
nearby VII.23.3c ví bādhiṣṭa syá ródasī mahitvā́(I.51.10, VI.29.5, etc.). These
associations would prompt the audience to take “bring together” as standing for
“push apart,” in the standard mythology of Indra.
After the 2nd ps. description of Indra’s mythological activity in 2d–3ab, the
second half of vs. 3 summarizes the birth in the 3rd person. Ge’s interpretation, which
makes c parenthetical and connects ab with d despite an awkward change of person,
seems clumsy.

### 4  
A curious verse. It begins conventionally enough, with a plea to Indra to
favor us “though these days” (ebhíḥ … áhabhiḥ). Which days is not clear, but I
assume it means “now.” The verse then turns towards the moral sphere: the peoples
(kṣitáyaḥ) who are durmitrá- ‘having bad allies/alliances’ (or possibly ‘bad allies’)
are purifying themselves (pávante). This pāda presents a number of problems: not
only whether durmitrá- is a bahuvrīhi or tatpuruṣa (opinion is divided; I take it as the
former; see also comm. ad VII.18.15), but also whether the kṣitáyaḥ are intrinsically
our enemies or are members of our larger community who have fallen into an evil
state. kṣitáyaḥ are ordinarily presented either positively or neutrally, but see III.18.1,
where they are purudrúhaḥ ‘possessing many deceptions’, so an intrinsically hostile
reading is possible (if, in my opinion, less likely). If here they are intrinsically hostile,
the point may be that if they’re sprucing themselves up, we had better get to work on
it as well, to meet the challenge of our enemies. If they are not our sworn enemies
but peoples with whom we have dealings (or who we ourselves actually are), is it that
they are purifying themselves of their bad allies/alliances, and therefore are worthy
of Indra’s aid? Varuṇa, as if evoked by his partner Mitra in durmitrá-, then makes his
appearance, noting untruth and releasing us from it. As was stated in the intro.,
Varuṇa’s presence is unexpected here. I now wonder if the hymn is specialized for a
particular ritual context (signaled by “these days”), perhaps the Varuṇapraghāsa. A
purificatory period (like that described in pāda b) might be appropriate then. For this
reason I favor an interpretation of pāda b in which the kṣitáyaḥ are identified with, or
associated with, us.

### 5  
As noted in the publ. intro., this verse serves as refrain for VII.28–30, so
that it does not respond to (or at least need not respond to) the immediately preceding
Varuṇa verse.
In b the genitives mahó rāyáḥ and rā́dhasaḥ may either be parallel or one
dependent on the other. I follow the latter interpr., with the rāyáḥ phrase dependent
on rā́dhas-. Although I have not found absolutely diagnostic passages, rā́dhas- is
regularly modified by adjectives (like ‘bovine’) that specify the type of rā́dhas-, and
mahó rāyáḥ may be a defining genitive of the same type.

Pāda d (dádo maghā́ni maghavann iyānáḥ) is almost a rewrite of V.28.5ab
vocéma … maghávānam …, … rā́dhaso yád dádan naḥ, with iyānáḥ ‘being implored’
substituting for vocéma and rā́dhaḥ for maghā́ni.

### 2  
The pāda-initial voc. bráhman shows the accent of the neut. bráhman-
‘formulation’, though it clearly belongs to the m. brahmán- ‘formulator’. The
confusion is probably deliberate; the first word after the voc. phrase is bráhmakṛtim
with the neut. 1st cmpd member, neut. pl. bráhmāṇi is found in pāda d, and note that
the preceding hymn begins bráhmā (V.29.1a), with the neut. (see also V.29.2b).
Just as 1d is a variant of V.28.5ab, so also does 2b (arvācīnó háribhiḥ yāhi
tū́yam) appear to play on V.28.1ab … úpa yāhi …, arvā́ñcas te hárayaḥ …, as well as
echoing the immediately preceding vs. (29.1b ā́tu prá yāhi harivaḥ …) with háribhir
yāhi tū́yam.

### 3  
Ge takes tatane as a preterite (“… habe ich … gespannt”), but the fullgrade root syllable should signal a subjunctive, which also fits the context better (opt.
daśema [b], subj. śṛṇavaḥ [d]). In contrast Kü (210) considers the form a properly
formed indicative and a relic, the regularly developed product of *ta-tn-̥ h2ai;
although this could be possible, it seems unnecessary, given that the context favors a
modal form.
Note that the hemistich finals dāśema (b) and hávemā́(d) rhyme, though they
are morphologically entirelhy distinct.

Although tr. as if parallel, máhi in d is an adverbial neuter, whereas mahé
in c is a dative modifying nṛmnā́ya. However, “greatly for dominion” seemed overly
fussy in English.

The first hemistich is characterized by alliteration, v-s in a, u-s and sibilants
in b: hávanta u tvā hávyaṃ vivāci / tanū́ṣu śū́rāḥ sū́ryasya sātaú.
suhántu in d is a nice example of a proleptic adjective: “weaken the obstacles

## 31
Indra

### 2  
Unlike other interpretors, I take utá as marking a new clause, summing up
the actions of the poet (who addresses himself in 2a) and his ritual companions
(whom he addresses in vs. 1) and comparing them to the actions of the Maruts (yáthā
náraḥ). Klein (I.409) takes utá as connecting vss. 1 and 2, but the position of utá in
2b makes that interpretation awkward. Ge takes it as connecting ukthám and dyukṣám
(“… ein Loblied … und zwar ein himmlisches”). His interpretation assumes a new
clause beginning with yáthā in the middle of b and also takes cakṛmā́in c as a sort of
34
34
dummy verb substituting for a verb of poetic speech (“wie wir Männer es …
gedichtet haben”). But, although “just as we have done” works fine in English as a
dummy verb, I am not sure that √kṛ can be bleached in the same manner in Sanskrit
– though I notice, with some chagrin, that I suggest just such an explanation for
kṛṇóti in I.77.1. Since the Maruts as Indra’s singers are mentioned elsewhere in the
hymn (explicitly vs. 8, implicitly vs. 12) and are often called náraḥ, my
interpretation of b has some support. The position of yáthā as a simile marker might
be problematic, however; it can be ameliorated by assuming that dyukṣám forms part
of the simile “as the superior men (made/make) a heavenly (speech), we have made
…” For dyukṣá- qualifying ‘speech’, cf. the compound dyukṣá-vacas- (VI.15.4).
### 3–4
Although these verses straddle a tṛca boundary, they are neatly
responsive. The repeated tvám of vs. 3 is matched by the initial vayám of vs. 4, and
the repeated -yú- (‘seeking X’) adjectives of 3 are again matched by the tvāyú-
‘seeking you’ of 4a. The final word of both verses is the voc. vaso. Even the gavyú-
‘seeking cows’ of 3b has its complement in 4b vṛṣan ‘o bull’.
There is no obvious noun to supply with asyá ‘of this’ in c. Ge supplies
“Schrei,” and my “cry” follow him; Klein (I.175) instead “act.” The phraseology
reminds us of the refrain of I.105 vittám me asyá rodasī, which I tr. “Take heed of
this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.”

### 5  
Contra Ge (and Klein DGRV I.175), I take váktave with nidé, not with
árāvṇe, which respects the pāda boundary and also conforms better to the semantic
domain of the two nouns: níd- ‘scorn’ is verbal, whereas árāvan- is more general. In
either interpretation the position of ca is a problem, since it appears with the first
member of a conjoined NP, not the second. In my interpretation the configuration is
X ca X' ... Y, in the Ge/Klein interpretation X ca Y...Y'.
### 6
On the basis of VIII.92.32 tváyéd indra yujā́vayám, práti bruvīmahi
spṛ́dhaḥ “With you as yokemate, we would respond to the challengers,” I supply
‘challenger’ here.
### 6–7
Again there is responsion across the tṛca boundary: 7a mahām̐utā́si
echoes 6a tvám vármāsi.
### 7–8
Echo between 7b svadhā́varī and 8b sayā́varī, though they occupy
different metrical positions.

### 10  
Much phonetic and morphological play, with the repeated prá’s, the
repetition of mahé mahi- (note that this replicates the mahé … máhi of VII.30.1cd),
and, especially, the chiastic finale: prá carā carṣaṇiprā́ḥ, where the last element, the
root noun -prā́ḥ, is of course unrelated to the first one, the preverb prá.
35
35

### 12  
Because the vā́ṇī ‘choir’ in vs. 8 was qualified as marútvatī ‘composed of
Maruts’, I supply Maruts here with pl. vā́ṇīḥ. It is also possible, and perhaps
preferable, to assume that the plural indicates that several choirs are involved: both
the Maruts and (we) the human singers.
In c barhayā could also be 1st sg. subjunctive, as Ge takes it. Either
interpretation fits the context fine; I slightly prefer the 2nd sg. imperative, because it
returns us to the imperatives of vss. 1–2.

It is tempting to take suté as parallel to mádhau in the simile and sácā with
ā́sate, rather than taking suté sácā as a formulaic phrase with semi-pleonastic sácā as
the publ. tr. does. The former interpr. would yield “because these who craft sacred
formulations for you sit together at [=by/around] the soma like flies on honey when
(the soma) is pressed,” an interpr. also suggested to me by Dieter Gunkel (p.c.,
11/5/15). I chose the latter path because of the parallel cited by Ge, X.50.7 ...

sudákṣiṇa- is a triple pun. In its only other RVic occurrence (VIII.33.5) it
means ‘having a good right (horse)’, but it could equally mean ‘having a good right
(hand)’, alluding to the immediately preceding vájrahasta- ‘having the mace in his
hand’. And, in keeping with the theme of giving, it can refer to the dákṣiṇā-, the
priestly gift’ distributed at the dawn sacrifice. This would respond to the rāyáskāma-
‘desirous of wealth’, which opens the verse.

### 5  
Ge joins c with b, rather than d as I do. This is possible, but the topic of
giving in both c and d connects them thematically.

### 8  
ávase kṛṇudhvam is close to a periphrastic causative, since “make [=create]
(him) for help” is unlikely to take the long-created Indra as object. Zehnder (p. 7 and
passim) takes it as such.

### 9  
kṛṇudhvám … ātúje similarly functions as a periphrastic causative. So also
Zehnder (p. 20 and passim).

### 11  
Although ‘seeking the prize’ is ordinarily accented as a denominative
(vājayánt-), as opposed to ‘incite’ (vājáya-) with causative accent, in this context, the
denominative sense seems clear. See comm. on 14d below.

### 14  
śraddhā́is most likely instrumental, but its lack of contraction with the
following vowel in the Saṃhitā text gives pause. See Old on this problem.
36
36
vājī́vā́jaṃ siṣāsati seems like a variant of gámad vā́jam vājáyan in 11a with
different emphasis. See also 20a below.

### 17  
The relative clause of b, yá īm bhávanti ājáyaḥ, is very peculiar. There is
no possible referent for the yé in either the preceding or the following main clause,
and in addition the īm lacks function. It seems like a mangled paraphrase of I.81.3
yád udī́rata ājáyaḥ “when (battle-)drives arise/happen,” but what caused the
mangling is unclear to me. The yé can be by “attraction” to the m. nom. pl. ājáyaḥ
from putative *yád, and this set of Indra hymns has several examples of functionless
īm (VII.20.3, 21.1). But it still lacks motivation.
The VP nā́ma bhikṣate “desires a share in your name” is striking and a little
puzzling. The same phrase nā́ma √bhaj is found in V.57.5, but there it means that the
Maruts, the subjects of the verb, all share the same name. Here, by contrast, it must
be a clever way of saying that everyone calls Indra’s name, a novel paraphrase of the
common epithet of Indra puruhūtá- ‘called upon by many’, found in this verse and
vss. 20 and 26. (The English slang equivalent would be “wants a piece of you.”) Ge
renders nā́ma bhikṣate as “Deinen Namen fleht … an” (implores), robbing the
expression of its vividness.

### 18  
The root √īś overwhelmingly takes the gen.; the construction here is
identified by Gr (s.v. īś, col. 236: #8 mit dem Acc.) as mixed: the gen. yā́vataḥ is
construed with the implied 2nd ps. “as much as you are lord over” (yā́vatas tvám
[ī́śiṣe]) in pāda a, which is picked up by the acc. etā́vad in the contrary-to-fact “if I
were lord over so much” (yád … etā́vad ahám ī́śiya). I think it more likely that
etā́vad here is a quasi-adverbial summing up of the dependent clause; a more literal
tr. would be “if I were lord to such an extent as” or the like. The other passages
assembled under Gr’s #8 can be variously explained and do not provide strong
evidence for an alternative case frame with √īś. In III.18.3 yā́vad is again adverbial;
see the publ. tr. “inasmuch as I am master …” In VIII.68.7 ī́śe is properly construed
with a gen. (kṛṣṭīnā́m) in its own pāda; the acc. cited by Gr, pūrvyā́m ánuṣṭutim in the
previous pāda, is probably an acc. of respect (see comm. ad loc.) For nearby VII.37.7
as well as III.51.4, the latter cited only as a possibility by Gr., see comm. ad locc.

### 22  
Despite Ge’s easy “dessen Auge die Sonne ist,” I cannot accept this for
svardṛ́śam. First, dṛ́ś- is never an ‘eye’, but rather ‘seeing’ or ‘having the appearance
of’, and furthermore, it’s Varuṇa who has the sun as his eye (that is, his spy). Here I
think the point is rather that Indra, like the sun, sees everything in the world, here
expressed by the merism “the moving and the still.”

### 24  
There are two word plays in this verse. The simpler one is between the
impv. bhara ‘bring’ in pāda a and the āmreḍita bháre-bhare ‘at every raid’, where
the noun bhára- has been specialized from ‘(an occasion for) bearing away’ to ‘raid’.
The more complex one involves the creation and disappointment of
expectations. The verse begins with abhī́ṣatáḥ. The juxtaposition of these two forms
37
37
(the latter being the pres. part. to √as ‘be’ in either gen.-abl. sg. or acc. pl.) and their
close sandhi, with retroflex initial ṣ, invites the audience to fill in the semantics of the
lexeme abhí √as ‘be superior’. But to our surprise, at the end of this hemistich we
find the semantic opposite, kánīyasaḥ ‘the lesser ones’, requiring us to revise our
analysis of the opening, dissolving the presumed lexeme into the directional
preverb/preposition abhí and the independent pres. participle modifying kánīyasaḥ
much later in the line. For extensive discussion see Old.
I cannot follow Gr, Old in interpreting jyā́yaḥ as voc., but take it, with Ge, as
neut. sg. with tád. Among other things, AiG III.296 notes only two masc. vocatives
in -īyas in the RV, this one and ójīyaḥ in X.120.4, which is also better taken as a neut.
## 33
Vasiṣṭha and the Vasiṣṭhids
On the structure and thematics of this famous hymn see the publ. intro., as
well as the introductory remarks of both Old and Ge. With VII.18, the account of the
Battle of the Ten Kings, it bookends the Indra hymns of VII and contributes its own
background to the (fragmentary) narrative of King Sudās and the Ten Kings Battle.
The name vásiṣṭha- appears in every vs. of this hymn, primarily at the end of
the d pāda: vss. 1, 2, 3, 4, (not 5, 6, though vásiṣṭha- appears in both c pādas,) 7, (not
8, though it's in middle of d,) 9, (not 10 though in c, nor 11 though in a,) 12, 13, 14.

### 1  
By most accounts this vs. is spoken by Indra, who is the referent of the 1st
ps. enclitics mā and me in pādas a and d and the subj. of 1st ps. voce in c.
As noted already ad VII.18.21, Ge has a peculiar interpr. of the verbal lexeme
(abhí) prá √mad as ‘go on a pilgrimage’, for which there is no support that I can see.
Old also rejects this interpr. I follow Old’s view that Indra is present at a competing
sacrifice -- a constant preoccupation of the Indra hymns of VII -- and recalling the
Vasiṣṭhas’ ritual service to him, he gets up to the leave the sacrifice where he is
present to go to theirs. Pāda d is the embedded self-quotation of Indra, providing the
reason for his departure for the Vasiṣṭhas.
The descriptors of the Vasiṣṭhas śvityáñcaḥ … dakṣiṇatáskapardāḥ are found
almost identically in VII.83.8 śvityáñcaḥ … kapardínaḥ, where they modify the
Tṛtsus, Sudās’s fighting force in the Ten Kings Battle, in a hymn much concerned
with that battle. Vasiṣṭha was at least an adoptive member of the Tṛtsu clan. See Ge’s
n. 1a and esp. vss. 5, 6, and 15 in this hymn.
Despite the position of the generally sentential, Wackernagel’s Law particle hí
far to the right in b, the verb complex abhí hí pramandúḥ must have domain over the
entire hemistich, with mā in 2nd pos. in pāda a serving as its object. As often, when a
preverb stays with its verb at the end of a clause rather than moving to the front of its
clause, hí is inserted, between preverb and verb (or here preverb1 and preverb 2 verb).

### 2  
In this vs. the perspective and location shifts from Indra, at the competing
sacrifice announcing his intention to go to the Vasiṣṭhas, to the Vasiṣṭhas at their
place of sacrifice “leading” Indra to them. The vss. are linked by dūrā́t ‘from a
38
38
distance’ (1d, 2a), in 1d referring to the distant location of the Vasiṣṭha from Indra’s
point of view, in 2a the distant location of Indra from that of the Vasiṣṭhas.
With Old, I consider Pāśadyumna Vāyata the hapless sacrificer whom Indra
deserted in favor of the Vasiṣṭhas. But I do not follow Old in thinking that b
describes an intermediate place on Indra’s journey from PV to the Vasiṣṭhas.

### 3  
With this vs. we pass to the Ten Kings Battle and the Vasiṣṭhas’ crucial
efforts in securing Indra’s aid for Sudās. The emphatic repeated opening of the first
three pādas evén nú kam highlights the critical incidents. The two sequences evéd and
nú kam are both found fairly frequently elsewhere, but never elsewhere together, so
it’s difficult to judge the force of their combination.

### 4  
Ge appears to be right that this vs. is also Indra’s speech. He picks up the
bráhmaṇā vaḥ from 3d in pāda a and also addresses them as ‘superior men’ (voc.
naraḥ), just as he spoke about the superior men (acc. nṝ́n) in 1c.
Ge takes pitṝṇā́m with both júṣṭī and bráhmaṇā; I doubt the first, as does Old.
Since I think Indra is addressing the Vasiṣṭhas at the time of the battle, not a younger
generation of Vasiṣṭhas long after the battle, his “by reason of your fathers’ sacred
formulation” (bráhmaṇā vo pitṝṇā́m) must refer to the formulation they inherited
from their own poetic forebears and are putting to use in enlisting Indra’s help.
The action Indra performs in response to the Vasiṣṭhas’ employment of the
bráhman- is not altogether clear. (Old, after some speculation, concludes “'ich
komme hier nicht zur Klarheit.”) The bare phrasing ákṣam avyayam must mean
literally “I enveloped the/an axle,” but whose axle it is and whether the enveloping is
a help or a hindrance aren’t recoverable from context. However, as Old points out,
III.53.19 may provide some guidance. That vs. is addressed to an axle (voc. ákṣa) in
a series of vss. (17–20) mean to avert possible disasters that might afflict a team of
oxen and the vehicle they are pulling. In vs. 19 the axle is urged abhí vyayasva
khadirásya sā́ram “Engird yourself in the hardwood of the Acacia tree,” before being
told to be and stay firm (vīḷáyasva). The first instruction to the axle contains the verb
(abhí) √vyā ‘envelop, engird’, which I take as referring to fixing the ends of the axle
firmly in the wheel hubs till the ends are literally surrounded with / enveloped in the
wood of the wheel hub. If the same type of action is referred to here, Indra is
performing a positive action, presumably securing the axle of the Vasiṣṭhas or their
allies in position, to protect them and their chariot from harm, as Indra promises with
ná kílā riṣātha.
As Ge points out (n. 4c), śákvarī- is the name of a meter with martial
associations. As he also points out, this fairly rare meter is found in the first three vss.
of X.133, a hymn to Indra attributed to Sudās Paijavana, that is, the royal hero of the
Ten Kings Battle, though there is no particular ref. to that battle in X.133. Since
śákvarīṣu is plural here, it would be better tr. “in Sakvarī (verses)” than “in Śakvarī
(meter),” as in the publ. tr.

### 5  
For the very compressed simile of the thirsty and heaven, cf. V.57.1 tr̥ṣṇáje
ná divá útsā udanyáve “like the well-spring of heaven for a thirsty man seeking
water,” where the “water” part is made clear.

### 6  
It is a curious, but perhaps coincidental, fact that the sole occurrence of
daṇḍá- in the RV is found in the same hymn with the only occurrence of the vṛddhi
deriv. maitrāvaruṇá- (vs. 11), given that the daṇḍa- ‘staff’ is the emblem of office
associated with the Maitrāvaruṇa priest in śrauta ritual. See Minkowski, Priesthood
in Ancient India, pp. 141–54 and passim. The conjunction in our hymn was pointed
out to me by Elizabeth Tucker.
The addition of the pejorative and sometimes diminutive suffix -ka- on a
word already meaning ‘small’ -- arbha-ká- -- is a nice slangy touch.
In c the ca appears to be subordinating (so also Klein, DGRV I.242–43),
though because ábhavat is pāda-initial, its accent need not be due to subordination.

### 7  
For the riddles here, see publ. intro. I make no effort at a definitive solution
(or even any solution at all). In this abstention I follow the good example of Old.

### 9  
On the weaving, see publ. intro. and vs. 12c, as well as comm. ad vs. 14.
### 10–13
Old discusses Vasiṣṭha’s two births and suggests that they are
presented in reverse chronological order. The birth depicted in vs. 10 is the second
birth, while 11–13 treat the first. In the first birth Mitra and Varuṇa emit semen at a
Sattra, which falls into a pot and ultimately gives rise to the seer Agastya. But a drop
of this semen is taken into a lotus, somehow comes to the Apsaras Urvaśī, who
somehow conceives and gives birth to Vasiṣṭha “from mind.” In the second birth the
wondrously conceived divine being of the 1st birth is received into a human Gotra.
Old is uncertain about the details; I am even more uncertain.

### 10  
In III.51.4 I take sám √hā as ‘compact oneself together’, that is,
‘concentrate one’s essence’, and that seems the image here, of the embryonic
Vasiṣṭha taking shape from concentrated lightning. Ge (n. 10a) suggests rather that it
refers to semen suddenly poured out. I do not see this, and his suggested parallel in
X.95.10 seems irrelevant, esp. since the lightning there is Urvaśī.
Old’s argument that vs. 10 depicts one birth and the following vss. another
depends in part on taking the two utá’s of 10c and 11a as marking the two births.
This would be more convincing if the first utá were not in the middle of the pāda.
This position seems better accounted for by assuming that 10c refers to both births,
with utá conjoining tát te jánma and ékam, as Ge takes it (“das war deine (eine)
Geburt and eine …”). So also Klein (DGRV I.368). The double yád in b and d
support this interpr., with each yád introducing one of the births. I follow this general
interpr.
The yád in b is very deep in its clause, with both subj. and obj. preceding it, if
pādas ab form a single clause as in the standard tr. (incl. Ge and the publ. tr.). It
40
40
would, however, be possible to take pāda a as the main clause on which b is
dependent: “light was compacting out of lightning when M+V looked upon you.”
This would solve the problem, but the unusual position of yád could also be
attributed to an attempt to make b and d parallel, each recounting one of the births
and opening with the putative father (or fathers) followed by yád, with a preterital
verb and the obj. tvā (the latter in different orders): b mitrā́váruṇā yád ápaśyatāṃ tvā
and d agástyo yát tvā viśá ājabhā́ra. In this scenario, pāda a, which is a single NP,
would have been fronted around the core clause.
With Old (fld. by Ge), I read dat. viśé contra Pp. viśáḥ. The clan in question is
supposed to be the Tṛtsus.

### 11  
The pub. tr. reads “born from her mind,” but given the uncertainties of
this birth story, the mind need not be Urvaśī’s, but someone else’s, or even pure
mind. So it might be better rendered as “born from mind.”
On the semen (if that’s what the drop is) and the lotus, see disc. ad vss. 10–13.
If the underlying narrative really does involve transporting spilled semen in a leaf
and long-distance conception therefrom, it anticipates the MBh narrative in which
the king Vasu ejaculates while hunting, catches the semen in a leaf, and tries to send
it home to his wife Girikā by enlisting a bird, though the bird and the semen meet
with a disaster over water that leads to the semen impregnating a fish (MBh
I.57.35ff.).
I take drapsáṃ skannám as a nominal clause, rather than taking cd as a single
clause with drapsáṃ skannám coreferential with tvā.

### 12  
As Ge points out (n. 12a), praketá- is otherwise only a noun, and so it is
best to go against the Pp’s reading praketáḥ in favor of the loc. praketé. (Ge also
entertains the possibility of reading *sapraketáḥ.)
The “both” are presumably both births; so Ge.
The weaving in pāda c is repeated almost verbatim from 9c, but with the
single Vasiṣṭha, not the pl. Vasiṣṭhas as subject. As noted in the publ. intro., I assume
that this refers to the production of the sacrifice. See comm. ad vs. 14 below.
The hapax sádāna- is not entirely clear. Ge suggests that it stands for
*sádādāna- by haplology and tr. “der … immerdar Geschenke hat.” He does not
render the utá vā, implicitly taking sahásradānaḥ … sádānaḥ as appositive adjectives.
Klein (DGRV II.169) follows Ge’s interpr. of sádānaḥ without mentioning the
possible haplology and states that the conjoined terms in the phrase sahásradana utá
vā sádānaḥ “come close to being synonymous.” His tr. “having a thousand gifts or
having constant gifts” both illustrates this suggestion and shows how flat-footed such
a phrase would be. Old discusses without coming to a conclusion, though he does
reject the haplology explan., which goes back to Ludwig. My own interpr. takes the
text as given and interprets the second adj. as additive “and one gift (more),” with
sádāna- ‘with (a) gift’ standing for ‘with one gift’. If the utá vā should be read as
disjunctive ‘or’ (as I admit it should), perhaps this is instead a version of the
Archilochus fox-and-hedgehog dichotomy (“the fox knows many things, but the
41
41
hedgehog one big one”) -- hence “having a thousand gifts -- or one (big) gift.” This
in fact is now my preferred tr. What the gifts refer to I have no idea.

### 13  
This vs. is the basis of Old’s (and others’) reconstruction of the 1st birth of
Vasiṣṭha (see comm. add vss. 10–13), with Mitra and Varuṇa at a Sattra emitting
semen into a pot, which then gave rise to both Agastya and Vasiṣṭha. Unfortunately
the details of this vs. are far from clear, though pāda b does (fairly) straightforwardly
depict a dual entity pouring semen into a pot.
The gravest problems are in pāda a. The opening satré ha is interpr. by Sāy,
fld. by Ge., as standing for sattré ‘at a Sattra’. The single -t- versus double -tt- before
-r- is of course not a problem [Max Müller’s ed. in fact prints sattré], but it is the
case that, though the word sat(t)rá- and its ritual complex are well attested already in
Saṃhitā prose, the word is not found elsewhere in the RV. (However, the ritual
almost surely already existed; there seems a clear reference to it in vs. 9 of the Indra
hymn III.31, where the Aṅgirases “sit a sitting” [sádanam √sad, though with the
words not in the same VP] to open the Vala cave. See comm. ad loc.) However, Gr
suggests reading *satréhá instead, to be analyzed as the adv. satrā́‘entirely’ and ihá
‘here’; the only change required would be accenting the second word. Old sits on the
fence, but seems weakly to favor the Sattra interpr., as do I, since it at least provides
richer semantics and a ritual context for the actions. Moreover the particle ha would
exactly match the same particle in the same location in pāda c.
The next problem is jātaú. If it is a dual ppl. (rather than a loc. sg. to the
putative stem jātí-, which, however, is not found in the RV), it can of course modify
the dual subjects of the verb siṣicathuḥ, and it is also quite possible that that dual
subject is Mitra and Varuṇa, as Old and Ge interpr. it. The problem is thus not
syntactic but semantic. In what way would M+V be “born” at a Sattra? Ge elides the
problem by (as far as I can see) folding it into an anodyne phrase with iṣitā́, rendered
as “erregt geworden,” where I assume the ‘geworden’ is a bleached, auxiliary-like
version of jātaú. Sāy glosses it as dīkṣitau, and this might nicely reflect the middle
Vedic configuration of the dīkṣā of a soma sacrificer as tantamount to a second birth.
No forms of the (secondary) root √dīkṣ are found in the RV; however, both dīkṣā́-
and dīkṣitá- are attested in the AV, with the former fairly common. I therefore am
inclined to follow Sāy’s interpr. -- or what I assume Sāy’s interpr. rests on -- that
jātaú refers to the conceptual rebirth of a consecrated sacrificer. This rebirth would
be somewhat comparable to the two births of Vasiṣṭha himself. This interpr. of jātaú
would be more clearly expressed than in the publ. tr. by rendering it “(re)born
[=consecrated] at a (ritual) Session.”
Pāda c appears to describe the creation of Agastya (see comm. above ad vss.
10–13). Māna is the name of Agastya’s father and family or indeed of Agastya
himself. See Mayrhofer PN s.v. for reff.
Kü (99, 570) has a very diff. interpr. of the vs. In the first hemistich he takes
kumbhé as a dual, modified by the dual ppl. in pāda a and subject of the dual verb in
b: “Beim Somaopfer geboren, angetrieben durch Verehrungen haben die beiden
Krüge den gemeinsamen Samen ergossen” (99). This is grammatically impossible,
42
42
because kumbhá- is masc., as the two occurrences of the acc. pl. kumbhā́n show, and
so its dual should be *kumbhā́(u). In c he takes mā́naḥ as ‘house’: “Mitten daraus ist
ein Haus hervorgegangen” (99=570). He does not comment on the mythological
content of the vs., but though mā́na- ‘building, house’ is at least marginally attested
in the RV (clearest in VII.88.5), the creation of a house from semen would be such
an outlandish feat that the creation of a seer seems positively plausible.
In b the pf. siṣicatuḥ has a retroflexed root init., as we would expect. But the
other two forms of the pf. in the RV (sisicuḥ II.24.4 and sisice III.32.15) do not. I
have no explanation for the discrepancy.

### 14  
As Ge (n. 14) points out, this vs. seems to pick up 10d, describing the
second “birth” of Vasiṣṭha, when Agastya presents him to the clan, and it seems to
consist of Agastya’s direct speech. As Old points out, the first hemistich seems to
identify the three priests of śrauta ritual, though not by title: the Hotar, supporter of
the ukthá-; the Udgātar, supporter of the sā́man-; and the Adhvaryu, supporter of the
pressing stone, i.e., the one who performs the physical actions. Assuming this is the
case makes it reasonably likely that the weaving of “the covering stretched by Yama”
(9c, 12c) does indeed refer to the production of the sacrifice. Vasiṣṭha is thus
presented as responsible for the whole of the sacrifice, not just a portion of it.
## 34
All Gods
Re characterizes this hymn as “invitation without praise.”
The first 21 (or actually 20 and a half) vss. of this 25-vs. hymn are in Dvipadā
meter. Despite its name, this meter should be considered to consist of four pādas of 5
syllables each, since verbs located in the 6th syllable of a putative 10-syl. pāda are
generally accented (see 3b, d, 4b, 6b, 20d); however, consider 14d, 17d, where verbs
in that position are unaccented. Those two violations fall in the latter part of the
Dvipadā portion and may be beginning the transition to Triṣṭubh, which takes over in
the 2nd half of vs. 21. On the meter see Old, Prol. 95–98.

### 1  
HvN’s resolution of the sandhi and accentuation of Saṃhitā śukraítu in
pāda a as śukra étu is incorrect: the Pp rightly reads śukrā́etu.
The reference to the departure of our well-crafted manīṣā́is a fitting
beginning to a hymn, as describing the dispatch of the praise hymn to the targeted
divinities.

### 2  
Ge (n. 2a), flg. Sāy., takes the waters as subj. of vidúḥ and suggests that the
point is that the waters are older even than Heaven and Earth: they are the Urelement.
They therefore were around for the creation of H+E and know all about it. In the
absence of any other obvious subject, this seems reasonable.
In the 2nd hemistich the function and position of ádha are somewhat puzzling.
Klein (DGRV II.96 n. 23) lists it with passages with the “logical conjunctive value”
‘therefore’. But he does not tr. it or comment on its non-clause-init. position, and I
find it difficult to wring a ‘therefore’ sense out of it. In the Prol. (369 n. 1) Old
43
43
suggests that the PB parallel (I.2.9, VI.6.17) with the reading adhaḥ ‘below’ is
correct and the RV should be emended, but he essentially drops that idea in the
Noten, remarking that RV ádha is “tadellos” and that the emendation would also
require altering the accent (to adháḥ). Our passage is reminiscent of IV.17.10 ayáṃ
śrṇ̥ ve ádha jáyann utá ghnán, which I tr. “this one is famed for conquering and
smiting.” Both passages have a mid-clause ádha that introduces a pres. participle or
participles and both contain a form of √śru. See comm. ad IV.17.10. In both cases I
think ádha opens a mini-clause that modifies or expands on the main verb. In our
passage I think the point is that, though rivers are very noisy when they flow (as is
often emphasized in Vedic texts), these waters also know how to listen. Note also
that in our case ádha is pāda-initial, though not clause-initial.

### 3  
As noted in the introductory remarks above, both pínvanta and máṃsante
are accented because they open 5-syl. pādas.
Both Ge and Re take the (soma) sacrifice as the referent of asmai, contra both
Sāy. and Old, who supply Indra instead. I definitely side with the latter. Like many
All God hymns, the separate vss. can serve as little riddles, each pointing to a
different god,, and the mention of vṛtréṣu ‘(battles against) obstacles’, even in the
plural, seems a tip-off that Indra is lurking.
I’m not quite sure what the subjunctive máṃsante is meant to convey --
perhaps that in times to come poets will talk about them that way in the accounts of
the Vṛtra-slaying?
### 4–6
Note the chiasmic verb sequence 4b dádhāta [… 5a sthāta] ... 5d tmánā
hinota ... 6ab tmánā … hinóta ... 6c dádhāta, with one interruption.

### 4  
The 2nd pl. subj. of dádhāta is unspecified, but is probably the priests /
poets associated with the current sacrifice, who were referred to in the 1st pl. asmát in
vs. 1. See vss. 5–6, where this identification is more explicit.
Once again both Ge and Re take asmai as referring to the sacrifice. They also
take the nominative(s) of the 2nd hemistich as coreferential with the subj. of the impv.
dádhāta in a: in other words, “put the horses to the chariot pole, as Indra (does/did).”
This seems unnec. Old’s view that the asmai refers to Savitar, who is then the subj.
of the 2nd hemistich, is far more plausible. Although híraṇya-bāhu- is found only here
in the RV, the very similar híraṇya-pāṇi- ‘having gold hands’ is used a number of
times of Savitar, and the uncompounded phrase bāhū́… hiraṇyáyā is used of
Savitar’s arms in nearby VII.45.2 (also VI.71.1, 5), as Old points out. Since Tvaṣṭar
fashions the mace for Indra in I.32.2, calling him vajrín- here is perfectly sensible.
### 5–6
The 2nd pl. impvs. in these two vss., 5a abhí prá sthāta, 5d hinota, 6b
hinóta, 6c dádhāta, all take the sacrifice (yajñám, explicitly 5b, 6b) as object and
make the identification of the subject as the priests/poets, suggested ad vs. 4, more
likely.
44
44

### 5  
The simile áheva, despite Pp áha iva, is surely to be analyzed as áhā iva, as
Old indicates, pointing out that in other places where it occurs (e.g., IV.33.6) the Pp.
gives the long vowel form. Both Old and Ge take áhā as nom.: “set out on the
sacrifice, as the days (do [=follow one after the other]).” Re takes it as acc.,
supplying “as (the sun) does the days,” which requires that he make the verb abhí prá
sthāta transitive (“mettez en marche”), which is unlikely. I prefer to take it as acc.
extent of time, meaning something like “'keep going in the performance of sacrifice,
as one keeps going day after day.”

### 7  
Like vss. 3 and 4, this contains an unaccented oblique form of ayám, in this
case asya, and as with those vss., I think it likely that asya is the sign of a riddling
mention of a god -- in this case likely Agni, as Old tentatively suggests. Ge and Re
also see a reference to the offering fire.
I do not understand the simile in the 2nd hemistich. If the bhū́ma that the earth
bears is its surface, what would an equivalent burden be for the offering fire?
In order to get 2 Dvipadā pādas in the 2nd hemistich, we must read *pṛthvī́for
pṛthivī́, as Old points out. Otherwise we have a Triṣṭubh anticipating the switch to
Triṣṭubh that happens much later in the hymn.

### 8  
Old asserts that áyātu- is a determin. cmpd., not a bahuvrīhi, thus ‘nonsorcerer’ rather than ‘not having sorcery/sorcerer’. The publ. tr. reflects -- and
indeed reflects somewhat loosely -- a bahuvrīhi interpr., though I think the difference
is minor. Re also takes it as a b.v.: “sans (user de) sorcellerie” (tr. EVP V), “sans user
de procédés magiques” (comm., EVP IV); see also Wh n. ad AV tr. VIII.4.16.
Nonetheless, a determin. interpr. is a reasonable alternative: “I -- no sorcerer --
invoke the gods.” A 2nd RVic occurrence of this stem, acc. áyātum in VII.104.16,
with AVŚ+P repetitions, is not registered in Gr., which omission is probably
responsible for Re’s erroneously calling our occurrence a hapax in his comm.
Unfortunately this other occurrence does not resolve the question of cmpd type. The
cmpd. is not disc. in AiG.
Presumably the implied opposition in this vs. is between sorcery in the 1st
half-vs. and truth (ṛtá-) of the 2nd half. So also Re (comm.).

### 9  
Once again the unspecified 2nd pl. subj. should be the priests/poets.
Note the extreme alliteration of … devī́ṃ dhíyaṃ dadhidhvam.
The morphological identity of this last form, dadhidhvam, can be queried. The
three occurrences of this form are normally assigned to the perfect rather than the
redupl. pres. (see esp. Kü 275), on the grounds that the -i-liaison is proper to the
perfect. Yet no corresponding med. 2nd pl. impv. is built to the pres. stem; indeed, the
posited correspondent (cf. Whitney, Gr. §668), the monstrous *dhaddhvam, is not
attested in Vedic (as imperative, injunctive, or augmented imperfect). It is likely,
therefore, that dadhidhvam serves as impv. to both pf. and redupl. pres., neutralizing
the distinction between those T/A stems. In fact, given that in this passage it is
parallel to the present impv. kṛṇudhvam in the same vs. and immediately follows on
45
45
an unambiguous redupl. pres. form to the same root and with the same obj. (8d
dhíyaṃ dadhāmi, 9b dhíyaṃ dadhidhvam), a present-stem interpr. is favored. On
ambig. pf. impvs. see my 2018 “The Vedic Perfect Imperative” (Fs. Lubotsky).
### 10–11
After several vss. with a ritual, priestly focus, we return to the semiriddling listing of gods, with these two vss. devoted to Varuṇa. In 10 the subj.
Varuṇa is withheld till the 2nd half, thereby producing a quickly solved riddle. Vs. 11
does not name him at all, but the referent is clear from the phraseology, as well as the
previous vs.

### 10  
The easiest thing to do with fem. gen. pl. āsām is to have it modify fem.
gen. pl. nadī́nām, as Ge and Re do (e.g., “de ces rivières”). But it is unaccented and
therefore should be a pronominal demonstrative, rather than an adjectival one. I
therefore assume that it picks up the waters (ā́paḥ) earlier in the hymn (2c, 3a); the
connection of Varuṇa with the waters, though not as firm in the RV as it is later,
would evoke them. The rivers are then in apposition to these unnamed waters. Re in
his comm. notes the “lien” of āsām with ā́paḥ earlier in the hymn but seems to stop
short of syntactically separating āsām from the rivers in this vs. For further disc. see
comm. ad I.68.7.
### 12–13
The 2nd pl. subjects of all the verbs but vy ètu in 13a must be the gods
in general. The priests/poets who were previously unspecified 2nd pl. subjects do not
command the powers to carry out the desires specified.

### 12  
The hapax ádyu- has been variously analyzed and rendered: e.g., Sāy.
adīpti- ‘non-shining’, reflected in Gr’s ‘glanzlos’ and probably Re’s ‘sans éclat’; Old
‘excluded from heaven’. But Ge’s (n. 12b) comparison of Old Avestan aidiiu- (YH
2x, plus a YA rep.) ‘harmless’ is surely correct and is accepted by EWA, etc. For
disc., with earlier lit., see Narten, YH 280–81.
Our half-verse ádyuṃ kṛṇota śáṃsaṃ ninitsóḥ is nearly identical to VII.25.2c
āré táṃ śáṃsaṃ kṛṇuhi ninitsóḥ, though in a different meter (our two 5-syl. pādas of
Dvipadā versus Triṣṭubh). To accommodate the meter the verb and object had to be
flipped and a different predicate supplied. This metrically driven modification
procedure is instructive.

### 14  
Initial injunc. 3rd sg. -iṣ-aor. ávīn (for ávīt) matches the init. áviṣṭa (+u) of
12a, which I (and the standard tr.) take as a 2nd pl. -iṣ-aor. impv. Re. takes ávīt here
as hortatory/imperatival (“Qu’Agni favorise …”), but I see no problem in having a
preterital (or perhaps general present “Agni aids …”) injunc. form in this vs.
characterizing an individual god. The 2nd pl. is found in the hortatory address to the
gods in general, parallel to impv. kṛṇota in 12c, whereas ávīt is followed by an
augmented pass. aor. adhāyi, expressing the reciprocal human action in response to
the god’s help.
46
46
The first half-vs. contains two exx. of -t/d à -n sandhi before nasal: (ávīt à)
ávīn no and (havyā́d à) havyā́n námobhiḥ. Re renders the latter as if it were an acc.
pl. to havyá- (“… favorise nos oblations”), but this must be an example of a hasty
Homeric nod, since havyá- ‘oblation’ is always neut.
Whose námobhiḥ? Ge takes them as Agni’s, which he offers to the gods. I
think it more likely that it refers to our acts of reverence to Agni, to which he
reciprocates by aiding us. So also Scar (40: “durch {unsere} Ehrerbietungen”). Re
takes námobhiḥ with the following clause: “Avec hommages a été déposée … la
louange …”). This avoids the problem and works well semantically, but in this hymn
verses regularly fall into two clauses separated by the half-vs. boundary, and there
are no examples of a portion of b adjoined to the clause of cd.

### 15  
Here the 2nd pl. address appears to be to the priests/poets.
This is the one of the few vss. in which the half-vs. break does not coincide
with a major syntactic break, and this is made more noticeable by the fact that there
is a clause break between pādas c and d.

### 16  
Assuming that it is the serpent that is sitting in the depths, that is, that the
referent is Ahi Budhnya, who is found explicitly in vs. 17, I see no alternative to
taking the nom. sg. pres. part. sī́dan as the predicate of a nominal sentence in cd,
picking up the acc. obj. abjā́m …áhim in ab. Sāy. simply indicates that sī́dan is for
acc. sī́dantam, and Ge and Re tr. cd as it if were a rel. cl. (e.g., “qui siège …”), a
translational choice that blurs the Sanskrit. The alternative, which unifies the syntax
at the expense of the sense, is to take sī́dan as implicitly modifying the 1st sg. subj. of
gṛṇīṣe ‘I will sing’ in the first hemistich. So Scar (134): “… Den wassergeborenen
Drachen preise ich …, {ihn}, der auf dem Grund der Flüsse weilt, wenn ich im
Finstern sitze,” construing c (budhné nadī́nām) with the acc. serpent of ab and d
(rájassu ṣī́dan) with the 1st sg. subj. This interpr. seems highly unlikely: why would
the poet “I” be sitting in the darkness? and where does Scar get the “weilt” for the
serpent?
I do not understand the reason for the close sandhi of rájassu ṣī́dan.

### 17  
The first half vs. is also found in V.41.16, and in both places it is
metrically anomalous. Here it has the requisite 10 syllables for Dvipadā, but the
caesura/pāda break comes after the 4th syllable, so that it does not fall into two 5-syl
pādas. In V.41.16 (which, with the following vs. 17, is metrically different from the
Triṣṭubhs that make up the bulk of that hymn) it has 10 syllables, rather than the
expected 11. It is also somewhat striking that two vss. in our hymn are devoted to the
very minor divinity Ahi Budhnya, when far more important gods receive only one,
and I wonder if 17 hasn’t been inserted to make the identification of this divinity
clearer, since vs. 16 does not give him his full title. It is worth noting that our 17cd
was already flagged above as one of the few places in the hymn in which a verb
beginning the d pāda is not accented. This may provide further support for the idea
that the vs. is a later insertion.
47
47

### 18  
The nom. pl. subjects of the two half vss. are different, in my opinion. The
loc. ‘men’, recipients of the fame bestowed on them by (presumably) gods in ab, are
the ones who go forth for wealth in cd.
The phase śárdhanto aryáḥ has an almost identical correspondent in nearby

### 5  
sá śardhad aryó víṣuṇasya jantóḥ, where the second phrase shows (or at
least strongly suggests) that aryáḥ is gen. sg. On the phrase see Thieme (Fremdling
54–55).

### 19  
My tr. “the worlds” assumes that bhū́mā is pl., contrary to the standard,
who tr. “the earth.” I would be happy with the latter.
I have taken -senā- as ‘weapon’ here, but it could as well be ‘army’, with Ge,
Re, etc. It does not affect the sense appreciably.

### 20  
The pl. “wives” (pátnīḥ), as often in the RV, must refer to the Wives of
the Gods. As I have argued elsewhere (“‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual
Innovation?” 2018 in Proceedings of the 13th World Skt. Conf., 2006), one of the
models for the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pátnī) in Vedic ritual, beginning
in the late RV, is the presence of the Wives of the Gods on the ritual ground, as here.
Tvaṣṭar is their usual companion and chaperone. He is also associated with the
shaping of the embryo in the womb, as in the pregnancy charm X.184.1. The request
that he confer heroes on us here must be a prayer for sons (who will become) heroes.

### 21  
As noted above, the first hemistich contains 10 syllables falling into two
5-syllable pādas, but the second half is a straight Triṣṭubh, anticipating the Triṣṭubhs
of the rest of the hymn.
The stem vasūyú- can modify both masc. and, as here, fem. nouns. This exact
phrase, arámatir vasūyúḥ is also found at VII.1.6.

### 23  
Both Ge and Re take rā́yaḥ here as nom. sg., parallel to the other entities
like mountains and waters, but I do not see why the construction that ends vs. 22, ví
dadhātu rā́yaḥ “let him apportion wealth,” is not simply continued here. There rā́yaḥ
must be the obj. of the verb, whether acc. pl. or partitive gen. sg.; in either case the
preferred accent would be rāyáḥ, but there are enough forms with the opposite accent
that we need not be too troubled. If we can accept the wrong accent in 22d, I see no
reason not to do so in 23a. Re gestures towards my interpr. in his n.

### 24  
Note the izafe-like yé sahā́saḥ nominal relative clause.
Correctly accented gen. sg. rāyáḥ appears here; see comm. on vss. 22–23.
On the infinitive construction here, see Keydana, Infinitive im Ṛgveda, 70,
159.

### 25  
I do not understand why Ge and Re render the juṣanta, to the common and
well-understood medial stem juṣáte ‘enjoys’, as ‘grant’ (zibilligen) and ‘agree’
48
48
respectively. Although it is true that the final vss. of hymns frequently ask gods for
things, it is also true that we commend our praises to them -- and surely that’s what’s
going on here: we want the gods to take pleasure in the hymn, or the ritual in general,
that we have just offered them.
## 35
All Gods
As indicated in the publ. intro., this hymn is remarkably monotonous and has
no real content -- simply the unbroken repetition of the wish that various gods or
natural elements “be luck” (śám) for us. It therefore needs and deserves very little
comment. Besides the deities mentioned in each vs., what variety there is in the
hymn is found in the adjuncts associated with each one, often a characterizing
adjective (e.g., 1b) or an oblique case form expressing accompaniment (e.g., 1a) or
circumstance (e.g., 1d). The 1st 13 vss. follow a fairly rigid template: # śáṃ (naḥ)
GOD NAME (ADJUNCT) (“BE”) (with the latter expressed by a 3rd ps. impv. of √bhū or
√as, or gapped; there seems no functional difference between √as and √bhū in this
hymn). The order of adjunct and “be” can be flipped. Sometimes a single god (or god
pair) occupies a pāda; sometimes two separate śám clauses are found in a pāda. In the
former case, the adjuncts fill the extra space, while in the latter case the god/power
name is all there is room for. In a few cases, noted below, the pattern is broken by
the substitution of a verb other than ‘be’.

### 1  
This gods listed in this vs. are dual divinities, each with Indra as the first
part of the pair and all expressed in dual dvandvas. All have the expected double
accent except indrāgnī́in pāda a, which always lacks an accent on the first member
in its numerous occurrences. Re suggests this is because the putative dual ending on
*índrā- is not perceived because of its coalescence with the initial vowel of agnī́.
This is fairly plausible, though there are a number of instances where the word must
be read with four syllables and there the dual ending of the 1st member should have
been recoverable.

### 2  
In a and c the provider of luck is śáṃsaḥ ‘Laud’, a clear play on the
ubiquitous śám. In c śáṃsaḥ is the head of a NP with dependent gen.: satyásya
suyámasya.
In d Ge renders purujātáḥ as “der viele Nachkommen hat,” but given the form
of this cmpd., this can hardly be correct. Cmpds. of the shape puru-PAST PPL
(+ACCENT), like frequent puru-ṣṭutá-, puru-hutá-, mean ‘much Xed’ or ‘Xed by
many’, and in cmpds. with jāta- as 2nd member, -jāta- means ‘born, generated’ not
‘offspring’. Re, who tr. “aux nombreuses naissances,” suggests that Aryaman is so
qualified because of his association with marriage.

### 3  
Although sg. fem. urūcī́is not otherwise used of the earth in its 5 other
occurrences, the du. modifies ródasī in VI.11.4 (and at some distance in IV.56.4),
which supports Ge’s supplying of Earth here.
49
49
The well-attested adj. suháva- almost always modifies a god or gods and
means ‘easy to invoke’. Ge supplies ‘names’ here, and I follow him: “god X, easy to
invoke” and “the name of god X, easy to invoke” are functionally nearly identical.
And in X.39.1 pitúr ná nā́ma suhávam “(the chariot), easy to invoke like the name of
one’s father,” we have the posited phrase, though “name” is in a simile. Re rejects
this interpr. in favor of a nominalized suháva- “les appels propices (faits) aux dieux,”
with, in my opinion, insufficient reason.

### 4  
The relentless pattern “luck be” is briefly broken here in pāda d, with śám
the object of the verb ‘blow’ (śám … abhí vātu).

### 5  
Ge takes b as another break in the pattern: “Das Luftreich soll uns Glück
sehen lassen,” with śám the object of the inf. dṛśáye. But this seems unlikely: the
clause is easy to interpret within the template, and furthermore the periphrastic
causative assumed by his tr. would be awkwardly or impossibly expressed (lit. “let
the Midspace be for us to see luck”); to express such a meaning we would expect
rather a form of √kṛ (“let the Midspace make us to see luck”).

### 6  
The last pāda here again has a real verb ‘let hear’ (śṛṇotu), not simply ‘be’,
and śám is thus displaced from predicated nominative (“X be luck”) to adverbial
usage (“for luck”), with naḥ correspondingly promoted from dative (“for us”) to acc.
obj. of the verb (“hear us”). Note that this same construction might be found in pāda
b and c, which lack verbs, while pāda a must follow the usual pattern because of its
astu. Thus bc possibly, “let Varuṇa … (hear us); let Rudra … (hear) us.” However, I
think it likely that b+c simply follow a. In any case it’s striking (or at least striking in
a hymn that otherwise has so little variation) that the verbal construction changes
within the vs., while the pattern of personnel is rigidly fixed: each pāda contains a
single god as subject with an instr. pl. of his entourage.

### 8  
The first pāda again has a verb with content, úd etu ‘let go up’, and as in 6d
this slots śám into an adverbial role.

### 8  
bhavítra- is found only here in the RV. My “(the means of) Creation” gives
full functional value to the instrument suffix -tra-. Gr “die Welt,” Ge “Creatur (?),”
Re “le séjour-des-existences”; see Re’s n. for further, though inconclusive, disc. The
immed. preceding hymn contains janítra- (VII.34.2), which seems to mean
something similar, insofar as it’s possible to tell.
### 14–15
These last two vss. stand apart from the 13 monotonous vss. that
precede them, though they hardly have more content.

### 14  
The first hemistich refers, as often, to the hymn just concluding, with
particular insistence on its absolute currency in the present moment, as shown by the
50
50
pres. participle and the comparative adj. ‘newer’: idám bráhma kriyámānaṃ návīyaḥ
“this sacred formulation being made anew.”
Who the “cow-born ones” are is debated (see, e.g., Ge, Re, and the long n. by
Bl [RV Rep. 316–17]), a question I confess to finding not very interesting, perhaps
because the longueurs of this hymn have dulled my senses.
The last phrase of 14, the afterthought nominal rel. cl. utá yé yajñíyāsaḥ, is
probably meant to include all stray divinities and cosmic or natural elements that
don’t fall under the first three categories (heavenly, earthly, cow-born) but might
deserve worship. It might be better rendered “and those (others) who are worthy of
the sacrifice.”

### 15  
The just discussed phrase in 14d yé yajñíyāsaḥ is picked up by 15a yé
devā́nāṃ yajñíyā yajñíyānām. I assume that this phrase doesn’t introduce another
group of worthies, but is simply an intensive elaboration of the original phrase. The
next pāda qualifies them with another derivative of √yaj, the -tra-stem yájatra-,
which I interpr., somewhat capaciously, as meaning that they provide the occasion or
reason for Manu’s sacrifice.
## 36
All Gods
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn can be read as a progress through a
sacrifice. Re (EVP IV.97) follows Hillebrandt in seeing it as a “récitation du
pressurage vespéral.” Hillebrandt (Myth. II.128 n. 3) in fact considers it as forming,
with VII.37.1–7 and VII.38, an old śāstra for the Evening (or Third) Pressing.
Although the focus on Indra and the Ṛbhus in VII.37 does identify that hymn as
associated with the Third Pressing, I do not see that association here. The kindling of
the ritual fire that climaxes our vs. 1 (d) suggests rather the Morning Pressing, as
does the sun’s sending out the cows in 1b (so also Ge n. 1b). Moreover, most of the
gods named in our hymn are not Third Pressing gods; for example, the Maruts,
mentioned twice (vss. 7 and 9) are primarily associated with the Midday Pressing,
and though the Third Pressing begins with an Āditya cup (which could subsume
Mitra and Varuṇa), that pair is prominent in the Morning Pressing and are found here
in vs. 2; Sūrya (vs. 1) is certainly not appropriate to the Evening Pressing. As far as I
can, VII.36 and VII.37 are ritually independent.

### 1  
As Ge (n. 1a) and Re indicate, the opening of this hymn, with prá
bráhmaitu (that is, bráhma etu), is very like the opening of nearby VII.34.1 prá
śukraítu (=śukrā́etu) … manīṣā́, with both referring to the beginning of the ritual day
with the dispatch of the poets’ verbal offering to the gods.
Note the figure ví … sasṛje (b) / ví … sasre (c), both with 3rd sg. mid. perfects
built to phonologically similar roots and compounded (in tmesis) with the same
preverb.
Narten (1969 “Ai. sṛ in synchronischer und diachronischer Sicht” = Kl. Sch.
135–41) recognizes two synchronically distinct roots √sṛ, primarily act. ‘loslaufen,
eilen’ and primarily med. ‘sich ausstrecken’. The two forms of the med. pf. ví sasre
51
51
(here and X.71.4) belong to the latter root; see also Kü (553). The instr. sā́nunā I take
as idiomatic for “on her back,” rather than expressing something like “along the back
(of something else).” The other occurrence of the pf. ví sasre in X.71.4 contains an
explicitly sexual image utó tvasmai tanvàm vísasre, jāyéva pátye uśatī́suvā́sāḥ “And
for another she [=Speech] has stretched out her body, like an eager well-dressed wife
to her husband,” and the same picture of feminine yielding is presumably meant here.
Re curiously takes pṛthú prátīkam as a “pre-compound” modifying Agni, but I
follow Ge in taking it as an acc. construed with ádhi, a reference to the part of the
earth on which the ritual fire is kindled.

### 2  
My tr. of bruvāṇáḥ “when called upon” follows Thieme’s (Mitra and
Aryaman, p. 69), which in turn follows Meillet’s ([1907] “quand il est invoqué”; see
Thieme p. 40). Ge and Re both take bruvāṇáḥ as pass./reflex. ‘be called, call oneself’
with mitráh as predicate (e.g., “der Mitra (Freund) heisst”). I now think something
halfway between is probably correct. When √brū is not cmpded with a preverb, it
does not seem to take an acc. of addressee, so my passive version with addressee as
subj., “when called upon,” is probably wrong. However, I don’t think it’s a mere
naming construction. Rather, Thieme’s 1st tr. (p. 40) “Contract, when named …”
conveys the intent better: that, when the word -- and god -- alliance/Alliance is
spoken at the concluding of a pact, the pact acquires its efficacy. JPB’s tr. of the
almost identical III.59.1 “Mitra arranges the peoples when (Alliance) is declared”
cleverly plays on the ambiguity of the word mitrá-, and I would substitute something
like that here.

### 3  
The general consensus, beginning with Sāy. (see also Ge, Re [by
implication], Lüders 395, Oberlies RdRV II.213), is that this vs. describes the rainy
season, with Parjanya as the divinity. But in a hymn with such a strong ritual focus,
such a detour into meteorology would seem out of place. I think that it instead
concerns soma/Soma, but, as so often, with a cosmic nimbus surrounding this ritual
substance. It is, of course, a commonplace that Soma in the IXth Maṇḍala is
regularly called a bull; cf. one of the many passages, with the same verb of roaring as
here: IX.82.1ab … sómaḥ … vṛ́ṣā … acikradat. The association of Soma with heaven
in IX is also too ubiquitous to need demonstration, as consultation (passim) of the 2nd
vol. of Oberlies’s Relig. Ṛgveda, devoted to the Soma hymns (e.g., “Der Himmel als
Heimat des Soma” [14–16]), amply demonstrates. For Soma circling “a great
heavenly seat” (máhi sádma daívyam) see IX.83.5. That Soma as cosmic bull evokes
the concept of the thunderstorm, as I think this vs. does, is quite different from
declaring that the vs. directly depicts the storm.
Under my interpr., the sū́dāḥ (for further on this word see below) that swell
like milk-cows would be the soma stalks after their soaking or even the cows that
provide the milk to mix with the just-pressed soma. Pāda a is more difficult to fit into
this scenario. The quieting of the wind does not have an unambiguous analogue in
the soma sacrifice. It could refer to the common dying of wind at evening, but this
would require following Hillebrandt’s view that this is an Evening Pressing hymn, a
52
52
suggestion rejected above. In IX.22.2 the surging of the soma juices is compared to
that of the wind, and so our passage might refer to arresting the flow of the soma
when it is mixed with milk. But I do not consider this a strong suggestion and remain
uncertain how to fit pāda a into the overall ritual focus.
I assign rante (so Pp.) to √rā3 ‘(come to) rest’ (so also Lub), along with ranta
in I.61.11 and nearby VII.39.3, contra the various other interpr. to be found in the lit.
I see no reason not to read the prim. ending -ante indicated by its sandhi situation and
restored by the Pp., despite Lub’s entry “ranta!,” suggesting a sec. ending and
injunctive form. As far as I can see this isolated stem can be as easily a root present
as the root aorist identified by Lub.
The meaning of the word sū́da- is much disputed. It occurs three times
uncompounded in the RV (here and in IX.97.44 and X.61.2), as well as once in sū́dadohas- (VIII.69.3). Gr’s ‘Süssigkeit, süsser Trank’, which I essentially follow, has
been rejected by most comm. and tr. since, starting with Pischel, who interprets it as
‘Somabeisatz’, referring to the extras added to the soma. Another strain of interpr., in
part dependent on post-RVic passages, takes it as referring to small bodies of
standing water. For disc. and various alternate tr., see, e.g., Old, Noten II.263–64;
Bloomfield, RR 101; KEWA III.493 (with fuller disc. than EWA II.740); Re comm.
ad loc. The general opinion is that there are at two distinct words sū́da-. In our
passsage Ge renders it as ‘die Lachen’ (pools) and Re as ‘les mares’ (ponds). While I
have not investigated the post-RVic ritual passages, which may belong elsewhere, I
see no reason that the RVic occurrences can’t be united under one rubric. The
passage in IX.97.44 refers to the preparation of soma and in fact seems almost to
gloss the phrase mádhvaḥ sū́dam pavasva “Purify yourself into the sweetness of
honey” in its pāda a by svádasva … pávamānaḥ “sweeten yourself as you purify
yourself.” X.61.2 is an obscure mythological snippet in a hymn bristling with
difficulties, and the use of the word there contributes little or nothing to our
understanding of its sense. The cmpd sū́da-dohas- in VIII.69.3 modifies cows in a
passage that also treats the preparation of soma and seems to mean something like
“milking out the sweetness / giving the sweetening milk”; we can compare the rootnoun cmpd havya-sū́d- ‘sweetening/preparing the oblation’ (I.93.12, IV.50.5), also
containing a form of sūd and also modifying cows, in soma-preparation context. It is
esp. telling that in I.93.12 the cows are urged to ‘swell’ (ā́pyāyantām), just as the
sū́daḥ in our passage are compared to cows and they ‘swell’ (ápīpayanta). The only
passage in the RV that might favor a ‘puddle / pool / pond’ interpr. is the one under
disc. here, and that is because the vs. has been interpr. (wrongly in my view; see
above) as referring to the thunderstorm, whereas I think it is clear that soma
preparation is at issue here as well as in the other sū́da- passages. Though I still
believe that the word is related to the ‘sweet’ root, my interpr. of sū́da- is otherwise
in line with Pischel’s -- I think it likely refers to the sweetness(es) that are added to
the pressed soma -- though I have not arrived at this interpr. by the same route as
Pischel. Since sū́da- is elsewhere a noun, I would slightly alter my tr. here to “the
sweetness(es) have swelled like milk-cows,” though the barbarity of the plural
‘sweetnesses’ would preclude allowing it in the publ. tr.

The construction of this vs. is skewed: the first hemistich contains a typical
generalizing rel. cl. referring to proper ritual performance (“who[ever] will yoke
…”). It is couched in the 3rd sg. and contains a pres. subjunctive (yunájat). In the 2nd
hemistich, pāda c contains another 3rd sg. rel. cl., this time with a pres. indic. (or
possibly subj.) (minā́ti), but without a ritual focus, and pāda d contains a 1st sg.
optative that does relate to the ritual (vavṛtyā́m). This ill-assorted trio of clauses has
been variously treated. Ge thinks that both rel. clauses have gods as subject, though
not necessarily the same god (see n. 4), and that at least the rel. cl. of c has
aryamáṇam in d as referent of the rel. prn. Re, mostly flg. Sāy., takes a pious human
as subject of ab and supplies a main cl. with it. I think rather that d provides the main
cl. for ab, with c a distinct rel. cl. dependent on d, and that there is a switch of
reference between the 3rd sg. yáḥ … yunájat of the first hemistich and 1st ps. vavṛtyām
of d: “I” am the embodiment of the proper ritual actor as defined in ab. The rel. cl. of
c is quite distinct and does indeed depend on aryáman- in d; the god I wish to bring
here to my ritual is the one who can neutralize the battle fury of my (and his) enemy.
Switch of reference between 3rd ps. and 2nd ps., even within a single vs., is extremely
common when referring to gods, and I see no reason why a similar switch between
3rd and 1st would not be possible when referring to the poet/ritual officiant. For a 1st
ps. version of the 1st pāda, cf. I.82.6 yunájmi te bráhmaṇā keśínā hárī (also III.35.4,
VII.19.6).
dhāyú- is a hapax. Gr glosses ‘durstig’, connecting it to √dhā ‘suckle’. Old
suggests, quite doubtfully, that it belongs rather to √dhāv ‘run’, and this suggestion
underlies Ge’s ‘rennlustig’; see also AiG II.2.470, where it is explained as showing
an exchange between -v- and -y-. EWA s.v. (rightly) rejects this root affiliation, in
favor or one suggested by Gotō (1st Kl. 179 n. 311) to √dhan1
’id.’. Re tr. ‘riches en
dons’, but suggests an association with dhā́yas- ‘nourishment, sustenance’, bringing
us back to Gr’s and indeed Whitney’s (Roots) root etym. to √dhā ‘suckle’. My
‘seeking fodder’ reflects the same association.
Note the faint phonological figure of (b) suráthā śūra dhā(yu) / d su(k)rát(um).
I follow JPB (Ādityas, 171–72) in taking aryáman- here as a descriptor of
Indra. As Brereton points out, it makes no sense for Aryaman to appear when the
poet is seeking to attract Indra. Moreover, the action of pāda c, confounding battle
fury, is much more appropriate for Indra (cf., e.g., nearby VII.18.16 índro manyúm
manyumyò mimāya), who is also the most common referent for the adj. sukrátu-
‘very resolute’.

### 5  
Ge and Re in their different ways attempt to wring a more palatable tr.
from yajante than the VP should allow. The problem is that the acc. with this verb
here is not a god, the usual object, but two desirable qualities of a god, namely
fellowship/companionship and vitality/vigor. In Ge’s rendering the reverent ones
“request” these qualities (erbitten); in Re’s they “obtain them by sacrifice.” But
though Re claims that this is the meaning of medial forms of √yaj, in fact
uncompounded middles take the god sacrificed to, just like active forms; cf. nearby
54
54

### 3  
yájasva … devā́n. It is forms (both act. and mid.) compounded with ā́that
acquire the meaning ‘obtain by sacrifice’. I therefore think the abstract qualities
fellowship and vitality must be the objects of our sacrifice/worship, standing in for
their divine possessor.
I take ṛtásya dhā́man “domain of truth” as referring to the ritual ground (as
does Sāy.).
Ge’s tr. of bābadhe tentatively connects it with √bandh ‘bind’ (flg. Sāy.), not
√bādh ‘(op)press’ (see his n. 5c). But √bandh otherwise lacks a pf. in the RV and
beginning in the AV its weak forms have a base bedh-. The standard weak 3rd sg. pf.
to √bādh is babādhé; see Kü 330–31. Schaeffer (156) takes bābadhe as an intens.
pres., parallel to badbadhé with both following the standard perfect in function, and
Kü (331; cf. also 488) seems to follow, though he takes badbadhé as an intensive
perfect, distinguished from the present bābadhe. Since all these stems have a 3rd sg.
ending characteristic of the perfect, I consider at least bābadhe to be a straight
perfect, with adjustment of the vowel length of redupl. and root syllable to conform
better to such distribution elsewhere in the perfect system; cf. esp. vāvṛdhé versus
vavárdha. The intens. badbadhé then adopted the inflectional patterns of the other
two redupl. stems. As for what the verb means here, although ví √bādh generally has
a negative sense ‘thrust away (undesirable things)’, here I think the same literal sense
refers to the god’s pushing out towards us the pṛ́kśaḥ ‘fortifying nourishments’ we
want in exchange for praise. Re (comm.) suggests a slightly different semantic
pathway.

### 6  
According to Old and Ge, this vs. consists only of dependent clauses, and
this is certainly true descriptively: there are two subordinate clauses marked by the
subordinating conj. yád ‘when’ (a) and the rel. prn. yā́ḥ (c), one accented verb
(suṣváyanta) in the rel. cl. of c, and no main verbs. In the publ. tr. I take d as a covert
main clause, signalled only by the preverb abhí, with which I supply a verb of
motion. However, it is perfectly possible that d is simply a continuation of the rel. cl.
of c, though I do not then know what to do with the abhí init. in d. Under the interpr.
with cd as rel. clause the 2nd hemistich would simply be “who are richly fertile, rich
in milk, rich in streams, swelling with their own milk.” In any case, if it lacks a main
clause, the vs. cannot be attached either to preceding vs. 5 or following vs. 7; it
would have to be an independent if incomplete structure.
The first hemistich lacks a finite verb, and in my view the participle
vāvaśānā́ḥ (whether pf. or intens.; Kü 488 [and Schaeffer by omission] favor the
former) serves as predicate. However, both Ge and Re supply a verb of motion,
presumably on the basis of initial ā́: “her(kommen)” and “ar(rivent).” This is of
course possible. Both Ge and Re also take the part. vāvaśānā́ḥ as belonging to the pf.
of √vaś ‘desire’, whose participle is homonymous with that of √vāś:
“zusammenverlangend” and “riches en désirs” respectively. Although this cannot be
faulted formally, the well-known noise-making quality of rivers (embodied in the
very word nadī́-) provides a more vivid image and, on the other hand, it is not clear
what the rivers would be eager for.
55
55
On the near-hapax suṣváyanta see my -áya-Formations (52–53), where I
argue that the other occurrence of the stem, act. part. suṣváyantī (X.110.6=AV
V.27.8) is founded upon this passage and that the form here has been generated in the
playful and alliterative context of this vs. (see esp. the following su- adjectives
sudúghāḥ sudhārā́ḥ) loosely to suṣū́- ‘well-bearing’, a connection already suggested
by Weber (see Old). Such a derivation matches the theme of the rivers’ burgeoning
fertility that dominates the vs.

### 7  
HvN’s restoration of the pausal form at the end of c as caránti is incorrect;
it must be carántī, as the Pp. has it.
Ge suggests that the ‘imperishable’ (ákṣarā), an esoteric designation for ‘cow’,
is the Dakṣiṇā, while Sāy. thinks rather of Vāc. In this Marut vs. I wonder if it
doesn’t refer to their mother Pṛśni.
For the phrase yújyam … rayím see VIII.46.19.
The nom. pl. té is very oddly positioned, in the middle of both clause and pāda,
breaking up the NP yújyam … rayím, and not even adjoining the caesura. I have no
explanation.

### 8  
The NP dhiyó avitā́ram, characterizing Bhaga, reprises the VP dhíyam …
avantu in 7b, where the Maruts were the subject.
The phrase sātaú vā́jam in d is somewhat problematic. Ge takes it, without
comment, as equivalent to the common vā́jasya sātaú (e.g., VII.21.7) with a genitive:
“bei dem Gewinnen des Preises.” Re follows, commenting “seul exemple de sātíavec régime Acc.” But this is the problem: although the dative inf. sātáye regularly
takes the acc. (e.g., IX.8.2 sātáye vásūni), the loc. to the same stem never does. And
in fact even the dative, when construed with vā́ja-, takes the gen.: vā́jasya sātáye
(V.9.7, VI.60.13, IX.7.9, X.93.10). In the one apparent exception, IX.68.7 vā́jam ā́
darṣi sātáye, the acc. is actually object of the main verb. I therefore think that vā́jam
here has to be an obj. of prá … kṛṇudhvam, parallel to the divinities and semidivinities in the vs.

### 9  
On niṣikta-pā́- see Old and now Scar (306).
I take prajā́yai as a quasi-infinitive. See also X.73.5.
## 37
All Gods
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is primarily devoted to the Ṛbhus (vss.
1–2) and Indra (vss. 3–7), which associates the hymn with the Third Pressing.

### 1  
The function of abhí, initial in c, is unclear; the verb of this hemistich,
pṛṇadhvam, final in d, does not appear with abhí elsewhere.
On the triple-backed (tripṛṣṭhá-) soma, see Ge’s n. 1c, where he suggests
among other possibilities that it refers to the three ingredients making up the soma
drink (soma juice, water, and milk).
56
56
### 1–2
The stationing of the adj. ámṛkta- ‘indestructible’ at the end of the b
pādas of both vss., in each case some distance from its noun, is clearly deliberate, but
I’m not sure what it’s signaling.

### 3  
There is some lexical chaining here: in pāda a the standing epithet of Indra,
maghavan, picks up the pl. maghávatsu in 2a (in the same metrical position), thus
implicitly asserting an identification of the human patrons of 2 with Indra. The quasiinf. deṣṇám (trisyllabic, to be read dayiṣṇám), also in pāda a, echoes dayadhvam at
the end of vs. 2. Although deṣṇá- is standardly taken as a deriv. of √dā ‘give’ (so
already Gr., also AiG II.2.927–28, EWA s.v. DĀ, II.714), it is at least secondarily
associated with √day ‘distribute’ here. A more distant, and less telling, lexical echo
is pūrṇā́‘full’ with 1d pṛṇadhvam ‘fill!’.
Note the abundance of vásu- forms (vásunaḥ b, vásunā c, vasavyā̀d).
For d Ge (n. 3d) appositely cites VIII.32.15 nákir asya … niyantā́sūnṛ́tānām,
which he tr. ad loc. as “Keiner tut … seinen Gnadegaben Einhalt,” with sūnṛ́tānām
an objective gen. with niyantā́. I am therefore puzzled as to why he does not take
sūnṛ́tā here as standing for acc. pl. sūnṛ́tāḥ in sandhi, as the obj. of ní yamate, the
same lexeme as in VIII.32.15. Instead he follows the Pp. in taking it as nom. sg.
sūnṛ́tā, subj. of the verb: “Deine Grossmut hält die Schätze nicht zurück” (sim. Re).
My tr. takes account of VIII.32.15 and goes against the Pp.

### 4  
The connection of the first two vss., dedicated to the Ṛbhus, and the
subsequent Indra vss. is made clear here: Indra is called ṛbhukṣán- (cf. the pl. applied
to the Ṛbhus in 1b, 2b) in pāda a and compared with vā́ja- in b. Vāja is of course the
name of one of the Ṛbhus, and they are all addressed as vājāḥ in 1b. Both Ge and Re
take the simile vā́jo ná as containing the PN (e.g., “comme un Vāja”), though Ge
allows the common noun sense as an alternate (“wie der gute Vāja [die gute Beute]”),
but I think the comparison is stronger if the ‘prize’ sense is more prominent and the
relationship to the Ṛbhu name is backgrounded. However, I would now emend the tr.
to recognize the PN explicitly: “Like a prize [/like (the Ṛbhu) Vāja] …”
Pāda b, with its description of Indra going home, is reminiscent of the envoi
in the fallow-bay-yoking oblation at the end of the soma sacrifice (cf., e.g., I.82a,
III.53.4-6) and is therefore appropriate to the Third Pressing context.

### 5  
This vs. presents minor problems of syntax and the uncertain fit of certain
lexical items. In the first pāda it is not clear what the pravátaḥ are that Indra
regularly gains for his devotee. The stem pravát- generally refers to a slope or
sloping course. Ge takes it as an abstract Vorsprung (lead or advantage), Re as a
course, Tichy (Nom.ag. 307) as “die schnellen Wege” (with !). I think the clue is
found in nearby VII.32.27 VII.32.27 tváyā vayám pravátaḥ śáśvatīr apò 'ti śúra
tarāmasi “with you let us cross over the (river-)courses one after another, cross over
the waters, o champion.” Here as well the reference seems to be to Indra’s aiding us
in gaining new lands by crossing river after river.
57
57
As for pāda b, all three just-named scholars take dhībhíḥ as part of the main
clause found in pāda a and embed the first part of b within this frame. Cf., e.g., Ge’s
“Du gewinnst selbst … den Vorsprung ab nach den Absichten, mit denen du (etwas)
unternimmst.” But, though convenient, this kind of embedding is foreign to RVic
sentence structure. Instead I think we must take the rel. prn. yā́bhiḥ as coreferential
with pravátaḥ in the main cl. (pravát- being, of course, fem.). The instr. of pravátgenerally expresses extent: ‘along the slope (etc.)’ (e.g., VIII.5.37=13.8=IX.24.2 ā́po
ná pravátā yatī́ḥ “like waters going along a slope”), and so here I assume that Indra
accomplishes his work (víveṣaḥ), that is, assures victory for us, along the rivercourses that are being fought for. The other instr. fem. in this hemistich, dhībhíḥ, is
then independent of yā́bhiḥ and part of the rel. cl. that yā́bhiḥ introduces, and I take it
in the same sense as the instr. matíbhiḥ in 2d and dhiyā́in 6c: “in accord with
[thought/vision].”
The success of Indra’s activities on our behalf is announced in c and his help
duly noted. The number mismatch in the instr. phrase yújyābhir ūtī́is common in
Triṣṭubh cadences containing inst. ūtí-, truncated from iambic cadences (dimeter /
Jagatī) of the type … víśvābhir ūtíbhiḥ (I.23.6 etc., etc.). See further disc. ad VI.10.5.

### 6  
The trans.-/caus. vāsáyasi is here used in a curious idiomatic sense. The
other two occurrences of this stem, nearby each other in III.1.17, 7.3, are
straightforward in function: ‘cause to dwell / settle down’. But here the verb is used
in a complaint: ‘cause to wait, cool one’s heels, hang around, bide one’s time’. The
idiom is reinforced by the very rare use of the simile particle iva with a verb. My
“seem to be …” is meant to capture this iva; it could also be rendered ‘as it were’. Ge
(n. 6) suggests that this is a hint to the poet’s patron that he (the poet) has been
waiting too long for his dakṣiṇā.
The adj. tātyá- is a transparent deriv. of the familiar word for father, tatá-
‘daddy, papa’. I therefore think the rather formal register of Ge’s väterlich and Re’s
paternel strike the wrong note; surely the idea is that Indra’s dhī́- is affectionate and
indulgent.

### 7  
The sense and syntax of this vs. are extremely challenging. My interpr.
differs from those of the other standard tr. I will not treat these in detail, but will note
two important points of difference. I do not think that Indra is the referent of yám in
pāda a (as, e.g., Old does), and I do not think that tribandhú- in c is a PN, much less a
reference to Vasiṣṭha (see, e.g., Ge, Mayr PN s.v.).
My sense of the structure of the vs. is that the two outer pādas (a, d), which
match by virtue of being relative clauses introduced by yám, go together, with the
referent of the yám the same in each: a mortal man beset by difficulties. These
relative clauses depict the same unfortunate situation, the dissolution and isolation of
this man. The two inner pādas (b, c) are the main clause (or a subordinate and a main
clause in b and c respectively) and present Indra as the antidote and refuge for the
unfortunate mortal. This complicates the clause relations but has the virtue of making
sense (some sense, anyway). Many details remain to be discussed, however.
58
58
In pāda a the VP (abhí yám … ī́se) is puzzling: √īś does not otherwise occur
with abhí, and it is found overwhelmingly with a genitive, not an accusative
complement. (For disc. of other possible acc. exx. cited by Gr., see comm. ad
VII.32.18. Commenting on this passage, Re suggests that √īś appears with the acc.
only when it is a pronoun, but this is not borne out by the distribution; among other
things, there are plenty of pronominal genitives with √īś.) Here the clue to the usage
is provided by a passage in the next hymn (cited by Old), VII.38.4 abhí yáṃ devy
áditir gṛṇā́ti, which has the identical structure, save for a different named goddess
(also a -ti-abstract) and a different verb, gṛṇā́ti (against our abhí yáṃ devy nírṛtiś cid
ī́śe). The root √gṝ regularly takes both abhí and the acc. In VII.38.4 the one referred
to by yám is benevolently greeted by the benevolent goddess Aditi; our passage
seems to have been constructed as a deliberate contrast to this happy scene, with the
malevolent goddess Nirṛti extending her sway to an unfortunate mortal. (The
passages differ in one notable way, however: in VII.48.4 the referent of yám is the
god Savitar.) The pairing of the two passages accounts for the unexpected preverb
and unexpected accusative with ī́śe in our passage.
The middle pādas referring to Indra (in my view) present the god as a sort of
venerable figure with whom the beleaguered man of pāda a (and d) can take refuge.
Indra’s venerable status results from the years that have accumulated for him, as
pāda b indicates, and in c the subject (who, in my opinion, is the mortal man referred
to by the rel. pronouns in a and d) approaches Indra because of the god’s attainment
of age. That old age is presented as a positive feature of Indra also gives the mortal
reassurance that his own aging can likewise be positive.
As already noted, I do not follow the almost universal interpr. of the hapax
tribandhú- as a PN nor the further identification of that PN with Vasiṣṭha. Instead I
take it as the bahuvrīhi it is in full lexical value: ‘having three bonds’, with the bonds
referring to kinship as bándhu- does so often. I further think that this is a reference to
the three-generations model so prevalent later: a man with both father and son (or
perhaps, as later, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather), ensuring the continuity
of the male line and, esp. later, the śrāddha offerings to the ancestors. Although this
theme is not prominent in the RV, it can be discerned indirectly in several passages;
see X.135 (and my article “The Earliest Evidence for the Inborn Debts of a Brahmin:
A New Interpretation of Ṛgveda X.135,” Journal asiatique 302.2 [2014]: 245–57)
and VI.20.11 (also discussed in that article, as well as comm. ad loc.). A man who
had achieved the tribandhú state would be well along in years, and his approach to a
similarly aging Indra would be appropriate. In fact, the depiction of Indra at this
stage of life in this vs. contrasts strongly with the usual representation of Indra as
young and virile. Note that tribandhú- may form a faint ring with tripṛṣṭhá- ‘threebacked’ in 1c.
In d we return to the afflictions visited on our unhappy man -- this time by
(other) mortals. Thus a and d show him as the target of a divinity (the devī́Nirṛti, a)
and men (mártāḥ, d), with Indra as the literal intercessor. Both Ge and Re tr. the
clear subjunctive kṛṇávanta in d as a preterite (“beraubt haben,” “ont rendu”), but
there is no justification for this and neither provides one. Exactly what the other
59
59
mortals will or would do isn’t entirely clear to me, and it depends in great part on
how we interpret -veśa- in the compd ásvaveśa-. In V.85.7, containing an array of
apparently non-kin relationships, JPB tr. ‘neighbor’; in IV.3.13, again in a set of
calibrated relationships, I do so as well, though in X.49.5 I render it as ‘vassal’. Here,
if I am correct about the sense of tribandhú-, -veśa- should refer to a relationship
outside the close family line. The sense would be: when mortals deprive him of his
non-blood (or less closely related) associates (pāda d), he still has his tight paternal
lineage (tribandhú- pāda c). My ‘clansmen’ could be correct (based on the usual
sense of víś-), but ‘neighbor’ or even ‘vassal’ (or Re’s ‘clientèle’) could, too. I do not
think Ge’s Anhang fits, however.

### 8  
The first pāda of this vs., ā́no … stavádhyai, is reminiscent of 1a ā́vo …
stavádhyai, and thus forms a ring, already anticipated by the echo of 1c tripṛṣṭhaíḥ in
7c tribandhúḥ. However, it also makes an appeal to Savitar, who does not figure
otherwise in the hymn, and thus seems to anticipate the first two vss. of the next
hymn, VII.38, which are dedicated to that god. Indeed the Anukr. identifies that
whole hymn as dedicated to Savitar, but see publ. intro. to VII.38 for the view that it
really is an All God hymn.
## 38
Savitar [/All Gods]
On the likelihood that this is actually an All Gods hymn, despite the Anukr.’s
ascription to Savitar and the domination of Savitar in the first vss., see publ. intro.

Ge takes ápi … astu as “…soll Anteil (an Opfer) haben,” but this isn’t

On the close parallel to our pāda a in the previous hymn, see comm. ad

The sequence váruṇaḥ … mitrā́so aryamā́presents a twist on the usual trio of
the principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, since mitrā́saḥ is plural and, as
Ge suggests (n. 4d), must be a word play, referring to the common noun mitrá- ‘ally’.
Obviously the god Mitra must also be referenced, with mitrā́saḥ found in Mitra’s
usual place in the sequence of names.

### 5  
On this assortment of minor divinities, see publ. intro. In particular,
ékadhenu- ‘having one milk-cow’ is a hapax, and who these beings are is otherwise
unknown.
The structure of the vs. is quite loose. The initial abhí invites us to group the
vs. with the preceding one, where abhí opens three of the four pādas (a, c, d) as the
preverb with two forms of the root √gṝ (gṛṇā́ti a, gṛṇanti c). This is indeed how I
construe it, with the main cl. represented only by abhí and a gapped *gṛṇanti (hence
60
60
my “(as do) those”), and the rest of the first hemistich occupied by the rel. cl.
introduced by yé. In other words, the Gift Escorts, described in the relative clause,
also greet Savitar. The root √sap does not otherwise appear with abhí (anywhere in
Skt. as far as I know; pace Gr). Therefore taking the whole of the 1st hemistich,
beginning with abhí, as a single rel. cl. (as Ge seems to) is not a favored option, esp.
since there is no corresponding main clause in the vs.: the 2nd hemistich has a set of
new sg. subjects and singular verbs. Ge is forced to take it as a syntactic truncation;
see his —. Re gets out of this difficulty by supplying a pl. impv. to √śru for ab
“(qu’ils nous écoutent),” parallel to śṛṇotu in c, but the abhí of pāda a seems to me to
point to a connection with the previous vs. as just argued.
I do not understand what mithó vanúṣaḥ is meant to convey -- perhaps that the
Gift Escorts avidly compete with each other to provide the best service? IX.97.37
sápanti yám mithunā́so níkāmāḥ, adhvaryávaḥ … is similar, with both √sap and a
form of √mith and with níkāma- ‘eager’ semantically matching our vanúṣ-; there the
sense seems to be that the Adhvaryus of various sacrifices compete with each other
to be best at serving Soma (“whom they serve, eager in rivalry -- the Adhvaryus …”).
The VP rātím √sap seems almost to be a gloss of the root-noun compd. rātiṣā́c- and might help us determine the function of this enigmatic group of divinities or
semi-divinities. The use of a transitive VP as apparent gloss makes it unlikely (at
least to me) that -sā́c- has a passive / intransitive sense in the cmpd (Scar’s ‘von
Gaben begleitet’ [593, Ge sim.], Re’s ‘qui ont le don pour attribut’). Gr’s transitive
‘Gabe gewährend, Spende betreibend’ is closer to the mark, though muddling the
sense of the root √sac.
The conj. utá is oddly positioned in the middle of its pāda, and it is not clear
what it’s conjoining. Klein (DGRV I.380) follows Re in positing an ellipsed
*śṛnvantu in the 1st hemistich, with the utá conjoining that clause with the śṛṇotu
clause here. But even were we to supply that verb (see above for reasons not to), utá
would still be out of position: we would expect it pāda-initial. I think that the utá is
loosely conjoining this clause with what precedes, but that this does not require
matching verbs. I further think that it has been postponed in order to allow áhiḥ to
take initial position, in order to echo the abhí’s that open this vs. (5a) and three of the
pādas in the preceding vs. (4a, c, d). Notably, two of the twelve pādas containing áhir
budhnyàḥ elsewhere in the RV are opened by utá (I.186.5, VI.50.14), with the latter
almost identical to ours except for the order of utá and the divine name: VI.50.14 utá
nó ‘hir budhnyàḥ śṛṇotu. This would give support to my view that the ordinary order
was disrupted to allow the semi-rhyme of #abhí / #áhi(ḥ). (Note that when utá was
moved to mid-pāda, it took the Wackernagel-positioned naḥ along with it.)

### 6  
The presence of yā́ti ‘begs’ in d solidifies the affiliation to the same root of
the mid. part. iyānáḥ in b. I follow Re in taking the part. as a passive, though this
interpr. is somewhat problematic The pāda also appears identically in VII.52.3b,
where the participle has transitive, though self-beneficial, usage. Ge takes it that way
here as well (“darum bittend”), and Bl (RR, ad our passage) claims that there is “no
good reason” to take iyānáḥ passively here. However, the context favors a passive
61
61
interpr.: Bhaga gives the treasure away when we (or the powerless one of d) beg for
it; I do not think Bhaga is himself begging it from Savitar, as an intermediate step
before giving it away himself. Moreover, the same mid. part. is regularly used in the
passive; cf., e.g., VII.17.7, 29.1 also in VII. Although I am reluctant to give identical
pādas, esp. in the same maṇḍala, different interpretations, in this case the
multivalence of the medial voice of this root (finite ī́mahe is regularly transitive, e.g.)
allows the same sequence to be used in two different ways.
### 7–8
These last two vss. concern the vājínaḥ ‘prize-winners’. As indicated in
the publ. intro., although most (in addition to the usual tr., see Oberlies RdV II.240)
take these to be horses, as so often, I instead take the referent of vājín- to be the
Maruts. In an All God hymn the default expectation is that gods are the dedicands.
And there are numerous phraseological parallels that support the identification. See
esp. nearby VII.36.7, where the Maruts are called vājínaḥ, as well as in the
immediately preceding hymn, where VII.35.9 śáṃ no bhavantu marútaḥ svarkā́ḥ is
almost identical, save for the expressed subj., to our 7ab śáṃ no bhavantu vājínaḥ …
svarkā́ḥ. The stem svarká- occurs only 3 times; besides these two occurrences, the
third, in I.88.1, refers to the Maruts’ chariots. The voc. phrase amṛtā ṛtājāḥ in our 8b
is found also, addressed to the Maruts, in V.57.8 ámṛtā ṛ́tājāḥ (accented).

### 7  
The cmpd. sanemí- lit. means ‘along with its/the felly’ (see, e.g., AiG III.75,
EWA s.v. némi-), but is a way to express ‘entirely’ (“felly and all”): “with all its
gear,” “bag and baggage,” “lock, stock, and barrel” are idiomatic English equivalents.

### 8  
It is appropriate that the vājíns should be the topic in a clause with the
āmreḍita loc. absol. vā́je-vāje. The etym. figure would be clearer if the loc. had been
tr. “whenever prizes (are at stake)” vel sim.
## 39
All Gods

### 1  
The first pāda somewhat echoes the first hemistich of the preceding hymn
(VII.38.1ab), with the final verb aśret mimicking likewise final áśiśret in 38.1b and
the verb’s object sumatím resembling amátim in 38.1b and in the same metrical
position. This is perhaps an additional reason to consider VII.38 to be fundamentally
an All God hymn properly situated in the All God cycle, rather than an intrusive
hymn to Savitar. See disc. in the publ. intro. to VII.38.
I do not know the referent of vásvaḥ. Perhaps, given the connections with
VII.38.1, it is Savitar. The same phrase sumatím (…) vásvaḥ is found in III.4.1 (an
Āprī hymn), but the referent is no clearer there. Ge suggests that the referent is Agni
himself. This would work in both passages and may be correct; inter alia Agni is
frequently the referent of vásu-, but the non-signalling of coreference with the
subject still seems a little odd. The pl. vásavaḥ appears in vs. 3 modifying the gods.
On the idiom PATH √bhaj see comm. ad VII.18.16.
62
62
The publ. tr. fails to render naḥ in d. I would emend to “will offer our true
(hymn)” or “will offer for us …”
Both Ge and Re avoid making ṛtám obj. of yajāti, both by making it an
adverbially used acc. of respect (vel sim.): “… möge er … das Opfer richtig [my
italics] vollziehen” and “(selon) l’Ordre.” I follow Lü (436–39, esp. 439) in
considering ṛtám ‘truth’ here a representation of ‘hymn’: “… möge … ein Lied
darbringen.”

### 2  
This vs. presents a number of minor problems. The first is the usage of the
verb in pāda a, med. pf. prá vāvṛje. Ge and Re interpr. it as passive, e.g. “Das Barhis
ist … gelegt,” as does Kü (461). Since this is the only med. form of the pf., against
several act. transitive ones, this is possible, but it should be noted that med. forms of
the present are generally transitive. Cf. very similar VII.18.4 prá vṛñjate … barhíḥ,
where the 3rd pl. form of the verb precludes a passive reading. Moreover, the passive
reading would require the adj. suprayā́(ḥ) to modify neut. barhíḥ; in my opinion
(contra Gr and possibly Ge, Re; see also Old’s somewhat cryptic n. to II.3.5), this
form belongs to the s-stem suprayás- and is a nom. sg. masc., but even if this
grammatical analysis is incorrect, I do not see any way to get a properly inflected
neut. sg. in -ā(ḥ) out of any possible stem. The difficulty disappears if we take vāvṛje
as transitive, supplying Agni from vs. 1 as subject. Undoubted acc. forms of the sstem adj. (suprayásam) modify Agni 3 times out of the 4 clear occurrences of the
stem (II.2.1, 4.1, VI.11.4). Although Agni in his physical form as fire is not a likely
twister of barhis, of course, he has just been identified as a Hotar in 1d and in his
priestly role could perform other priestly actions.
I take eṣām as gen. for dat., as often, and referring to the gods (so also Ge, Re).
As noted in the publ. intro., the hapax bī́riṭa (in sandhi; Pp. bī́riṭe) in b is
completely opaque. See EWA s.v. The only thing that is clear is that it has aberrant,
non-Indo-Aryan phonology, with plain b and unmotivated retroflex ṭ. It is not even
evident what grammatical form it might be: standing next to dual viśpatī́, it might be
expected to be a dual as well. Indeed a pragṛhya bī́riṭe would be better metrically, as
Old points out. If the sandhi represented in the Saṃhitā text is correct, however, it
could be a loc. in -e. Both Ge and Re take it as such, following in their tr. Yāska’s
gloss gaṇa- (see also Kuiper, Aryans 31 and Kü 461), and both construe viśā́m in the
next pāda with it (“in der Gefolgschaft ihre Clanleute” and “dans l’arroi des clans”
respectively). A hemistich boundary between a locative and its dependent genitive
seems highly unlikely to me, esp. when it is not a well-known standard expression. In
the publ. tr. I take it as a loc., but decline to translate; I would now be inclined to take
it as a nom. dual, but also decline to tr., hence “like two ? clan-lords.” Unlike many
problematic hapaxes, this one does not seem to be phonologically generated.
With Ge and Re, I interpr. the verb in b, ā́… iyāte, as ‘hasten here’. Lub
classifies it with √yā ‘beseech, beg’, and the morphology supports him: the form
cannot belong with well-attested ī́yate ‘hastens’ both because of its short root syllable
and because of its athematic ending, whereas it could easily belong to the medial root
pres. of ‘beg’ (cf. part. iyāná-). But ‘beg’ does not fit the context, and esp. with Vāyu
63
63
forming one of the paired subjects and with the time specified as dawn and the
occasion the Early Invocation, the common formulaic vā́yav ā́yāhi (I.2.1, etc.) and
its variants, calling Vāyu to the first pressing, imposes itself here. I don’t understand
the morphology, but a poet who could inflict bī́riṭe on us is capable of confecting a
nonce verb form in the same pāda.
If viśā́m is not dependent on bī́riṭe, what is it doing? A survey of the
occurrences of this gen. pl. reveals that it is often pāda-initial (as here) and dependent
on viśpáti- (e.g., III.2.10, 13.5, V.4.3), páti- (e.g., I.127.8, VI.15.1), or a similar
authority figure. I therefore loosely construe it with viśpatī in b, though I resupply
that word in c. Alternatively, II.4.1 viśā́
m agním átithimṣ suprayásam “Agni, the
guest of the clans, who receives very pleasurable offerings” is suggestive, since it
contains a form of suprayás- modifying Agni. But ‘guest’ is missing in our passage,
and in any case the suprayás- form is in a different clause.
As for the aktór uṣásaḥ phrase, Ge. (n. 2c) has convinced me that it's an
abbreviated version of uṣáso yā́man aktóḥ “at the coming of dawn from night”
(III.30.13, VI.38.4). Perhaps the loc. yā́man was gapped because of the presence of
the loc. pūrváhūtau, although the latter is not part of the same phrase.
The epithet niyútvan- ‘possessing a team’ is primarily used of Vāyu, and
therefore, although Pūṣan intervenes between vāyúḥ and niyútvān, it must modify
Vāyu, with the name and the epithet polarized at the edges of the pāda.
Vāyu and Pūṣan do not generally appear together and do not form a natural
pair; I don’t know the reason for their joint appearance here. As far as I know, Pūṣan
has no part in the Morning Pressing.

### 3  
There is almost universal agreement that jmayā́represents an adverbial
instr. of exactly that shape, despite the hiatus, rather than Pp. jmayā́ḥ. See, e.g., Old,
Re, Scar 421, with lit.
With Sāy., cited by Ge, the Maruts must be the referents of śubhrā́ḥ in b: pl.
forms of this adj. generally modify the Maruts, and the midspace is especially
associated with them.
Note that marjayanta must be reflexive, with real medial value, rather than
being a straight transitive -anta replacement of the type commonly found with -áyaformations.
On urujrayaḥ see comm. ad V.54.2.
Assuming the Agni is the messenger in d (so, e.g., Ge), this vs. contains both
standard models of the sacrifice: “the gods come to the sacriifice” and “the sacrifice
goes to the gods.”

### 4  
Pāda b contains víśve … devā́ḥ, though distracted. Since this is the middle
vs. of the hymn, this specification of the dedicands of the hymn may constitute a not
very noteworthy omphalos. It also introduces a brief flood of named gods (4d, 5).

### 5  
In the first hemistich Agni appears to be playing on both sides, as it were:
he is commanded (voc. agne) to bring (ā́… vaha) a series of gods here, including
64
64
Agni (acc. agním) at the end of pāda b. This seems conceptually odd: Agni the god
does not need to be brought to the sacrifice -- he’s already there -- and it is also hard
to see how he would bring himself. Ge’s (n. 5b) explanation that including Agni in
the list serves for “Vervollständigung der Götterversammlung” seems weak. In that
case we might expect Agni to come at the end of the list, and in any case too many
gods are missing fom the list to consider it a complete collection. It might be possible
to consider the Agni to be brought as the celestial Agni, i.e., the sun. But I think it
more likely that agním is parallel to gíraḥ in pāda a, and both are acc. of goal,
expressing the ritual elements the gods will encounter at the ritual: hymns and the
ritual fire. The standard tr. take gíraḥ in this way, and I see no reason why agním
can’t have the same function.
In c eṣām is hard to construe. I follow Old in accepting the BR emendation to
*eṣám ‘quick’. Old cites the parallel in the very next hymn VII.40.5 víṣṇor eṣásya.
As Old points out, the corruption can have arisen on the basis of likewise pāda-final
eṣām in 2a. There are of course no metrical consequences. The emendation was not
explicitly signaled in the publ. tr., which should read “… Viṣṇu, *the quick.” Neither
Ge nor Re accepts (or even takes note of) this emendation.

### 6  
I take yajñíyānām as gen. for dat., as in 2a.
In b I assume that Agni obtains from the gods, and then gives to mortals, what
the latter wish. Cf. a fuller expression in VI.5.7 aśyā́ma táṃ kā́mam agne távotī́“May
we attain this desire, Agni, through your help.” On the basis of that passage, as well
as X.96.7 só asya kā́maṃ … ānaśe, both with kā́mam √(n)aś, I also take nákṣat as an
s-aor. subjunctive to √(n)aś, rather than as an injunc. to √nakṣ, pace Narten (s-aor.
160) and Gotō (1st Kl. 192), who assert that no such subj. exists to √(n)aś.
In d I take the position of nú within the instr. phrase yújyebhir nú devaíḥ
seriously, indicating that the gods are now to be our yokemates, now that we have
made successful sacrifice to them.

### 7  
A fine meta-summary vs., which is also the final vs. of the next hymn
(VII.40.7).
## 40
All Gods

### 1  
The standard interpr. take vidathyā̀as nom. sg. fem. modifying śruṣṭíḥ (e.g.,
Thieme [Unters. 48] “die zur Verteilung führende Erhörung”), and this is certainly
the default reading. However, it leaves the sám in the VP sám etu with little to do,
and I wonder if vidathyā̀is not instead an instr. sg. fem., which would justify the
lexeme sám √i ‘come together’. This adj. modifies vā́c- in I.167.3, and “hearing” and
“ceremonial (speech)” would make a nice pair. The speech would also stimulate the
praise (stómam) we aim at the gods in the next pāda.
In b I take práti … dadhīmahi in its idiomatic sense, ‘to fix an arrow (on a
bowstring), to aim’, though a more generic one (Ge ‘anheben’, Re ‘commencer’) is
hardly out of the question.
65
65
In d ratnínaḥ ‘possessing treature’ is perfectly ambiguous: it can be a gen. sg.
and modify asya (standing for Bhaga) or a nom. pl. modifying the 1st pl. subj. of
syā́ma. In the publ. tr. I take it as the former (as does Thieme loc. cit.), while Ge and
Re take it as the latter (though Re recants in his notes, deciding that the gen. sg. is
better, on the basis of ratna-bhā́j- VII.81.4). In fact, I think it’s probably meant to be
both, with the nom. pl. a proleptic use, and would now emend the tr. to “may we,
possessing [=acquiring] treasure, be at the apportioning of him who possesses
treasures.”
Gr (s.v. ratnín-), Ge, Re, and Thieme (loc. cit.) all take the referent of asya to
be Savitar, and the presence of unaccented asya, which should refer to someone/-
thing already in the discourse, supports this interpr. However, since the next hymn
(VII.41) is entirely devoted to Bhaga as distributor of goods and since vibhāgé
appears to be a pun on his name, I think Bhaga is equally plausible. The lack of
accent on asya could be accounted for by this pun.

### 2  
A series of four singular nouns are the subject of dadātu, a singular verb.
The verb niyuvaíte is esp. appropriate for Vāyu, who is regularly called
niyútvant- ‘having a team’. Note the use of this adj. in the immed. preceding hymn,
VII.39.2, where it must qualify Vāyu rather than Pūṣan, despite the word order (see
comm. ad loc.).

### 3  
The pl. verb junánti in c has two singular subjects, Agni and Sarasvatī,
which should trigger a dual verb, or else a singular one as in 2ab. Since Agni and
Sarasvatī do not form a stable set of gods (as, e.g., Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman do),
it is not clear what god or gods should be supplied to justify the plural verb. Re adds
a parenthetical “(et autres)”; possibly the Maruts addressed in the first hemistich?
With Ge and Re, I take tásya as a dependent genitive limiting rāyáḥ and
referring to the man whom the Maruts, Agni, and Sarasvatī help -- not as a
demonstrative adjective with rāyáḥ, which would be grammatically possible.

### 4  
Contrary to Ge and Re, I take pādas a-c as a clause subordinate to the main
cl. of d.

### 5  
Flg. Old, I emend vayā́to ‘vayā́(=avayā́) ‘propitiation’, which only
requires the insertion of an avagraha but no emendation. Ge and Re also accept this
suggestion. The word should have been marked with an asterisk in the publ. tr.
## 41
Bhaga (or All Gods)
Like VII.38, which is essentially an All Gods hymn though ascribed by the
Anukramaṇī to Savitar, this hymn is properly located within the All Gods sequence,
the last of three 7-verse hymns in Triṣṭubh (save for our vs. 1 in Jagatī), followed by
an All Gods hymn of 6 vss. Nonetheless, the Anukramaṇī assigns most of it (vss. 2–
6) to Bhaga, with vs. 1 to the Liṅgoktadevatāḥ and vs. 7, an extrahymnic vs. (see
publ. intro.) to Uṣas. The 1st vs. calls on a range of gods, including Bhaga (pāda c), in
66
66
monotonous fashion, before settling down to exclusive focus on Bhaga beginning
with vs. 2, and it was surely meant as an All God hymn and positioned in the All God
collection for that reason. The hymn is also found in AV (Ś III.16, P IV.31)

### 1  
As was just noted, this vs. is in Jagatī in an otherwise Triṣṭubh hymn (and
hymn sequence) -- or rather its first three quarters are. The final pāda is in Triṣṭubh
and ends with the verb 1st pl. opt. huvema, which gives a Triṣṭubh cadence and also
ends the first pāda of the next vs. (2a), contrasting with its semantic match 1st pl. pres.
indic. havāmahe in the first pāda (1a), which provides a Jagatī cadence. The switch in
meter at the end of the vs., cleverly accomplished while holding the verb essentially
constant, and the variant repetition of the opening of the 2nd hemistich, prātár
bhágam, at the opening of vs. 2, prātar(-jítam) bhágam, knit the 1st vss. together
despite the metrical difference and the range of gods in vs. 1.

### 2  
On the first pāda of this vs. see comm. immediately above.
The referent of the repeated rel. prn. yá- (b, c, d) is Bhaga, and we therefore
might expect that in the sequence in d yám bhágam the latter word refers to the god
(as the same acc. does in pāda a and in 1c). But instead it is almost surely merely a
pun on the divine name and its first reading is as the homonymous (and of course
etymologically identical) common noun ‘portion’ -- though the more usual word for
‘portion’ is bhāgá-. At best it could be read twice, once as the name, once the
common noun (“which Bhaga … portion …”). If we follow the Pp., bhágam must be
part of the quotation ended by íti, because the other word in the quotation, bhakṣi, is
read by the Pp. as unaccented and cannot therefore be initial in the quotation/clause.
In principle, however, the sandhi form bhakṣī́ti could contain both an accented
particle íti and an accented bhakṣí, contra the Pp. which could -- and should -- then
be the only word in the quotation.
Part -- but only part -- of the solution depends on how we analyze the verb
form. Old and Ge inter alia (e.g., Scar 157) take it as a 1st sg. middle, which could
therefore be accented, since medial s-aor. forms take accent on the ending (cf.
bhakṣīyá, bhakṣīmahí) -- though it need not be. (Indeed no one, as far as I know,
rejects the unaccented Pp reading in favor of *bhakṣí.) I follow the view of Sāy. (also
Gr, Wh. [AV tr. III.16.2], Narten [p. 179 n. 512] inter alia [see Old’s reff.]), that it is
a 2nd sg. act., that is, a -si impv. (ultimately derived from the act. s-aor. subjunctive;
cf. bhakṣat), where we should expect root accent (*bhákṣi) if the form were to be
accented. Because there seems to be universal agreement that bhakṣi is unaccented,
the divergent interpretations of the morphology do not affect the interpr. of where the
quotation begins, but it seems worthwhile to point out the possible interpr. not taken.
One reason I prefer the -si impv. interpr. is that the 1st sg. interpr. might
impose more modality on an injunctive than we might expect: cf. Ge’s “ich möchte
… teilhaft werden” (though Scar’s “ich bekomme …” avoids modality). The context
favors a request, rather than a statement of accomplishment.
67
67

### 3  
Although the prātár of vs. 1 and 2a has disappeared, this vs. seems to
contain a reminiscence of it: 1c #prātár bhágam is echoed by 3a #bhága prá(ṇe)tar
(in opposite order), and pādas c and d then pick up prá ṇ(etar) of 3a in #bhága prá ṇo
and #bhága prá nṛ́bhiḥ (latter without retroflexion). This is hardly the most
sophisticated effect in Rigvedic poetry, but it is an illustration of the subtle
concatenative effects that can provide unity and a throughline in even the most banal
(as this hymn mostly is) composition.
### 3–5
The concatenation continues in the next vss. The ending of vs. 3, …
nṛvántaḥ syāma, echoes in the following two vss. The 1st pl. opt. syāma is repeated at
the end of 4a and d and 5b, while the -vant-stem adj. shifts from nṛvántaḥ (3d) to
another punning bhágavantaḥ (both ‘possessing a portion’ and ‘accompanied by
Bhaga’) in bhágavantaḥ syāma (4a, 5b; cf. bhágavān 5a). And bhágavān in 5a
matches maghavan in the same metrical position in 4c.

### 4  
On the structural relationship of the various utá-s here, see Klein DGRV
I.355–56.
### 5
The punning continues here with a clever twist: even Bhaga himself should
become possessed of a portion (bhágavant-) (a); (only) in this way (téna) will we
become bhágavant- (b). In other words, Bhaga needs to get his own portion before
he can pass it on to us.
This vs. forms a slight ring with vs. 1: the intensive verb johavīti provides one
additional stem to the two forms of √hū in vs. 1, havāmahe and huvema.
### 6
This vs., bringing the Dawns into the picture, forms the transition to the
extra-hymnic vs. 7 (see publ. intro.). Note that we have the newer nom. pl. form
uṣásaḥ in 6, whereas 7, a repeated vs. (=VII.80.3), has the inherited uṣā́saḥ.
The racehorse Dadhikrā(van) seems intrusive in this vs., but he is the subject
of the nearby hymn VII.44. Here as there he is associated with dawn and the Dawns.
As suggested in the publ. intro. to that hymn, the association may be with the dakṣiṇā,
which is distributed at the morning pressing and which often consists at least partly
of horses.

### 7  
Though this vs. is also found, better situated, in a Dawn hymn (VII.80.3)
and is quite possibly extrahymnic here, the emphasis on the valuable goods, esp.
livestock, that the Dawns bring, to distribute as dakṣinā, well fits the hope for a good
portion that characterizes the rest of the hymn. Note esp. that in 3cd we hope to be
propagated with cows and horses (góbhir áśvaiḥ) and to become possessed of men
(nṛvántaḥ), matched here by the entities by which the Dawns are accompanied:
áśvāvatīr gómatīḥ … vīrávatīḥ.

### 42–43  
All Gods
68
68
These two hymns are in some ways companion pieces, progressing similarly
through the ritual and sharing means of expression and images. For details see
individual discussions below.
## 42
All Gods

### 1  
The first three pādas of this vs. begin with prá ‘forth’ and seem to express
the dynamic beginning of the sacrifice. None of the three verbs (√nakṣ, √vī, √nū) is
commonly found with prá, so the use of the preverb here seems situational -- that is,
the three prá √X are not standard lexemes; rather, the poet has attached prá to all
three to emphasize that all parts of the sacrifice are setting at once.
krandanú- is a hapax, built with the rare suffix -anú- (AiG II.2.210). Of the
very few other such stems, one -- nadanú- ‘roar’ (1x, also nadanú-mant- 1x) --
belongs to the same semantic field, and another -- nabhanú- ‘spurting’ (1x, also
nabhanū́- 1x) -- belongs to the same root as the genitive qualifier of our form
nabhanyà- ‘inclined to / about to burst out’. I think it likely that this roar refers to all
the sonic parts of the sacrifice: the just kindled fire (for agní- as subject of √krand, cf.
e.g., X.45.4), the soma (often the subject of √krand in IX), the hymns (cf. VII.20.9,
with stóma- as subj.)., and most likely also the pressing stones that appear in d.
The cows “swimming in water” in c presumably stand in for the milk to mix
with the soma, though the exact ritual reference is unclear. In the soma sacrifice it is
the soma that undergoes a water bath (see IX.106.8 where udaprút- modifies the
soma drops), not the milk.
The verb yujyā́tām in d requires some discussion. On the surface, the form is a
3rd du. act. opt. root aor., and this is how Ge and Re render it and how Gr and Lub
classify it. Old, however, points out that the pressing stones are usually yoked (in the
passive) rather than yoking something else (in the active). He wishes to take it
instead as built to the passive stem yujyá-, but the question then is what the form is
meant to be. Old himself favors a passive injunctive: though this should have the
form *yujyetām, he suggests that the rarity of such forms might have generated the
“wrong” form on the analogy of athematic 3rd du. med. injunctives/imperfects in -
ātām. He also floats the possibility of a subjunctive, though that should have the
primary ending (expect *yujyāte, I suppose, not at this period the *yujyaite of the
grammars). Although the publ. tr. reflects Old’s view that the context favors a
passive, I now believe that the act. opt. analysis of Ge/Re, etc., with péśaḥ
‘ornament’, referring to the soma, as object, is correct. The passage, and the verb,
would play with the standard passive expression (pressing stones are yoked), but take
them as agents of the yoking. I would therefore now emend the tr. to “The two
pressing stones should yoke the ornament of the ceremony.”

### 2  
The ‘road’ of Agni, ádhvan-, in pāda a picks up its etymological relative
adhvará- ‘ceremony, lit. ritual cursus’ in 1d, a relationship unfortunately difficult to
convey without awkwardness in tr.
69
69
Sāy. reads *sú te for suté, and Old favors this reading on the grounds that suté
is rare in Agni context. But since the last hemistich of the preceding vs. (and possibly
pāda b as well) concerns the soma, this does not seem a cogent enough objection to
change the text. Sāy. likewise reads *jánimā níṣattaḥ rather than jánimāni sattáḥ.
This would make fine sense -- and ní √sad is a very common idiom for Agni’s
seating at the ritual when acting as Hotar -- but it again requires emending a text that
makes sense on its own.
As indicated in the publ. intro., the vari-colored horses in bc are Agni’s
flames. The “I” of d is presumably the poet impersonating Agni as Hotar.

### 3  
The pl. subj. of mahayan in pāda is unclear; the most likely referent would
be the priestly colleagues of the 1st ps. sg. poet subj. of huvé in 2d; in this spirit Ge
supplies “die Sänger,” Re “les chanteurs.” However, Old adduces the almost
identical passage VII.61.6 sám u vāṃ yajñám mahayaṃ námobhiḥ with 1st sg.
mahayam. Noting that small differences between otherwise identical passages are
common, he does not insist on the 1st sg. interpr. However, given the 1st sg. of 2d, I
am now inclined to consider this a strong possibility, and would emend the
translation (or at least provide as an alternative): “I magnify the sacrifice for you all
…” This makes the interpr. of vaḥ easier: as is common with such enclitics in ritual
context, vaḥ should refer to the rest of the officiants, but if they are also the 3rd ps.
subjects of mahayan, this produces a clash. The emendation of -n to -ṃ is of course
trivial.
The prá of vs. 1 returns in d, though in the common idiom prá √ric ‘project,
extend beyond, surpass’. The medial pf. of this root, acdg. to Kü (426–27), is always
presential and has the stative sense ‘hervorhinausragen über Abl.” The ablative is of
course missing here. In our passage I think the sense is primarily physical: the ritual
fire is gaining strength and its flames project outward on the ritual ground (“in the
nearness” upāké), though the fire’s surpassing superiority may also be referenced.
The physical image is found, differently expressed, in the companion hymn VII.42 in
vs. 2d ūrdhvā́śocī́ṃṣi … asthuḥ “The flames have stood up erect.” Given the prá
here, this might be taken as a reference to the movement of the ritual fire to the east,
but the fire seems to me to be already established in its location.
Both Ge and Re supply a ‘speech’ element to their interpr. of mandrá-,
“wohlredende” and “à la voix-harmonieuse” respectively, but its derivation from
√ma(n)d ‘exhilarate/be exhilarated / gladden/be glad’ does not suggest or require
such a semantic extension. It is true that the adj. regularly modifies jihvā́- / juhū́-
‘tongue’ and is also found in the bahuvrīhi mandrá-jihva- ‘having mandrá tongue(s)’.
But generally when Agni’s tongue is mentioned, it is as the instrument for eating the
oblation and conveying it to the gods, not as a speech organ. His tongue is
gladdening because it gives the gods pleasing nourishment. Agni himself is very
often mandrá- as well, as in our passage -- probably for at least two reasons: 1) like
his tongue, he is the conveyor of the oblation to the gods, 2) he produces general
gladness by his presence and role in the sacrifice. Both factors are probably at issue
here: in c he is commanded to sacrifice to the gods (thus conveying the oblation to
70
70
them); in vs. 4, esp. d, he gives “a desirable reward” to the mortals whose dwelling
he is established in.
For dāti see comm. ad IV.8.3.

### 5  
The adhvarám of pāda a echoes adhvarásya in 1d and provides a faint ring,
since the last vs. (6) is extra-hymnic.
In the publ. tr. in c the verb sadatām is taken as a sg. impv. with Agni as
subject. At best, this would be a middle 3rd sg. (though tr. as a 2nd ps.), to a stem, and
indeed a root, that is otherwise relentlessly active. This is just an error. The form
must be a 3rd du. act. impv., with Night and Dawn (the decoupled dual dvandva náktā
… uṣā́sā) as subj. -- as is the standard interpr. (Gr, Ge, Re). The tr. should be
emended to “Let Night and Dawn sit here on the ritual grass.” What this is meant to
convey is another question, since times of day do not usually have a physical
presence at the ritual and it is hard to conceive Night and Dawn sitting on the barhis.
For the “repair” of this image in the next hymn, see comm. ad VII.43.3. The ultimate
reference is probably to the daily offering to Agni at the two twilights (later called
the Agnihotra).

### 6  
As just indicated, this vs. belongs to the class of “meta” final vss.,
commenting on the hymn just completed. I would now be inclined to tr. the root pres.
injunc. staut as “has just praised.”
The second pāda is interesting for the interaction between analytic phrases
and compounds. That is, the first member of the bahuvrīhi rāyás-kāma- ‘having
desire for wealth’, rāyáḥ, itself a gen. case form rather than stem form in
composition, is modified by / compared to an independent gen. viśvápsnyasya. The
connection of this adj. with ‘wealth’ is clear from VIII.97.15, where the independent
gen. rāyáḥ is modified by viśvápsnyasya: kadā́… rāyá ā́daśasyer, viśvápsnyasya ...
On the sense of the adj., see comm. ad VIII.97.15.
## 43
All Gods
### 1–2
The 1st two vss. of this hymn begin with prá, recalling the insistent prá in
the 1st vs. of the preceding hymn (VII.42.1) and presumably fulfilling the same
function: to express the energetic initiation of the ritual. However, both prá √ṛc (1a)
and prá √i (2a) are standard lexemes, unlike those in 42.1.

### 1  
The inf. iṣádhyai is a hapax and variously interpr.: e.g., Ge “dass sie gern
kommen,” Re “en sorte que (nous) en tirions profit.” The root affiliation is also not
entirely clear; e.g., Lub classifies it with √iṣ ‘send’, though we do not of course
know how he would tr. it. Both Re’s disc. and his tr. seem to me plausible: he takes it
as “un doublet isolé d’iṣayádhyai” and cites Burrow’s (1955) interpr. “pour que nous
soyons prospères.” It is worth noting that the few instances of iṣayádhyai
(I.183.3=VI.49.5, VI.64.4) also occur in a Triṣṭubh cadence and that that form in
isolation is ill-formed for such a cadence, since the root syllable should be heavy in
71
71
such a cadence. In I.183.3=VI.49.5 this problem is avoided because the root syllable
amalgamates with a preceding final vowel: yéna narā nāsati
yeṣayádhyai. But in
VI.64.4 rayím divo duhitar iṣayádhyai the cadence is simply bad (and in fact
produces an uninterrupted run of 5 light syllables). Haplology of the suffix -ayá- to
our form iṣádhyai here fixes this metrical problem.
víprā in c, modifying bráhmāṇi, is the only neut. N/A form of this stem, but
the stem does modify a different word for thought/poetic formulation, matí-, as fem.
víprā (VII.66.8, VIII.25.24). The Pp. analyzes it instead as nom. pl. m. víprāḥ, which
is of course a possible form underlying the sandhi, but which cannot be easily fitted
into the sentence. Sāy. does it by sleight of hand: he glosses the first part of pāda c as
yeṣāṃ viprāṇāṃ medhāvināṃ brahmāṇi, converting the supposed nom. pl. viprāḥ
into a gen. pl., and then supplies viprāḥ as subj. of pra … arcan in the main clause in
a: te viprāḥ prārcann pūrveṇa saṃbandhaḥ, an attempt to justify the nom. in the rel.
cl. Needless to say, this doesn’t work.
The verb viyánti in d is ambiguous. With the Pp., Gr., etc., it may be taken as
belonging to ví √i ‘go apart, spread out’, but it could also belong to the root pres. of
√vī ‘pursue, go in quest’. In a rel. cl. the accent would be the same for either analysis.
Because of the connections between the preceding hymn VII.42 and this one, I favor
the latter affiliation on the basis of (prá) vetu in VII.42.1b, but ví √i is certainly not
excluded -- and might make slightly better sense with the simile. The tr. might then
alternatively read “go apart” for “go questing.” On the other hand, I like the idea of
formulations going in quest of divine response and rewards, an interpr. encouraged
by the prá lexemes (like prá … etu in the next pāda, 2a).

### 2  
In c I construe dat. adhvarā́ya with sādhú, giving the latter richer semantics
than the mere adverbial “richtig” of Ge or even Re’s “correctement.” Found twice in
42 (1d, 5a), adhvará- reappears here, though the word is too common to make much
of this.
As noted above ad 42.3, our pāda d seems to be a clearer expression of the
image of the increasing flames of the ritual fire found also in 42.3b.

### 3  
In two of its four occurrences víbhṛtra- means something like ‘dispersed’,
but that makes no sense here. The third occurrence is similar to ours, however: I.95.2
… janayanta gárbham … víbhṛtram. In both these instances it seems to be an
idiomatic expression for children of an age to be carried around, in I.95.2 of the newborn fire. In our passage both Ge’s “die Tragekinder” and Re’s “des fils (en âge)
d’être portés” seem on the money. Since Eng. lacks a useful expression (or means to
make one) like Tragekind, my tr. is an attempt to convey the sense in brief and also
to capture the implied locus of the children in our passage. In the simile they are said
to be sitting on their mother (acc. mātáram), but in the frame the corresponding term
is loc. sā́nau ‘on the back’, and I suggest that the mother’s back is implied in the
simile as well. The difference between acc. mātáram and loc. sā́nau is a fairly trivial
example of the “case disharmony in similes” discussed in detail in my 1982 IIJ
article of the same name.
72
72
In b the gods are urged to take their seats (devā́saḥ … sadantu) on the barhis.
The action ordered is of course unremarkable and repeated numerous times in the
RV, but in the context of this sequence of hymns it can be considered a “repair.” In
the preceding hymn, in VII.42.5, Night and Dawn are given the same command, also
in the 3rd ps., also in the thematic aor. (náktā … sadatām uṣā́sā). As was noted there,
this produces an unusual image; 43.3 replaces and thus repairs it with the familiar
one.
In c the problem is that neither of the fem. adjectives -- nom. viśvā́cī or acc.
vidathyā̀m -- modifies an expressed noun, and the referential possibilites are wide
open. Ge follows Sāy. by taking the nom. as the sacrificial ladle and the acc. as the
flame, though in his n. (3c) he suggests that ‘speech’ would be possible for both. Re
follows Th. (Unters. 49) in taking over devátāt- from d as the acc., tr. “(la troupe des
dieux) arrivant au sacrifice,” while maintaining the ladle as the nom. (One might
think that the gods might find this an odd and messy welcome!) Old thinks the nom.
is definitely the ladle, but suggests various possibilities for the acc. On the basis of
I.167.3 vidathyā̀… vā́k, I take the acc. as speech, with the anointing metaphorical:
the ladle pours the butter offering into the ritual fire as ritual speech is recited. There
is precedent for this metaphor: cf. I.61.5 arkám … sám añje and I.64.1 gíraḥ sám
añje with ‘chant’ and ‘hymns’, respectively, as object of ‘anoint’.

### 4  
The isolated form sīṣapanta is hard to assess. By form it appears to belong
to a redupl. aor., but no other forms to such a stem are attested and, more to the point,
there is no securely attested -áya-transitive. I cannot evaluate sāpáyant- in TB
II.4.6.5, which is evidently the Brāhmaṇa form Whitney lists, with ?, in Roots s.v.
√sap, but even if it belongs to the same root, it is attested too late to provide a basis
on which to generate an associated redupl. aor. in the RV. Nonetheless, I see no
choice but to take sīṣapanta as a redupl. aor. and to assume an unattested *sāpáyati
for early Vedic. What then does sīṣapanta mean? In my 1983 -áya- monograph (p.
219) I assert that it has intrans./reflex. sense, is not connected with a causative, and
that it is based on nearby sápante (VII.38.5) (without specifiying how), but I no
longer believe that. Nor, despite the temptation of the -anta ending, do I believe it’s
an -anta replacement. Rather I would now take it as a reflexive transitive ‘serve
themselves’ (or, since that English idiom is too colloquial, ‘do service to
themselves’). The basis for this is expressed in the next pāda: the gods do their own
milking (dúhānāḥ), producing the “streams of truth,” presumably the praise hymns,
by their own actions -- thus serving themselves. See Lüders (473, 475), who argues
for “stream of truth” as Kultlied and (475) interprets this hemistich essentially as I do.
This may be a variant on the notion that the gods are the ultimate source of the
hymns that praise them because they provide the inspired thoughts to the poets, or it
may be that the sheer arrival of the gods at the ritual ground provides the impetus for
the “milking” of the hymns.
Both Ge and Re take the 2nd hemistich as a single cl., with máhaḥ as goal of ā́
gantana. Ge further takes máhas- as “Feier” (celebration), while Re’s
“manifestation-de-grandeur” is closer to the root sense of the word. But I see no
73
73
reason not to take this neut. s-stem in the standard sense ‘greatness’ and construe
pāda c as an independent nominal cl., as in the publ. tr.
In d sámanasaḥ ‘of the same mind’ replicates the same word in 2b and
provides a bit of a ring. Note that in 2 the referents are the human officiants, whereas
here it is the gods, who are thus implicitly equated -- and equation facilitated by the
similar structures: the two words are in identical metrical positions and both follow a
2nd pl. impv., with sámanasaḥ modifying the 2nd ps. subj. Although ‘of the same mind’
in the first instance means that all members of each group have the same mind, the
repetition may imply that the human officiants of vs. 2 and the attending gods of vs.
4 also share the same thoughts.
## 44
Dadhikrā
Both by number of vss. and by its listing style, this hymn fits the sequence of
All Gods hymns in which it is found, though the presence of Dadhikrā among these
deities is somewhat puzzling. As noted in the publ. intro., most of the divinities
named have associations with the Dawn ritual.

### 3  
As discussed in the publ. intro., in the middle of a hymn of utmost
simplicity and banality, this vs. -- or a single pāda, c -- is utterly baffling and has
given rise to competing interpr. This pāda contains two color terms, bradhná-
‘coppery’ and babhrú- ‘brown’, and a hapax mām̐ścatóḥ (or better maṃ̐ścatóḥ; see
Old): bradhnám mām̐ścatór váruṇasya babhrúm. Most comm. assume that the two
color terms refer to horses (see, e.g., Ge n. 3c, also Old), because of the presence of
Dadhikrā and because color terms often designate horses. (Cf., e.g., Re “au (coursier)
couleur-fauve de Mitra, au (coursier) brun de Varuṇa.”) But the introduction of two
extraneous horses seems unlikely to me, in a hymn that barely strays from the dawn
ritual context.
The old and once widespread interpr. of māṃ̐ścatú-/ maṃ̐ścatóḥ is as a cmpd.
‘chasing/hiding the moon’, with a form of ‘moon’ still containing an internal nasal
and the 2nd member built to √cat ‘hide’ (for lit. see, e.g., AiG III.250, EWA s.v.
māṃścatú-) -- though this interpr. has generally been replaced by agnosticism about
both meaning and deriv. because of the problematic details of the derivation and the
uncertainty of the passages containing this forms and the related ones (see below).
The form in our passage is generally assumed to be a gen. sg. to a -u-stem. The
identification of the supposed referent given in Re’s tr., “Mitra,” also has a long
history (see, e.g., Old, Ge’s n. 3c with lit.) and is due in part to the presence of
apparently parallel gen. váruṇasya and in part to a chain of semantic assumptions: if
māṃścatú- means ‘chasing the moon’, then it can refer to the sun, and the sun in turn
can stand for Mitra (see EWA s.v.). But this chain, esp. the last link, is not strong,
though the apparent parallelism with váruṇasya is admittedly stronger.
Assessing the cmpd is somewhat aided (but not all that much) by the
existence of two related words mām̐ścatvá- and mā́m̐ścatva-, in two nearby vss. in
the Soma Maṇḍala, IX.97.52, 54 in the same tṛca. Vs. 52 also contains bradhná-.
Though the exact sense of the two vss. is obscure, the context is the usual self-
74
74
purification of soma, with the soma drop in 52 addressed directly and the bradhná-
“also there, sped like the wind” (bradhnáś cid átra vā́to ná jūtáḥ). I tentatively
identify bradhnáḥ there as the sun or the ritual fire at the dawn sacrifice, and take
māṃ̐ścatvé in the same vs. as a temporal loc. If bradhná- is the sun, that body is
copper-colored only at dawn and at sunset; a temporal loc. of māṃ̐ścatvá-, if it means
‘hiding/chasing the moon’, would mean ‘at the time of the hiding of the moon, viz.
dawn’, a time appropriate to the ritual content of the vs. Returning to VII.44.3 with
this ritual context in mind, I suggest that the same elements of the ritual are
represented here: the coppery bradhná- is the sun, or perhaps the fire (I favor the sun,
because the sun is well known as Varuṇa’s spy); the brown babhrú- is the soma, as
often (IX.11.4, 31.5, etc.). And in my analysis māṃ̐ścatoḥ is not a gen. to a -u-stem,
but rather a loc. du. to a root noun *māṃ̐ś-cát- and, as in my interpr. of IX.97.52, is a
temporal loc. “at the two twilights.” Of course, we should expect this loc. du. to be
accented *māṃ̐ś-cátoḥ, but the non-transparency of the stem could have led it to be
reanalysed as a -u-stem gen. parallel to váruṇasya. Although the cmpd in its literal
meaning would only be appropriate to morning twilight, it came to be applied to both.
As for mām̐ścatvá- / mā́m̐ścatva-, I suggest that they are -tva-stem derivatives of this
root noun, with simplification of the geminate *mām̐ścat-tva-.
Riccardo Ginevra has recently called my belated attention to Pinault’s 2008
treatment of this same word (“About the Slaying of Soma: Uncovering the Rigvedic
Witness,” Ged. Elizarenkova, 353–88). In this extensive and exceedingly careful
treatment with comprehensive treatment of the earlier lit., Pinault seriously disputes
all previous analyses of the cmpd (esp. 360–64), including the one I maintain above.
His most telling objection to that analysis is that the Indo-Iranian paradigm of the
‘moon’ word has no trace of the nasal found in other IE languages, since it has been
vocalized in the weak forms of the paradigm and generalized from there (362–63). In
order to connect mā̆ṃś- with the ‘moon’ word, we must assume that the nasal was
preserved in just this form under exceptional phonological circumstances because of
the obscurity of the formation. Although I recognize the hazards in this assumption, I
am still willing to take the risk. I cannot endorse Pinault’s own suggestion, that the
first member is the ‘flesh’ word, the second member was borrowed from a non-IndoAryan language “of the Nūristāni type” (383), and the cmpd means ‘flesh-cutting’
and refers to a disguised myth of the killing of soma. The first hypothesis (‘flesh’) is
certainly possible, but the other two, esp. the second (inter alia, he gives no etymon
or even source language for this borrowing), seem significantly less plausible than
the isolated preservation of the nasal in ‘moon’.
Although I would hardly claim that my analysis of the cmpd or of the passage
in general is airtight, it does provide an interpr. of the pāda that better fits the hymn:
two more divinities (Sūrya and Soma) that the poet is calling upon (úpa bruve pāda
b), rather than a couple of irrelevant race horses.
## 45
Savitar
75
75
### 1–2
Although Savitar’s role as god of evening, causing the world and its
activities to settle down, is alluded to in 1d, his role as rouser of the world at dawn is
given equal billing in that pāda (… ca … ca). The more oblique expression in 2d
must also refer to this latter role. The sun “cedes his task” of waking and rousing the
world to Savitar.

### 2  
Both Ge and Re take the aor. injunc. paniṣṭa in c as modal, but the aor.
injunc. ánu dāt in d as general pres. (e.g., “Jetzt sei … gepriesen; … ordnet …”). But
there is no reason that the first needs to be assigned modal value: the temporal adv.
nūnám can instead draw attention to an immediate past action (“has [just] been
wondered at”). And it seems preferable, if contextually possible, to take the two
adjacent aor. injunctives in the same value.

### 3  
Klein (DGRV II.102) asserts that ádha in d “conjoins the second distich
with the first, following an intervening participial phrase” (that is, conjoins ab with
cd, the participial phrase occupying c); Klein tr. “And propping apart his broadly
encompassing sunbeam he shall give mortal’s nourishment to us.” Although this
seems roughly correct, the dislocated position of ádha, not only after the participial
phrase of c but after the first, heavy word of d, martabhójanam, might have called for
more comment. It would be possible to take c with ab -- there are no syntactic
obstacles to this: the participial phrase can attach to the nom. subject of ab -- which
would situation ádha closer to the beginning of the clause it’s conjoining (after only
one word). But I favor a slightly richer semantics for ádha than Klein does: often
‘then’ rather than just ‘and’. And I think it likely here that positioning ádha in the
last clause of the vs. and in fact in the last clause of the hymn proper) since vs. 4 is a
meta-verse), is meant to emphasize Savitar’s last and most significant action, the
actual delivery of his bounty to us mortals. The particle is found directly before the
verb to stress the action of granting. With this analysis there is no need to attach c to
ab.

### 4  
As just noted, this is a meta-summary final vs., referring to the very hymns
(imā́gíraḥ) invoking Savitar at the present moment. The 2nd pāda focuses on his
hands: pūrṇágabhastim … supāṇím “having full fists [that is, fists full of goods] and
good palms.” This provides a semantic, but not lexical ring with the beginning of the
hymn, where many good things are in Savitar’s hand (háste 1c). (I would in fact have
tr. 4b -pāṇí- as ‘hand’ but used ‘palm’ instead to make the lexical difference clear in
English.) The ‘hand’ focus is also continued in the two arms (bāhū́) in 2ab, though
that is so standard an image of Savitar that it may be independent here.
## 46
Rudra

### 1  
This hymn begins with the NP imā́(ḥ) … gíraḥ “these hymns,” the same
phrase that opened the last vs. of the preceding hymn (VII.45.4). In that hymn it was
a nom. pl.; here it is an acc. pl., but its grammatical identity does not become clear
76
76
until almost the end of the vs., when the transitive verb bharatā ‘bring’ is found in
the middle of d, right before the final brief cl. śṛṇotu naḥ. The ambiguity of case
between the identical phrases in 45.4a and our 1a makes the connection seem closer.
### 2–3
The final pādas of both vss. are semantic variants of each other: “don’t
hurt our children.” In 2d the negative is expressed by the privative on the adj.
anamīváḥ (… bhava) “be without affliction,” while 3d contains the stronger and
more conventional prohibitive mā́… rīriṣaḥ “do not harm.” The word for ‘children’
is the fairly rare uncompounded root noun jā́- in 2d, replaced by the fuller and more
familiar bipartite phrase toká- tánaya- “offspring (and) descendents.”

### 2  
The complementary etymological and morphological figure ávann ávantīḥ
is noteworthy, but I have no idea what “helping/helpful doors”(ávantīr dúraḥ) are or
do. Perhaps it is an indirect way to refer to the sacrificial offerings humans make to
help the gods, in return for the help (etc.) they receive from the gods, in this case
Rudra. As Re suggests ad loc. (EVP XV.161), “dúraḥ … s’oriente vers «maison»”
and the emphasis in this vs. and the next on the protection of our children and
offspring may have invited this allusion to the house.

### 3  
The first hemistich contains two occurrences of pári, but in fact it should
technically have three: the first pári at the end of pāda a governs the preceding abl.
divás in the sense of ‘from’ (note the close sandhi divás pári); the second, in the
middle of b, should be construed with both preceding cárati and following vṛṇaktu
and is positioned exactly between the two clauses that contain those two verbs.
I take the hapax voc. svapivāta to the lexeme ápi √vat, which I interpr. after
the manner of Tichy. See comm. ad I.128.2. The intimacy implied by this lexeme
(‘be/make familiar/intimate’) is appropriate to the focus on the household disc. above.
My tr. “o you who are our familiar” does not represent the su-, but it is difficult to
incorporate it without making an already heavy tr. even more so.

Pādas 2c and 3c contain the same three words after the caesura, but with
the first two flipped: 2c yā́ḥ śúcayaḥ pāvakā́ḥ and 3c śúcayo yā́ḥ pāvakā́ḥ (with the
last word to be read *pavākā̇́ḥ in both instances, of course). I do not understand the
motivation for the permutation, although each order has a positive and negative
feature: 2c puts the rel. prn. in the more usual 2nd position in the pāda, as opposed to
3c, where it is 3rd (though both positions are syntactically acceptable), but the break
in 2c (–⏑⏑) is decidedly less common than the one in 3c (⏑⏑ –)(see Arnold, Vedic
Metre, 188).

Heaven and Earth

### 1  
The té that opens the 2nd hemistich is ambiguous: it can be nom. pl. m.,
modifying kaváyaḥ, or acc. du. f., providing the object of puráḥ … dadhiré.

### 2  
Unusually, this vs. requests and depicts physical movement of Heaven and
Earth, which is conceptually awkward, given that Heaven at least has a fixed position
at a great distance from our ritual ground. I have argued elsewhere (“The Divine
Revolution of Ṛgveda X.124: A New Interpretation. Beyond Asuras and Devas,”
Staal Ged., 2016) that one of the likely reasons for the eclipse of the inherited
divinity and original head of the pantheon Dyauṣ Pitar “Father Heaven” is his
inability to move about the cosmos and esp., in conformity with the newer ritual
model, to come to our sacrifice rather than having the oblations of that sacrifice filter
up to heaven. This is one of the few passages in the RV where his presence at the
sacrifice is urged, and only a little thought is required to reveal it as odd.
Ge takes sádane as du (“den beiden Sitzen der Wahrheit”), and in favor of this
interpr. is the fact that its final vowel is pragṛhya in the Saṃhitā text (sádane ṛtásya,
not *sádana ṛtásya, as in IV.42.4), as Old points out. However, I take it, with Re and
Lü (607–8)(and Gr implicitly) as a loc. sg. in the usual phrase. As Lü points out
(608), gods are never themselves “seats of truth” but are located in such seats.

The voc. indo ‘o drop’ in b is incongruous in this context, and as Ge points
out, the 1st hemistich seems to have been adapted from a Soma hymn, where ‘drop’
would be appropriate. He adduces I.91.19 (c: gayasphā́naḥ pratáraṇaḥ …) and 12,
whose 1st pāda also contains gayasphā́naḥ, though the matches are not exact and
neither of the cited pādas contains indo. However, gayasphā́na- is found only in
those two passages and in our vs.

Sleep
As noted in the publ. intro., the first vs. does not belong with the rest of the
hymn but rather with the preceding one, VII.54, to Vāstoṣpati, the Lord of the
Dwelling Place. However, as also noted there, this is not just a product of wrong
division of hymns: VII.55.1 is in a different meter from VII.54, and VII.54 ends with
the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, which is always the final pāda of a hymn. Moreover, as Old
points out, VII.54 has three vss. and follows correctly on the three-vs. hymns VII.51–
53, while an additional vs. would break that sequence. Old suggests that the single vs.

### 1  
originally formed its own hymn and that the rest of VII.55, with 7 vss., is an
addition to the original collection (Anhangslied).

### 1  
In addition to the voc. vāstoṣ pate that repeats the three vs.-initial vocc.
vā́stoṣ pate in VII.54, this vs. has other similarities to VII.54, esp. VII.54.1: amīvahā́
‘destroying affliction’ echoes 54.1 anamīváḥ ‘without affliction’, as āviśán ‘entering’
does 54.1 svāveśáḥ ‘easy to enter’; sim. sákhā ‘companion’ and 54.2 sakhyé
‘companionship’. Note also that pāda c sákhā suśéva edhi naḥ is identical to I.91.15; I.91 is the Soma hymn that VII.54.2ab seems to have been partially based on. In
addition, pāda b is identical to VIII.15.13b and IX.25.4a, both of which are addressed
to Soma (on Soma as the addressee in the former, see comm. ad loc.). I do not quite
understand the Soma/Vāstoṣpati connection.

### 2  
The target of the simile in pāda b, ‘spears’, does not precede the simile
marker iva and in fact is as far as it can be from it in a pāda of only 8 syllables: vī̀va
bhrājanta ṛṣṭáyaḥ. This arrangement may have resulted from an attempt to keep
metrically unfavorable bhrājante out of the cadence.
On the refrain ní ṣú svapa and the present stem svápa- see my “Sleep in Vedic
and Indo-European” (KZ 96 [1982/83], esp. 8 n. 3).

### 3  
The hapax voc. punaḥsara may be a word play with sārameya. Bollée
(Gone to the Dogs in Ancient India, 43) tr. “recessive one,” indicating that the dog is
in retreat. But the rest of the context suggests an aggressive dog on the attack.
On the intens. dardar- here, see Schaeffer (136), who cites a very similar
Avestan passage.

### 4  
On √sas, again see my ‘sleep’ art. cited ad vs. 2.

### 8  
Note the two hapax cmpds with loc. 1st member, proṣṭḥe-śayá- and vahyeśayá- versus talpa-śī́van- (-śī́varī-), with stem form in 1st member and a different 2nd
member belonging to the same root √śi ‘lie’.

Maruts
79
79

### 1  
Ge takes cd to be the answer to the question in ab, but since vs. 2 seems
more directly responsive to the question, I take cd here as simply further
specification of the subject of the question.
Unusually, īm has no acc. function; there is no possible accusative role it
could fill.
I consider vyàktā(s) to be at least an implied pun. The first reading is as the
nom. pl. m. of the ppl. of ví √añj ‘anoint, ornament’, referring presumably to the
Maruts’ characteristic adornments and their glistening appearance as (wet) bearers of
rain. This interpr. is reflected in all the standard tr. However, I think it also is meant
to contrast with sánīḷāḥ ‘of the same nest’, as an indication that the Maruts are also
separate individuals, and employing the common ví / sá(m) polarization. The
problem is to identify a morphological form that could be represented by vyàktā(s)
and express the sense ‘separate, individual’ vel sim. I hesitantly suggest that we start
with the -añc-stem, vy-áñc-, found only in the cmpd. uru-vyáñc- ‘wide-spreading’.
(The rarity of this stem may be accounted for by competition with the well-attested
stem víṣvañc- of almost the same meaning [‘facing in opposite directions, divergent’],
which looks like a more substantial version of vyáñc- and is built to the extended
form víṣu of the same preverb ví.) If vyáñc- made a collective abstract in -tā-,
*vyáktā- ‘individuality, separateness’, the form in our passage could be its instr. sg.
in adverbial usage. There are obviously weaknesses in every link in this chain of
reasoning. First, the stem vyáñc- is very rare and limited in distribution; second, I
know of no other such abstracts to -añc-stems and in fact -tā-stems are relatively rare
in early Vedic (AiG II.2.617); third, it should be accented *vyáñc- (AiG II.2.619).
However, a poet intent on packing a pun into vyàktā(s) might not scruple to use
unusual forms to achieve it, and elsewhere in the RV puns sometimes ignore
accentuation for their 2nd reading. In slight support of the suggestion, we might note
that this set of hymns has one other ex. of the instr. of such a stem in adverbial usage:

### 4  
puruṣátā ‘in human fashion’, as well as an instr. to a -tāt-abstract in the
same usage: VII.57.7 sarvátātā ‘in your totality’, referring to the Maruts -- the exact
opposite of my suggested vyàktā ‘in their individuality, separately’, also of the
Maruts. If my suggestion is correct (by no means certain!), it would also be a pun
facilitated by sandhi, since the first reading as ppl. should have underlying -ās and
the other one as instr. simply -ā, but both would show up as -ā in this sandhi position.
Because this vs. is in Dvipadā Virāj (which, despite its name, consists of four
pādas of five syllables apiece), ádha opens the d pāda and is therefore less oddly
placed than might appear. Klein (DGRV II.128) characterizes the ádha as
“conjoining the second [term] with the first” and tr. “the young men of Rudra and the
ones having good horses.” But since the two terms are coreferential, the ádha (/ Engl.
‘and’) seems unnec. or even misleading.

### 2  
This vs. seems a response, if an indirect one, to the question posed in vs. 1.
The hí, as often, has a higher discourse function: it gives the reason for asking the
question in the first place. We could tr. “(I ask) because …” I also consider this vs. a
further expression of the “individual/collective” theme I identified in vs. 1, here
80
80
conveyed by the pl. janū́ṃṣi ‘births’ in the first clause, contrasted with the sg.
janítram ‘means of begetting’ in the 2nd. If 1ab asks “who are they individually?” 2ab
states that the question needs to be asked because no one knows their individual
births, even though (cd) they [=Maruts] know “mutually” (mitháḥ) their own
(individual) means of begetting. In other words, they share the knowledge of their
separate births -- something we don’t know. Note the middle vidre: they know facts
about themselves, contrasting with the 3rd-party lack of knowledge in ab nákiḥ …
véda.

### 3  
This vs. continues the theme of mutuality in vs. 2, but now concerns the
Maruts’ adult behavior as gods of the storm. The mutuality is expressed both by the
adv. mitháḥ repeated from vs. 2 and by the reciprocal 3rd pl. verb aspṛdhran “they
contended with each other.”
The hapax svapū́- has been variously, and surprisingly, interpr. See Old ad loc.
(also KEWA s.v., etc.) for the numerous suggestions, incl. BR ‘broom’, Lanman
‘wings’. However, the most obvious analysis also is most likely the correct one, as a
root noun cmpd. to root √pū ‘purify’, hence ‘self-purifying’. This is Old’s conclusion,
reflected also in Ge’s and Re’s tr. and in Scar (323). Perhaps the resistance to this
obvious interpr. resulted from the fact that it is a hapax -- astonishing given the
centrality of Soma Pavamāna “self-purifying Soma” in RVic ritual as the subject of
the entire IXth Maṇḍala -- and in this passage it has no connection with soma. Here it
quite likely refers to the rain drops accompanying the Maruts’ storm, as Ge suggests.
Old acutely notes that the verb in this pāda vapanta resembles pavanta ‘they
purify(/ied) themselves’. Rather than considering vapanta a corruption of pavanta
(which seems extremely unlikely to me), I would instead suggest that it’s a
metathetic word play (vap ≈ pav), aided by preceding (s)vap(ū́bhiḥ).

### 4  
Whenever the birth of the Maruts, and esp. the udder of Pṛśni, are found in
the RV, bewilderment ensues, and this passage is no exception. At least it is here
identified as a secret that only the insightful can perceive -- a characterization that
the modern interpreter fully concurs with. For other problematic passages on this
topic see II.34.2, VI.48.22, and VI.66.1, 3 with comm. ad locc. Our passage would be
fairly easy to interpr. if we could take ū́dhaḥ (that is, ū́dhar) as a loc. sg. Such is Ge’s
solution (“im Euter,” explicitly identified as a loc. in n. 4b) and also Re’s, though the
latter has the grace to bury the loc. in a parenthesis: “(en sa) mamelle.” But a loc. -ar
to r/n stems “ist nicht nachgewiesen” (AiG III.311), and it is safer to take it as an acc.
sg. as elsewhere. In my interpr. yád is a neut. pronoun (rather than a subord. conj.)
and refers collectively to the Maruts and ‘udder’ is a species of appositive to it
though with a bit of a twist: ‘udder’ refers to the contents of the udder, and that
contents is the collective Marut embryo(s). This seems to me better than taking yád
as ‘that’ or the like, as in Kü’s (175) “Diese Geheimnisse kennt der Weise, dass die
grosse Prś̥ ni ein Euter getragen hat.” (On p. 339 Kü simply reproduces Ge’s tr., with
ū́dhaḥ as loc. and a pronominal obj. [“sie”], referring to the Maruts, supplied; he
doesn’t comment on these two incompatible interpr.)
81
81

### 5  
The good heroes that the clan possesses are in fact the Maruts themselves,
specified in the instr. Re calls this an “instrumental of identification.” Whatever term
is used, it is not, in my experience, a common usage of the instr., but it is nonetheless
not hard to interpret. A similar usage is found two vss. later, in 7cd.

### 6  
A very cleverly constructed vs., nicely fitted to Dvipadā Virāj meter. Each
5-syl. pāda consists of two words, phonologically and etymologically (or pseudoetymologically) related. There are both repetition of morphological figures and
variation on them. All four pādas end with a nom. pl. masc. adj.; the first two pādas
end with superlative -iṣṭhāḥ, the third with the phonologically similar, but
morphologically distinct -iślā(ḥ), the last with something phonologically distinct
(ugrā́ḥ).
Three (a, b, d) of the four pādas contain etymological pairs; in the first two
the etymological relation is reinforced by phonological repetition (yā́maṃ yā́(y)iṣṭhāḥ,
śubhā́śóbhiṣṭhāḥ. (As for the first, the Saṃh. has yéṣṭhā́ḥ, but the first vowel must be
distracted. HvN restore yáyiṣṭhāḥ with short root vowel, but I think yā is more likely.
In neither of the other two occurrences of this stem [V.41.3, 74.8] does the meter
establish the quantity of the root syllable.) In the third ex. (pāda d) the etymological
relationship is not transparent, but would be available to the audience steeped in
derivational morphology: ójobhir ugrā́ḥ. Although c, śriyā́sámmiślā́(ḥ), lacks the
etymological connection, it mimics it through alliteration, though it is notable that we
have miśLa, not the also attested miśRa, which would match śriyā́better. Another set
of three versus one: in three pādas (b, c, d) the first noun is in the instr., but in pāda a
it is not. The 2nd pāda is the only one that doesn’t deviate from the various patterns in
any regard: it’s an etymological figure, ends with a superlative, begins with an
instrumental.
One can also note the reversal of vowels in the root syllables of the word pairs
of b and d: u … o versus o … u.

### 7  
The first pāda of this vs., ugráṃ va ójaḥ, restates the last pāda of the
preceding vs. (6d ójobhir ugrā́ḥ) as an equational nominal clause. Because of its
connection with vs. 6 it also sets up the expectation that what follows will also be an
etymological figure, but b sthirā́śávāṃsi is not, though it has the same syntactic
configuration as pāda a.
The loose construction of the instr. marúdbhiḥ is similar to that in 5a.

### 8  
The nominal equations of 7ab continue in the first half of this vs., and
śubhráḥ picks up śubhā́śóbhiṣṭhāḥ of 6b. Although śúṣmaḥ is not etymologically
related to śubhráḥ, they are alliterative.
Pāda c contains a rhyming simile: dhúnir múnir. Such full rhyme is quite rare
in the RV and seems to provide the crescendo of this highly wrought little passage.
Note also that the final of d, dhṛṣṇóḥ, is a slight flip of the initial of c, dhúniḥ.
82
82
In order to get a proper Dvipadā Virāj line, the iva of c has to be read ‘va, as it
sometimes is elsewhere. See Old. If the particle is disyllabic, however, it makes cd a
Triṣṭubh pāda. Since the Dvipadā Virāj section of the hymn is drawing to a close
(fully Triṣtubh starting with vs. 12), the possible double metrical reading here may
be gesturing towards the upcoming Triṣṭubh takeover. Indeed the Dvipadā Virāj
begins to break up beginning in vs. 10, despite the Anukr. identification of 1–11 as
DV.
In the simile of c, iva (/va) is out of place; we expect *dhúnir iva múniḥ. This
displacement was doubtless made to draw attention to the rhyme noted above. But it
also interacts somewhat with the question of whether cd contains two DV pādas or
one Triṣṭubh, because a quick glance at Lub shows that iva is fairly rare immediately
after the caesura, which would be its position here if we are dealing with a Triṣṭubh
pāda. I imagine that this rarity has less to do with iva’s accentless status (though that
might contribute) than with its usual tendency to take 2nd position, which would
generally put it earlier in the line. There certainly do exist trimeter lines with iva
post-caesura, e.g., IV.18.6 ṛtāvarīr iva saṃkróṣamānāḥ (cf. also V.1.1, 11.5, etc.);
they are just less common than I had expected.

### 10  
The metrical decay noted for 8cd continues here. Although the first half of
the vs. has the expected 10 syllables with a word boundary after 5 -- thus allowing a
division into two DV pādas -- the opening of b is huve, an unaccented verb. In the
immediately preceding vs. pāda b opens with accented yuyóta, which must owe its
accent to its pāda-initial position, as there are no syntactic features favoring it. The
DV here is far less sensitive to the pāda boundary. Even more clearly, the second
half of the vs. is an undoubted Triṣṭubh, since it has 11 syllables and a caesura after
the first 4, with the unaccented voc. maruto spanning syllables 5–7.
Both Ge and Re (also Lub) take vāvaśānā́ḥ to √vaś ‘want, desire’ with the
supposed object being soma, but I think it makes more sense, and requires less
machinery, to assign it to √vāś ‘bellow’. Otherwise too much has been gapped and
needs to be supplied; cf. Re’s expansive parenthesis: “… pour qu’à satiété … (vous
vous gorgiez de soma, le) désirant-avec-force.” See the same disagreement about the
affiliation of the same participle in VII.36.6, with comm. ad loc.

### 11  
This vs. is unambiguously Triṣṭubh, consisting of two pādas of 11
syllables. The first has an opening of 5, which could be a self-contained pāda of DV,
but what follows it is 6 syllables, marking the whole as a single Triṣṭubh pāda. The
second part is even less ambiguous, as it has an opening of 4, so a DV division is
impossible. The only feature that matches that of DV is that there are only two
Triṣṭubh pādas in the vs., not four.
On iṣmín- see comm. ad I.87.6.

### 12  
The metrical boundary, however fuzzy, between the DV and Triṣṭubh
sections separates the first part of the hymn from the more ritually focused one
83
83
beginning here. The expression hinomy adhvarám “I set the ceremony in motion”
announces the inauguration of the sacrifice.
This vs. harps, rather tediously, on the adj. śúci- ‘gleaming’, which occurs 6x,
twice each in pādas a, b, and d.
Pāda c contrasts ṛtá- in ṛténa … ṛta-sā́paḥ with satyá-, the latter as goal of √i
‘go, come’. In my view, satyám … āyan refers to the truth-serving Maruts’ epiphany
on the ritual ground: they “came to reality” for the sacrificers, that is, they became
really present. This epiphany is effected “by truth”: the operation of the properly
performed ritual mechanism.

### 13  
This vs. has no finite verbs, but three predicated tense-stem participles: pf.
upaśiśriyāṇā́ḥ (b), aor. rucānā́ḥ (c), pres. yáchamānāḥ (d), in a hymn already well
provided with such (see 10d, 11d).
As for upaśiśriyāṇā́ḥ, although pf. participles regularly have preterital value,
the middle pf. of √śri is presential (Kü 527–28) and stative, and this form contrasts
with the far more common ppl. śrita- ‘set’ -- hence my “being set,” though this
rendering somewhat undercuts the stative value.
In cd it is possible that only one of the participles is predicated, and in fact the
publ. tr. renders pāda c as wholly a simile. However, this hemistich could contain
two independent predications: “(you are) shining like …; (you are) holding
yourselves …” In any case there is an unsignaled change of subject between the
hemistichs: in ab the ornaments (nom. khādáyaḥ, rukmā́ḥ) are the grammatical
subjects, while in d the Maruts must be supplied because the participle yáchamānāḥ
seems to assume an animate subject. Pāda c is ambiguous: either the brilliants
(rukmā́ḥ) or the Maruts can be shining. The etymological relationship between
rukmā́ḥ in b and the part. rucānā́ḥ in c might suggest that c goes with b. However, in
my publ. tr. I have privileged the hemistich boundary and supplied the Maruts as subj.
of c (as do Ge and Re), but the other interpr. is certainly possible. One argument for
the standard interpr. might be that the subjects of medial participles to √ruc (wellattested rócamāna-, as well as rucāná-, rurucāná-, rórucāna-) are generally gods.

### 14  
Ge suggests (n. 14a) that the budhnyā̀… máhāṃsi “deep-grounded
powers” are the “verborgenen Herrlichkeiten” (niṇyā́) concealed in Pṛśni’s udder in
vs. 4. Even leaving aside the fact that, as was discussed above, ū́dhaḥ in vs. 4 should
not be a loc., this interpr. seems both unnec. and too specific, esp. since 10 vss.
intervene. budhnyà- here may refer to the powers that the Maruts, gods associated
with the midspace, derive from the earth below, or it may simply mean something
like ‘fundamental’, by a semantic development parallel to that of the Engl. word.
The preverb prá is showcased in the first hemistich: prá … īrate …, prá …
prayajyavas tiradhvam. I am not certain what prá √tṝ nā́māni in b is meant to convey,
but I interpr. it in the context of the importance of the Maruts’ individual identities
(vss. 1–4) and of calling their names (10a) earlier in the hymn. Perhaps the Maruts
need to “put their names forward” and make themselves individually known before
they can enjoy the Gṛhamedha offering.
84
84
As noted in the publ. intro., the ritual references in pādas b-d are quite
specific, alluding to the Maruts’ role in the Sākamedha, the last of the Cāturmāsyāni
(“Four-monthly”) rituals. See the publ. intro. for further details.

### 15  
The phonological figure of the two words adhīthá, itthā́straddling the
pāda boundary of ab provide a nice little study in syllable weight. (The echo is of
course obscured by the application of sandhi in the Saṃhitā text: adhīthéthā́). If we
add in the opening of the vs., yádi, the echo is even more pronounced: yádi …
adhīthá, itthā́, with (y)ádi doubling adhī.
Exactly what itthā́is doing here is unclear to me, but this adverb several times
appears in context with vípra- and some verb of invoking (see Ge ad VII.94.5), as
here (with the invoking represented by the nominal hávīman). Cf. VII.94.5 … īḷata,
itthā́víprāsaḥ, IV.29.4 = VIII.7.30 itthā́vípraṃ hávamānam. I suggest that itthā́
refers to the precise manner in which a vípra- makes the invocation.
The Maruts are asked to “give study to / be mindful of” what is stutásya.
stutá- is of course a very common past passive participle meaning ‘(what/who is)
praised’. In this context we might rather expect the abstract noun ‘praise’, and indeed
Ge simply so tr.: “… des Lobpreises eingedenk seid,” with no explicit comment, but
a crossref. (n. 15a) to several passages with a similar idiom but with stotrásya ‘praise
song’ instead of stutásya (e.g., V.55.9 ádhi stótrasya … gātana). But the poet could
easily have used stotrásya here in the same metrical slot if he had wanted to, and so I
think we must take the ppl. seriously. Re in fact does so -- “prêtez-attention à la
chose-louée” -- though in his n. he simply notes its similarity to the stotrá- passages.
I think the point is a cleverer one: the poet suggests that if the Maruts pay attention to
what we poets praise -- what gifts we poets praise -- they will know what to bestow
on us. The “if” clause is immediately followed by its corollary: “right away give (us)
wealth …” -- the poet implying that the Maruts are a quick study! Although I must
admit that stutá- ‘praised’ seems always to refer to gods, not to material objects, the
semantic extension seems an easy one, and we can invoke the term dāna-stuti-
‘praise of the gift’ – though it’s notable that, although this term is ubiquitous in
secondary lit. on the RV, it is not actually attested in Vedic.
By my rules, we might expect that anyáḥ in d should be definite (‘the other’)
rather than the indefinite ‘another’ that better fits the passage (unless we assume that
the anyáḥ is a rival poet). However, I suggest that nū́cid … anyáḥ is a composite
negative indefinite expression like ná káś cid anyáh. Cf. VIII.24.11 nū́anyátrā cid …
The cadence of d is bad. It is tempting to emend injunc. ādábhat to subj.
ādábhāt, which would fix the meter and fit the sense (in fact, the publ. tr. renders the
verb as if a subj.: ‘will … swindle’), though no doubt the temptation should be
resisted.

### 16  
Each pāda in this vs. contains a simile marked by ná comparing the
Maruts to domestic animals (a, d), spirits (b), and children (c). Except in c, the simile
begins the pāda. The vs. contains only one finite verb, śubháyanta, in b; the
functional role of the finite verb is filled instead by the adjectives that are the point of
85
85
contact between the simile and the frame. In the publ. tr. I deliberately failed to
render ab as the rel. cl. it technically is because the “which Maruts … they …”
structure would have intruded upon the succession of similes.
In b opinion is divided on the sense of yakṣa-dṛ́ś-. Ge takes -dṛ́ś- as active,
with the first member in an acc. relationship with it (“Geisterseher”), flg. Sāy. in his
analysis of the syntax of the cmpd., though not of the meaning of the first member.
So also Re. However, Ge considers the possibility of a pass. sense in his n. (16b), and
Old opts for the pass. interpr. For disc. of this cmpd. see Scar (232); of his choices I
opt for the bahuvrīhi.
Another oblation to the Maruts at the Sākamedha, besides the Gṛhamedha
mentioned above (vs. 14), is made to the krīḍin- (‘playful’) Maruts on the 2nd day of
the sacrifice (see, e.g., ŚB II: 20 and Eggeling, SBE XII.408). The characterization of
them in d as prakrīḷínaḥ obviously makes ref. to this oblation.

### 17  
This vs. has the feel of a final vs. Though there is no overt sign of a break
with what follows, the next vs. turns its attention to the Hotar, Agni, and this might
be taken as a change of subject.
In the cadence of pāda a mṛḷantu should be read with a light root syllable,
contrary to normal practice. Old doubts that the form should be read with this
exceptional light syllable and ascribes the irregularity to “die metrische Unebenheit”
of this hymn, while HvN do accept the light reading and adduce one other occurrence
that requires this scansion (IV.3.3, though that passage looks more equivocal to me).
Ge and Re take varivasyá-, lit. ‘make wide space’, in a general ‘help, protect’
sense (e.g., “qui protègent les Deux Mondes bien fixés”). But surely the beneficiaries
are us (not the two worlds), and the idea is to make the worlds spacious for us.
### 18–19
As was just noted, vs. 17 “feels” like a final (or pseudo-final) vs. If vs.
18 marks a new beginning, we can note both that in vs. 18 the Hotar invokes the gods
as he would at the beginning of a sacrifice and that in vs. 19 (and 20a) the Maruts are
referred to four times (19a, b, c, 20a) with the near-deictic pronoun imé “these right
here,” which might indicate their epiphany on the ritual ground.

### 18  
The first hemistich of this vs. presents us with a common problem: the
most obvious way to interpr. it meets a syntactic stumbling block that should not
allow that interpr., and the standard interpr. ignore that obstruction. In this case the
issue is the middle participle gṛṇānáḥ. This part. is attested over 50x; the vast
majority of these attestations are clearly passive in value. In fact, Gr interpr. only 2
forms as “medial” (that is, transitive, not passive): this passage and I.181.9.
Nonetheless, both Ge and Re take it as transitive here (though with different objects)
without comment. But I think we ignore the use of the overwhelming majority of
forms at our peril. In fact, since Agni as Hotar is the implicit subject of the sentence,
a passive value of gṛṇānáḥ is easily possible: as both Hotar and god, Agni performs a
ritual invocation (as priest) while himself being hymned (as god). (The other
86
86
occurrence flagged by Gr as non-passive, I.181.9, is indeed transitive, but owes its
anomalous usage to special circumstances. See comm. ad loc.)
If we eliminate gṛṇānáḥ as a potential governor of an object, the acc. satrā́cīṃ
rātím must be construed with ā́… johavīti. Although the acc. with (ā́) √hvā is more
usually a god or other animate being, abstract entities (like ‘giving’ here) are also
possible. The vaḥ in 2nd position in pāda a, which might have served as acc. to ā́…
johavīti must then be a gen. dependent on the acc. NP. The more usual configuration
is restored in pāda d havate vaḥ “he calls upon you,” a minor ex. of poetic repair.
In c both Ge and Re supply ‘sacrificer’ with gen. ī́vataḥ ‘such’, while I supply
‘wealth’. There is in fact no good support for either position that I can find. I prefer
mine because ‘wealth’ would pick up ‘giving’ from the previous pāda, whereas there
is no mention of a sacrificer anywhere. But I do not strongly favor my solution.
gopā́- ‘herdsman’ is regularly construed with ṛtásya ‘truth’ (e.g., I.163.5, III.10.2), so
perhaps that phrase is meant, anticipating ádvayāvī ‘without duplicity’ in d. Note that
the gopā́- is also ádabdha-/ ádabhya- ‘undeceivable’ (e.g., II.9.6, X.25.7).

### 19  
As was noted above, this vs. contains three examples of the near-deictic
imé, opening the first three pādas. The publ. tr. only fully renders the first one, as
three examples of “these here” seemed too heavy. It is also worth noting that, though
the imé forms might suggest the presence of the Maruts right here at the sacrifice (as
was suggested above), the clauses in which they are found describe general activities
of those gods, which would almost necessarily be performed away from the ritual
ground.
Both Ge and Re follow the Pp. reading sáhasaḥ. Re interpr. it rather loosely
as an abl., whereas Ge takes it as a gen. and as if it were the differently accented poss.
adj. *sahásaḥ (“die Gewalt des Gewaltigen”), without comment. Old suggests that
the better reading is dat. sáhase and cites passages containing ā́√nam with the dat. I
follow this interpr.

### 20  
Ge and Re both take b as a self-contained clause. I think it better (with
MMüller in SBE) to take bhṛ́miṃ cid beginning b as obj. to junanti in pāda a, parallel
to radhráṃ cid -- beginning a new clause with yáthā in the middle of b. The point
would be that the Maruts are so vigorous that they can energize both an entity that
has no energy at all (“the feeble”) and one that has energy in excess (a whirlwind).

### 21  
The adj. sujātá- ‘well-born’ generally refers to gods, or at least to mortals;
it is only here used of material goods (implicitly vasavyà- in the preceding pāda,
hence my ‘of good quality’. Of course, it is possible that vasavyà- here refers, at least
partly, to human capital (sons), as apparently in II.9.5 ubháyam te ná kṣīyate
vasavyàm ... krdhi páti ̥ ṃ svapatyásya rāyáḥ, where the second category of “goods of
both types” (ubháyam … vasavyàm) is “wealth in good descendents” (svapatyásya
rāyáḥ). But I don’t think this is a necessary interpr.: “well-born/produced” is likely
available to semantic extension.

### 22  
As most interpr. point out, the three locc. in b are especially contested
objects for the Ārya. See esp. Proferes (98): “Because of their economic value, rivers,
plants and clans were subject to competing claims, and constituted flashpoints for
conflict between various groups for whom control over resources meant increased
power” -- as well as his elucidation of the three terms. See also Thieme (Fremdling
55), Oberlies (I.350).
Fem. yahvī́- ‘exuberant’ is in the pl. typed for rivers/waters.

### 23  
Despite the use of √kṛ ‘make’ (2nd pl. pf. cakra), it is not likely that the
Maruts created the ukthā́ni themselves, though they are singers on other occasions;
rather they provided the occasion and the subject for the poets of earlier eras to
celebrate them. Though Re’s ‘provoke’ is a bit strong, it’s the right idea. My ‘have
given rise to’ is a bit weak.

### 24  
The sense of pāda d is somewhat unclear and the various tr. incompatible.
Ge’s “wir möchten euch mehr gelten als das eigene Heim” seems esp. difficult to
wring out of the Skt., though the other possibilities he suggests in the n. (24d) are
somewhat more likely. I start with the abhí √as lexeme, which generally means
‘surmount, dominate, be superior’, which doesn’t seem to be reflected in the Ge
suggestions. However, in my interpr. the enclitic vaḥ has only the vaguest syntactic
connection to the clause. I do not have a better solution.
## 57
Maruts

### 1  
My interpr. differs considerably from the standard—Old, Ge, Re —all of
whom take ab as a single clause, with the sg. nā́ma mā́rutam the subject of 3rd pl.
madanti and mádhvaḥ the oblique obj. of that verb. So, e.g., Old “Am Honigtrank
erfreut sich … euer Marutname (=Marutgeschlecht).” The number disagreement
between subj. and verb is taken as a constructio ad sensum (so explicitly Ge n. 1ab,
sim. Old), and the clash between 2nd person encl. vaḥ / voc. yajatrāḥ and the 3rd ps.
verb is glossed over. I find these disharmonies disturbing and prefer to separate the
two pādas. By my interpr., as noted in the publ. intro., pāda a has an idiomatic
contruction very similar to Engl. “has X’s name on it,” meaning “is destined for /
belongs to X.” (“That cookie has your name on it” means “you should take it; I’ll
cede it.”) Then in b the person switches from 2nd (vaḥ … yajatrāḥ) to 3rd (madanti
with gapped subj. = Maruts), but the number is unchanged. This situation lasts
through then first hemistich of vs. 2. As for the sense, I take the ‘honey’ to refer to
the soma to be offered to the Maruts at the sacrifices mentioned in b: the soma
oblation at the sacrifice in question is intended just for them. Alternatively, but less
likely in my view, it could refer to the rain that the Maruts produce. In that case it
would have the Maruts’ name because it is their product. The rain is metaphorically
referred to in d pínvanti útsam “they swell the wellspring.”
The relationship among the clauses in the 2nd hemistich isn’t certain, although
there are no real implications whichever interpr. is chosen. With the standard tr. I
88
88
take pínvanti útsam, which opens d, as the main clause on which both the preceding
rel. (c: yé rejáyanti) and the following temporal clause (yád áyāsuḥ) depend. In this
case pínvanti would be accented because it opens its pāda. However, that verb could
be part of the rel. cl. starting in c (yé …), with all of cd dependent on b: “… they
become exhilarated -- they who set … to trembling (and) swell the wellspring, when
…”

### 2  
The two suffix-accented -tár- agent nouns in the first hemistich take
accusative objects, rather than the expected gen. (nicetā́raḥ … gṛṇántam, praṇetā́raḥ
… mánma). See Tichy (363–64). Although Tichy suggests some possible reasons for
this unexpected (but not vanishingly rare) construction (pp. 367ff.), they don’t seem
to be particularly applicable here.
I see no easy way to get a causal sense from hí, hence my “surely.”
Object-less vītáye is clarified by 6b vyantu … hávīṃṣi.
The pf. part. pipriyāṇā́ḥ is interpr. by Ge/Re as implicitly prospective: the
Maruts will become pleased/gratified as a result of their vītí-. I take it rather as
having preterital value: they have first been gratified by the initial guest-reception
ritual and are now awaiting their meal. A passage like I.73.1 átithir ná prīṇānáh
“being gratified like a guest” supports this interpr.

### 3  
Ge takes anyé with marútaḥ: “Nicht glänzen andere Marut so sehr wie
diese …” But both the position of yáthā, which in its simile-marking role should
follow the first term of the simile, and common sense (who would the other Maruts
be?) strongly suggest that anyé refers to a group separate from the Maruts. By my
rules anyé should be definite, and I think Re is correct in supplying ‘gods’. This
would make sense in a ritual context: the other divine visitors at the ritual (save for
Indra) are pretty drab compared with the Maruts.
Since the other occurrence of viśva-píś- modifies Dawn’s cart (VII.75.6), as
Old points out a passive sense ‘all-adorned’ is more likely than ‘all-adorning’. So
Scar (319) ‘allgeschmückt’.
The middle part. piśāná- is an isolated form: the only apparent attestation of a
root aor. to this root, beside the thematized nasal pres. piṃśá- and the pf. pipeśa, etc.
(However, piśā́in VII.18.2 is taken by most as an impv. to a thematic aorist [see
comm. ad loc.], which could easily have replaced the opaque root aor. impv. *pīḍhí,
so the root does have a fragmentary aor. system.) That it is a participle at all has been
called into question by John Lowe, who suggests it may be a Caland adj. instead
(“Caland adjectives …” 2012: 92–93; see also Participles in Rigvedic Sanskrit 2015:
133). Although I don’t see any advantage in assigning it to a category of dubious
existence (Caland adj. in -āná-), its isolation does make it difficult to interpr. As a
medial form, it might be expected to match the medial perfect usage and be pass.
(e.g., VI.49.3) or reflexive (V.60.4) vel sim. However, it is generally taken as
transitive, as in the publ. tr., with the transitive value ascribed to the preverb ā́(see
Gr) opening c. Lowe (Part. 133) disputes this interpr., declaring the supposed tmesis
between preverb and participle here “a unique type of discontinuity.” He prefers to
89
89
construe ā́with the finite verb añjate in d and take piśānā́ḥ as an intransitive adj.;
ródasī is then an obj. of añjate along with samānám añjí and not construed with
piśānā́ḥ: “All adorned and decorated, they anoint / the two worlds (with) the same
anointing for beauty.” As far as I can find, however, there are no occurrences of √añj
with double acc. When the object anointed is in the acc., the ointment is in the instr.,
so his suggested interpr. would be syntactically unique in a different way. I therefore
prefer to construe both ā́and ródasī with piśānā́ḥ. However, the construction need
not be transitive “adorning the two-world halves,” as is the standard interpr. and publ.
tr. Old suggests several other possible relations (see also Re’s n.), including that
ródasī might be an internal / Inhalts-type of acc., expressing the ornament, hence
“wearing the two world-halves as adornment.” Old ultimately rejects this interpr., as
does the publ. tr., but it remains a possibility, one that would better reflect the medial
form.

### 4  
Unlike Ge/Re I attach b to c, not to a. Nothing rests on this, but the cause
and the (hoped-for non-)effect are more closely allied that way.
I did not tr. vaḥ in c, which would have necessitated the awk. rendering “…
into the way of it of yours.” This vs. is over-supplied with vaḥ-s, with one in each
pāda.

### 5  
Ge and Re tr. raṇanta as a modal (“sollen sich … erfreuen”; “Que les
Maruts se réjouissent …”), as does Hoffmann (259), who explicitly identifies it as a
subjunctive, not an injunctive, flg. Re (BSL 33.1: 6–7), who claims that -anta is a
regular RVic subjunctive ending. I think a modal value, whether the form is
identified as injunctive or subjunctive, is unnecessary and in fact fits the context less
well than a preterital reading. Previous vss. refer to the performance of the sacrifice
at which the Maruts are present (esp. 1ab and 2). They are now asked to provide
benefits in return, and so we might assume that the sacrifice is now over (though 6ab
gives me pause), an assumption supported by kṛté with its past reference: ‘what has
been/was done’.
In the publ. tr. cid is not tr. I think it is a simple emphatic here “in just what
has been done here,” which is somewhat stilted in Eng., or else (perhaps more likely)
it actually emphasizes the following word átra: “in what has been done here” -- at
our sacrifice, not at someone else’s. So Sāy. It could, of course, mean “also” or
“even,” but neither of those makes sense in context -- nor does Ge’s (/Hoffmann’s)
“wenigstens” or Re’s “(un peu) même.”

### 6  
With Ge, I take víśvebhir nā́mabhiḥ with stutā́saḥ, despite the displacement
of word order. In fact, there’s nowhere else to put that unwieldy instr. phrase but at
the beginning of a new pāda. Re tr. it as an independent phrase, whose referent and
relation to the rest of the sentence aren’t clear to me: “Alors, (une fois) loués, que les
seigneurs Marut agréent, de tous (leurs) noms, les offrandes!”
90

### 7  
The contrast of víśve … sarvátātā “all (of you) … in (your) totality”
highlights a constant theme of Marut hymns, that they are both individuals
(emphasized by “all your names” in 6b) and a collectivity. See the treatment of this at
the beginning of the previous hymn (VII.56) and comm. thereon.
The position of the patrons (sūrí-) as middle men in the circulation of goods
and services is nicely expressed here: you help the patrons; they help us.
## 58
Maruts

### 1  
The gen. phrase daívyasya dhā́mnaḥ does not have a clear syntactic
relationship to the rest of its clause. The standard interpr. (Ge, Re, Scar [62])
resupplies the word gaṇá- in the rel. clause and seems to take the phrase as gen. of
material, as it were: e.g., Ge “die starke (Truppe) der göttlischen Rasse.” By contrast
I treat the possessive adj. túviṣmant- as a real possessive with the gen. phrase
implicitly dependent on the underlying nominal tuví(s)-/*távis-, hence “having the
power of its divine nature.”
The utá beginning the 2nd hemistich is relatively functionless. Klein (DGRV
I.375–78) says it signals weak nexus between distichs with non-parallel structure. It
might also be possible to claim that it is a sort of inverse utá, which should connect c
with d, which are syntactically and thematically parallel. I also think it possible that
it expresses a covert conceptual connection between the heaven indirectly referred to
in b (daívya-) and the midspace defined by the two world-halves in c, a space also
indirectly measured by the distance from ‘chaos, disorder’ (nírṛti-) and the heavenly
vault (nā́ka-) in d.

### 2  
Like the gen. phrase in 1b, the instr. tveṣyèṇa has insufficient syntactic
grounding in its clause. Like Ge “(geschieht)” and Re “(s’est produite),” I see no
choice but to supply a verb to link the subject janū́ḥ and the instr.
I have no opinion on the morphology of janū́ḥ. Gr calls it a masculine nom. sg.
to the -us-stem janús-, an interpr. bolstered by the acc. form janúṣam (3x). AiG
II.2.490 posits a paradigm of alternating gender, with m. or f. in the (nom./acc.)
singular, but neuter in the dual and plural, which accords with the distribution of
forms in the RV (du. janúṣī, pl. janū́ṃṣi) but fails to account for the gender switch. In
the same vol. (II.2.496–97) Debrunner suggests that our janū́ḥ belongs to a -ū-stem
(though acc. janúṣam would still need to be a masc. [or fem.] form to an -us-stem).
The problem is that non-neut. forms of -is- and -us-stems don’t lengthen the suffixal
vowel in the nom. sg., unlike -as-stems. However, it seems possible that our janū́ḥ
contains a nonce lengthening on the model of the vastly more common masc. -asstems, as AiG III.292 indirectly allows. It should also be noted that because of
following cid, the suffixal syllable of the preceding noun would be heavy, whether it
originally read janū́ś cid, as in the transmitted text, or *janúś cid, as grammar would
have us expect.
The relationship between the first hemistich and the rel. cl. in c displays the
RV’s customary willingness to switch person reference in midstream and without
91
91
warning. The first hemistich refers to the Maruts in the 2nd ps., with the enclitic vaḥ
in a and the b pāda consisting only of vocatives. Because there is nothing to lean on,
all three vocatives are accented, but in all three cases the initial accent contrasts with
the inherent accent of the stem: bhī́māsaḥ (bhīmá-); túvimanyavaḥ (tuvi- cmpds. are
accented either on the 2nd member [e.g., tuvi-rā́dhas-] or on the 2nd syllable of the
first member [e.g., tuví-brahman-]); áyāsaḥ (ayā́s-). There could therefore be no
doubt that the reference is 2nd person; yet the rel. cl. that picks up the referents with
the nom. pl. prn. yé is unequivocally in the 3rd ps.: (prá …) sánti. The following pāda
returns to 2nd ps. ref. with vaḥ.
On the “X Y utá” construction (rather than expected X utá Y) see Klein
DGRV I. 344ff.

### 3  
In pāda a I take maghávadbhyaḥ as referring to our human patrons, because
I take the Maruts as subj. of the 2nd pl. impv.: dadhāta. However given the
connections between 3ab and 6ab (for which see below), where maghónām refers to
the Maruts, it is quite possible that the subj. of the impv. is the poet’s fellow priests
and the Maruts are the referent of maghávadbhyaḥ.
The simile in c causes some interpretational problems. Both Old (ad VI.50.10)
and Re suggest interpr. that violate the structure of the RVic simile, and I think both
treatments are wrong; Ge’s treatment is more possible, though it differs from my
own. All three take jantúm as part of the simile with gató nā́dhvā (= ná ádhvā),
roughly for both “as a travelled road leads (the) people on,” while I take jantúm in
the frame.
The RVic simile is only nominal; when a verb is involved it is shared by
simile and frame. Both Old and Re take c as entirely simile, with its own independent
verb (ví tirāti), and d as a loosely (Old) or more tightly (Re) connected frame, with
its own verb (prá … tireta). Old explicitly argues (ad VI.50.10) that ná can
sometimes be a quasi-clausal simile marker, and he tr. “Der gegangene Weg
vergleichsweise mag einen Menschen vorwärts bringen: so bringt auch uns verwärts.”
After examining all the similes in the RV (see my “Case disharmony in RVic similes.”
IIJ 24 [1982] 251-71), I would vigorously contest his characterization of ná. Re’s tr.
has a more conventional simile/frame relationship, but still violates the shared verb
rule: “Comme le chemin parcouru fait passer l’homme outre, qu’elle nous pousse
(plus) avant …” (The subject of d, “elle,” seems to refer to the suṣṭutí- in b.)
Although the structural violation in Re’s tr. would be mitigated by the fact that the
two verbs belong to the same verb stem, tirá-, they have different preverbs (ví and
prá), and therefore different senses, and are also in different moods (subj. and opt.).
Ge’s rendering, “Wie ein zurückgelegter Weg der Leute, so möge es (uns)
zum Ziele führen,” respects the simile structure, with the subject in the frame (“es”)
presumably referring to the good praise in b (see Re also), but the sense seems off. If
the praise is to bring anyone or -thing across, it should be the Maruts (brought to our
sacrifice), not us. Still I would be willing to consider a variation of Ge’s interpr.,
with the praise as subj. in the frame, but the Maruts as obj.: “As a road when it’s
travelled (does) people, (the good praise) will bring the (Maruts) across.”
92
92
However, I think it likely that the focus in this 2nd hemistich has shifted to the
help that the Maruts will give us when they have enjoyed our praise (see the thrice
repeated yuṣmótaḥ ‘aided by you’ in the next vs., 4abc). In particular, pāda d prá ṇá
spārhā́bhir ūtíbhis tireta is almost identical to VII.84.3 prá ṇá spārhā́bhir ūtíbhis
tiretam, addressed to Indra and Varuṇa. In the latter passage, tiretam must be a 2nd du.
active opt. with Indra and Varuṇa as subj. In other words, in that passage gods are the
subject. In our passage tireta is ambiguous: it can be a 2nd pl. act. opt. or a 3rd sg. mid.
opt., and different factors pull in different directions. The parallel in VII.84.3
suggests we have gods, namely the Maruts, as subject here too, and the easiest way to
do that is take it as a 2nd pl. A passage in the preceding hymn, VII.57.5 prá vā́jebhis
tirata puṣyáse naḥ “Further us with prizes for our thriving,” with 2nd pl. act. impv. to
the same stem, also supports this interpr. This is the analysis of Gr, and it is also
responsible for Old’s “So bringt …” On the other hand, the clear 3rd sg. tirāti in c
invites a 3rd sg. interpr. also of tireta, and the following hymn contains the idioms we
have here, prá √tṝ and ví √tṝ, there with a single instance of the verb stem in the 3rd
sg. middle positioned between the preverbs: VII.59.2 prá sá kṣáyaṃ tirate ví mahī́r
íṣaḥ “He furthers his dwelling place, ex(tends) his great refreshments.” Re and Ge
both opt for the 3rd sg. middle interpr., but the subject they each (seem to) provide is
the good praise of b, a far cry from the gods we expect as subject of the expression
found in d. My interpr. of cd solves both problems, though, admittedly, not in the
most elegant fashion. I supply ‘flock’ (gaṇá-; see 1a) as the subj. of both ví tirāti and
prá … tireta. We thus have a singular subject that will allow tireta to harmonize with
tirāti and the divine subject that will allow d to harmonize with VII.84.3.

### 4  
As noted just above, this vs. is structured by three (abc) pāda-init. yuṣṃótaḥ
‘aided by you’. The three separate clauses containing this opening build on each
other in an interesting way, and the first two are also linked by a
morphophonological relationship.
To begin with the latter, both a and b end with a predicated -ín-stem
qualifying the successful poet and the successful steed respectively with semantically
parallel descriptors: … śatasvī́, … sahasrī́“possessing hundreds … possessing
thousands.” The two words are also phonologically similar; to put it schematically,
SaCasRī́, where the -s-Resonant-ī́final is esp. salient. The second one is correctly
formed (to sahásra-) and well attested. The first is a hapax and aberrantly formed:
the expected -ín-stem to śatá- is śatín-, which is in fact reasonably well attested.
śatasvín- is obviously modeled on sahasrín- (already implied by AiG II.2.917 and Re
ad loc.), aided by the fact that -vín- is regularly added to -as-stems (AiG II.2.917). So
with śatá- temporarily re-configured as an -as-stem, the suffix -vín- can be affixed,
allowing the stem to parallel sahasrín- in metrical and phonological shape. In b
sahasrī́is immediately preceded by sáhuriḥ, which reinforces the phonological
pattern: sahVri(ḥ).
Now as to the relations among the three yuṣmótaḥ clauses. I suggest that they
can be seen as an instance of Behagel’s Law (the law of “increasing members”)
involving syntactic blocks, not merely NPs. Pāda a contains a noun and a predicated
93
93
adj. (vípraḥ … śatasvī́); pāda b a noun and two predicated adjectives (árvā sáhuriḥ
sahasrī́). And pāda c has two clauses, a nominal one consisting of a noun (samrā́ṭ)
predicated of an unexpressed subject (=Indra), and a full clause, with finite verb and
object (hanti vṛtrám). My view of the increasing complication of syntactic structure
in these three clauses produces interpr. of two of the clauses that differ from the
standard. In b both Ge and Re (also Klein, DGRV I.436) take sáhuriḥ as an
attributive adj. and only sahasrī́as predicated (e.g., “… does the winning steed
become a possessor of thousand(-fold) booty”). This is of course possible, but both
the structural argument already adduced and the pragmatic fact that the horse has to
become victorious before he wins prizes speak for my interpr.
In c the difference between interpr. is greater. I take samrā́ṭ as one clause,
with the noun predicated of unmentioned Indra : “(Indra) is sovereign king.” This
clause is linked to the next (hanti vṛtrám) by utá: “and (he) smites Vṛtra.” Ge, Re,
and Klein all take samrā́ṭ simply as the subj. of hanti (e.g., “and with your aid does
the great king smash the obstacle”). But this interpr. must ignore or explain away the
position of utá. Klein is the only one who is explicit about the function of utá. He
groups it with passages that contain “a repeated term within one of a set of parallel
clauses,” conjoined by utá. But in the other exx. he gives (pp. 436–37) the utá is
adjacent to the repeated element and in Wackernagel’s position. In our passage this
should yield *yuṣmóta utá samrā́ṭ. Klein does not comment on utá’s position here.
Although one could argue (though Klein does not) that utá was displaced to the right
to avoid the clash …-óta utá, in fact that is the kind of clash that RVic poets like!
(Indeed the presence of utá in this pāda may be partly to call attention to the
compositionally suppressed -ūtá-.) My interpr. takes the utá as properly positioned to
conjoin two clauses, and no special pleading (much less ignoring of the problem) is
required.
Although Indra’s name is not mentioned, hanti vṛtrám is of course a
definitional predicate for Indra, who is also regularly identified as a samrā́j-. The
Maruts’ role in helping Indra in the Vṛtra conflict is of course one of the contended
issues in the RV (see the Agastya hymn I.165 for example).
Re takes abc as expressing the three functions, which I find hard to see. Does
he assume pāda b is the third function and c the second? Surely he doesn't see the
smashing of Vṛtra in c as third function!

On jijīḷiré as a presential stative, see Kü (610–11).

### 6  
The first hemistich, which contains both suṣṭutí- ‘good praise’ and a form
of √juṣ ‘enjoy’ with the Maruts as subject, but in separate clauses is an expansion of
3b jújoṣann ín marútaḥ suṣṭutíṃ naḥ. As was noted above, the first pāda of 3 also
contains a pl. form of maghávan(t)-, which I take there as referring to our human
patrons, because I take the Maruts as subject of the 2nd pl. impv., but the presence of
maghónām here, clearly referring to the Maruts, may instead suggest that the
maghávant-s in 3a are also the Maruts.
94
94
idám in b (idáṃ sūktám) is yet another example of the frequent use of a form
of ayám in the last vs. of a hymn to refer to the whole preceding hymn.
## 59
Maruts

### 1  
The āmreḍita idám-idam in pāda a must go with the clause in b. The ca that
connects the two clauses is slightly displaced: we might expect it to occur after the
first element of its clause, namely idám-idam. But the pāda boundary and the
intrusion of a pāda-initial voc. dévāsaḥ have clearly interfered with the placement,
and the sequence yám … yáṃ ca makes the syntax perspicuous.
The sequence of vocc. in cd is puzzling because the first is unaccented, while
the rest are accented, including those that follow the first in the same pāda: tásmā
agne váruṇa mítrā́ryaman, márutaḥ … We would, I think, expect either all accented
(*ágne váruṇa mítrā́ryaman) or all unaccented (agne *varuṇa mitrāryaman). Old
suggests that a new “Ansatz” begins after tásmā agne, and it is of course true that the
caesura follows agne -- but also of course true that vocatives are not ordinarily
accented in that position. He also points out that the three vocc. in the 2nd part of the
pāda are the names of the three principal Ādityas, which occur together and as
accented vocc. elsewhere (V.67.1, VIII.19.35). In the latter passage the three vocc.
are found pāda-internal post-caesura as here (see comm. ad loc.) Both of the factors
adduced by Old no doubt contributed to the accentual behavior of this pāda, but it is
a fine reminder that the rules of voc. accent, which we think of as fairly mechanical,
are in part rhetorically driven.

### 2  
yuṣmā́kam … ávasā is a variant of the cmpd. yuṣmóta- (i.e., yuṣmā́-ūta-)
found three times in the preceding hymn in VII.58.4.
The vs. contains two, or implicitly three, 3rd sg. act. present forms of the root
√tṝ, tarati in b, prá / ví tirati in c. For the same pairing of preverbs, see comm. ad

This vs. plays on the common contrast, also found earlier in this Marut
cycle, between the Maruts as individuals -- here “the last” (caramá-) of them -- and
as a collective (víśve).
On sácā as loc. absol. marker, see comm. ad IV.31.5.
I have rendered the nom. pl. kāmínaḥ as an adverb (avidly) to avoid the
somewhat heavy ‘having desire (for it)’.

Both of these vss. begin nahí vaḥ; in neither one is it easy to produce a
causal value for -hí, hence my ‘certainly’. The opening of 4c abhí vaḥ plays on the
nahí vaḥ of 3a, 4a.

### 5  
Both Ge and Re take c as a single clause (e.g., “Car je vous ai donné ces
offrandes”), but the position of hí suggests that a new clause begins with preceding
95
95
raré, and imā́vo havyā́is a fine nominal clause announcing the oblations present
right here on the ritual ground.

### 6  
The sequence sádatāvitā́is analyzed by the Pp. as sádata avitá, with the
latter form generally taken as a 2nd pl. impv. to √av ‘help’. But this interpr. is
problematic on grounds of both form and meaning. There is no stem avi- to √av; the
best that can be done is to classify it with the -iṣ-aor. ávīt, etc., but, in addition to -irather than -iṣ-, the accent is wrong, since the -iṣ-aorist has root accent. Moreover, a
form of ‘help’ fits badly in the passage, where the main verb should provide syntactic
support for the infinitive phrase spārhā́ṇi dā́tave vásu “to give coveted goods.” These
difficulties are treated in detail by Narten (Sig. aor. 87–88), who suggests an
appealing and convincing solution, to read sádatā vitā́, with the latter the 2nd pl. impv.
to the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue’, a solution that does not require emending the
Saṃhitā text. As Narten points out, this pres. appears elsewhere with an infinitive.
Although we ideally would expect a long root vowel (*vītā́), she adduces the 2nd sg.
impv. vihí (3x), beside more common vīhí, as a model. This solution is accepted by
Lub, though it is rejected by Baum (Impv. in RV 93, although he hesitates p. 167);
Klein (DGRV I.166, 167; II.39) implicitly accepts the Pp. reading, but he does not
cite the following pāda containing the infinitive phrase.
The accent on the 2nd pl. impv. sádatā presumably results from its
juxtaposition and contrast with adjacent vitā́.
ásredhantaḥ at the beg. of c can be either a voc. or a nom. pl.; nothing hangs
on the exact identification.

### 7  
I take pāda a as a nominal clause separate from b, with predicated pres. part.
śúmbhamānāḥ. The hemistich cannot form a single clause because apaptan in b is
unaccented despite the hí in pāda a. I take the sense of the first pāda to be that storms
come out of nowhere, fully beautified as it were, so the beautification must have been
done “in secret” (sasvár). The dark-backed geese of b are the storm clouds. The next
hymn, dedicated to Mitra and Varuṇa, has a similarly structured vs., VII.60.10 sasváś
cid dhí sámṛtis tveṣy èṣām apīcyèna sáhasā sáhante “Because their fiery attack is
even in secret and they are strong with hidden strength …” (JPB tr.). In that vs. the
finite verb in b, sáhante, is accented and therefore falls under the domain of hí in
pāda a.

### 8  
tiráś cittā́ni is a striking expression, without obvious parallels. In
interpreting it, we can begin by noting that tiráś cid is a reasonably frequent pāda
opening (IV.29.1, V.75.7, VIII.33.14, 51.9, 66.12), including in the next hymn,
VII.60.6. Although I toyed with the possibility of reading tiráś cit tā́ni here, with the
neut. pl. prn., this does not seem to be productive. However, the fact that tiráś cid is a
formulaic expression may help account for the fact that our tiráś cittā́ni seems to be
only loosely connected syntactically to the rest of the clause. Ge takes the expression
as meaning “against/contrary to expectation” (wider Erwartung), but I’m not at all
sure that tiráḥ can mean ‘against’ (though see X.171.4 devā́nāṃ cit tiró váśam “even
96
96
athwart the will of the gods”). And in any case we would surely want to punish
someone who tried to kill us, whether we expected him to or not. Re’s “en croisant
(nos) pensées” is better; I have adapted an English idiom “cross-purposes,” which is
practically a calque on the Skt. phrase. Here it reflects the hostility between the
would-be attacker and “us.”
### 8–9
Although, as noted in the publ. intro., the last four vss. of the hymn (9–
12) must be late additions, there is a verbal link between vs. 8 and vs. 9: tápiṣṭhena
“with the most scorching …” opening 8d is echoed by the Maruts’ ritual epithet
sā́ṃtapanāḥ opening 9a. This link may help account for why these Sākamedha vss.
were attached just here.
### 9–12
For the Sākamedha rites reflected in these vss., see publ. intro. and, e.g.,
ŚB II.5.3, esp. 3ff.; ĀpŚS VIII.9; sec. lit. including Hillebrandt, Ritual-Litteratur,
117–19; Keith, Religion and Philosophy, 322–23, etc.

### 9  
With the standard tr., I supply “come” in c, anticipating ā́gata in 10a.

### 11  
The āmreḍita ihéha echoes that in vs. 1, idám-idam, forming a superficial
ring. Given the apparent composite nature of the hymn, this apparent ring is
presumbly not a sign of a hymn conceived originally as a unity, but perhaps a hasty
adjustment to try to integrate the separate pieces.
Pāda c appears to mean “I choose the/your sacrifice” (yajñám … ā́vṛṇe), as in
Re’s “je choisis votre sacrifice.” But this doesn’t make a lot of sense in its baldest
form. Although ā́√vṛ normally just means ‘choose’, in this passage the ā́appears to
be used as it is with √yaj: ā́√yaj means ‘attract through sacrifice’ (sim. ā́√pū
‘attract through purification’), hence my “I will you (to come) here to (my) sacrifice,”
that is, I attract you to it by the force of my will.
[VII.60–74 JPB]
## 75
Dawn

### 1  
Although the Saṃhitā form āvo in pāda a (Pp. āvaḥ) is assigned to √vṛ
‘cover’ by Gr, it clearly belongs to √vas ‘shine, dawn’. See, e.g., AiG I.335. It is
rightly glossed by Sāy. with vyaucchat. Both roots occur regularly with the preverb
ví as here (‘dawn widely’ / ‘uncover’) and both are regularly found in dawn contexts.
Here ví … āvas explicitly contrasts with ápa … āvar (√vṛ) ‘uncovered’ in c.
The latter form makes a bad Triṣṭubh cadence: … āvar ájuṣṭam#, where we
would expect -var to be a heavy syllable. Old (Prol. 424 n. 1) persuasively suggests
that this apparent light syllable may actually represent *āvarr (from original 3rd sg.
*āvart), with the same doubling of final resonant before initial vowel that we find in -
nn from older *-nt. He suggests the same for kar (IX.92.5) and abibhar (X.69.10),
both of which would be metrically better as *-arr.
97
97
āv- is something of a signature of this vs.: āvo …, āviṣ(kṛṇvānā́) … / āvar,
reinforced by numerous other a-/ā-initial words: ā́gāt / ápa … ájuṣṭam, áṅgirastamā
… ajīgaḥ.
The ‘truth’ (ṛténa) of Dawn must refer to her conforming to the standard
patterns of the cosmos by dawning every day and indeed her embodiment of these
patterns, since the regular alternation of night and day is the most salient sign of
cosmic laws. The word here contrasts with drúhaḥ ‘deceits’ in c.
Corey Barnes (class, 12/15) pointed out the repeating pattern (drúh)as táma
… (ájuṣ)tam, á(ṅgir)astamā, which showcases ‘darkness’.
In d I take pathyā̀as standing for acc. pl. pathyā̀ḥ in harmony with the Pp. and
the standard views. Scar (137 and n. 191) tentatively suggests taking it rather as an
instr. pathyā̀(“gegen den Text”), modelled on pathyā̀(jánānām) in nearby VII.79.1,
where either instr. sg. -ā̀or acc. pl. -ā̀ḥ is possible. Although “awaken the paths” with
the acc. pl. is not an entirely straightforward expression, his instr. interpr. not only
goes against the text but also requires supplying an obj. (“der Menschen”), and in
addition “awaken (the men) along the path” doesn’t appreciably improve the sense.
(Were they sleeping by the roadside?) I assume that “awaken the paths” is shorthand
for “filling the paths with (newly awakened) people moving hither and thither and
thereby making the paths lively.” An instr. in VII.79.1 fits the context better.

### 2  
Like the āvaḥ forms (see vs. 1), bodhi is ambiguous, and either interpr.
could be made to fit the context. Gr takes it to √budh ‘be aware, be awake’, but most
later interpr. assign it to √bhū (Old, Ge, Re, Lub). However, I opt for √budh for
several reasons. For one thing, as I have shown elsewhere (1997 “Syntactic
Constraints on Morphological Change,” 69–74), bodhi to √bhū is in virtual
complementary distribution with the parallel impv. bháva, with bodhi confined to
pāda-medial position, against bháva, which occurs initially and finally. A pāda-final
bodhi here would violate this distributional rule. Moreover, the last word of the
preceding vs. is ajīgaḥ, belonging to √gṛ ‘awaken’, and I think the poet is playing off
these two ‘awaken’ roots. Although Old gives numerous supposed parallels with
√bhū and the syntactic construction in our pāda, most of these involve dat. infinitives.
However, two give me pause — III.54.3 mahé ṣú ṇaḥ suvitā́ya prá bhūtam, VII.85.4
ásad ít sá suvitā́ya … — both of which contain the dat. suvitā́ya and a form of
‘be(come)’. On the basis of these passages, I admit the possibility that bodhi here
belongs to √bhū, but still think it likely that the poet is slyly playing with the
‘awaken’ roots. If it does belong to √bhū, I would explain its wrong positioning on
the basis of strict parallelism between the semantically and syntactically parallel
clauses of a and b, with the latter ending with the impf. (prá) yandhi.
Ge and Re construe márteṣu with śravasyúm (“… Reichtum, der unter den
Sterblichen nach Ruhm strebt”; “… la richesse … qui crée le renom parmi les
mortels,” with Re adding a “creative” dimension to śravasyú- that does not seem to
me to be justified, though it makes the tr. make more sense). I think rather that the
sequence dévi márteṣu mānuṣi is meant to draw attention to two different
relationships that Dawn, a goddess, has with the human world: on the one hand, she
98
98
comes among mortals (márteṣu) every day, awakening the whole human world; on
the other, she has a special relationship with the descendents of Manu, that is, the
Ārya sacrificial community, a much more restricted set of humans to whom she is
more tightly bound by ritual activity.

### 3  
The focus shifts from the sg. Dawn of vss. 1–2 to her pl. beams (bhānávaḥ),
but with lexical repetition linking them: ā́guḥ at the end of b echoes ā́gāt similarly
position in 1b, citrā́ḥ repeats citrám (qualifying ‘wealth’) in 2c. And the nom. pl.
beams and gen. sg. goddess are syntactically intertwined: eté tyé bhānávo [nom. pl.
m.] darśatā́yāś [gen. sg. fem.] citrā́[nom. pl. m.] uṣáso [[gen. sg. fem.] amṛ́tāsaḥ
[nom. pl. m.].
The phrase janáyanto daívyāni vratā́ni “generating the heavenly
commandments” seems to expand on the ṛténa of vs. 1: by her dawning, Dawn every
day recreates in visible form the rules that govern the cosmos.

### 4  
The initial eṣā́syā́“this very one” (fem.) matches eté tyé “these very ones”
(masc.) opening the previous vs., referring to her beams.
As Old points out, pāda a lacks a syllable (even reading, as expected, s
i
yā́). He
tentatively suggests *yuyujānā́. It is certainly the case that yujāná-, which is fairly
common, never appears in this post-caesura position, while the four occurrences of
yuyujāná- are all post-caesura. But it is difficult to explain why the corruption would
have occurred -- perhaps haplology in the sequence (s
i
)yā́*yuyu(jānā́)?
The “patterns of the peoples” (vayúnāni jánānām) seem almost to be the
human equivalent of the daívyāni vratā́ni of 3c.
The pāda-final pres. jigāti picks up the aor. forms to the same root, also pādafinal, ā́gāt (1b), ā́guḥ (3b), but it also plays against the likewise redupl. ajīgaḥ at the
end of 1d, belonging to the separate root √gṛ ‘awaken’.

### 5  
citrá- reappears in b (cf. 2c and 3b).
The polarized position of the phrases ṛ́ṣiṣṭutā (beg. of c) and váhnibhir gṛṇānā́
(end of d) helps anchor the application of váhni- ‘conveyor’ to ‘conveyor of ritual
offerings’, since ‘praised by seers’ is unambiguous. Cf. also I.48.11 yé tvā grṇ̥ ánti
váhnayaḥ.

### 6  
And citrá- again, for the third time opening a b pāda.
The metaphorical use of váhni- found in the previous vs. contrasts with the
literal use (well, as literal as the RV gets) of the participle váhantaḥ ‘conveying’
referring to Dawn’s horses (áśvāḥ).

### 7  
The first hemistich consists of four consecutive etymological figures, all
nom. sg. fem. + instr. pl. masc. — simple but effective.
On cd see Hoffmann (Injunk. 134).
99
99

### 8  
Since it directly follows vāvaśanta ‘(the cows) keep bellowing (7d)’, nū́no
opening the vs. is surely meant to evoke the root √nu ‘bellow, roar’, also used of
bovines, with its (pseudo?) intensive (á)nūnot (also nónuv-), though of course it
really consists of particle followed by enclitic pronoun.
## 76
Dawn
On the intricate structure of this hymn and its relationship to verb tense, see
publ. intro. As noted there, vss. 1–2 have augmented aorists referring to the
immediate past (áśret 1b, ajaniṣṭa 1c, akar 1d, adṛśran 2a, ábhūt 2c, ā́gāt 2d); vss. 3-
4 have augmented imperfects and one perfect referring to the more distant past (āsan
3a, 4a, dadṛkṣé 3d, avindan 4c, ajanayan 4d); and vss. 5–7 have present indicatives
and imperatives stating general truths and urging action (sáṃ jānate … yatante 5b,
minanti 5c, īḷate 6a, ucha 6c, jarasva 6d, ribhyate 7b).

### 1  
Unlike the previous hymn, which contains no other divinities, this vs.
introduces two (though one without name) before mentioning Uṣas, who enters only
as the very last word of the vs. The two other gods are Savitar (b) and Sūrya in his
role as “eye of the gods” (devā́nām … cákṣuḥ, c).
The two virtually synonymous adj. viśvájanya- ‘belonging to all people’ and
viśvā́nara- ‘belonging to all men’ are juxtaposed across the pāda boundary (a/b); they
refer to two different entities: the immortal light (jyótir amṛ̥́tam), presumably the sun,
and god Savitar (savitā́deváḥ). As such they may also subtly allude to the wellknown group, the All Gods, with their first member(s) viśvá- and the ‘men’ words
implicitly summoning up the opposite, devá-. The pl. gods then show up in c, with
another occurrence of víśva- in d.
In c it is not possible to determine whose krátu- is being referred to. Ge takes
it as the gods’, and certainly the adjacency of the two words (krátvā devā́nām) is
suggestive. Re seems to favor Uṣas. However, given that it is Savitar’s action in ab
that raised the light, I think it likely that the krátu- is his.

### 2  
On the relation of this vs. to its paired frame vs. 5, see publ. intro. Their
relationship is signalled in the first instance by patterned repetition, with 2b and 5b
almost identical: ámardhanto vásubhiḥ x x x x. This patterned repetition also
involves poetic repair. The qualifier ámardhantaḥ ‘not negligent’, used unusually of
paths in vs. 2b, returns in 5d with a far more appropriate referent, the Fathers or their
modern-day representatives, the Vasiṣṭhas. The standard tr. either ignore the identity
of the two words, found in the same metrical position, and tr. each in a way that fits
the context as the tr. sees it (so Ge “unfehlbar” 2b versus “nicht zurückstehend” 2d)
or choose an anodyne tr. that doesn’t reflect the act. transitive morphology of the
form (Re “impeccable” in both places). But forms of the root √mṛdh generally take
an acc. obj. (or an enclitic prn. that is likely acc.) in the sense ‘neglect X’, and we
would expect the participle, even negated, to reflect the same usage. As usual, I think
it is incumbent on us to follow the morphology, even when it leads us to
interpretations that seem, at first, awkward. Here I would first point out that Dawn
100
100
“awakened” the paths in the previous hymn (VII.75.1d pathyā̀ajīgaḥ), so paths in
this group of hymns appear to have more animacy than might be expected. The paths
in our vs. are the ones that lead to the gods (devayā́nāḥ), and in this context “nonnegligent paths” could be ones that don’t fail to lead us there, perhaps because they
stay in good order, as is implied by the qualifier íṣkṛta-. As often with such semantic
mismatches, the sense that comes from apparently incompatible words construed
together is hard won, but it also leads to a deeper understanding of what the poet
intended.
In the ppl. íṣkṛta- here and in a number of other locutions involving íṣ + √kṛ
(iṣkartár-, íṣkṛti-, etc.), íṣ- behaves like a pseudo-preverb. The most likely default
source for this íṣ- is the root noun of the same shape meaning ‘refreshment,
nourishing drink’ (so EWA s.v. íṣ-), although the semantics makes difficulties: the
additive meaning we might expect (‘prepare nourishment’ vel sim.) is not found.
Instead it seems to mean something like ‘set in order, set to rights, restore’. Although
some interpr. the idiom as ‘heal’ (see EWA loc. cit.), I see no good evidence for this
in the RV; certainly “healed paths” here would be even more aberrant than “nonnegligent” ones. The form here is the only occurrence of the lexeme íṣ √kṛ in the
Family Books; otherwise it is limited to the late RV: the finite verb íṣkṛṇudhvam
X.53.7, the past participle here and in the cmpd. íṣkṛtāhāva- X.101.6, as well as
negated ániṣkṛta- VIII.99.8 and IX.39.2, agent nouns íṣkartar- VIII.1.12 and
iṣkartár- VIII.99.8, X.140.5, and the fem. abstract íṣkṛti- X.97.9. Besides its possible
etymological connection with íṣ- ‘refreshment’ (textually hinted at only in IX.39.2),
it also seems to form an antonymic pair with níṣ √kṛ ‘expel’; see the hymn to healing
herbs, X.97, where íṣkṛti- is contrasted with níṣkṛti-, níṣ kṛtha. This rhyming contrast
may account for the ‘restore’ sense, antonymic to ‘expel’. Our passage also contains
interaction with a different pseudo-preverb: íṣ-kṛta- can be seen as picking up (āv)ír
akar in 1c. Though the augment induces -r sandhi, the underlying idiom is āvíṣ √kṛ
(e.g., IV.4.5 āvíṣ kṛṇuṣva) with -íṣ matching íṣkṛta- here.
purástāt / pratīcī́“from the east, facing west” is another example of a paired
contrast across a pāda boundary.
### 3–4
As noted in the publ. intro., these two vss. are defined as an omphalos,
and this relationship is signaled by the patterned repetition of their first pādas: 3a
tā́nī́d … āsan / 4a tá íd … āsan “just those were …”

### 3  
Despite the straightforward, indeed ballad-like opening (“those were the
days …”), the syntax of the rest of this vs. is difficult to entangle. The problem is that
there appear to be two subordinating expressions (yā́in b, yátaḥ pári in c), though it
is difficult to identify more than one subordinate clause; if there are two subordinate
clauses, one of them would have very sketchy clausal structure. Nonetheless, Ge and
Re opt for the latter solution, supplying a verb in b, both taking yā́as neut. pl. nom.
and the subject of this clause (e.g., “Nombreux furent ces jours en vérité qui
(surgirent) autrefois …”); for them cd is then a new subordinate cl. marked by yátaḥ
pári referring to these same days (e.g., “à la suite desquels …”). Something like this
101
101
is possible, and in my many fiddlings with this vs. over the years I have more than
once hovered over something like it. But the stumbling block is prācī́nam in b, which
both Ge and Re must take as an adverbial temporal expression (“vorher” and
“autrefois” respectively), even though this stem is otherwise only locational
‘forwards / towards the east’, often in a ritual context. I can see no way to integrate
the standard use of this stem into a nominal clause consisting only of pāda b. I
therefore take bcd as a single subordinate clause with two markers of subordination,
yā́(b) a neut. pl. acc. extent of time (“through which …) and yátaḥ pári (c) referring
to the place from which Dawn comes, picking up purástāt in 2c. The yā́is more
narrowly construed with the finite verb dadṛkṣé in d (“… the days through which you
became visible” -- that is, dawned over and over), the yátaḥ pári with the participle
ācárantī “faring forth thence [= from the east].”
I further take prācī́nam as the goal of that participle (“faring forth … towards
the east-facing [sacrifice]”). As I just noted, prācī́na- is often found in a ritual
context, modifying yajñá- (VII.7.3) or barhís- (I.188.4, IV.5.4, X.110.4). Either
would be possible here, and the point would be that Dawn is hastening from the east
towards the sacrifice that, like an expectant lover, is facing towards her. Assuming
with most comm., beginning with Sāy. (see esp. Old’s argumentation) that we should
read loc. jāré, contra Pp. jāráḥ, the acc. prācī́nam in the frame would be the
functional equivalent of jāré in the simile -- GOAL -- despite the mismatch of cases, a
nice example of case disharmony in a simile (as discussed in my 1982 IIJ article).
Although I realize that this is a very fussy solution, I cannot see any other way
to deal with the troublesome prācī́nam. And it is, after all, an omphalos vs., where
perturbations are common. Strictly speaking, my tr. fails to render both subordinators
as such: “thence” should be “whence.” But the tr. is hard enough to parse as it is.
The contrastively paired similes, “like (a maiden) faring forth to her lover, not
like one going (home) again” (jārá ivā́cárantī … ná púnar yatī́va), are well
understood by the standard comm. and nicely indicate that Dawn dawns with as
much speed as she can muster, eager for reunion with her lover, rather than lingering
like one reluctantly leaving a tryst. For the first cf. I.123.9 … yóṣā ná ... niṣkr̥tám
ācárantī “going to the appointed place like a maiden to a rendezvous,” also of Dawn
(see also VI.75.4 in the weapon hymn). The iva is wrongly placed in the 2nd simile,
but the poet had too many elements to fit in as it was.

### 4  
Although this vs. begins in the same way as vs. 3, the syntax is quite
straightforward, with no dependent clauses and the Fathers as subject throughout.
Once again we might consider this an example of poetic repair, given the syntactic
difficulties the previous vs. posed.

### 5  
As noted above, this vs. marks the transition to present-tense verbs and
imperatives from the distant past of vss. 3–4. Who the subject of these verbs is in vs.
5 is not entirely clear. Until the very last syllable of the first hemistich, it is
impossible to know even the gender, but the oddly positioned té at the end of pāda b
identifies the subject as masc.; up until then, since sáṃgatāsaḥ could be either masc.
102
102
or fem., the fem. Dawns are a possibility. The second hemistich repeats the té
immediately (c), and adds an unambig. masc. adj. ámardhantaḥ (as well as
potentially ambig. yā́damānāḥ). Once té restricts the subject to masc., our immediate
thought would be the Fathers, who are the subject of vs. 4. This is the solution of
both Ge and Re. However, the temporal switch between 4 and 5 might speak against
that. In vs. 6 the Vasiṣṭhas are explicitly identified as the subject (6a). My own view
is that the subject of vs. 5 is deliberately left unspecified, to allow a transition
between, and identification of, the Fathers and their latter-day representatives the
Vasiṣṭhas. That the Fathers are at least arguably present is suggested by samāná ūrvé
“in a common pen,” since ūrvá- frequently refers to the Vala cave where the
cows/dawns are confined and therefore could set the action of the vs. in mythological
time when, as the preceding vs. notes, the Fathers “found the hidden light” and
“generated the dawns,” as in the Vala myth. As for a contemporary reference,
“common pen” could refer to the sacrificial ground, where the Vasiṣṭhas would be
acting in concert.
In addition to specifying the gender of the subject of ab, the final té also
repeats the final syllables of the two verbs that precede it in the pāda, jānate …
yatante.
## 77
Dawn
On the structure of this hymn, as signaled by its verb forms and personal
reference, see publ. intro. The first three vss. contain a series of sg. augmented
aorists (started with a perfect), all but ábhūt with Dawn as 3rd ps. subj.: úpa ruruce,
ábhūt, ákar, úd asthāt, áśvait, aroci (which last almost forms a ring with the opening
pf.), adarśi, into which fem. sg. pres. participles have been interspersed: prasuvántī,
bā́dhamānā, bíbhratī, váhantī, náyantī. Following that we get in vss. 4–5a an equally
insistent series of imperatives: ucha, kr̥dhi, yāvaya, ā́bhara, codáya, ví bhāhi, with
Dawn as 2nd ps. subject. In 5b the fem. pres. parts return: pratirántī, dádhatī. In the
last vs. the pattern is broken again: a pl. present vardháyanti with the Vasiṣṭhas as
subject, found in the only subordinate cl. in the hymn, and in the last pāda before the
clan refrain an aor. injunctive in imperatival usage, dhāḥ.

### 1  
√ruc appears with the preverb úpa only here. I connect it with the simile
yuvatír ná yóṣā “like a young maiden”: úpa generally connotes ‘up close, intimate’,
and úpa √ruc may suggest the beguiling radiance of a beloved young girl close by.
As Re points out, √bhū + dat. inf. is rare. Here ábhūt … samídhe seems to be
the intrans./pass. equivalent of a periphrastic causative √kṛ samídhe, as in I.113.9 úṣo
yád agníṃ samídhe cakártha “O Dawn, since you have caused the fire to be kindled
….,” adduced by both Ge and Re. For a periphrastic caus. nearby, see VII.75.8 mā́...
nidé kar “Don’t put to scorn …”
I do not know why we have pf. ruruce in a vs. containing two augmented
aorists, ábhūt and ákar, with two more in the next hemistich (2a asthāt, 2b aśvait);
the passive aor. (a)roci would have been possible, and is in fact found in 2d.
103
103

### 2  
Whatever the reason for the pf. ruruce in vs. 1, its semi-repetition in the aor.
aroci in 2d inaugurates a pattern of lexical chaining in the first part of this hymn.
víśvam opening the vs. may pick up víśvaṃ jīvám “every living thing” of the
previous vs. or anticipate víśvam in 3d, where I supply ‘world’.
In c the bahuvrīhi sudṛ́śīka-saṃdṛś- ‘having an appearance lovely to see’ is an
internal etymological figure, … dṛ́śīka- … dṛś-. Since the final segment of the cmpd,
underlying -ś (or rather the product of nom sg. -ś+s), appears as -g in sandhi, it
echoes the -k- of the prior member: sudṛ́śīka-saṃdṛg.

### 3  
More chaining: the compound etym. figure with dṛś in 2c is echoed not
only by a repetition of the entire first member of the cmpd. sudṛ́śīka- (3b) but also in
the pass. aor. adarśi (3c), while the fem. agent noun netrī́of 2d returns as a participle
náyantī (3b), likewise fem., and the aor aśvait of 2b matches the adj. śvetá- in 3b.

### 4  
On the abrupt change of tense/mood and of person here see above and publ.
intro. Notably, the lexical chaining stops here as well.
In pāda a ánti- ‘nearby’ contrasts with dūré ‘in the distance’, though the first
is in a cmpd. and the latter is not. The ‘away’ / ‘here’ contrast is also found in c,
though yāváya means ‘keep away’ without benefit of preverb or adverb, while ā́
serves for ‘here’. The objects of the antithetical pairs are similar in the two pādas:
“(bring) nearby” takes -vāma- ‘valuable things’ (a), váśuni ‘goods’ (c); “keep/send
away” amítram ‘foe’ (a), dvéṣaḥ ‘hatred’ (c). Re comments similarly. ánti- may also
implicitly refer back to the semantically similar úpa opening the first vs. and mark
the beginning of the 2nd section of the hymn. For the complementary opposition ánti /
dūrá- in a similar passage, cf. IX.78.5 jahí śátrum antiké dūraké ca yáḥ “Smash the
rival nearby and the one who is in the distance.”
The VP dūré amítram ucha “dawn the foe into the distance” displays an
apparent transitive sense of √vas ‘dawn’. This transitive sense is otherwise limited to
ápa √vas ‘dawn (X) away’, as in nearby VII.81.6 uṣā́uchad ápa srídhaḥ “Dawn
dawns away failures” (=I.48.8; cf. VII.104.23, VIII.47.18). In our passage the
locational adverb dūré ‘in the distance’ fills the role of the preverb ápa ‘away’, a
point also made by Re. Baum’s interpr. (Impv. in RV, 164) of amítram as an acc. of
goal, in the sense “‘illuminate the enemy (when he is) far away,’ i.e. prevent him
from hiding,” is unlikely, and he does not mention the ápa √vas passages.

### 5  
I take the two ca’s in cd as marking a “both … and” construction: íṣaṃ ca
… gómad áśvāvad ráthavac ca rā́dhaḥ “both refreshment and largesse in cattle,
horses, (and) chariots.” Though ordinarily we might expect the 2nd ca to be placed
after the first term in the second constituent (hence* gómac ca …), I explain its late
position as resulting from treating the three parallel -vat adjectives as a unitary
qualifier; it also allows the complementary placements of ca in cd: #X ca ..., ... ca Y#.
Klein interprets the passage very differently, taking the two ca’s as independent: the
first as conjoining the two participial clauses in bc (… pratirántī … / … ca … 
104
104
dádhatī …)(DGRV I.104–5) and the second as an XYZ ca construction, conjoining
the -vat adjectives (86 and passim).
## 78
Dawn
On the lexical marks of this hymn, see publ. intro. The signature word práti
opens the hymn and is repeated at the beginning of the first two pādas of vs. 2 and in
the middle of 3a; it returns at the beginning of the last vs. (5), thus sketching a ring.
The other signature word, fem. pres. part. vibhātī́- ‘radiating widely’ is concentrated
in the latter part of the hymn, ending the pādas 3b, 4b, and 5c.

### 2  
The lexeme ápa √bādh appears, as often, in tmesis. This tmesis appears to
be regular even when the lexeme appears, as here, in the participle (univerbated as
apabā́dhamāna- only in the late X.103.4; in tmesis I.35.3, 90.3, V.80.5, IX.97.43 as
well as here). But in our passage ápa is oddly positioned for a preverb in tmesis
(which may account for Gr’s failure to register the preverb, as also in V.80.5):
immediately following the object and not adjacent to a metrical boundary, …
bā́dhamānā, víśvā támāṃsi duritā́pa devī́. Although this aberrant position might
suggest that ápa is not a preverb here but a postposition or adverb, this would require
separating the expression from the well-attested verbal lexeme, which I prefer not to
do. I should however note that in vs. 1b bā́dhamānā támāṃsi is found without ápa.

### 3  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. departs from the practice of the rest of
the hymn by referring to plural Dawns.
práty adṛśran in the middle of pāda a repeats the opening of the hymn (1a),
with polarized #práti … adṛśran#. The plural subject in vs. 1 are Dawn’s “beacons”
(ketávaḥ).

### 5  
As noted in the publ. intro., the hapax denom. tilvilāyádhvam is the most
notable feature of this hymn. This verb is clearly built to the adj. tílvila-, found in
V.62.7, where it appears to mean something like ‘fertile’: bhadré kṣétre nímitā tílvile
vā “(the pillar) fixed in the good or ___ field/land.” Note not only the l-s, but the
rhyming til-vil-, a word-formation tactic not otherwise found in standard Vedic; the
standard assumption is that it is a non-Indo-Aryan word (see, e.g., Kuiper, Aryans
14). The standard interpr. take it as a (presumably more specific) synonym to
bhadrá-, though of course the vā ‘or’ construction could identify it as a contrast or
even opposite to bhadrá-. If the word belongs to the agricultural sphere (as kṣétra-
‘field’ suggests), a non-IAr origin makes sense. It is sometimes connected (see EWA
s.v.) with tilá- (AV+) ‘sesame’, which also lacks an IAr etym. The word tílvila- is
found in later Vedic; most of the occurrences are in similar passages in the gṛhya
sūtras for the erection of a housepost and are clearly dependent on RV V.62.7 (e.g.,
ĀśGS 2.8.16, ŚāṅkhGS 3.3.1), but a ŚB passage seems to place it in the ‘fruitful,
fertile, rich’ sphere. The passage concerns a cow let out to wander; whichever
direction she goes will predict what will happen to the sacrificer. ŚB IV.5.8.11 yádi 
105
105
pratī́cīyā́d íbhyatilvila iva dhā́nyatilvilo bhaviṣyatī́ti vidyāt (Eggeling) “If she goes
westwards, let him know that he will be rich in dependants and crops.”
## 79
Dawn
As noted in the publ. intro., ví is the signature word of this hymn. The first
and last hemistichs of the hymn (1a, 5c) begin with ví and a form (indeed two, in the
etymological figure in 1a) of √vas: 1a vy uṣā̀āvaḥ and 5c vyuchántī, forming a ring,
and ví opens 1d, 2a, 3c, 4d as well. This preverb also gets played with in various
ways: 2b opens with víśo ‘clans’, whose 1st syllable falsely promises the preverb. The
regular oppositional counterpart of ví, namely sám, opens 2c and provides the 2nd
syllable of 1c (susaṃdṛ́gbhiḥ). The alliteration of 3c is also set in motion by its
opening ví (see below).

### 1  
This vs. echoes the 1st vs. of VII.75 in several ways, and VII.75.1 is helpful
in resolving the verbal ambiguities in this one. Our vs. contains two occurrences
(pādas a, d) of ví … āvaḥ in exactly that sandhi form. The 3rd sg. augmented root aor.
form āvaḥ is entirely ambiguous between √vas ‘dawn’ and √vṛ ‘obstruct, cover’, and
the preverb ví does not help, since ví √vas regularly means ‘dawn widely’ and ví √vṛ
‘uncover, open’. VII.75.1 also contains two such forms, but both of them are in
sandhi forms that allow their root affiliation to be unambiguously identified. VII.75.1
opens exactly like our vs., vy ùṣā́āvaḥ, but in VII.75 the sandhi form of the verb is
āvo, which must belong to √vas. Pāda c of VII.75.1 contains āvar (though in tmesis
with ápa rather than ví); again, the sandhi form -ar makes it clear that this verb must
belong to √vṛ. Given the parallelism of the two vss., it seems almost as if VII.75.1 is
providing a guide to the ambiguities of our vs. In any case the standard interpr. all
distribute the āvaḥ forms in this vs. as just laid out.
There is another echo between the two vss.: pāda a here contains pathyā̀,
which could represent either instr. sg. pathyā̀(so Pp.) or acc. pl. pathyā̀ḥ out of
sandhi, recalling pathyā̀in VII.75.1d, which must represent acc. pl. -āḥ before a
vowel. In this passage I favor the instr. sg. Note also that páñca ksitī́ḥ opening our b
pāda opens VII.75.4b.

### 2  
Whatever the etymology of aktú- ‘night’ -- I favor the connection with PIE
*nokw
t- ‘night’, pace EWA s.v.; see most recently LIN 505 and n. 20 -- it is here at
least secondarily associated with √añj ‘anoint’ (which for some, e.g., EWA, is its
etymon), since aktū́n serves as obj. of vy àñjate. My “glossy nights” is an attempt to
capture the pun. For those who consider aktú- a derivative of √añj, aktū́n here would
be an internal obj. / cognate acc.; cf. Oberlies (Relig. v. II.111): “Die [rotglühenden]
Morgenröten verstreichen ihre Farbe …”
In any case, aktū́n participates in two phonetic figures: añjate … ánteṣu aktū́n
and the near-mirror-image aktū́(n) … yuktā́(ḥ).
As in the previous hymn (VII.78), Dawn is sg. in this hymn, except in one vs.,
in this case this one; in VII.78, vs. 3.

### 3  
\#ábhūd uṣā́(ḥ) is reminiscent of \#ábhūd agníḥ in VII.77.2, though there the
construction involved a predicated infinitive. See also VII.76.2 #ábhūd u ketúr
uṣásaḥ.
Dawn is índratamā because she is maghónī ‘bounteous’ as he is maghávan(t)-.
The splv. suffix -tamā echoes támaḥ ‘darkness’ in the prevous vs., 2c.
As Re points out, suvitā́ya in b recalls duritā́in VII.78.2.
Pāda c displays heavy alliteration: ví divó devī́duhitā́dadhāti. The pattern is
set in motion by the preverb ví, which, as was noted above, is the hymn’s signature
word. The first three words in c have ví itself, its inverse (d)iv(ó), and a long-vowel
variant (de)vī́, but in the meantime the d pattern has asserted itself and carries
through to the end of the pāda. The elements of this sequence are found nearby each
other in other hymns in this cycle, though not with the same intense concentration. Cf.
esp. VII.77.5–6: 5b devi, 5c dádhatī, 6a divó duhitā́.

### 4  
As slowly becomes clear, this vs. concerns the Vala myth, as the last pāda,
describing the opening of “the doors of the firm-fixed stone,” illustrates. This
slipping into the Vala story accounts for the otherwise puzzling áṅgirastamā ‘best /
most like the Aṅgirases’ in the previous vs. (3d; found also in nearby VII.75.1, also
in a potential Vala context). The Aṅgirases, of course, were responsible, along with
Indra, for opening the Vala cave and releasing the imprisoned cows; they did so by
singing. As Ge points out, the praisers who benefit from Dawn’s largesse in 4b are
most likely the Aṅgirases, and they would also then be the subjects of c.
Note the phonetic echo between rā́dho (a) and (á)rado (b), which is then
found scrambled in d (dú)ro ádr(eḥ). Pāda d also contains internal phonetic play with
d’s and r’s, as well as a, u, and o: … dṛḷh(asya) dúro, adr(e)r äūr(ṇ)o(ḥ). This is the
only trisyllabic reading of the augmented stem aurṇo- and the vowel hiatus a-ū (or
av
ū?) emphasizes the phonetic figures.
The verb in c, the pf. jajñúḥ, is perfectly ambiguous between √jan ‘beget’ and
√jñā ‘recognize’. It is now standardly taken to the former, though Ge previously
(Ved. St.) assigned it to the latter, a stance criticized by Old and silently given up by
Ge in his tr.

### 5  
As noted in the intro. above, vyuchántī, which opens the last pāda of the
hymn (save for the clan refrain), forms a ring with the opening phrase (1a) vy ùṣā́
āvaḥ. This reinforces the affiliaion of āvaḥ in 1a with √vas, not √vṛ.
## 80
Dawn

### 1  
This vs. reprises various parts of the other dawn hymns in this cycle. The
first hemistich práti … uṣásam … abudhran echoes VII.78.5a práti tvā … budhanta,
with each having the mortal worshipers as subject. (Note augmented abudhran
versus injunctive budhanta.) In c Dawn is “unrolling” the two world halves
(vivartáyantīm), while in VII.79.2c her cows “roll up” the darkness (sám … táma ā́
vartayanti) with the preverb sám complementary to ví. In our vs. sám is found in the
107
107
same pāda in the adjective describing the two world-halves, sámante ‘adjoining’.
Finally, Dawn’s role in “revealing all beings” (āviṣkṛṇvatī́m bhúvanāni víśvā)
reminds us of her revealing her own greatness (āviṣkṛṇvānā́mahimā́nam) in the first
vs. of this cycle (VII.75.1b). The act. part. in our vs. is externally focused, while the
middle part. in VII.75.1 properly captures the internal focus of that expression. The
act. expression is also found in VII.76.1 āvír kar bhúvanaṃ víśvam uṣā́ḥ.
Ge takes du. rájasī as referring to the Dark (and Light), i.e., Night and Day.
But du. rájasī ordinarily refers to the two world-halves and is often used in
conjunction with ródasī (e.g., I.160.4, IV.42.3), and I see no reason to seek a
different referent here. Dawn’s action of ‘unrolling’ the two world-halves would
refer to the visual effect of the gradual revealing of their features as the dawn’s light
strengthens. For a similar notion, though with ví √vṛ ‘uncover’, see the previous
hymn VII.79.1 ví sū́ryo ródasī cákṣasāvaḥ “The Sun has uncovered the two worldhalves with his eye.”

### 2  
Because of the middle voice of the part., I interpr. návyam ā́yur dádhānā as
referring to Dawn’s new life, which she would then assume every day. The middle
voice contrasts with VII.77.5 pratirántī na ā́yuḥ “(she,) lengthening our lifetime.”
Both Ge and Re seem to imply that in our passage the new life is established for
others.
The sg. abodhi at the end of the first hemistich matches the pl. abudhran in
the same position in vs. 1.
Pāda d prā́cikitat sū́ryaṃ yajñám agním is exactly parallel to VII.78.3 ájījanat
sū́ryaṃ yajñám agním, which suggests that ácikitat is felt as a redupl. aor. to the caus.
cetáyati, despite the obvious drawbacks of form (we would expect *acīkitat).

### 3  
This vs. is identical to VII.41.7, though it may fit better here.
The three -v/matī- adj., áśvāvatīr gómatīḥ … vīrávatīḥ, modifying the pl.
‘dawns’ reprise the sequence at the end of the first hymn in this cycle, VII.75.8
gómad vīrávat … áśvāvat, where they qualified rátnam.
## 81
Dawn

### 1  
Note the adjacency of támaḥ and jyótiḥ, though here across the pāda break.

### 3  
The stem vánanvant-, in my opinion, must be separated into two separate
words on semantic grounds, neither of which is entirely clear morphologically. In
VIII.102.19 and X.92.15, where it is associated with an axe (svádhiti-) in the
identical phrase svádhitir vánanvati, it appears to belong with vána- ‘wood’. Cf. for
the association IX.96.3 ... svádhitir vánānām, X.89.7 svádhitir váneva But in
VIII.6.34 it modifies matíḥ ‘thought’ in a context in which ‘wood(en)’ seems
effectively excluded. In both VIII.1.31 and our passage I also find it difficult to make
‘wooden’ work, though Ge, for example, thinks our voc. addressed to Dawn (may --
he tags it with ? --) mean “Wagenbesitzende,” on the assumption that the wagon is
108
108
wooden and the material has come to refer to the object made of it. In VIII.1.31,
where it modifies ‘horses’ (áśvān), he takes it as referring to their wooden yokes. (He
refuses to tr. the form in VIII.6.34.) Mayrhofer (both KEWA s.v. vánam and EWA
s.v. ván-) favors the ‘wood’ connection as well, and in EWA suggests that vánan- is
the -n-form of a heteroclite, whose -r- is found in the locatival 1st cmpd member
vanar- (though one would of course not expect the -r- in the oblique). Re, having
written in favor of the ‘wood’ connection (BSL 37: 19), disavows it in his n. to this
passage in EVP III, in favor of “gracieuse,” on what seem firm grounds. Old
discusses the problem with his customary acuity and decides for a derivation from
√van ‘win, hold dear’, with a pun on ‘wood’ in VIII.102.19 and X.92.15. Although I
generally favor seeing audacious metaphors in the RV, in this particular case I find
that putting all the forms of vánanvant- under one rubric unduly stretches the
metaphorical fabric -- though I might be open to Old’s suggestion that in VIII.102.19
and X.92.15 there is a pun on ‘wood’, but the form belongs with √van. This does not,
however, help with the morphology. I tentatively suggest that the form derived from
√van is the result of the further derivation or contamination of originally participial
forms. The 8th class present to √van vanóti has an act. part. vanvánt-; if this acquired
a -vant-suffix, the result would be in the first instance *vanv-án(t)-vant-, which by
dissimilation of the middle -v- could develop into our form (though with accent shift).
Or the pf. part. vavan-váṃs- could have dissimilated to *vanan-váṃs- (again accent
is a problem). Or, starting with the pres. part. vanv-ánt-, we could imagine a
perseverative form *vanv-an(t)-ant-, with migration of the 2nd -v-. Or we can confect
an intens. stem *vanvan- with participle *vanvan-a(n)t-, again with flip of the v. But
all of these scenarios are pure fantasy, I’m afraid. As for the form putatively derived
from ‘wood’, I have even less idea, though I suppose it’s worth pointing out that all
attested forms from both stems vanánvant- actually have the weak form of the suffix
-vat- and *vana-vatV, built directly to vána-, would be metrically unfavorable.

### 4  
This vs. presents several minor syntactic problems. Pāda b contains two
apparent datival infinitives, the almost synonymous prakhyaí and dṛśé, most likely to
be construed with kṛṇóṣi in pāda a. The standard interpr. take the two infinitives as
separate parallel constructions, though the details of these constructions differ acdg.
to tr. (cf., besides Ge and Re, Scar [353] and Keydana [Inf., 167, 203]). As a typical
ex., see Scar’s “… die du … machst, dass man sieht und man das Licht schaut.”
Although as far as I know there is no way to tell, I prefer to take both the datives
with svàr; the standard expression svàr dṛśé indicates that the sun is visible, available
for seeing, while prakhyaí is used in a similar fashion to cákṣase in 1c.
The 2nd hemistich is more problematic. The first question is the grammatical
identity of ratnabhā́jaḥ, which could be gen. sg. and modify immediately preceding
fem. gen. tásyās te, or nom. pl. and modify the implied pl. subj. ‘we’ of immediately
following 1st pl. īmahe. Ge opts for the latter (“… die du Belohnungen austeilst”), but
Old, Re, and Scar favor the nom. pl., as do I. For one thing other -bhā́j- cmpds have
similar syntacto-semantic value (“having a share of X”), rather than the transitive
sense (“sharing out X”) required by the gen. interpr. It is of course possible that the
109
109
positioning between the gen. sg. and the 1st pl. was deliberate, and the form is meant
to be ambiguous.
The other problem lies in the interpr. of the two verbs īmahe (c) and syā́ma
(d). The standard interpr. take the pāda break as a clause break (“as sharers of your
treasure we beseech you; may we be like sons …”). I find this mildly problematic, in
that ratnabhā́jaḥ would be better construed with syā́ma (“might we be sharers …”)
than with īmahe, and I have therefore taken it that way, with īmahe parenthetical and
the simile in d an adjunct. This interpr. is supported by VI.71.6 vāmabhā́jaḥ syāma
“May we be partakers of the valuables” (sim. III.55.22 sákhāyas te vāmabhā́jaḥ
syāma). However, my interpr. not only complicates the syntax slightly, but the lack
of accent on parenthetical īmahe might be troublesome -- though I don’t have strong
intuitions on how verbal accent works with parentheticals. (The one example I can
come up with, however, does accent the verb that interrupts the clause: X.95.1
mánasā tíṣṭha ghore vácāṃsi miśrā́kṛṇavāvahai nau “Thoughtfully -- stand still,
fearsome woman! -- let us two now exchange words.”) In any case it might be better
to follow the standard interpr. and tr. something like “we beseech you ([for us] to be)
sharers in your treasure; may we be like sons to a mother” -- though as the tr. shows,
taking īmahe with ratnabhā́jaḥ requires more semantic machinery.
In c tásyās te is a fairly unusual ex. of the double sá tvám construction. As is
sometimes the case with oblique forms of this construction, I think it likely that the
tásyāḥ is there to indicate the gender of the personal pronoun -- though, given the
Dawn context, the fem. gender of te could hardly be a secret.

### 6  
codayitrī́maghónaḥ is perfectly ambiguous, since maghónaḥ could be
either gen. sg. or acc. pl. In the former case it would refer to Indra, the archetypal
maghávan-, in the latter to the pl. patrons (the sūrí- referred to in pāda a). According
to the standard distribution of cases, suffix-accented -tár- agent nouns should take
the gen.; indeed our stem does just that in I.3.11 codayitrī́sūnṛ́tānām. However, this
distribution is not absolute, and given the recent mention of the pl. patrons and the
absence of Indra from this hymn (and mostly from this hymn cycle), a pl. reading is
quite possible as well.
sūnṛ́tātvatī at the end of c forms a faint ring with sūnárī at the end of vs. 1.
Note that it also recalls I.3.11 just cited.

Vāyu / Indra and Vāyu

### 1  
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn plays on the two senses of niyút- in
Vāyu context: his teams of wind-horses and our teams of poetic thoughts. This
ambiguity is fully on display in pāda c váha vāyo niyúto yāhy áchā, where acc. pl.
niyútaḥ is stationed between the two imperatives. váha and yāhy. The latter is interpr.
by the Pp. as accentless yāhi, but in this sandhi situation, followed by initially
accented áchā, it could also represent yāhí. If this impv. is unaccented, niyútaḥ
should be construed with it, with a clause boundary after preceding voc. vāyo. If it is
accented, it should begin a new clause and niyútaḥ should be construed with váha.
The situation is complicated by the semi-parallel passage I.135.2 váha vāyo niyúto
yāhy asmayúḥ, where unaccented yāhi is the only choice because the following word
does not begin with an accented vowel. If niyútaḥ is to be contrued with yāhy, it is an
acc. of goal and refers to our teams (poetic thoughts); if with váha, it should refer to
Vāyu’s teams. Curiously, both Ge and Re in both passages choose to construe
niyútaḥ with váha (e.g., “Fahre, Vāyu, die Niyut-Rosse, komm here!”), even though
in I.135.2 this interpr. should be excluded. Old (ad I.135.2) opts for the other
construction and tr. “fahre, Vāyu; zu (unsern) n.[iyút-] komm.” This interpr., the
only one strictly possible in I.135.2, is further supported by III.35.1=VII.23.4 yāhí
vāyúr ná niyúto no áchā “Travel like Vāyu to our teams” where niyútaḥ is clearly
construed with yāhí. However, just because niyútaḥ needs to be construed with yāhy
in our passage and in I.135.2, construing it also with váha isn’t excluded -- so an alt.
tr. of this passage and of I.135.2 could be “Drive (your teams), Vāyu; travel to our
teams.” See also 3c.

### 2  
The rel. yáḥ in pāda a may be somewhat deeper in the clause than we
would like, following both the indirect obj. īśānā́ya and the direct obj. práhutim.

### 3  
I take dhāti as a root aor. subjunctive (as apparently also Kü, judging from
his tr. “… soll … führen …,” p. 186); unfortunately it does not have a distracted root
vowel.
Note the extreme alliteration of b: … devī́dhiṣáṇā dhāti devám, with mirrorimage plain and aspirated voiced stops, as well as the etym. figure devī́… deváṃ
enclosing the whole.
The niyút- in this vs. are explicitly identified as Vāyu’s ‘own’ (svā́ḥ), which
supports the view that the niyút- in 1c are not Vāyu’s but ours.
The question in d is the referent of vásudhiti- ‘treasure-chamber’. Both Gr
and Ge identify it as Vāyu himself, though this seems pretty much excluded by the
fact that acc. vásudhitim is conjoined with the other acc. vāyúm (c) by utá (see Klein
DGRV I.323–24, though he also suggests Vāyu could be the referent). Old suggests
Indra (flg. Pischel), and Re so renders it in tr. To me Agni seems more likely than
either Indra or Vāyu, since Agni is actually called a vásudhiti- in I.128.8, and śvetá-
111
111
‘gleaming’ is more appropriate to Agni than to either of those gods. (For Agni as
śvetá- see, e.g., V.1.4.) However, to my mind the most likely referent is Dawn, a
possibility also floated by Re. Dual vásudhiti- occurs twice (III.31.17, IV.48.3), both
times of Night and Dawn. In both cases the noun is modified by dual kṛṣṇé ‘black’,
which of course characterizes only one of the pair and evokes the opposite,
suppressed quality, ‘bright’ (see comm. ad IV.48.3). In IV.48.3 the two treasurechambers are intimately associated with Vāyu and his journey to the sacrifice. Note
also that the dawns show up in the very next pāda in our hymn (4a). The one obstacle
to identifying vásudhitim here as Dawn is that the accompanying adj. śvetám is masc.,
but this would be problematic in any case, if it modifies vásudhiti-, because the noun
itself is fem. (see du. fem. kṛṣṇé just cited)—though it can have a masc. referent (e.g.,
I.128.8 agním hótāram īḷate vásudhitim “They invoke Agni, the Hotar, [as] treasurechamber]”). I assume that *śvetām has been redactionally shortened (without
metrical consequences, since it precedes a consonant-initial word) on the basis of
such equational passages, or perhaps on the basis of such passages vásudhiti- was
simply interpr. as masc. here.

### 4  
In the publ. tr. the injunc. uchán is rendered as a preterite; I’d now be
inclined towards a pres. “the dawns dawn,” if the vs. depicts the ritual scene
unfolding. If, however, it is an account of the Vala myth, a preterital uchán would be
better. Since there is probably split temporal reference here, describing the actions
both of the mythical Aṅgirases originally opening the Vala cave and of the priests
reenacting this mythic model, the injunctive uchán can fit both scenarios—likewise
the perfects that follow (vividuḥ b, ví vavruḥ c, sasruḥ d), since that tense can be used
both for both distant and immediate past. Unfortunately English does not have a
temporally un- (or under-)marked tense like the injunctive, and so a choice between
present and preterital translations has to be made.
On the basis of the next hymn, VII.91.4 náraḥ … dī́dhyānāḥ (and see also our
5a), the subject of b should be ‘men’ or the Uśij-priests in the next pāda, though the
‘dawns’ of the previous pāda would technically be available.
I did not render cid in c in the publ. tr. Cf. V.29.12, where the same phrase
opens the pāda and cid likewise appears to be functionless. It could perhaps mean
‘also’ here, as a second action after finding the light.
On ánu pradívaḥ see Old’s extensive disc.

### 5  
If the previous vs. had two temporal reference points, this one seems
completely focused on the ritual here and now. As noted in the publ. intro., the
priests have become the draught animals that draw Indra and Vāyu’s chariot --
alluding to the trope of sacrifice as chariot.

### 6  
As noted in the publ. intro., the use of īśāná- ‘having dominion’ here
cleverly assimilates the patrons modified by this participle with Vāyu (2a) and IndraVāyu (5d), who receive the same modifier.
112
112
Ge (n. 6a) persuasively suggests that the striking phrase “confer the sun on us,”
with the patrons as subject, refers to “the great light of the Dakṣiṇā” (priestly gift).
This is reminiscent of the biblical quotation “Let your light so shine before men …”
that always preceded the taking up of the collection in the Episcopal church of my
youth.
## 91
Vāyu / Indra and Vāyu

### 1  
For my interpr. of the context of this vs. see the publ. intro., where I
suggest that the vs. depicts the primal situation before the ritual was first instituted,
with the gods existing without a sacrificial compact. I take purā́… ā́san as
existential, “existed previously,” as I do almost the same construction (but with pf.,
not impf.) in IV.51.7 purā́suḥ -- but not purā́-āsitha in VI.45.11, where the purā́is
contrasted with nūnám in disjunctive vā clauses. The existential reading seems to me
preferable to a predicative one, whether vṛdhā́saḥ or anavadyā́saḥ were to be
predicated.
The construction of kuvíd is unusual, in that it appears on the surface that the
kuvíd construction consists of a rel. clause introduced by yé without a main clause.
Old’s first suggested rendering is of this type (“Bewiesen sich wohl einst die Götter
als tadellos?”); similarly Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 145). But Old alternatively suggests
supplying a main verb with kuvíd with the relative clause subordinate to that clause
(“Wie denn (verhielten sich) die Götter, welche ... waren?”), a syntactic solution
silently adapted by Re. In either case ā́san would unproblematically be accented
because it belongs to the rel. cl. Although my interpr. differs somewhat from Ge’s,
we both take ā́san as the verb of the main clause with kuvíd (“Ganz gewiss waren es
schon früher die untadeligen Götter …”), with the rel. clause either requiring a verb
to be supplied (Ge) or simply being a nominal rel. cl. (me). By this interpr. the
accentuation of ā́san would contradict Gr’s rule (s.v. kuvíd) that the verb introduced
by kuvíd is accented only when it is in the same pāda -- but see comm. ad II.35.1 for
further violations of this “rule.” The construction I envisage runs into another
problem, that the rel. cl. (námasā yé vṛdhā́saḥ) would seem to be embedded in the
main clause kuvíd … ā́san). But we have seen elsewhere (e.g., VI.21.2, 22.5, 64.5, 6)
that nominal relative clauses can function as pseudo/proto-izafe constructions and be
embedded in the matrix clause. Here the rel. cl. would, further, precede the main
clause proper, beginning with purā́, and be preceded only by the rhetorical
introductory kuvíd aṅgá, so its “embedding” is slight.
For “hard-pressed Manu” see VI.49.13.

### 2  
Ge (n. 2a) suggests that ná in pāda a stands for haplologized *ná ná, with
both the simile particle (“Willig wie Boten”) and the negative (“… nicht zu
hintergehen”). Certainly it must represent the negative with infinitival dat., since ná
dábhāya occurs twice elsewhere (V.44.3, IX.73.8) with gopá-, but it is less clear that
we need the simile marker. Though Indra and Vāyu are probably not technically
messengers in the way that Agni is, I see no real problem in identifying them thus
113
113
when they come to the sacrifice from the heavenly world, rather than simply
comparing them to messengers.
I do not entirely understand why pātháḥ is accented, and, unusually, Old
makes no comment in the Noten. I assume that it falls roughly in the category of
expressions with a single verb and “zwei Subjekten, Objekten u. s. w.” (specifically
here the u. s. w.) treated in Old’s lengthy article on Verbalenklisis in the Rig Veda
(ZDMG 60 [1906]:707–41 = KlSch 182–216; cited phrase p. 708=183), though in a
rather cursory scan of the article I did not find this passage. The triggering phrase
here would be māsáś ca … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “though the months and many
autumns,” with the accented verb in the middle, even though the conjoined NPs are
not contrastive.
Ge tr. the just cited phrase with “viele Monaten und Herbst,” though
technically speaking fem. pūrvī́ḥ can only modify śarádaḥ, to which it is also
adjacent. Klein (DGRV I.134) echoes Ge’s interpr. forcefully (“… must be taken
with both conjoined nouns” [my ital.]), and no doubt this is the ultimate intent,
though I find preferable the rendering that matches the grammar (so also Re without
comment).

### 3  
As discussed in the publ. intro., I differ from the standard tr. (which
consider Vāyu the subject of ab and the referent of the acc. pl. in pāda a to be the
sacrificers) in considering this first hemistich a disguised reference to the soma
offered to Vāyu. Although the Vāyu identification might seem the default -- and it
indeed may be correct -- both the vocabulary and the ritual situation seem to point in
another direction. The descriptor sumedhás- is never otherwise used of Vāyu, but it
is applied 3x to Soma or his drop (IX.92.3, 93.3, 97.23); the only figure who receives
this epithet more often is Agni. Similarly śvetá- is not used of Vāyu (for the
supposed application in the immed. preceding hymn, VII.90.3, where I think it refers
to Dawn, see comm. ad loc.), but does apply to a drop (drapsá-) in nearby VII.87.6,
while Soma makes himself a śvetá- rūpá- in IX.74.7. The adj. is also used of horses
(VII.77.3), and perhaps, in conjunction with niyútām abhiśrī́ḥ “the full glory of the
teams,” Soma is configured here as the lead horse of the “teams” of offerings we will
make to Vāyu. The beings (acc.) that the subject accompanies (siṣakti) are called
pī́voanna- ‘whose food is fat’, a hapax. It seems an unlikely epithet of human
sacrificers, as the standard interpr. requires. It might describe the ritual fires, but it is
most clearly reminiscent of X.100.10 ū́rjam gāvo yávase pī́vo attana, ṛtásya yā́ḥ
sádane kóśe aṅgdhvé “O cows, eat nourishment in the pasture, eat fat, you who are
anointed in the cup, at the seat of truth,” addressed to the milk to be ritually mixed
into the soma. The masc. gender of pī́vo-annān is something of a stumbling block to
this interpr., but it might result from the variable gender of the underlying referent
gó- ‘cow’ or reference a masc. term for milk or liquid in general. The other acc. pl.
in this pāda, rayivṛ́dhaḥ, is a hapax, though reminiscent of námasā … vṛdhā́saḥ in 1a.
Like the numerous other cmpds in -vṛ́dh- the root noun 2nd member could have either
intransitive/passive value with the 1st member in an instr. relationship
(‘strong/increased by wealth’) or transitive value with an acc. 1st member
114
114
(‘increasing wealth’) -- though most -vṛ́dh- cmpds conform to the former type. Ge
interpr. it as transitive (“die … ihre Reichtümer mehrend”), Gr as intrans.; Old fails
to comment, and Re takes refuge in vagueness (“ayant … une richesse abondante”),
which seems to lean towards the intrans. Scar (521) allows both possibilities in his
gloss, though his tr. of the passage follows the transitive path, “die ihren Reichtum
mehren,” echoing Ge. For my larger interpr. of the passage, either would more or
less work, but neither adds much or seems particularly apt.
To sum up, though I don’t reject the Vāyu / human ritualist interpr. of the
nom. / acc. in ab out of hand, I think an identification of the nom. as Soma and the
acc. as the cows(’ milk) with which soma is mixed works better in the passage. (I do
have to admit that Indra and Vāyu drink clear, unmixed soma in the very next vs.)
Alternatively we might consider the ritual fire (specifically the one that receives the
offerings, later called the Āhavanīya) the subject and the libations themselves the acc.
And, on the basis of VII.92.3 in the next hymn I also now wonder if the acc. referents
in ab might be the teams of wealth we meet in that vs. Basically, no single interpr. of
this vs. can account for all the elements of it.
My interpr. of c follows from that of ab. I take the pl. subj. to be the drops of
soma, extending themselves as offering to Vāyu -- not the priestly sacrificers. Only
in d do these sacrificers make their appearance (náraḥ).

### 4  
Both Ge and Re take ab as a series of subordinate clauses truncated without
a main cl. By contrast, as I indicated in the publ. intro., I think that the yā́vat ‘as long
as’ clauses in ab project the future temporal limit to the institution of sacrifice, with
cd inviting the gods to participate as long as it will last.
dī́dhyānāḥ in b matches the same word in the same position in the immed.
preceding hymn VII.90.4b, though the contexts are different.
The 2nd du. act. aor. impv. pātam in c echoes the 2nd du. act. pres. pātháḥ in 2b,
but these two root forms belong of course to two different roots √pā, ‘drink’ and
‘protect’ respectively. Both of them are anchored to their roots by root-noun cmpds
closely preceding them, go-pā́‘cow-protectors’ (2a) and śuci-pā ‘drinkers of the
clear (soma)’ (4a), both dual and both subject of the following verb. In fact śuci-pā
looks both left and right, with elementary etymological figures on both sides: śúciṃ
(sómaṃ) śucipā pātam ….
## 92
Vāyu / Indra and Vāyu

### 2  
For sómam as obj. of prá √sthā, see parallels cited at VI.41.2.

### 3  
I assume that the object of Vāyu’s quest in our house is soma. Other interpr.
take iṣṭáye differently: Ge “um gern in sein Haus zu kommen,” which seems quite
loose; Re “pour (aller le) chercher en (sa) demeure,” with the referent of “le”
apparently dāśvā́ṃsam of pāda a, which I suppose is possible.
As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. makes clear the equation between the
teams (niyút-) in ab that Vāyu drives to the sacrifice, his wind-horses, and the teams
115
115
of wealth he hitches up (ní … yuvasva) for us in cd. In cd we would expect an
accusative resumptive prn. tā́n or the like, picking up the rel. phrase yā́bhiḥ …
niyúdbhiḥ of ab and serving as obj. of ní … yuvasva. The absence of this prn. is
presumably what led Ge to pronounce the yā́bhiḥ of a as “die freie Verwendung des
Relatives” (n. 3) and to tr. the subordinator with “Wenn.” But I think rather that the
objects in cd stand for the missing *niyútaḥ. Though the noun niyút- doesn’t appear
explicitly in cd, elsewhere that noun can be obj. of its etymologically twin verb; cf.,
e.g., I.180.6 ní yád yuvéthe niyútaḥ ... and, in the immediately hymn, the passive
phrase niyuvānā́niyútaḥ ... (VII.91.5). Therefore the accusatives in cd expressing
wealth and its material realizations are implicitly equated with niyút-. The important
complementarity of the two forms of ní √yu in the two hemistichs is disguised by
Ge’s bland translation of the verb in c: “gib uns”; similarly Klein (DGRV I.26)
“grant to us.”
In the phrase in d vīráṃ gávyam áśvyaṃ ca rā́dhaḥ “(a) hero and bovine and
equine bounty,” the sg. vīrám is superficially unsettling and disharmonious: surely
we want more than a single hero! But vīrám most likely is meant to characterize
rádhaḥ, along with the common adjectival collocation gávyam áśvyam. However, an
adjectival vīryá- *‘consisting of heroes’ is blocked, because that stem has been
frozen as a neut. substantive meaning ‘heroism, heroic deed’. I would now be
inclined to reflect what I consider the substitution of vīrá- for the non-functional
adjectival stem and tr. the acc. phrase as “(teams that are) well-nourishing wealth for
us, bounty in heroes, in cows and horses.”

### 4  
The standard interpr. (Old, Ge, Re) take the nom. pl. rel. yé of ab to be
coreferential with the instr. sūríbhiḥ ‘with the patrons’ in c. This is certainly possible,
but I follow Thieme (Fremd. 20) in taking it rather with the 1st pl. subj. of syāma in c,
hence “(we) who …” There is no morphosyntactic way to tell, as the rel. cl. of ab has
no finite verb, so the person of yé is unspecified. I favor “we” because cd seems to
set up a contrastive pair of the two instr. pl. in c / d (sūríbhiḥ / nṛ́bhiḥ), with which
we accomplish complementary feats: smashing obstacles along with the patrons (c),
conquering in battle with the superior men (=warriors) (d). If the first hemistich
refers exclusively to one of these instrumentals the rhetorical balance is disturbed.
I do not follow Thieme (Fremd. 20 n. 1) in accepting the old suggestion
(conjectured by Gr; see Old for further lit.) that the Saṃhitā vāyáva should be taken
as a nom. pl. vāyávaḥ, against Pp. dat. sg. vāyáve, as an adj. ‘serving Vāyu’ vel sim.
As Old points out, the dat. is supported by té vāyáve found twice in the preceding
hymn (VII.91.1, 3), like our yé vāyave, and in any case the posited adjectival form
would be morphologically dubious (see, e.g., Re’s remarks inter alia). Most supply
another nom. pl. adj. to construe with dat. vāyáve; cf. Ge’s “die dem Vāyu (opfern),”
Re’s “(étant) au (service de) Vāyu.” But I think this is unnecessary: I take the phrase
vāyáva indramā́danāsaḥ as an example of the fungibility of compounds and free
syntagms with the same structure. In other words, I would extract the √mad form
from the cmpd and construe it also with dat. vāyáve. Although transitive forms of
√mad generally take the acc., cf. IX.25.1 marúdbhyo vāyáve mádaḥ “exhilarating
116
116
(drink) for the Maruts and for Vāyu” and, with the same nominal form as here,

### 1  
prá va índrāya mā́danaṃ, háryaśvāya gāyata “Sing forth your exhilarating
(song) to Indra of the fallow bays,” though the dat. there is more likely controlled by
the verb prá √gā. The connection between Vāyu and √mad is reinforced in the next
vs.: 5c vā́yo … mādayasva.
With Old, Re, Thieme (loc. ci.), I take aryáḥ as gen. sg. of arí-, construed
with nitóśānāsaḥ, not as nom. pl. with Gr, Ge.
In cd the opt. syāma seems to serve as a modal-establishing auxiliary to the
participles ghnántaḥ (c) and sāsahvā́ṃsaḥ (d), perhaps a more economical and less
clumsy alternative to two separate optatives (hanyā́ma and sāsahyā́ma) or else a
makeshift attempt to express repeated modal action (expressed by my parenthetical
“be (always) X-ing”).
In d amítra- seems deliberately positioned verse-final to contrast with aryáḥ,
which ends the previous hemistich, and therefore most likely has its full etymological
sense -- ‘(one) without alliance (to us)’ -- in opposition to arí-, which identifies
members of our larger sociopolitical community, even if unknown to us personally.
Re treats VII.93–94 in EVP XIV, starting p. 55.
## 93
Indra and Agni
Both Ge and Re remark on the prominence of the word vā́ja- in the hymn
(“Das Schlagwort ist vā́ja”; “Thème du vā́ja”). Although I would certainly not deny
that, the word does not seem to call attention to its dominance in the way that other
signature words often do: not only is it absent from three of the eight vss. (4, 5, 7),
but especially at the beginning (vss. 1–3) it is not prominently positioned (not at a
pāda boundary or after the caesura) nor positioned in the same place in the vs. line --
both being ways in which a word can assert itself -- nor does it repeat the same case
and number. In vss. 6 and 8 it is hemistich-final (6d, 8b) and so becomes slightly
more salient. In other words, it’s certainly a theme, but a somewhat muted one.

### 2  
The first hemistich is hyper-alliterative, with sibilants s and ś and, esp. in
the 2nd pāda, v and u, all tied together by alternations of short and long a: tā́sānasī́
śavasānā hí bhūtáṃ, sākaṃvṛdhā śávasā śūśuvā́ṃsā. This phonological effect is
reinforced by the etymological figure of śavasānā … śávasā śūśuvā́ṃsā, all
belonging to the root √śū, śvā ‘swell’. To capture the etymological relationship I
would be inclined to adjust the publ. tr. to “o swelling ones .. swollen with swelling
(strength).”
It is difficult to say which of the qualifiers is/are being predicated of Indra and
Agni with the bhūtám, but Ge, Re, and I seem all to have settled on sānasī́.
vā́ja- is modified by ghṛ́ṣvi- in IV.32.6, 9 and by sthávira- in VI.1.11, 37.5.
The two adjectives seem, if not contradictory, at least slightly incompatible, but note
that Indra is qualified by the same two adjectives in the same order, case, and
metrical location as here in III.46.1, VI.18.12. In keeping with the Indraic slant to
117
117
this hymn (on which see publ. intro.), it seems as if a phrase more appropriate to
Indra has been transferred to the prize.
### 3–4
There is no main clause in vs. 3: the three co-referential participial
phrases (… ichámānāḥ b, … nákṣamānāḥ c, … jóhuvataḥ …d) all simply expanding
on the dependent cl. of pāda a, úpo ha yád … gúḥ “When they have come”).
However, the first pāda of vs. 4 echoes 3b exactly, save for number: 3b … víprāḥ
prámatim ichámānāḥ (pl.) versus 4a … vípraḥ prámatim ichámānaḥ (sg.), vs. 4
seems to continue vs. 3. Interestingly enough, it is not possible to determine whether
his new start in 4 is a main clause or continues the dependent cl. in vs. 3 -- though Ge,
Re, and I all take it as an independent cl. The problem is that the finite verb ī́ṭṭe opens
the second pāda; its accent then can be owing to its metrical position and it can be a
main-cl. verb (as we all interpret it). However, the accent could also signal that it’s
the verb of a dependent cl., and the whole complex of vss. 34 could be interpr.
“When the prize seekers have come …., (when) the inspired poet … invokes …,
(then,) o Indra and Agni, further us …” -- in other words 4cd would supply the main
cl. for all of 3–4ab.

### 7  
In d the verb is pl. (śiśrathantu), but only two gods, Aryaman and Aditi, are
mentioned in the pāda; the subjects must therefore include the gods found in b.
## 94
Indra and Agni
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is made up of four tṛcas, which were
probably originally independent, since four 3-vs. hymns would fit the standard
pattern of hymn arrangement, but a single 12-vs. hymn following one with 8 vss.
would not. There is little sign of unity within the separate tṛcas, but the content of the
hymn as a whole is so generic that it would be hard to identify features that would
either unify or distinguish the various parts. Also, there may be a faint, probably
secondary, ring between the 1st vs. (1c) and the last (12d) (see comm. ad vs. 12),
which may suggest that the four tṛcas were combined into a single hymn even before
the redaction of the Saṃhitā text. The first tṛca (vss. 1–3) also has a faint sign of
internal unity: the dual dvandva voc. índrāgnī beginning the b-pāda in each vs.
However, the 3rd tṛca (vss. 7–9) also contains the same form in every vs. (7a, 8c, 9c),
and 10b also begins with this cmpd., though there it is not a voc. but an acc., and it
requires a distracted reading (indrā̆-agnī́-).

### 1  
Both Ge and Re take ajani ‘has been born’ in c as the main verb for ab,
while I take ab as a separate nominal cl. Either is possible. I would be more inclined
towards the Ge/Re solution if mánmanaḥ were an ablative, parallel to abhrā́t in the
simile (“has been born *from this conception, like rain from a cloud”). But though
mánmanaḥ itself could be abl., it is anchored as a gen. by asyá, which must be
adjectival (and hence go with mánmanaḥ) because of its accent. In fact, at least in tr.
“this … praise hymn of this conception” is a clumsy expression, though both Ge and
Re make it slighly less so by adding ‘mine’ (“of this conception of mine”). Though
118
118
the 1st ps. ref. is not found in the text, it does ameliorate the tr. The point is the usual
one, that the verbal product, the hymn, arises from the poet’s mental functions.

### 2  
This vs. traces the genesis of the praise hymn further back: the poet’s
insight (dhī́-) / conception (mánman-) that produces is the hymn is itself the product
of the gods’ stimulation, here expressed by pipyataṃ dhíyaḥ “swell his insights.”

### 4  
The loc. phrase índre agnā́beginning this tṛca echoes the repetitive voc.
dvandva índrāgnī of the 1st tṛca.
### 5–6
Both vss. begin with the dual pronoun tā́, but the first is 3rd ps. (“these
two”) and object of a 3rd ps. verb (īḷate … víprāsaḥ “the inspired poets invoke those
two”), while the 2nd, followed by 2nd ps. enclitic vām, has switched reference to 2nd ps.
and is object of a 1st ps. verb (havāmahe “we call upon you two”) -- thus effecting a
relationship of considerably more intimacy.

### 7  
On īśata see comm. ad I.23.9.

### 8  
On my reading *akásya for kásya after mā́, see comm. ad IV.3.13.

### 10  
This vs. is a fragment, a yád clause without a main cl. It also contains an
augmented intensive ájohavuḥ; this preterital form seems out of place in a hymn that
lives almost entirely in the ritual present (our actions for Indra and Agni) and
immediate future (via the imperatives we address to those same gods). (Only ajani in
vs. 1 is preterital, but this aorist refers to the immediate ritual past.) The verse is also
one of the few in this hymn that lacks parallel pādas or near repetitions elsewhere.
(See Ge’s nn and Bloomfield, RReps for some of the details, though Bloomfield does
not list partial repetitions.)

### 11  
This vs. is likewise a fragment, a nom. dual dvandva (vṛtrahántamā),
which supports a rel. clause characterizing Indra and Agni, but no main clause. By
my interpr. (and those of Ge and Re), this rel. cl. is nominal, with a predicated part.
mandānā́. Old takes the ambig. āvívasataḥ as a dual finite verb (but cannily doesn’t
tr.); this interpr. requires an anomalous meaning for the form, whereas the interpr. as
a gen. sg. participle, shared by Ge, Re, and me, allows the form to have its usual
sense (“seek to win [the gods]”).

### 12  
The 3rd ps. ref. of the nom. du. in vs. 11 is transformed into 2nd ps. ref. by
the 2nd du. impv. hatam in 12b, mediated by the dual prn. tāú, which in this context,
with a flg. impv., can have either 3rd or 2nd ps. ref. (see my “sá figé”).
Ge and Re take ābhogá- and udadhí- as PNs, which seems odd since both
words are easily interpretable. The latter is in fact attested in other passages as a
common noun meaning ‘water-holder, reservoir’ and its components are clear. I
assume that the reason for assuming a PN is that a ‘water-holder’ is considered to be
119
119
a positive entity, and since it is to be smashed, it must be negatively viewed here. But
“holding” water can shade into “withholding” water, a negative action. We might
here also invoke the first vs., where the hymn is produced “like rain from a cloud.” A
cloud can be considered a ‘water-holder’, and the positive and negative aspects of
water-holding may be contrasted in the 1st and last vss.. As indicated above, although
I do think the tṛcas in this hymn were originally independent, some sense of ring
composition might have gone into their combining.
As for ābhogá, Old seriously doubts the gloss ‘snake’ found, e.g., in Gr. But
I’m somewhat puzzled as to why. There is certainly a root √bhuj ‘bend, coil’ distinct
from √bhuj ‘enjoy, benefit’, and bhogá- definitely means ‘(snake’s) coil’ in
reference to Vṛtra in V.29.6 ... bhogā́n sākáṃ vájreṇa maghávā vivṛścát “the
bounteous one hews apart his [=Vr̥tra's] … coils at one blow with his mace.”
## 95
Sarasvatī

### 1  
The problem in this vs. is rathyèva in c. Contextually the most obvious
interpr. is as a nom. sg. fem., subject of yāti, but assuming the correctness of the Pp.
reading, rathyā̀iva (and there is no other viable alternative), it is difficult to find a
way to get there morphologically. If it belongs to the vṛkī-inflected rathī́-
‘charioteer’, the nom. sg. should of course be rathī́s. Gr assigns it to this stem, but as
an instr. sg., but who would this other charioteer in the instr. be? Ge/Re also interpr.
as an instr., but to a stem rathyā̀- ‘Fahrstrasse’ / ‘une route-carrosable’. See Ge’s
somewhat opaque comm. in the 4th vol. of his tr. (p. 252, col. 3, ad II.4.6b) and Old’s
more illuminating one, interpreting a previous, but similar formulation of Ge’s
(ZDMG 61 [1907] 831–32 = Kl.Sch.262-63). Old himself prefers an interpr. as an
acc. pl. rathyàḥ with double application of sandhi (to nom./acc. pl. *rathyàs iva).
Here the acc. pl. would presumably be parallel to “all the other waters” that Sarasvatī
pushes ahead of her, but the simile would ill fit the passage. (Old does not transl.)
The sequence rathyèva occurs several times elsewhere: II.39.2, 3, III.33.2, 36.6,
VII.39.1. In all but III.36.6, rathyā̀is clearly the correct dual nom./acc. to the vṛkīstem, and in III.36.6 I interpret it also as a dual (contra most interpr.), for reasons
given in the comm. ad loc. But here that solution, wedding morphology and sense,
will not work. My ad hoc and admittedly entirely unsatisfactory “solution” here is to
take it as a nonce fem. nom. sg. in -ā, perhaps based on asuryā̀(also nom. sg. fem.)
in the 1st vs. of the next hymn (VII.96.1), also of Sarasvatī. The hymns are twinned
and can be read against each other.

### 2  
By my interpr. (as well as the standard ones), this vs. contains two forms of
the act. pres. stem céta-, 3rd sg. cetat (or acetat: see immed. below) in pāda a and part.
cétantī in c. The first is found in the sequence ékācetat, analyzed by the Pp. as ékā
acetat. This is perfectly possible, but an injunctive form is equally possible on textual
grounds and in my opinion would fit the presential/resultative context better. See
Gotō (1st cl., 138 and n. 181), who so interprets it. In any case, I take it as intransitive
‘shows / appears’, with ś́úciḥ as the predicate adjective. In c the participle cétantī has
120
120
the sense ‘perceives, takes note’ and governs the gen. rāyáḥ. Given the semantic
multivalence of the root √cit and the pleasure poets take in manipulating and
juxtaposing its forms, this functional shift within a verse is not surprising. (Gotō [p.
138] also assigns different functions to the two forms.) The intrans. use of cetat is
supported by cetati in the same usage in the next hymn (VII.96.3).

### 3  
The male subject of this vs. is not identified, but the Anukramaṇī identifies
him as Sarasvant. This seems correct (despite doubts raised, e.g., by Old), given that
half of the following hymn, the 2nd tṛca (VII.96.4–6), is devoted to him and he is
mentioned by name in all three vss. The two hymns VII.95 and 96, despite being in
different meter, should be read against each other. See comm. ad vs. 1 above.
I take med. māmṛjīta as reflexive, with Sarasvant both subj. and obj. (so also,
apparently, Kü 373), though Ge thinks that the obj. is the racehorse and Re that both
subj. and obj. are the racehorse.

### 4  
On mitá-jñu- see comm. ad VI.32.3.
The sákhibhyaḥ of the final pāda must be Sarasvatī’s sister rivers. As Old
points out, the stem sákhi- can be used of females as well as males; fem. sákhī- is
absent from the older language. See also Re ad loc. For the glorification of Sarasvatī
over the other rivers, see vs. 1 and implicitly vs. 2, as well as the 1st vs. of the next
hymn (VII.96.1) and VI.61.9, 10, 13. The formulation “higher than ABL” is identical
to the boast of the victorious co-wife in X.145.3 úttarāhám … úttaréd úttarābhyaḥ “I
am higher, higher even than the higher ones (fem.).”

### 5  
My interpr. of the syntax and the reference in this vs. differs considerably
from the standard. Most (Ge, Re; see also Old) take b as parenthetic, with pāda a
parallel to c, both containing nom. pl. m. med. participles with 1st ps. subjects,
júhvānā(ḥ) and dádhānā(ḥ) respectively. The first part. is transitive with imā́as
object. Hence, “Offering these (oblations, vel. sim.) … , setting ourselves in your
shelter, we …” Under this interpr. according to Re, the yuṣmát in pāda a refers to the
patrons, already found in vs. 3 -- rather loosely construed (“de votre part”). Ge fails
to identify the 2nd pl. referent, while Old considers both the patrons and the rivers
possible and makes no decision.
Although the Ge/Re(/Old) interpr. is certainly possible -- and has the
parallelism of the two participles in its favor -- I am reluctant to bring in patrons,
who figured only in the Sarasvant vs. 3, and I also prefer to avoid parenthetical
clauses if at all possible. I therefore go against the Pp. in taking the first participle as
júhvānā and neut. pl., rather than júhvānāḥ and masc. pl. As a nom. pl. neut., the part.
is passive and forms a nominal clause with imā́, with the participle predicated (as is
not rare). The part. stem júhvāna- is found with both transitive and passive interpr.
(Note that Gr takes this form as passive, but as a nom. pl. fem. in -āḥ modifying his
supplied gíraḥ ‘hymns’, represented by imā́ḥ [requiring him to go against the Pp
reading imā́].)
121
121
By my interpr. of pāda a, the 2nd pl. refers to the (other) rivers just featured in
4d, and in the expression yuṣmád ā́, ā́means ‘all the way to’, though it must be
admitted that ā́in that usage usually precedes (see Gr col. 169). Old himself suggests
as one of his possibilities “bis zu euch hin” of the rivers or waters. The ambiguous
position of ā́in the expression in 2b giríbhya ā́samudrā́t “from the mountains all the
way to the sea” also has ā́directly before an abl. expressing goal.

### 6  
Ge and Re seem to take vā́jān as the obj. of várdha as well as rāsi, while I
supply Vasiṣṭha, the subject of the preceding hemistich.
## 96
Sarasvatī (1–3), Sarasvant (4–6)

### 1  
With Gr, Ge (etc.) I take gāyiṣe as a 1st sg. -se form of the stuṣé type; Old,
fld by Re, takes it as a 3d sg. passive. Besides separating the form from the standard
usage of stuṣé and the like, this leaves bṛhát … vácaḥ syntactically untethered. Old
takes it in instr. sense, but it’s hard to get the neut. acc. to function that way.
Re also takes mahayā in c as a 1st sg. subjunctive, but an impv. works better
with the voc. vasiṣṭha (d), an example of poetic self-address (treated in my 2005 Fs.
Skjaevø article).

### 2  
On the interpretational problem posed by du. ubhé … ándhasī “both stalks,”
see publ. intro. As indicated there, I do not subscribe to the interpretation that takes
this as a metaphorical expression of political geography. Rather I assume that the
usual sense of ándhas- ‘soma stalk’ à ‘soma’ allows the dual to refer to two liquids.
Ge (n. 2a) points out that in ŚB V.1.2.10 this dual is used for soma and surā (the
profane intoxicating drink), and since in the Sautrāmaṇī ritual surā is mixed with
milk, the second liquid could also be the more benign milk. Old makes a good case
for the connection of soma and surā with Sarasvatī and also suggests that the
formulation is meant to indicate that the Pūrus make use of profane drinks as well as
soma. Re favors soma and surā without disc. Two textual passages nearer to hand
suggest other possible solutions. As was noted ad VII.95.1, 3, these two adjacent
hymns to Sarasvatī, VII.95 and 96, show twinning tendencies. In VII.95.2 (that is, the
vs. corresponding to this one in position) Sarasvatī milks out “ghee and milk”
(ghṛtám páyaḥ) for Nāhuṣa, probably the designation of a human family group or
lineage (see Mayrhofer, Personennamen s.v. náhuṣ-); here the Pūrus (another such
designation) preside over two liquids, which could be those very two. Alternatively,
in this same hymn, VII.96.5, Sarasvant’s waves are characterized by honey and ghee
(mádhumanto ghṛtaścútaḥ), and this pair is another possibility, esp. if ‘honey’ stands
for soma, as often. These two vss. (2, 5) match each other in another way; see ad vs.
5 below. In the end, Ge’s interpr (at the end of his n.) that the Pūrus, living beside the
Sarasvatī, inhabit a land rich in soma and milk seems to suggest the most likely
image: whatever the two liquids are, they are indications of a place rich in
nourishment -- in biblical terms, a land of milk and honey.
122
122
I do not know why the Maruts would be the particular companions of
Sarasvatī, unless their storms swell her waters.

### 3  
The subjunctive kṛṇavat seems to have a more strictly modal sense than
most subjunctives; I am tempted to tr. “should do good” or “may she do good.”

### 4  
Why Sarasvant should receive the pleas of bachelors seeking wives and
sons is utterly unclear to me, and the standard tr./comm. don’t address this issue.

### 5  
The third pāda of this vs., which is the 2nd vs. in the tṛca addressed to
Sarasvant, the masc. equivalent of the far more prominent Sarasvatī, parallels that of
the 2nd vs. in the tṛca addressed to Sarasvatī that opens this hymn:
2c sā́no bodhi avitrī́marútsakhā
5c tébhir no avitā́bhava
Re suggests that this parallelism attests to the secondary character of Sarasvant. The
difference between the two impvs. bodhi and bhava, both to √bhū, conforms to the
positional distribution of these two forms discussed in my 1997 “Syntactic
constraints on morphological change: The Vedic imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi”
(Syntaxe des langues indo-iraniennes anciennes, ed. E. Pirart).

### 6  
The acc. phrase in ab pīpivā́ṃsam … stánam is the object, or one of the
objects of bhakṣīmáhi in c, which makes the rel. clause yó viśvádarśataḥ, referring to
the stána-, technically an embedded rel. But as we have often seen, nominal rel. cl. --
pseudo-izafes -- are regularly found embedded.
The expression “share in the breast” seems somewhat odd, but this “swelling
breast” is presumably swelling with the honey and ghee in vs. 5. As noted in the publ.
intro., it is also odd to attribute this breast to the male figure Sarasvant. The more
appropriate association between the breast and Sarasvatī is found in I.164.49, a
passage adduced by Ge (n. 6ab).
## 97
Indra and Bṛhaspati
Re treats this hymn in EVP XV.66–69. For the structure of the hymn and the
covert identification of Bṛhaspati (/Indra) with Agni, see publ. intro. This
identification is argued for extensively by Schmidt (B+I, 62–67, which also contains
a complete tr. and philological comm.).

### 1  
This vs. plays on the ambiguity of reference of the noun nṛ́-, which can
refer both to superior (mortal) men and to gods. It also cleverly but uninsistently
identifies the sacrifice as the meeting place of men and gods, the nṛṣádana- ‘seat of
men’ who come from / belong to both heaven and earth (diváḥ … pṛthivyā́ḥ) --
though see Ge’s n. 1a for other, in my opinion less likely, possibilities. The náraḥ in
pāda b, however, seem only to be men proper, that is mortals, who seek the gods at
the sacrificial common ground.
123
123
In c sunvé is one of the rare exx. of a singular verb with neut. pl. subj. (here
sávanāni), a construction that is of course supported by comparative evidence. Gr
interprets the verb rather as a 1st sg. transitive. This is not impossible -- and note the
1st pl. verb in 2a -- but sunve is otherwise passive, with 3rd pl. sunviré likewise
passive.
In d the verb gáman (in sandhi) could represent either 3rd pl. gáman or 3rd sg.
gámat, but both the context, with Indra mentioned in the preceding pāda, and the
parallel I.178.2d gáman na índraḥ sakhyā́váyaś ca support the 3rd sg.
The pāda is also marked by case disharmony: dat. mádāya and acc. váyaś ca
appear to be joint complements of gámat, conjoined by ca. Such case disharmony is
rare in ca collocations (see Klein DGRV I.56–57), but at least in this example poses
no obstacle to understanding: the dat. expresses purpose, the acc. goal. Although
neither Klein nor I find the construction problematic, Re supplies a second verb to
govern váyaḥ (“obtenir”), and HPS interprets the acc. as an Inhaltsakk.
A more problematic issue, at least for me, is the position of ca, unmentioned
by any one, incl. Klein. The standard tr./interpr. take the 2nd term of the conjoined NP
to be prathamáṃ váyaḥ “first vitality/youth,” but we should then expect the ca to
follow prathamám, the first word of the second member. Although such positioning
is not an unbreakable rule, it is remarkably regular. To avoid the problem I take
prathamám as an adverb here, as I do in the parallel I.83.4 (prathamám … váyaḥ
without a ca), cited by Old and Re, for which see comm. ad loc.

### 2  
The problem in this vs. is maha (sandhi form) in b bṛ́haspatir no maha ā́
sakhāyaḥ. The Pp reads this as mahe, as do most subsequent interpr. -- though mahaḥ
is possible and is in fact the interpr. of at least one tr.: HPS takes it as the voc. pl. of
máh-, construed with sakhāyaḥ, hence “ihr grossen Freunde.” But this seems
unlikely: there are no voc. forms to this stem in the RV (though the derived fem.
mahī́- does have some), and the intrusion of ā́in the middle of the voc. phrase seems
unlikely. Others accept the Pp mahe and generally take it as a 3rd sg. verb, but
opinions differ on its root affiliation and meaning. I will not detail these
disagreements; see the disc. in Old, Ge’s n. 2b, Re ad loc., and Gotō 243–44. My
interpr. is closest to Gotō’s: he assigns this to a root √mah ‘bring about’, separate
from √mah ‘magnify’, with a t-less 3rd sg. of the śáye type (see also comm. ad I.94.1)
and tr. “Bṛhaspati ist für uns imstande.” I differ from him in the interpr. of the rest of
the pāda: he takes ā́as the trigger of an unexpressed verb of motion, “[kommet] o
Genossen herbei.” This seems to assume that the friends addressed are not
coreferential with naḥ earlier in the pāda, or the referents of the 1st ps. verbs in pādas
a and c. I do not entirely understand the position of ā́, but it may show the occasional
positioning of a preverb immediately after its verb or simply be an adverbial ‘here’,
as in my tr.
As Re points out, the optative (bhávema) is quite unusual in a yáthā purpose
cl., where the subjunctive is standard. See Gr s.v. yáthā, cols. 1083–84, nos. 6–8.
124
124

### 3  
Both Ge and Re take great pains to avoid indentifying Indra in c with
bráhmaṇas pátim in b and the elaboration on this phrase in d, but as discussed in the
publ. intro. and extensively by HPS, the identification is the point.

### 4  
The second pāda contains an equational rel. cl. with expressed copula ásti;
main cl. equational expressions almost always lack copula (when asti is found, it is
generally existential), but overt copulas are not uncommon in dependent clauses. It is
of course optional; see the nominal rel. cl. in the preceding vs., 3d, which lacks
copula.
Pāda c contains a phrase in the nominative, kā́mo rāyáḥ suvī́ryasya “desire for
wealth in good heroes,” which is picked up abruptly by the acc. prn. tám, object of
the immediately following verb dāt. There seems no other way to interpret it -- and it
goes perhaps too easily into English -- but both the syntax and sense are slightly off.
The fronted expression seems like a topicalized phrase, but in Vedic topics would not
default to the nominative but remain in the appropriate case for the larger syntactic
frame; see in the next vs. the acc. phrase that occupies the whole of pāda a, which is
the obj. of the verb in b. Moreover, one doesn’t give wishes/desires but rather the
contents of those desires, so that the referent of tám may be rayí-, not kā́ma-. Both
concerns suggest that the relationship between the kā́ma- phrase and the abbreviated
táṃ dāt clause is less close than it appears. Re supplies some structure to the first
phrase -- “(En nous est) le désir …” -- and something like that might produce the
necessary distance.

### 5  
On pastyā̀- see comm. ad I.40.7. As noted ad I.40.7 HPS in that passage
renders the stem as ‘stream’ but here as ‘house’, the interpr. I prefer. Note that in our
passage HvN should be corrected from pastiyā́nām to pastíyānām (that is,
pastyā̀nām).

### 6  
The construction of the vs. is uncertain in several regards, which center on
the 2nd hemistich. The first is whether neut. sáhaḥ belongs in the rel. cl. or not; the
position of rel. yásya is compatible with either answer. I take it as an independent
qualifier of acc. bṛ́haspátim in b, hence an acc.: Bṛhaspati is identified with the
abstract noun ‘strength / force’ itself. I therefore assume that the rel. cl. begins with
yásya. This also seems to be the Ge solution. The sense of Re’s tr. is similar, but he
puts sáhaḥ in the, or a, rel. cl. as a nominative -- taking c as containing two nominal
rel. clauses: “lui dont la force-dominante (est réelle, dont) le séjour-commun (est)
noir.” HPS makes sáhaḥ the subject of an equational rel. cl.: “dessen Gewalt eine
schwarze Stätte ist.” Since I think it more likely that Bṛhaspati is identified as
strength itself than that his seat is, I find Schmidt’s interpr. less likely, though it does
have the merit of not inserting a syntactic break in the middle of a pāda. If Bṛhaspati
is identified with sáhaḥ here (as I think), Schmidt’s claim that Bṛhaspati is identified
with Agni in this hymn -- an identification esp. clear in this vs. (see publ. intro.) -- is
strenthened, since Agni is so often called “son of strength” (sūnú- sáhasaḥ, e.g., in
this maṇḍala VII.1.21, 22, 3.8, etc.).
125
125
A more interesting question is what to do with d. The pl. vásānāḥ is
universally, and plausibly, taken as referring to to the horses of ab: in pāda they are
called ‘ruddy’ (aruṣā́saḥ); in d they “clothe themselves in ruddy form” (rūpám
aruṣám). The question then is whether d is simply a continuation of the main cl. in ab,
the part. vásānāḥ modifying áśvāḥ in pāda a, with the rel. cl. of c embedded in it.
This is perfectly possible and seems to be the standard interpr. Although we prefer to
avoid interpr. with embedded relatives, once again the rel. cl. in this instance is
nominal (whichever finer grained interpr. we follow), and nominal relatives are
systematic exceptions to this rule. However, I prefer to take d as a continuation of the
rel. cl. introduced by yásya, with oppositional nominal expressions, contrasting
Bṛhaspati’s dark seat with his horses which take on “ruddy form.” This interpr.
allows the ‘ruddy’ in d to be more than a pleonastic repetition of the same word in
pāda a and gives more punch to the nī́lavat sadhástham of c by making it part of a
contrastive pair. If this interpr. is correct, the part. vásānāḥ would be predicated.
Ge (n. 6bc) notes the word play between semantically and etymologically
distinct saha- (b) and sáhaḥ (c). In fact the play is more tightly constructed than he
indicates, with the chiastic figure saha-vā́ho vahanti / sáhaḥ, with the hemistich
boundary isolating the semantically non-conforming word.

### 7  
It is difficult to wring a causal sense out of hí here. The vs. continues the
depiction of Bṛhaspati as Agni: the hundred feathers of the preening bird are the
flames dipping and rising much like the action of preening; the golden axe or axes
are likewise flames; while the descriptions in cd are focused on the role of Agni in
the ritual.
On śundhyú- see comm. ad V.52.9.
I would now be inclined to tr. the bahuvrīhi híraṇya-vāśīḥ (for the inflection
see AiG II.2.408) as implicitly pl. (‘having golden axes’, rather than the publ.
‘having a golden axe’ flg. Ge/Re) because it seems to refer to Agni’s flames. HPS tr.
“mit hundert goldenen Äxten bewaffnete” without comment; he seems to have
silently transferred the śatá- from śatá-patraḥ in pāda a, presumably an oversight.
svāvesá- is somewhat difficult and disputed. HPS specifically rejects
Velankar’s “easy of approach” and Re’s “d’accueil favorable”; Schmidt’s “mit
seinem gute Eintritt” is closer to Ge’s “bringt Glück mit seinem Eingang.” HPS (p.
66) suggests that svāveśá ṛṣváḥ simply evokes the image of a fire flaring up, but I
don’t see what ‘entrance’ has to do with that. I take it as ‘providing good/easy
entrance’; here this would refer to the entry of the libations into the offering fire, an
interpretation that is in harmony with d, which concerns the subject’s superior ability
to provide āsutí-, the ‘pressed drink’, to his comrades, presumably the gods who
consume the oblations through Agni as their mouth.

### 8  
I take the ‘comrades’ addressed by the voc. sakhāyaḥ to be different from
those mentioned in the dative in the preceding vs. There the comrades of the god
were the (other) gods who receive the oblation from Agni; here they are the
126
126
comrades of the poet, who urges them to tend to the god. The identity of comrades
obviously depends on who they are comrades to.
Pāda d implicitly echoes 4d.

### 10  
On kīrí- see comm. ad V.52.10.
## 98
Indra

### 1  
Verbal forms of the root √pā ‘drink’ do not appear with the preverb áva in
the RV or, indeed, elsewhere in Skt. But this noun stem avapā́na- is found 5x in the
RV (I.136.4, VII.98.1, VIII.4.10, X.43.2, 106.2); in 3 of these passages (all but
I.136.4, X.43.2) it is used of a wild beast come to drink; cf. (besides our passage)
VIII.4.10 ṛ́ṣyo ná tṛ́ṣyann avapā́nam ā́gahi “like a thirsting antelope, come to the
drinking (hole).” These specialized contexts suggest that rather than meaning simply
“das Trinken, der Trunk” (Gr), the stem refers to a drinking hole frequented by wild
animals (so already MonWms). The preverb áva ‘down’ would refer to the physical
stance of animals lowering their heads to drink. The image of Indra beating buffalos
to a watering hole is rather charming.

### 2  
With Ge I take yád as a neut. rel. prn. rather than as the subordinating conj.
yád, though this poses some minor syntactic difficulties. If the referent is ultimately
soma, we would expect a masc. form (yám); the neut. can be explained as “attraction”
to the predicated “food” (neut. ánnam) in the same cl. (“what you made your food
…”). As a resumptive pronoun in the main cl. we might also prefer *tásya to asya,
though this is a small problem.

### 3  
I might now slightly alter the tr. of the pf. part. jajñānáḥ to ‘having (just)
been born’ to put emphasis on Indra’s prodigious actions immediately after his birth.

### 4  
On the s-aor. of √sah see Narten (Sig.Aor. 264–67) and on the lengthened
grade of some forms of this aor., as well as elsewhere in the root, see Narten (op. cit.)
Gotō (1st Kl. 325–26), EWA s.v. SAH.
On the root noun vṛ́t-, see Schindler (Rt.Nouns s.v.); it belongs with √vṛ
‘obstruct’ (etc.), not, with Gr, √vṛt ‘turn’. In this passage a derivation from ‘obstruct’
makes sense for the defensive forces that provide an obstacle to the attacking army.

### 5  
The first hemistich préndrasya vocam prathamā́kṛtā́ni, prá nū́tanā
maghávā yā́cakā́ra is a variant on the famous opening of I.32: I.32.1ab índrasya nú
vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam, yā́ni cakā́ra prathamā́ni vajrī́. The two contain almost all of the
same elements (prá vocam, índrasya, prathamā́(ni), yā́(ni) cakā́ra, nú / nū́tanā), with
variation only with vīryā́ni ≅ kṛtā́ni and different epithets of Indra, maghávā / vajrī́.
Nonetheless the distribution of elements between clauses and the word order in each
clause are significantly different. This variation is typical of RVic formulae, which
127
127
generally do not follow a fixed template and are not sensitive to meter alone (both
vss. in question are Triṣṭubhs).

Viṣṇu, Viṣṇu and Indra

### 1  
Re supplies “other gods” as the subj. of ánv aśnuvanti in b. This seems
perfectly acceptable, though not strictly necessary. And since in vs. 2 it is,
presumably, mortals (since they are ‘born’) who fail to reach the limit of Viṣṇu’s
greatness, mortals could also be the subject here. See remarks below on the
formulatic connection between the two vss.
As Re points out, both the case of the complement (acc. versus gen.) and the
voice (act. versus mid.) differ between 1st pl. vidma in c and 2nd sg. vitse in d. The
middle voice of vitse makes sense, since Viṣṇu knows his own farthest realm; the
variation in case is harder to account for. Perhaps the two earthly realms are subjects
of direct knowledge, while the farthest realm is something even Viṣṇu only knows of.
### 1–2
The b-pādas of these two vss. are variants of each other, using two
different roots for ‘attain’ (√naś, √āp) and two different formulations of ‘greatness’,
the 2nd an elaboration on the first:
1b ná te mahitvám ánv aśnuvanti
2ab ná te … mahimnáḥ páram ántam āpa
Another example of the freedom of RVic formulaics; see comm. ad VII.98.5 in the
previous hymn for further on this.

### 2  
Ordinarily the pres. part. should express ‘being Xed’, in contrast to the past
part. ‘Xed’. But in this context jā́yamāna- must refer not to someone in the process
of being born, but more likely someone who is still alive, against jātá-, someone born
in the past and presumably now dead.

### 3  
With Ge I take the first hemistich as Viṣṇu’s quoted speech. This, however,
does not solve the puzzle posed by hí bhūtám. Is bhūtám an impv., as Ge takes it -- or
an injunctive, with Re? If an imperative, how does it square with hí? This particle is
not rare with imperatives, but it always seems somewhat problematic. Often it
appears with the first impv. in a series, and the hí clause can command the action on
which all subsequent actions depend, with the following impvs. often introduced by
áthā -- see comm. ad I.10.3, 14.12, etc. -- but here there is no following imperative.
In the publ. tr. I manage a syntactic sleight-of-hand, reading bhūtám twice, once as
an injunctive in a causal hí clause, to be construed with the two adj. in pāda a, írāvatī
dhenumátī, and once as an impv. in a main cl., to be construed with the adj. in b,
sūyavasínī (schematically “because you are X Y, become Z”). Although this works, it
seems somewhat artificial and requires separating the three apparently parallel
adjectives into two clauses. This interpr. was based in part on I.93.7, which contains
128
128
a clause ADJ ADJ hí bhūtám followed by an áthā cl. with an impv. to a different verb.
In the publ. tr. of I.93.7 I take bhūtám as an injunc (with Ge, Re). “Since you are X Y
…, therefore …” But in the comm. I cast doubt on that interpr. and prefer an impv.
interpr. “Become X Y, then …” Therefore, I.93.7 is not necessarily a support for my
publ. interpr. here; I still weakly prefer it because of the absence of a following impv.,
but now consider the alternative possible: “Become full of refreshment, rich in milkcows, affording good pasture …” The following impv. may be missing because
Viṣṇu’s direct speech is truncated. (Despite their distance in the text, comparing
I.93.7 to our passage is justified by the fact that the first pāda in the very next vs. in
our hymn, 4a, is identical to I.93.6d, adjacent to the vs. under comparison.)

### 4  
As was just noted, the first pāda of this vs. is identical to I.93.6d, where
Agni and Soma are the dual subjects. Indeed, the identity of the dual subjects in this
vs. is left hanging throughout the vs., and the poet may have left a false trail: the last
du. 2nd ps. referents were the two world halves (ródasī), addressed by Viṣṇu in 3ab.
Assuming that the hymn as we have it is a unity (rather than consisting of two
separate tṛcas, plus summary vs., as is possible), ródasī would remain a live
possibility for the subj. of this vs. until the final pāda (d), where the 2nd du. subjects
are addressed as narā ‘superior men’, suppling a gender that clashes with fem. ródasī.
But since nṛ́- has a wide range of reference, this still does not definitively identify
them. Even the dual number leaves the identity open: nárā is used of the Aśvins
(mostly), Indra-Vāyu, Indra-Agni, Indra-Varuṇa, Mitra-Varuṇa -- and only once
(here) of this pair. It is only with the first word of the following vs. (5a), the voc.
índrāviṣṇū, that the question is settled.
All of the deeds recounted in this vs. can be attributed to Indra alone (see publ.
intro.), although Viṣṇu’s role in enlarging and defining cosmic space may be alluded
to in pāda a, with the creation of space for the sacrifice. Re’s claim that ab belong
more to Viṣṇu, cd more to Indra is overstated: the cosmogony in b has little to do
with what we know of Viṣṇu but is associated elsewhere with Indra.
As Old points out, the name of the Dāsa in c, Vṛṣaśipra, seems akin to
Viśiśipra in V.45.6, whom Manu defeats (note that Manu figures in our vs. 3b) -- a
connection not registered in Mayr.’s Personennamen. However, as noted in the
comm. ad V.45.6, this gets us nowhere, since we know nothing further of either of
these figures. More interesting is the potential relationship between these names and
Śipiviṣṭa, the epithet of Viṣṇu found in the RV only in this hymn (vs. 7) and the next
(VII.100.5, 6). The first member of this epithet, śipi-, looks like a Caland form of the
2nd member of the two names, śipra-, while the 2nd member, viṣṭá-, is esp. close to the
1st member of the name found in V.45.6, viśi-; vṛṣa- in our passage is a plausible reSansritization cum folk etymology of a possible MIA form *visi-, underlying viśi.

### 5  
Both Śambara and Varcin are Indra’s targets elsewhere, with no
involvement of Viṣṇu. They are conjoined objects (varcínaṃ śambaraṃ ca) of
Indra’s smiting (áhan) in VI.47.21.
129
129
There is numerical play between the two hemistichs: in c the numbers are
raised both by a digit (9 à 10) and by a factor of 10 (9 [/10] à 100; 90 [/100] à
1000). The connection is emphasized by the parallel structure of the numerical
expression: b: #náva X navatíṃ ca / c: #śatám X sahásraṃ ca. Varcin is credited
elsewhere with the same number of forces: II.14.6, IV.30.15.
I do not know why the verb is in the present in the second hemistich (hatháḥ)
but aorist in the first (śnathiṣṭam). In the passages containing the other three
occurrences of Varcin (II.14.6, IV.30.15, VI.47.21) the verbs are all preterital.

### 6  
The adj. urukramá- ‘wide-striding’ is otherwise used only of Viṣṇu (5x),
but here encompasses Indra as well, in the dual.
The dual dvandva voc. índrāviṣṇū that opened vs. 5 is here divided into two
pāda-final vocc. in c (viṣṇo), d (indra). Presumably because they belong to separate
clauses, the dvandva doesn’t decompose into a vāyav indraś ca construction, but it
does follow such constructions in placing the 2nd member of the dvandva first (see
my 1988 “Vāyav indraś ca revisited,” MSS 49: 13–59).

Viṣṇu

### 1  
The meter of the first pāda is badly off and is not easily fixable. See Old.
He suggests a distracted reading of nū́and records the suggestion that márto should
be emended to márti
yo, which HvN print as their text. If both are adopted (distracted
nū́and márti
yo; so Arnold p. 310), the line achieves 11 syllables, but the price may
be too high, esp. as the light fourth syllable would be unusual.
Although dáyate generally means ‘distribute (goods to someone else)’, e.g.,
I.68.6 tásmai … rayíṃ dayasva, in a few passages it seems to have adopted the more
“middle” meaning ‘receive/take a share’, perhaps adjusted to the model of other
words of sharing, esp. bhájate ‘receive a share’ versus act. bhájati ‘share out,
distribute shares’. See Gotō (1st Kl., 172–73), whose tr. of this passage is close to
mine. As noted ad II.33.10, I do not subscribe to Gotō’s separation of forms of
dáyate into two separate roots.
The three subsequent pādas (bcd) state the conditions under which the mortal
in pāda a will receive the longed-for share. They are marked by the rel. prn. yáḥ in b
and c; adopting Re’s strategy I have rendered them as conditionals (“if”) for clarity,
rather than as straight rel. clauses (“who”). Unfortunately I don’t think my tr. makes
it clear that cd are parallel to b, rather than being part of a resumed main clause, and
I would now slightly emend the tr. to “…, if he will set … and will seek …”). The
apparent non-parallelism is exacerbated by the fact that the verbs of c and d (yájāte
and āvívāsāt respectively) are subjunctives, whereas dā́śat in b should be the
injunctive to the thematic pres. dā́śati, which elsewhere attests a real subjunctive
(dā́śāt). KH discusses just this passage (Inj. 238), suggesting that in such contexts the
indicative present, injunctive, and subjunctive overlap in usage.
130
130

### 3  
Flg. a suggestion by Ge (n. 3a, though not reflected in his tr.), I take eṣáin pāda a (also 4a) as belonging to the stem eṣá- ‘quick’, which is used several times
of Viṣṇu in the gen. expression víṣṇor eṣásya (II.34.11, VII.40.5, VIII.20.3), in which
confusion with the nom. pronominal eṣá(ḥ) (possible here) is excluded.
The hapax śatárcas- is problematic. The Pp analyses the 2nd member as
arcasam, but Wackernagel (AiG I.318) points out that the sandhi between the cmpd
members would require rather -ṛcasam. However, Old disputes this, claiming that it
would then have to be written (“… geschrieben werden müssen”) *śatáṛcasam ,
though it’s not clear to me why. Interpr. differ significantly: Sāy. glosses with arcis-.
Old posits a masc. s-stem *arcás- ‘singer’, comparing VI.34.3 yádi stotā́raḥ śatáṃ
yát sahásraṃ gṛṇánti “When a hundred, when a thousand praisers sing to him …,” an
interpr. followed by Ge -- though the connection between the two passages seems
tenuous to me. By contrast, Re tr. “au cent éclats,” perhaps flg. Sāy.’s arcís-. Since
an infinitival dat. ṛcáse ‘to praise, for chanting (praise)’ is found in VI.39.5 and
VII.61.6, it seems reasonable to take the underlying stem ṛcas- as the base here, as
Gr does, glossing ‘hundertfach zu preisen’. My ‘worth a hundred verses’ is close to
that, though perhaps ‘praises, chants’ would be better.
Because of the lack of accent on asya, it should be pronominal, not adjectival;
I would adjust the tr. to “of him, the stalwart.”
### 3–4
As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 3 and 4 are responsive. The first pāda
of 4 concentrates the essence of the 1st two pādas of 3, substituting ví cakrame (of 3b)
for trír deváḥ (in 3a) at the beginning of the pāda. This phrase, trír deváḥ, is short a
syllable; Old suggests reading t·rir, but this seems unlikely: I don’t know of any
other disyllabic readings of this extremely common numeral (either as 1st cmpd
member tri- or adverbial trís). I suggest rather that the metrically disturbed opening
draws attention to the beginning of this set of paired vss. by being flawed and is
“repaired” by 4a. See similar remarks about 3c and 5c ad vs. 5.

### 4  
By concentrating Viṣṇu’s strides in the first pāda of 4, the poet is free to
express the aim of Viṣṇu’s action -- creating space and dwelling places for the people
-- in the rest of the vs.
As Ge points out (n. 4c), asya can refer either to Viṣṇu or to Manu, although
in actuality this may not matter. It may be an instance of “trickle-down” ownership:
Viṣṇu makes a dwelling place for Manu, and in turn Manu’s people also get firmly
planted. Or, Manu and the people may both be under Viṣṇu’s auspices.

### 5  
On the name Śipiviṣṭa, see comm. ad VII.99.4. Note that Viṣṇu’s name
was already celebrated in 3d, though the actual name is not mentioned there.
The syntactic affiliation of aryáḥ is disputed: the question is whether it
depends on vayúnāni or simply picks up te in the previous pāda. With Ge and Re I
follow the latter course; Re argues cogently that vayúna- √vid does not normally
have a “régime extérieur” (though I.72.7, II.19.3 appear to be exceptions). I would
131
131
further add that since Śipiviṣṭa seems a type of “secret name,” referring to Viṣṇu as a
stranger (arí-) might fit with that. By contrast Thieme construes aryáḥ with vayúnāni,
in two somewhat different ways: Fremdling (1938, p. 41) “… kennend die
Ordnungen, die für den Fremdling gelten,” later corrected in Unters. (1949, 22 n. 1)
to “… kennend die Geheimnisse des Fremden.”
The end of pāda c tavásam átavyān#, with the s-stem adj. followed by a
(negated) comparative to the same root, nicely echoes the end of 3c with the same
configuration but the comparative not negated: tavásas távīyāni. The employment of
longer and shorter forms of the comparative (i.e., with or without the linking vowel -
ī-) allows the phrases to make an almost exact metrical match -- except that the
cadence of 5c is faulty (... -sam átavyān), with a light syllable at the beginning (and
in fact 5 light syllables in a row (… -i tavásam a-), starting right before the caesura
and continuing through the break and into the cadence. As in the paired vss. 3–4 the
metrical disturbance may call attention to the formulaic match. átavyān also picks up
kīráyaḥ ‘(even) the weak’ in 4c semantically.
In d the pres. part. kṣáyantam is rendered by both Re and Th (Fremdl.) as if it
belongs to √kṣi ‘dwell’ (“qui résides” and “… [dich,] der da wohnt”), but the part. to
the root pres. of that root is kṣiyánt-; the part. here must belong to √kṣā ‘rule over’
(them. pres. kṣáyati). Ge may be trying to have it both ways with his “der … thront,”
if my German dictionaries are correct in glossing thronen as “sit enthroned.”

### 6  
Exactly what this vs. is trying to tell us is unclear. Most tr. and comm.
take paricákṣya- as referring to something blameworthy (tadelnswert); so, e.g., Ge
(“Was war an dir zu tadeln …?”), Old, KH (Injunc. 78–79). But the other example of
this gerundive in VI.52.14 modifies vácas- specifically and seems to mean ‘to be
disregarded, overlooked’: mā́vo vácāṃsi paricákṣyāṇi vocam “let me not speak
words to you that can be disregarded.” Esp. because the verb in the dependent cl.
belongs to √vac, pf. vavakṣé, it seems reasonable to supply ‘speech’ here as well.
The point seems to be that we should have paid attention when he called himself
Śipiviṣṭa, and that even when he appears in other form(s), he should not keep the
form of Śipiviṣṭa concealed from us, any more than we should not notice the name.
But what these statements are in service of, I have no idea -- and the hymn ends here
(save for the repeated vs. 7, which, however, makes a point of addressing Viṣṇu as
Śipiviṣṭa).

## 101
Parjanya

### 1  
As was noted in the publ. intro., this hymn has a penchant for triplets, but
it is not always clear which three entities are referred to -- as in this vs., at least for
me, with “the three speeches.” As Ge points out (n. 1a), the identities of the speeches
depends on the identity of the addressee of the impv. “speak forth” (prá vada). If it is
Parjanya, the dedicand of the hymn, they probably refer to thunder(claps) (so, e.g.,
Lü, Va 392 -- three because they sound in the three heavenly domains) or thunder,
lightning, and rain (so, e.g., Doniger 174). I am inclined to follow Lü but for reasons
132
132
differing from his. I suggest that this could be an early version of the triple utterance
“da da da” of Thunder in BĀU V.2, made famous in the West by T. S. Eliot in the
section of The Wasteland entitled “What the Thunder Said.” Note that in BĀU V.2.3
Thunder or the thundering one (stanayitnuḥ) is identified as daivī vāk (like the three
vā́c- here).
If the impv. is the self-address of the poet, it would refer probably to the three
types of ritual speech (ṛ́c-, sā́man-, yájus-), or, on the basis of VII.33.14 (which
contains prá vadāty ágre, similar to our prá vada [jyótir]agrā), solemn speech
(ukthá-), melody (sā́man-), and the sound of the pressing stone -- or, less likely in my
view, with Ge three dynamic levels of sound, soft, medium, loud. Needless to say,
both sets of referents may be meant. In the natural world interpr., the “light at the
front” would of course be lightning; in the ritual interpr. it would be the ritual fire.
The three speeches milk the udder of pāda b. Again the identities of the
referents of the udder and the liquid it produces depend on the referents in pāda a. In
the natural world interpr., the udder would be heaven or the clouds therein, the liquid
the rain; in the ritual the udder would probably be the soma plant and the liquid the
soma -- though the udder could possibly be the sacrifice as a whole and the good
things that result from its performance.
On vā́d- prá √vad see comm. ad VII.103.1.
In the publ. tr. of the 2nd hemistich it was not made clear which nouns go
together -- since Engl. lacks the convenient tool of case. The calf (vatsám) is the
same as the embryo of the plants (gárbham óṣadhīnām); both are objects of the
participle ‘creating’ (kṛṇván), whose subject is the bull (vṛṣabháḥ), which is also the
referent in the phrase “as soon as he is born” (sadyó jātáḥ) and the subj. of “sets to
bellowing” (roravīti). The calf, embryo of the plants, is most likely Agni, who is so
called elsewhere (see Ge n. 1c). Ge suggests that it is Agni as lightning, which is
possible, but I assume that lightning and the ritual fire are here assimilated, via a
trope whereby the sound of thunder, likened to ritual speech, kindles the ritual fire.
The bull is surely Parjanya, as is confirmed by the identical phraseology of vs. 2 of
the next, related hymn (VII.102.2): yó gárbham óṣadhīnām … kṛṇóti … / parjányaḥ.

### 2  
Multiple candidates have been suggested for the three lights of d, but it
should be pointed out that there is actually only one light (jyótiḥ), which has three
vartu-s (trivártu). Unfortunately this adj. is a hapax, but it is most likely related to the
better attested trivṛ́t-. For the relationship between these two and the uncertainty of
the root affiliation (√vṛt [which I favor] or √vṛ), see Scar (511). If the form does
belong with √vṛt we should properly expect *trivarttu, but of course rTT and rT
clusters can generally only be distinguished on etymological grounds (see AiG
I.112–14). As for our form, AiG II.2.663 (with lit.) suggests that trivár(t)u in this
passage is a nonce creation modeled on well-attested tridhā́tu found in the preceding
pāda (c).
In any case the triply layered shelter and triply turned light conform to the
triadic focus of this hymn; I’m not sure they need to be more specifically identified.
133

### 3  
As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. is full of gender ambiguity and gender
switching, in service of the Vedic love of paradox. Although the subject of the first
hemistich is surely Parjanya, he is not identified by name, and a masc. gender
pronoun only appears as the very last word of the half-vs. (… eṣáḥ) -- while the state
and activity ascribed to the subject of pāda a are quintessentially female.
In the 2nd hemistich the referents probably align well with the implied genders,
unlike pāda a: by most interpr. the mother is Earth, the father is Heaven, as usual.
But the action, at least in pāda c, is paradoxical, since it is the “milk” (páyaḥ) of the
father that the mother accepts. This milk is of course a metaphor for rain. In d it is
said that both the father and son grow strong on it, another apparent paradox.
Assuming that the father is Heaven, this is probably an early ref. to the water cycle:
rain produces plants, which ultimately produce the offerings sent to heaven via the
smoke of sacrifice, swelling the clouds that then again produce rain. By most
accounts the “son” who is also strengthened in d refers to mankind, the offspring of
the earth.

### 4  
This extravagant claim of Parjanya’s cosmic centrality -- all creatures, the
three heavens, and the waters all take him as their basis -- must derive from his
control of the rain, as the second hemistich suggests and 5cd further develops. The vs.
is also made up of pādas with either exact (a, d) or near repetitions (b, c) elsewhere
in the RV (see Ge’s nn. 4a, 4c, 4d and for pāda b partial reps. in I.35.6, VII.87.5;
VII.90.4, X.111.8), which may account for the generic impression it gives.

### 5  
The subjunctive jujoṣat in b would fit the context better with a modal
reading (“let him enjoy it / may he enjoy it”), surrounded as it is by impvs. (astu b,
santu c) -- though the standard rendering of the subjunctive, as given in the publ. tr.,
is certainly not excluded.

### 6  
With Lü (506), I take the first hemistich as a truth-formulation, summarily
referred to by tád ṛtaṃ “this truth” beginning c.

## 102
Parjanya
Although the Anukr. identifies the meter of vs. 2 as Pādanicṛṭ (7 7 / 7), it is
clearly a Gāyatrī like the other two vss., with distraction of the gen. pl. ending -nãm
at the end of pādas a, c.

### 2  
This vs. consists only of a rel. cl; it could be attached either to vs. 1 or to
vs. 3, both of which have pronouns in pādas adjacent to vs. 2 that could serve as
referent (sá 1c, tásmai 3a). I prefer attaching it to vs. 3, since this configuration
would fit the standard model of definitional relative clause / ritually based main
clause.
On gárbham óṣadhīnām see VII.101.1c and comm. thereon.

## 103
Frogs
134
134
My interpr. of this hymn relies on the treatment of it in my 1993 article “Natural
History Notes on the Rigvedic 'Frog' Hymn,” Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute 72-73 (1991-92 [1993]) [=Amṛtamahotsava Volume, for 75th
anniversary of the BORI], pp. 137–44. Since this article is not universally accessible,
I will reproduce much of the commentary here (without particular ref. to pg. nos. or
to the sec. lit. that is excerpted there). The hymn is one of the most popular in the RV
and has been constantly tr. -- e.g., besides the usual, Macdonell (VRS and Hymns …),
Renou (Hymnes spéculatifs), Thieme (Gedichte), Maurer, Doniger.

### 1  
This first vs. is in Anuṣṭubh, as opposed to the rest of the hymn, which is
Triṣṭubh, and it reads like a scene-setting introduction. Old suggests that it’s an
addition.
The natural history phenomenon corresponding to the “year-long vow”
(saṃvatsarám … vrata-[cāríṇaḥ]) undertaken by the frogs is surely estivation, as
was already suggested by H. H. Bender in 1917 (“On the Naturalistic Background of
the ‘Frog-Hymn,’ RV VII. 103,” JAOS 37: 186–91). The rains (here embodied in
Parjanya) trigger the emergence of the frogs, in a frenzy to mate—what is known as
“explosive breeding.” A loud chorus of male vocalizations attends the mating, calling
females to the breeding place.
The pf. of √śi ‘lie’ is represented in Vedic only by the med. part. śasayāná-,
found twice in the RV (also V.78.9). It has full-grade for expected zero-grade in the
root syllable, matching the full-grade forms of the archaic root pres. śáye, part.
śáyāna-.
The presence of the stem brāhmaṇá- is of course a sign of the lateness of this
hymn, since it is restricted to only the latest layer of the RV.
I now think the phrase brāhmaṇā́vratacāríṇaḥ “(like) brahmins following their
commandment” may be a sly reference to brahmacárya- (first found in the AV, but
cf. brahmacārín- in late RV X.109.5), which refers not only to the studentship phase
of life stages, but also, specifically, to celibacy. The frogs, by virtue of their
estivating state of suspended animation, have perforce been celibate, but they now go
about energetically remedying the situation.
The phrase vā́cam … prá √vad is reminiscent of nearby VII.101.1 tisró vā́caḥ
prá vada in a hymn to Parjanya, who is the instigator of the frogs’ speech here.

### 2  
The comparison of the estivating frog to a “dried-out leather bag” (dṛ́tiṃ
ná śúṣkam) may reflect a natural phenomenon: a 1932 “Notes on Indian Batrachians”
by one C. McCann in the Bombay Journal of Natural History recounts an experiment
undertaken by him that involved depriving frogs of water until they became shrunken
and dried out like pieces of wood and then rehydrating them, at which point they
began behaving normally.
It is difficult to interpr. sarasī́as anything but a loc., but its morphology is a
bit problematic. To the well-attested -s-stem sáras- ‘pond’, the loc. sg. is the
expected sárasi (IX.97.52), but our form not only shows an unusual ending with a
long ī, but it also bears the accent. No other forms to a putative stem sarasī́- (so Gr,
135
135
etc.) are found. Wackernagel-Debrunner (AiG II.1.306; II.2.384) also posit a sarasī́-
stem, a vṛkī-type fem. with collective meaning, with loc. sg. in -ī́(AiG III.170; see
also Lanman, Noun Inflection, 389), by way of a contraction of *sarasí
y
-i. Though
vṛkī́-loc. sgs. are rare, see nadī́(I.135.9) and gaurī́(IX.12.3) to better established
vṛkī́-stems. On balance, it seems best to posit a stem sarasī́- with Gr, Lanman, Old,
Wackernagel-Debrunner, etc., but I do so reluctantly because of its extreme isolation
and the widespread attestation of the -as-stem sáras-.

### 3  
This vs. contains the famous hapax akhkhalīkṛ́tya with the otherwise nonoccurring (in Skt.) cluster -khkh-. The word was brilliantly explained by Thieme (KZ
[1951] 109 = KlSch 138). He sees it as the first attested cvi formation in Sanskrit.
The base noun is akṣára- ‘syllable’, and the sense would be ‘making syllables’ -- a
reference to the Indian pedagogical technique, still in use today in traditional
instruction, of students repeating the text after the teacher, syllable by syllable, word
by word. Here the teacher would be the father, as was most likely the original
situation -- hence pitáraṃ ná putráḥ “like a son to his father.” Since even in RVic
times the language used in instructing young boys would surely have been an early
form of Middle Indo-Aryan, it would not be surprising that this technical pedagogical
term should appear in MIA garb: akṣára should yield *akkhara- in early MIA -- and
in fact does; cf. Pāli akkhara-. This has simply been transformed into the more
“froggy” sounding *akhkhara- à akhkharī- in the cvi formation. This onomatopoetic
rendering of a frog call is worthy to take its place beside the better known imitation
in Aristophanes’s brekekekex koax koax. In fact, because the word does double duty
in this passage -- imitating frog vocalizations directly, while implicitly comparing the
frog chorus to the call-and-response style of childhood instruction -- our word seems
even more ingenious and well chosen than the Greek. And it is quite striking that
both the Greek and the Sanskrit immediately convince as froggy, though they are
phonologically very distant from each other.

### 4  
The verb in the first pāda, ánu gṛbhṇāti, is generally rendered with an
anodyne ‘greet’ (Macdonell, Maurer, Doniger; sim. Re ‘salue’), ‘support’
(unterstützt, Ge), or is given a specifically ritual interpr. (Thieme, Gedichte). But the
lexeme has a straightforward literal sense ‘grasp in following, grasp from behind’,
and this literal meaning exactly describes the posture of frog mating (“amplexus”),
with the male grasping the female around her middle with his forefeet (sometimes
facilitated by so-called “nuptial pads” developed during the mating season). Since
once achieved, this posture is held for long periods—hours, days, even weeks or
months—it would be visually salient to any Vedic bard outdoors during the rainy
season, which is also the frog mating season. The only potential problem with my
interpr. is that the obj. of the verb is masc. anyám. However, the expression here
anyó anyám “the one … the other” is already stereotypical in the RV for any mutual
activity and will soon be frozen as the adverb anyonyam ‘mutually’. Moreover it is
not impossible that the original text had a fem. *anyā́m (anyó *anyā́m ánu gṛbhṇāti
enoḥ): four-syllable openings almost always have a heavy fourth syllable (see Arnold,
136
136
188), whereas the transmitted text has a light one. Thus *anyā́m could have been
changed redactionally to anyám on the basis of the later adverb.
Note the phonetic echo … ámandiṣātām / maṇḍū́kaḥ.
The intens. kániṣkan in c, ‘hopped and hopped, continually hopped’, is a nice
description of the apparently random and chaotic “scramble competition” of male
frogs seeking partners.

### 5  
The pedagogical model seen in vs. 3 is made more explicit here: the
repetition of one frog’s call by another is likened to that of a pupil and his teacher
(śāktásyeva … śikṣamāṇaḥ).
With Maurer, I take sárvam … párva as referring to a group of frogs, not to
the section of a lesson with most others.

### 6  
This vs. reflects the natural fact that different frogs have different cries,
which allow the females to differentiate conspecific males from those unsuitable for
their mating.
### 7–9
With the behavioral model of the frogs established in the first 6 vss., the
next three treat the ritual application of this model.

### 7  
The first ritual application is that of the Atirātra or “Overnight” soma
ritual. Frogs are generally nocturnal; they are active during the day only if the
weather is rainy or very humid. So, the first signal to humans of the frogs’
emergence from estivation would be the sound of the nocturnal frog chorus when the
rain supplied them with the impetus to emerge. Hence they are compared to
brahmins at an Overnight ritual speaking around a soma vessel configured as a pond.
The similes are complexly intertwined: the frogs are compared to brahmins, but
those hypothetical brahmins are then implicitly compared to frogs around a pond – in

But as the day dawns, the frogs become visible, with their drive to mate
overriding any instinct to flee or conceal themselves. This visibility is insistently
conveyed by “[they] become visible; none are hidden” (āvír bhavanti gúhyā ná ké cit).
The frogs are compared to two different kinds of priests: brahmins (7a, 8a), who are
here responsible for ritual speech, and Adhvaryus (8c), the priests who do the
physical labor in Vedic ritual. They are “sweating” (siṣvidānā́ḥ): sweat is a sign of
hard ritual labor in Indo-Iranian religious terminology (see my 2011 [2015] “Avestan
xšuuīd: A Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 25:
19–29). Here, once again the image does double duty -- the frogs would be covered
with water drops from the rains, but they are also compared to the hard-working
priests officiating at the Pravargya ritual. The Pravargya is an especially sweatinducing ritual, since it involves a hot milk drink (gharmá-), which must be tended as
it is heated over the fire. Other features of the Pravargya conform to aspects of the
hymn: there is a year-long dīkṣā (period of consecration for the sacrificer), reflected
137
137
in both 1a (saṃvatsaráṃ śaśayānā́ḥ “lying for a year”) and 8b (bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ
parivatsarī́ṇam “creating their yearly sacred formulation”); this dīkṣā involves a
taboo on water or moisture of any kind. But the most crucial intersection between the
Pravargya and frog behavior is found in the next vs.
Note in passing the non-etym. figure vā́cam akrata bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ with
two forms of √kṛ governing two words for speech, with the subject, brāhmaṇā́saḥ in
a derivational relationship to the 2nd form of speech.

### 9  
The year-long preparation for the Pravargya rite is again emphasized here
in the first three pādas.
In b the ná is potentially ambiguous. The first reading is no doubt the
negative: the ritualists/frogs do not fail to observe the proper ritual calendar. The VP
ná (…) (prá) minanti is quite common (e.g., II.24.12, III.28.4, X.10.5). But ná could
also be a simile marker in the phrase náro ná, for, after all, the subjects are frogs,
compared to men. Since ná occupies the fifth syllable of the pāda, either reading is
compatible with its position: an early caesura, followed by ná, for the negative
reading; a late caesura, preceded by ná, for the simile.
The final pāda of the vs. is the ritual climax: the gharmá-drinks, heated on the
fire, bubble up and overflow their vessel, as milk does when it’s been left too long on
the stove. The “obtain their own release” (aśnuvate visargám, note the middle verb),
a phrase rendered rather generically by many tr. (e.g., Doniger “the hot fires come to
an end”; Maurer “the heated receptacles get emptied out”), is in my view a rendering
of the dramatic moment when the bubbling mass boils over. I further suggest that its
analogue in the natural world is the female frog’s release of her masses of eggs (up to
2000+ in some species), which are fertilized by the male as they are released – which
must be a visually striking event. It may also refer to the practice of some frogs of
making a “foam nest” in which to deposit the eggs, liquid albumen whipped up by
the frog’s hind legs into a “dense light foam” -- a process that also might appear like
milk boiling over.

### 10  
The frogs’ release and fertilization of masses of eggs in the preceding vs.
serves as a model for the fertility and increase of the ritualists that are major aims in
Vedic rituals. This is surely the sense conveyed by the final vs. of the hymn,
describing various types of frogs as “giving” goods and hundreds of cows to us, as
well as lengthening both their and our lifetimes. They do so “at a pressing of
thousands,” which can literally refer to the release of the frogs’ eggs. The prodigious
fertility of frogs (no matter what happens subsequent to the thousands of eggs
produced) is an encouragement to our own..
The publ. tr. renders prá tiranta ā́yuḥ as “they lengthened (their / our) life.”
But the verb is of course tirante, a present indic., out of sandhi and the tr. should be
corrected to “lengthen.”

Multiple divinities, to destroy demons and ward off evil

See the publ. intro. for an intro. to this complex composite hymn and its parts.
Complete translations are given by Norman Brown (“The Rigvedic Equivalent for
Hell,” JAOS 61 [1941]: 76–80) and Herman Lommel (“Vasiṣṭha und Viśvāmitra,”
Oriens 18-19 [1965/66]: 200–27), as well as Doniger.

### 1  
The verse contains a remarkable eight verbs of violence, with three in the
last pāda alone -- all quite different.

### 2  
The syntactic function of aghám in pāda a is ambig. It could be an acc. sg.
masc. parallel to agháśaṃsam, the object of yayastu. So Wh (tr. of AV VIII.4.2)
“against the evil plotter, the evil …” The pāda break following it might support this
reading. However, it can also be a neut. sg., modifying tápuḥ and therefore the
subject of yayastu, as in the publ. tr., flg. Ge, followed also by most subsequent tr.
Ge’s cited parallel, VI.62.8, where tápur aghám belong together, seems decisive here.
See also V.3.7, where aghám is used as a weapon against an agháśaṃsa-: ádhī́d
aghám agháśaṃse dadhāta “set evil upon him, the speaker of evil.”
The simile particle iva in the simile carúr agnivā́m̐iva is postposed, but such
late placement of simile markers is not uncommon in the RV.
The hapax anavāyá- is unclear. Old approvingly cites Bergaigne’s gloss
‘qu'on ne peut détourner par des supplications’, and this interpr. seems to inform
most subsequent tr., including mine. But this interpr. should rest on the lexeme now
understood to be áva √yā ‘appease’, and I do not see how the morphology would
work. √yā has a zero-grade ī, but no ay- forms -- but (an-)avāya- can only be broken
down into ava+ay-a, containing no elements of √yā/ī. AiG fails to treat this form. Re
(EVP XVI.114) tries briefly to get it from áva √ī, but decides that áva √i is “simpler.”
This is certainly the case morphologically, but the semantics are harder: áva is not a
particularly common preverb with √i and when it appears, the lexeme generally
means ‘go down’ (with ‘down’ the physical direction), occasionally more generally
‘go away’. Re cites V.49.5 ávaitu ábhvam, claiming that the verb there means
‘céder’, thus allowing our form to means ‘qui ne cède pas’. But I do not see a ‘cede’
sense in that passage, just ‘go away’. This is, in fact, the interpr. found in RIVELEX
(I.181), which glosses the stem anavāyá- as ‘nicht weggehend’ -- ‘not going away’
(metaphorically ‘nicht vergehend, verbleibend’, 181 n. 1) and analyses as a
“Verbales Rektionskompositum/Dete<r>minativkompositum” an- + avāya-
‘weggehend’ (< áva + √ay1
-). This must be the correct analysis, though I am sorry to
abandon the richer semantics of a derivation from áva √yā. My publ. tr. ‘unrelenting’
can still probably stand, as a strengthened expression of ‘not going away’. (Note in
passing that RIVELEX I.394 [s.v. ay1
-] glosses verbal forms of áva + this root as
‘herabsteigen; Abbitte leisten — descend; apologize’; the second terms of the
German and English glosses must result from confusion with áva √yā / ī and should
be stricken.)
The rendering ‘worm-eater’ for kimīdín- here and in the following vs., as well
as in X.87.24, is based on a suggestion of Schindler and Werba recorded in EWA s.v.
and also entertained by Scar (41). Note that in X.87.24 it is associated with
139
139
yātudhā́na- ‘sorcerer’, which stem figures prominently later in our hymn as well as
in other parts of X.87.

### 3  
The first hemistich of this vs. contains 2 locative phrases, vavré antár (a)
and anārambhaṇé támasi (b). Essentially all tr. are agreed that the two phrases are
parallel and refer to the same place -- and this is reasonable and probably would be
the default reading. This interpr. in turn leads some (see esp. Norman Brown and
Oberlies I.473) to take this as a description of Hell, or the RV equivalent thereof. My
interpr. is syntactically bolder, and perhaps less well supported, but it arises from my
discomfort with equating the enclosed space denoted by vavrá- (which is several
times used of the Vala cave, e.g., IV.1.13, V.31.3) with “ungraspable darkness.”
Because these locales seem incompatible, I take vavré antár as referring to the place
where the evil-doers are hiding / taking refuge, and the action enjoined on Indra and
Soma in b is to roust them from this hole and thrust them into a dark void with no
handhold, the very opposite of an enclosure. A similar use of vavré antár as a place
from which creatures are ejected is found in the account of the Vala myth in V.31.3
prā́codayat sudúghā vavré antár “(Indra) impelled forth the good milkers (who were)
within the cave.” The action there is of course benign, but the loc. phrase also refers
to the original location of the cows, not their destination. I must confess, however,
that vs. 17 in our hymn, with the phrase vavrā́m̐anantā́n “holes without end” into
which the villainess is to fall, does give me pause. (On the other hand, vs. 17 is in a
portion that was probably a late addition to the hymn; see publ. intro.)

### 4  
The lexeme úd √takṣ (lit. ‘fashion up’) that opens the 2nd hemistich occurs
only here in the RV, and at least acdg. to Monier Wms nowhere else in Skt.; it was
clearly artificially generated to contrast with the verb nijū́rvathaḥ (‘grind down’) at
the end of the hemistich, to highlight the úd ‘up’ / ní ‘down’ contrast.

### 5  
párśāna- occurs only 3x in the RV (and nowhere else in Skt.), here and in
VIII.7.34, VIII.45.41. It has no good etymology (see EWA s.v.). The sense of ‘deep
place, chasm’ is thus entirely dependent on context. Such a meaning is compatible
with all three passages; the strongest support for it is VIII.7.34 giráyaś cin ní jihate
párśānāso mányamānāḥ “Even the peaks bend down, thinking themselves depths.”
Parallel locatives in VIII.45.41 make it likely that it refers to a place, but not what
sort of place it might be: yád vīḷā́v indra yát sthire, yát párśāne párābhṛtam “What is
in a firm place, what in a solid place, Indra, what has been borne away (in)to a
párśāna ....” In our passage the ní ‘down’ does suggest that the destination is a depth,
but I also think that this interpr. has been somewhat uncritically embraced by those
with preconceptions about the Vedic hell/underworld.
nisvarám ‘in silence, to silence’ contrasts with svaryà- ‘reverberant’, used of
the weapon in 4c.

### 6  
As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. closes the first section of the hymn, at
least as I understand the structure.
140
140
The preverb pári appears with √hi ‘impel’ only here in the RV (and, acdg. to
Mon Wms., all of Skt.). It seems to have been suggested by the pári in pāda a,
construed with √bhū, in the meaning ‘encircle’. The idiom pari √hi ‘impel around’
does not make much sense, unless the image is of hótrā- compared to horses made to
circle a race track. Re thinks rather that it reprises pári bhūtu in a: “l’offrande que (je
ceins) autour (de vous en la) poussant” -- but this seems more trouble than it’s worth:
he is forced to supply the crucial verb (je ceins: ‘gird, buckle on’) while relegating
the actual verb stem hinomi to a participial adjunct (“en … poussant”).
hótrā- is of course completely -- and not very interestingly -- ambiguous
between ‘libation’ and ‘invocation’.
In the last pāda Indra and Soma are compared to nṛpátī. Some interpr. (Brown,
Doniger) take this as a ref. to the Aśvins, and it is true that the other three occurences
of this dual refer to the Aśvins (VII.67.1, 71.4, X.106.4), as duals often do. However,
I think it’s more interesting to assume that the poet is comparing these two great gods
to human ‘lords of men = kings’, a sly switching of the hierarchy of roles. (Of course
he just compared the gods to horses, so being compared to humans may be a step up.)
I think Ge is correct in his interpr. of this simile: the gods should encourage our
poetic formulations in the way that human kings do, by providing us with material
goods. If nṛpátī = Aśvins, the simile doesn’t work.

### 7  
See publ. intro. for the init. práti here echoed by that beginning 11c and
forming a ring defining vss. 7–11 as a subsection. Since práti ‘against’ is not
otherwise found with √smṛ (or with √śuṣ, see vs. 11), I think the preverb has been
stationed at both ends of this section to focus attention on the targeted victim. See
disc. in publ. intro.
The NP rakṣáso bhaṅgurā́vataḥ is entirely ambiguous between gen./abl. sg.
and acc. pl. It is almost universally taken as acc. pl. here, as parallel obj. to druháḥ
‘deceits’, but I prefer gen. sg. for several reasons. For one thing “deceits (and)
demons” is a somewhat off-balance coordination (though certainly not impossible in
RVic discourse). More important, the second hemistich defines a single enemy who
shows hostility “with his deceit” (druhā́); it makes sense to identify this single foe as
the singular demon of pāda b, who owns the deceits mentioned there. In favor of the
acc. pl. interpr., in X.76.4 (cited by Ge, n. 7b; cf. also X.87.23) the same phrase must
be acc. pl. obj. of a form of √han, as here: X.76.4a ápa hata rakṣáso bhaṅgurā́vataḥ.
On the other hand, in IX.71.1 (also cited by Ge) in the two-word sequence druhó
rakṣásaḥ, which we also find here, druháḥ is an acc. pl. (as here), obj. of the verb véti,
but rakṣásaḥ belongs to a different syntagm and is abl. sg., construed with pāti
“protects from the demon.” The point of citing all these parallel passages is to
demonstrate that even identical word sequences can function differently syntactically
in different contexts: the poets were not locked into a morphological template.
The poss. adj. bhaṅgurā́-vant- (to bhaṅgurá- [AiG II.2.487], to √bhañj
‘break’; see EWA s.v. BHAÑJ) modifies rakṣás- 3x and hantár- once. I choose to
render its possessive morphology by tr. ‘with his wreckage’ (lit. ‘having breakage,
wreckage’), referring to the damage that a demon brings in his train -- in contrast to
141
141
looser and more colorful tr. like Brown’s (reproduced almost verbatim by Doniger):
“Slay those who employ demons, who hate us, who would break us to bits,” where
he manages to turn both the root noun druh- and the poss. adj. bhaṅgurā́vant- into
verbs qualifying rakṣásaḥ. Others attenuate the meaning of bhaṅgurā́vant- to
‘crooked’, and then by easy metaphorical extension ‘tricky, malicious’ (see Gr’s
‘tückisch, trügerisch’, also EWA’s ‘trügerisch, mit krummen Wegen’; Ge, Lommel,
Lü 419 ‘hinterlistig’). This interpr. is based on the second of BR’s glosses of the base
adj. bhaṅgura- 1) zerbrechlich, vergänglich, 2) krumm, kraus, gerunzelt; see Gr’s
reproduction of the 1st word of each in his gloss of (bhaṅgurá). This base word is not
found in Vedic -- and bhaṅgurā́vant- is found outside the RV only in passages based
on RVic passages -- though bhaṅgura is fairly widespread in Classical Skt., where it
generally means ‘breakable’, but occasionally ‘curved’ esp. in connection with
eyebrows (cf. AiG III.195 in addition to BR s.v.). Since the ‘curved, crooked’ sense
seems to be a late and specialized development, I see no reason to impose it on this
RVic word, esp. since I see no clear line from ‘break’ to ‘be crooked’ except in such
a specialized application.

### 8  
The lexeme abhí √cakṣ here seems almost a substitute for abhí √car
‘conjure against’, and note that the object (“me”) is qualified by the part. cárantam.
Re notes that this is the only RVic pejorative ex. of well-attested abhí √cakṣ, which
generally means ‘look upon, look towards, oversee’ in neutral or positive sense. It is
notable that in our passage the action of this visual idiom is accomplished by verbal
means (“untruthful words” ánṛtebhir vácobhiḥ). Re remarks that it coincides “avec le
passage de «voir» à «dire»” -- without specifying what he means.

### 9  
The hapax pāka-śaṃsá- is taken by some as a bahuvrīhi (implicitly, Gr
‘arglos redend’; cf. Whitney [AV VIII.4.9] “him of simple intent,” Brown “him of
pure and single heart,” Doniger “the man of pure heart” [with śaṃsa- = ‘heart’?!]),
but by accent it should be a determinative cmpd, contrasting explicitly with the
bahuvrīhi aghá-śaṃsa- ‘having evil speech’ with 1st member accent, found in vss. 2
and 4. It is surely my guileless speech that is in question, since I was “acting with
guileless mind” (mā pā́kena mánasā cárantam) in the immediately preceding vs (8a).
As Re points out, ví √hṛ probably refers to distortion of ritual speech.
Since pāka-śaṃsá- is a thing, not a person, the parallel bhadrám in b should
also likewise be a thing (so Ge, Whitney, Lommel, Brown), not, as the publ. tr. (“an
auspicious one”) has it, a person. I would thus take the form as a neut. acc. sg., not a
masc. and slightly emend the publ. tr. to “something auspicious.” This something is
probably also connected with ritual performance.

### 10  
I take ní … hīyatām as belonging to √hā ‘change position’; in most
passages ní √hā means ‘bend down’ (e.g., VIII.27.2), but here and in VI.52.1, also a
curse, I take the passive as ‘be bent double’. Most tr. are unsatisfyingly generic
(‘perish’ and the like).
142
142

### 11  
See disc. in publ. intro. and ad vs. 7 on the use of práti to define this
section of the hymn and call attention to the victim. As noted ad vs. 7, práti √śuṣ is
found only here.

### 12  
The prim. comp. ṛ́jīyas- here (=AVŚ VIII.4.12; also in AVŚ V.14.12), to
ṛjú- ‘straight’, should of course have a full-grade root syllable *rájīyas-, like the
superlative rájiṣṭha (RV 7x, = Aves. razišta-). Re plausibly suggests that it has
adopted the root syllable of the base adjective -- though why other primary
comparatives and superlatives tolerate root ablaut is not addressed. It’s worth noting
that if we were to restore the expected form, it would fix a problematic cadence
(yatarád *rájīyaḥ ß ṛ́jīyaḥ), by producing a heavy syllable four syllables from the
end. As it is, the cadence is ⏑ ⏑ – ×, rather than expected – ⏑ – ×. I am reluctant to
emend, however, since it is not clear how the erroneous zero-grade would have been
introduced.

### 13  
Most interpr. (Ge, Oberlies [Rel. RV I.441], Re, Doniger, Wh [AV]),
take kṣatríyam here as masc. personal ‘ruler’, modified by the part. dhāráyantam,
while I take it as neut. ‘rule’ (as it sometimes is; cf. IV.20.3, V.69.1) and the obj. of
the participle. The problem with the standard interpr. is that the part. has nothing to
govern, and in fact a number of interpr. supply a second kṣatríyam (or kṣatrám; see
Re) to occupy that role. Cf., e.g., Ge “… den Herrscher, der fälschlich (die
Herrschaft) führt.” However, Lü (419), Lommel, and Brown interpr. as I do.

### 14  
The disjunctive “if” clauses that occupy the first hemistich are more
complicated than they first appear. In the publ. tr. I took the first half, yádi vāhám
ánṛtadeva ā́sa, as a contrary-to-fact expression “if I were …” The general context
speaks in favor of this interpr.: in the 2nd hemistich the speaker asks indignantly why
Agni is angry at him, so the implication is that the speaker has not done what would
occasion such anger. This assumption presumably accounts for Ge’s tr. “als ob …”
(fld. by Lommel), which is strenuously disputed by Old. But the grammar makes
problems: the indicative perfect ā́sa should not express contrary-to-fact modality, but
a fact in the past (that may or may not have present relevance). For contrary-to-facts
of this sort, the pres. opt. usually serves; cf. VII.44.23 yád agne syā́m aháṃ tváṃ,
tváṃ vā ghā syā́ahám “If I were you, Agni, or you were me …” Note also that the
AV version has an indicative present, ásmi (Wh “If I am one of false gods …”). So
we must reckon with the real possibility that “I” did have false gods, at least in the
past, and I would slightly alter the tr. to “If I was (previously) a man with false gods
…”
The parallel verb in b is the perfect apy ūhé. In the publ. tr. I take this as
presential -- and this is quite possible, since the other forms of this pf. are so used
(see Kü 489–90) -- but Kü takes it as preterital, and, given my slight reinterpr. of
pāda a, this might be best: “if I called upon …” Kü accepts Insler’s 1996 positing of
a root √vāh ‘respect’ separate both from √vah ‘convey’ and from √ūh ‘laud’ (which
latter has a full-gr. root med. pres. à them. pres. óh(a)-). I am not convinced of the
143
143
need for this separate root and would simply group the pf. ūhé with the pres. of √ūh,
despite Kü’s argument that unless the pf. is clearly distinguished from the pres. by
meaning or function, they should not belong to the same root.
What exactly this pāda is conveying is not clear. Did the speaker call upon the
true gods but in a false (that is, ritually faulty or with false intent or a false heart?)
way? Such is the interpr. of most comm. -- e.g., Ge “nur zum Schein” -- but Lü (420)
suggests equating mógham and devā́n (“oder wenn ich das Falsche als Götter …
auffasste ...”), though he also gives the alternate “in falscher Weise.” And Re is more
radical in his interpr. of the verb: “si j'ai une compréhension (fausse des) dieux.”
Given the appearance of the same adverb mógham in 15d, with the sense of false
speech, the standard interpr. of the occurrence in this vs. seems the correct one, esp.
as it contrasts nicely with the false or untrue gods in pāda a.
The question in d is where to construe te. Ge (fld. by Scar 469, but with ?)
takes it as a quasi-agent: “Die Falschredenden sollen dem Tode durch dich verfallen.”
Given that te is an enclitic and that the verb is not passive, this seems a stronger
statement than the text would seem to support. I take te with the drogha- of the cmpd
drogha-vā́c- “deceitful to you,” but I admit that it might rather go with nirṛthám
“your dissolution” (so Brown, Doniger “your destruction”; sim. Lü) -- that is,
dissolution stemming from you. Not all tr. render the te: it is absent from Lommel’s
rendering.

### 15  
I use the standard English rendering of yātudhā́na- (with cognates well
attested also in Old and Middle Iranian) as ‘sorcerer’ (German Zauberer), without
any implications about what practices this figure might engage in. Since in the RV
the word is found only in “popular” discourse, he presumably doesn’t work his ill
through orthodox ritual means.

### 17  
The standard rendering of khargálā- is ‘owl’; see, inter alia, Gr, EWA,
and the various tr. of this vs. But I find this unlikely for several reasons. The ‘owl’ is
found as úlūka- in 22a, so it is already represented in this sequence of vss. But,
though one could argue that there are numerous types of owls, which could have
different designations, there are other arguments against this identification. For one
thing, if the word is onomatopoetic, as EWA suggests, kharg(a) is not a particularly
owl-ish sound. I tentatively suggest the nightjar. A number of species of nightjars are
found in the proper geographical area. As for behavior and appearance, judging from
information aggregated from the internet, nightjars are nocturnal (“goes forth by
night” prá … jígāti … náktam), feeding esp. at the twilights; the sexes are similar,
and the birds are small and therefore could be considered typically female (hence the
fem. khargálā-). They stay hidden on the ground by day (“concealing her own body
by deceit” ápa druhā́tanvàṃ gū́hamānā): images on the internet show them visually
almost indistinguishable from the ground and one YouTube video is entitled “Indian
Nightjar -- Master of Camouflage”; acdg. to Wikipedia “During the day, the Indian
nightjar lies still on the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is then difficult to detect,
blending in with the soil.” Moreover, their cries are much easier to connect with
144
144
kharg(a) than an owl’s, being described as “a continuous churring” (the internet
provides numerous recordings of various types of nightjars). Note that
etymologically the “-jar” of nightjar is derived from its churring song -- and jar and
kharg are reasonably close phonetically. Moreover, their genus name is Caprimulgus
“goat-sucker,” based on the old belief that the birds suck milk from goats; if a similar
belief was also found in India, it might seem to be the habit of a sinister or at least
uncanny creature -- accounting for its inclusion here among the sorcerers in animal
form.
The ability of the soma-pressing stones to smash demons, referred to in d, is
also found in the pressing stone hymn X.76.4 ápa hata rakṣáso bhaṅgurā́vataḥ
“Smash away the demons with their wreckage,” which incidentally contains one of
the three other occurrences of bhaṅgurā́vant- in the RV, besides the one in vs. 7
above. The demon-destroying ability of ritual implements, especially the noise made
by their clashing, also reminds me of “Manu’s Cups,” whose clattering destroys
Asuras. See the various Vedic prose versions of this in my Sacrificed Wife, pp. 21–
26.

### 18  
I am not entirely certain why it is the Maruts who are tasked with the
destruction of these creatures, though it is probably because the demons in question
have taken the form of birds and therefore are moving in the midspace, which is the
Maruts’ domain. Re also cites the well-known relationship between the Maruts and
the víś- (see vikṣú here), and these animal demons may be associated with the “folk.”
The root noun ríp- is otherwise used of cheats and swindles (cf. also ripú-
‘cheating, swindler’), and I am reluctant to allow a sense ‘defilements’ only here --
though it is the almost universal solution of other tr. (Wh, Brown, Klein [DGRV II.149: “impurities”], Lommel “Unsauberes,” but cf. Ge’s “Unredlichkeit”
[dishonesty], which has a moral nuance). Deception and cheating are also
characteristic of the animal-demons in this section: see the khargálā who conceals
her own body “with deceit” (druhā́) in 17b, the flying dog-sorcerers that want to
deceive Indra in 20b, and the oblation-stealers in 21b -- so the standard sense of rípfits the larger context. However, I do have to acknowledge that the root √rip does
mean ‘smear’, and so ‘defilement’ is not out of the question.
It is difficult to avoid taking devé here as an adjective ‘divine’, modifying
adhvaré ‘ceremony’, a temptation that all tr. (including me) have succumbed to and
that is endorsed by Old.

### 19  
The “mountain” with which Indra smites the demons must be Indra’s
vájra- ‘mace’, identified with a mountain elsewhere, as Re points out: in VII.22.6, as
well as in the curious dvandva indrā-parvatā (3x, only in voc.: I.122.3, 132.6,
III.53.1). See comm. ad locc.

### 21  
I have rendered the impf. abhavat in pāda a as an immediate past (‘has
become’), though this is not ordinarily a usage of the impf. But this sense fits the
context better than a simple past.
145
145
Note the echo of parāśaró in paraśúr in c.
As Re remarks, this is the only negative use of the desid. vívāsa- (√van ‘win’),
usually ‘seek to win, covet, coax’. The negative sense must be attributable to the
confrontational preverb abhí.
How to distribute and construe the two similes in cd is the question. I take
both similes, paraśúr yáthā vánam “like an axe a tree” (c) and pā́treva “like pots” (d),
with the pres. part. bhindán (d) in two slightly different senses, ‘splitting’ and
‘breaking’ respectively (sim. Brown, Doniger). This pres. part. is anticipated by the
preverb complex abhī́d that opens the hemistich, looking like an aberrant form of
√bhid -- a low-level ex. of poetic repair. Others (notably Ge, Wh, Lommel) take
bhindán only with the 2nd simile, with the first controlled by eti in d (e.g., Ge “Śakra
fährt auf die Dunkelmänner los wie die Axt in den Baum”). But axes are more likely
to “split” than to “advance,” and I take eti only with the acc. pl. (satáḥ …) rakṣásaḥ
as goal. It would also be possible to take bhindán + eti as a verb phrase with auxiliary,
‘keeps splitting’ or the like.
The function, and indeed the morphological identity, of satáḥ is unclear. With
Gr, I take it as a pres. part. to √as in the acc. pl., modifying rakṣásaḥ. In my interpr.
it means ‘real, really being X’, though that could extend to ‘really present’. Re by
contrast suggests that it’s an adverb, meaning here ‘tout à fait’, also probably found
as 1st cmpd. member in sató-mahant- (‘entirely great’ VIII.30.1) and sató-vīra-
(‘entirely heroic’ VI.75.9). Although Re does not pronounce on the morphological
analysis, AiG II.1.237 implies that it contains the adverbial ablatival suffix -tas / -tás
and thus does not belong to the pres. part. of √as. See also EWA s.v. satás. Old (ad
VII.32.24) allows several possibilities, incl. the adverb, which he considers assured
in the cmpds. cited above. Although, with Old, etc., I think that an adverbial satáḥ is
found in those cmpds., I do not find that interpr. satáḥ as adverbial here improves the
sense, though I grant that the acc. pl. pres. part. doesn’t really either.

The śuśulū́ka-, occuring beside úlūka-, must be some species of owl, and
it is tempting to take it as a deformation of *śiśu-ulūka- ‘baby owl, little owl’, hence
presumably the diminutives found in many tr. (incl. mine).
Sāy. takes kóka- as the cakravāka bird (see Ge n. 22b), Gr, Wh, Lommel,
Brown, Doniger as the cuckoo, presumably on onomatopoetic grounds. The reinterp.
‘wolf’ is owing to Lü (see Re and EWA s.v.) and has MIA support. Despite the
dominance of birds in pādas a and c, ‘dog’ and ‘wolf’ make a natural pair in b.

Acdg. to Re, Mehendale interpr. the curious formation yātumā́vant- in
pāda a (also I.36.20, VII.1.5, VIII.60.20) not as a metrical variant of yātumánt- (so
AiG II.2.775) but as a haplology for *yātu-māyyā́vant-. I assume (I have not seen the
art.) that his posited form contains -māyā́- in one form or another and anticipates the
next vs. where the female sorcerer is “exulting in her magic power” (māyáyā
śā́śadānām), though I don’t know why the form posited is not just *yātu-māyā́vant-,
containing attested māyā́vant- ‘possessing māyā’ (IV.16.9). If we accept this
146
146
suggestion, or modified suggestion, the tr. could be slightly altered to “the demonic
power of those possessing the magic power of sorcerers.”
The kimīdín- was singular in vs. 2, but a dual matched pair (mithunā́yā́
kimīdínā) here. Why the dual is not entirely clear, but the next vs. specifies both male
and female sorcerers as Indra’s target, and the mithuná- here suggests a sexual
pairing.

vígrīva- ‘with no / broken neck’ is ambiguous: is it descriptive of a preexisting condition and thus a species, ethnic, or personal slur (in English “no-neck” is
an insult, referring to a burly and stupid thug or goon)? or is it used proleptically
here, to indicate what will happen to those who “shake to pieces” (ṛdantu). I’ve taken
it as the former, but opinion is divided and either would work in the passage.
mū́ra-deva- is also contested. Acdg. to EWA (s.v. mū́la-), flg. Wack., it is an
r-form of *mū́la-deva- ‘whose gods are roots’ (Wurzelanbeter)(see also Brown).
This excursion into exotic anthropology seems unlikely to me -- not the sort of
divinity that Vedic people would posit even of their worst and most primitive
enemies. Most tr. take it as ‘idol-worshiper’ (e.g., Ge Götzanbeter), without, however,
indicating what the ‘idol’ rests on: ‘root’ à ‘root as representation of god’ à ‘idol’
(not a semantic chain that seems reasonable to me)? Or, more likely to me, based on
mūrá- ‘stupid, foolish, dumb (i.e., non-speaking)’. My own ‘with feckless gods’ is
rests on this association, but is closer to the sense of the original adjective. I do not,
however, have an explanation for the accent.

Commentary V
[V.1–28 JPB]
## 29 Indra
As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is punctuated by expressions of somadrinking, each slightly different and generally found in the 2nd half of an even pāda:
2b ... papivā́ṃsaṃ sutásya
3b ... sómasya súṣutasya peyāḥ
3d ... papivā́m índro asya [rhyming with 2b]
5b ... somapéyam [cf. 3b]
[7d sutám pibat ... sómam]
8b ... somyā́pā́ḥ
11d ... ápibaḥ sómam asya

### 29.1  
I follow Brereton (Ādityas, 165–66), who in turn followed Thieme (Mitra
and Aryaman, 78–77), in taking aryamā́not as nom. sg. masc. (as it is normally and
as taken by the standard tr.), but as acc. pl. neut. construed with trī́(like trī́rocanā́in
the next pāda). Against Thieme’s “three hospitalities,” Brereton plausibly suggests
that in this context the three aryamā́must refer to “what governs the ritual,” perhaps
the three soma-pressings or the three fires.
Pāda-initial trī́, found here in a and b, recurs in 7c, 8a, b (also non-initial in
7b).
In c pūtá-dakṣa- (/pūtá-dakṣas-) is ordinarily Ādityan vocabulary (though
used of the Maruts also in VIII.94.7, 10). Ge (/WG) supply the Ādityas as the subj. of
dhārayanta in b and of course take Aryaman as the subject of pāda a. By contrast, I
think the Maruts are subjects of all three pādas -- but they are identified with the
Ādityas throughout, as the use of pūtádakṣa-, ordinarily a qualifier of the Ādityas,
makes clear.

### 29.2  
Ge (/WG) take abhí yád áhim han as subordinate to ā́datta vájram in the
same pāda. Although this fits the metrical scheme slightly better, it makes some
trouble with the logical sequence of events (“he took the mace when he smashed the
serpent,” almost implying that the smashing occurred first). It works better as
subordinate to the main clause of d.
The word order áhim hán and the lack of augment on the verb scrambles the
standard formula, producing almost a syncopated effect, which is repaired in 3d.

### 29.3  
Ge (/WG) take havyám as the subj. of ávindat: “the oblation found the cows
for Manu.” This interpr. accounts for the accent on ávindat, which would be
generated by hí. But it is otherwise bizarre: gā́ḥ √vid ‘find the cows’ is a standard
formula in the Vala myth, and the subject of the verb is always Indra or his
agent(s)/companion(s) (e.g., Aṅgirases I.62.2, Saramā V.45.7, 8); for Indra himself
cf., e.g., I.101.5, II.19.3, VIII.96.17, and in a variant of the formula in the next hymn
2

### 30.4  
vidó gavā́m ūrvám. I know of no passages in which the oblation is credited
with finding the cows, and in fact soma plays far less of a role in the successful
outcome of the Vala myth than in that of the Vṛtra myth (though see 12a below). I
therefore take tád dhí havyám as a nominal sentence completing b, with a clause
break in the middle of c. I attribute the accent on ávindat to contrast with the
immediately following verb áhan, which opens the next pāda. This hymn in fact
shows a penchant for pāda-internal clause breaks: cf. in the immediately preceding vs.
2c, as well as 8d, 9d, 11d, 13b, all except the last right after the caesura as here.

### 29.4  
For Indra enwrapped in the earth, cf. I.173.6 sáṃ vivya índro vrjána ̥ ṃ ná
bhū́ma “Indra has enwrapped himself in the earth like a girth.” Cf. also his wearing
the earth III.32.11, VIII.4.8. Although here the enwrapping seems presented as a
handicap, esp. given the cid, in the just cited passages the images seem rather to
emphasize Indra’s vastness.
As noted also by Ge, Schaeffer, and WG, jígartim … apajárgurāṇaḥ is a word
play, but the words presumably belong to different roots. The first is universally
assigned to √gṝ ‘swallow’, but the root affiliation of the second is disputed. Ge and
EWA (s.v. GARī p. 470) assign it to a √gṝ ‘hold out’, but I follow Schaeffer (Intens.,
116–22) in taking it to √gṝ ‘greet, extol’, with the negative sense contributed by the
preverb ápa. So also WG and Oberlies (Relig. I.401). See also nearby apagū́rya
(V.32.6).
The etymological separation of jígartim and apajárgurāṇaḥ invites further
scrutiny of the hapax jígartim. As noted above, this word is generally grouped with
√gṝ ‘swallow’ and interpreted as an agent noun ‘swallower’ (my ‘gulper’). However,
with apajárgurāṇaḥ off the table, there is no particular contextual support for this
interpr., though it is certainly semantically acceptable. Far more troubling are the
serious formal problems. For one thing, -ti- is by no means an agent-noun suffix; it
normally of course forms feminine abstracts, though AiG II.2.636–37 does register a
number of such stems that have been reanalyzed “zur Bez. der persönlichen Träger
des Verbalbegriffs zu verwenden.” Debrunner himself identifies our form as a 3rd sg.
verb form inflected as a -ti-stem (AiG II.2.638), but this interpr. has nothing to
recommend it. Not only is such a morphological transfer not a feature of the RV, but
there is also no such verb stem available to be nominalized. The root √gṝ ‘swallow’
does not have a redupl. pres. or in fact any redupl. stem save for the pf. jagāra and
the intensive subj. jalgulas (I.28.1); the single form of the redupl. aor. ajīgar
(I.163.7) supposedly belonging to this root (see Gr, and Whit. Roots) actually
belongs with the other forms of this stem to the root √gṝ ‘awaken’, and we just
discussed intens. part. járgurāṇa- above. It is, further, a seṭ root; it’s hard to know
what its pre-C full grade should be in a redupl. pres. formation since there are no
parallel formations to roots in -ṝ that I know of (*jígarīti? cf. VS galgalīti and EWA
s.vv. GARI2
, GAL), but presumably not simply gar. In short, neither the nominal
morphology nor the root formation of jígarti- is easily accounted for under the
standard hypothesis, but I have nothing better to substitute. I therefore retain the
rendering in the publ. tr., though with full awareness of its fragility. My thanks to
3
Veronique Kremmer, who drew my attention to jígarti- and its many problems and
discussed the issues at length with me.

### 29.6  
Indra’s two actions in this vs. are expressed by injunctives (vivṛścát b,
bādhata d), as in the preceding vs. (kaḥ 5d), but the middle verb, árcanti in c, is
emphatically present. The configuration here, #árcantī́ndram marútaḥ, matches that
of 1c #árcanti tvā marútaḥ. See Hoffmann (Injunk. 165) on this vs., who seems to
think the “timeless, mentioning” function of the injunctive can be so distant from a
real preterite that it can drag in present indicatives. I would attribute it rather to the
attempt in this hymn to associate the heroic deeds of the past with the activities of the
present sacrificers. It is also barely possible that the text originally read
*árcantíndram, that is, *árcant índram with the underlying 3rd pl. ending -nt
preserved before vowel, but later reint. as pres. -nti after -nt regularly became -nn.
The -í- could then have been lengthened, as if a sandhi product of árcanti índram,
with no metrical consequences. The change would have been facilitated by the model
of likewise pāda-initial árcanti in 1c, as well as arcanti in 12b. Still, on balance I find
this unlikely. Other examples of preserved -nt because of early misparsing as -nti
occur before the enclitic pronoun īm, and the result in either case would be -ntīm. See
disc. ad I.67.4, etc.
IV.29.7: On neut. pl. mahiṣā́in conjunction with the numerical expression trī́śatā́ni
see Old. Note the alternative phrasing with gen. pl. in 8a trī́… śatā́mahiṣā́ṇām.
IV.29.8: Gr and Ge [/WG] take both ághaḥ and ápāḥ as 3rd sg. Since ághas belongs
to the root pres. to √ghas, either 2nd or 3rd sg. is grammatically possible. But for ápāḥ
to be 3rd sg., an s-aor. stem ápās- has to be posited, for which there is no other
support save for a med. pāsta in a mā́-prohibitive in the AV (XII.3.43). Nevertheless,
Narten does set up such a stem (Sig.Aor. 168). I see no reason to do so; the presence
of nom. sg. maghávā, adduced as evidence by Narten, is not sufficient, since nom. sg.
appositives to 2nd sg. subjects are common. Also common is abrupt shifting between
2nd and 3rd ps., found already in this hymn between vss. 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 5 and 6. In
our vs. we must assume that a shift happens between the hemistichs, given the 3rd sg.
jaghā́na in 8d, but this is hardly unprecedented -- and note that it returns abruptly to
2nd ps. in vs. 9. I therefore prefer to interpret 8ab as couched in the 2nd sg., as in the
publ. tr. But if a 3rd sg. reading of ápāḥ is really desirable, I would prefer to consider
the -s ending a local analogy to the precative peyāḥ at the end of 3b, reinforced by
the ambig. parallel ághaḥ, rather than setting up an s-aorist stem to account for a
single form.
I follow Ge in taking both kārám and bháram as the direct speech expression
of a victory cry. The former is appropriate to gaming contexts, while the latter is at
home in battles. Our ahvanta … bháram has a compositional equivalent bhára-hūti-,
for which see comm. ad I.129.2; for kārám √kṛ, see I.131.5. It may be convenient to
assemble here some passages containing both bhára- and kārá- (or derivatives):
I.l12.1 yā́bhir [ūtíbhiḥ] bháre kārám áṃśāya jínvathaḥ; VIII.66.1 (likewise an Indra
4
hymn): (índram ... ūtáye/ ....../) huvé bháram ná kāríṇam; IX.16.5 mahé bhárāya
kāríṇaḥ; IX.14.1 kāráṃ bíbhrat puruspṛ́ham. See also Wackernagel KlSch. 340ff.

### 29.9  
On uśánā as an indeclinable, see my 2007 “Vedic Uśanā Kāvya and Avestan
Kauui Usan: On the Morphology of the Names” (Fs. Jasanoff).
On the basis of other mentions of this myth, 2nd du. áyātam must conceal a
Vāyav Indraś ca type construction, with the other subject, beside voc. indra, being
Kutsa. Cf. nearby dual dvandva indrā-kutsā (V.31.9). The gapping of Kutsa in the
first half of the verse is repaired by cd saráthaṃ yayātha, kútsena, with the same root
√yā as in áyātam. I do not understand the change in tense stem.

### 29.10  
In the publ. tr. I take kútsāya primarily with pāda a, though syntactically
and metrically it should go with b. I would now emend the tr. to “the other you made
into wide space for Kutsa to drive” or “… for Kutsa for driving.” I’m not sure how a
wheel can become a wide space -- what sounds like a kind of highway -- but the
addition of Kutsa doesn’t make it any less comprehensible.
I take anā́saḥ ‘mouthless’ as proleptic, describing the state of the Dasyus after
Indra has finished crushing them (sim. to I.32.6 *anā́ḥ pipiṣe), while Ge [/WG] take
it as a standing characteristic of the Dasyus (“mouthless Dasyus”). There is no way
to tell.

### 29.11  
The etym. fig. pácan paktī́ḥ is also a proleptic expression of sorts, “cooking
(food, so that it is) cooked,” though since paktí- is not an adj./participle, but a noun
identifying a type of food, the parallel isn’t exact. For other exx. of paktí- √pac, see
IV.24.7, VII.32.8.

### 29.12  
This vs. brings the third repetition of arcanti (1c, 6c [or árcan(t); see
above]; cf. ā́rcan 2b).
I don’t quite understand the double cid construction in cd, where even one cid
seems somewhat superfluous. Ge (/WG) take it as concessive and logically to be
construed with apidhā́navantam (“the cowpen, although it had a cover” [Ge: “obwohl
verschlossen,” sim. WG]). This is possible, though I don’t like the position of cid,
and I would also note that #gávyaṃ cid ūrvám is also found in VII.90.4, where a
concessive value is harder to wring out.

### 29.13  
Gr, Ge (/WG), and Klein (DGRV I.219) interp. pári √car as ‘serve’.
Although this sense is found in later Vedic, the RVic instances of this lexeme only
have the literal meaning ‘go around’ (e.g., III.7.2) with the developed sense
‘encompass’. (I.127.9 comes closest to ‘serve’, but the ‘surround’ sense is dominant.)
Interpreting pári carāṇi here as ‘serve’ requires the part. vidvā́n to take an obj.
(“knowing your heroic deeds …”), but pāda-final vidvā́n is almost always used
absolutely. Moreover áparītaḥ (pári √i) in the next vs. continues the thought of
conceptual circumscription.
5
Ge (/WG) and Klein divide the vs. syntactically into ab / cd, with the rel. cl. of
c expressing the obj. of d. By contrast I think the lexical parallelism and the
conjunction co [=ca u] of … yā́cakártha / yā́co … kṛṇávaḥ of bc mark those relative
clauses as tightly conjoined, and I take them as subordinate to pāda a. Further, the
last pāda préd u tā́te vidátheṣu bravāma strikes me as a self-contained (pseudo-
)refrain, reminiscent of the Gṛtsamāda refrain in II: bṛhád vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ
(II.1.16d etc.).

### 29.14  
This vs. is structured somewhat like vs. 13, with (a) etā́víśvā cakṛvā́n
corresponding to (13b) (vīryā̀) … yā́cakártha, though with pf. participle not rel. cl.,
and (c) yā́cid nú … kṛṇávaḥ corresponding even more closely to (13c) yā́co nú …
kṛṇávaḥ. I would therefore now slightly emend the publ. tr. to reflect this parallelism
more closely: “By your nature you cannot be circumscribed in heroism -- you, Indra,
(as one) having done all these many (deeds) (as well as) those (deeds) that you will
do even now in your daring. There exists no one to obstruct this power of yours.” In
other words I take pādas a and c as parallel adjunct expressions, with b as their joint
main clause, and d (like 13d) independent. Note that d has no overt referent for yā́in
c. The English is awkward, but this structure corresponds better to the Skt.

### 29.15  
On the sandhi in návyā ákarma see Old.
## 30 Indra
There are a number of paired repetitions of words and phrases in earlier and
later parts of the hymn, but not enough to define an omphalos: e.g., -senaḥ# 3d /
sénāḥ# 9b; X Y cakrṣ̥ e 4a / X Y cakre 9a; yudháye 4b / 9d; áśmānam cid 4c / 8c;
gávām ... usríyānām 4d / 11d.

### 30.1  
Despite the distance between them and the syntagms in between, I take rāyā́
and ūtī́as parallel polarized instr. to be construed primarily with gántā. Ge and WG
differently, though also differently from each other.
It is tempting to interpr gántā in d as a periphrastic future, a temptation
yielded to in the publ. tr.
V.30.1–2: Note the reciprocal ‘seeking’ (ichán) of Indra (1c) and his devotee (2b).

### 30.2  
WG take sasvár as ‘in sleep’, against the standard interpr. ‘in secret’, arguing
that the latter does not make sense with bubudhānā́ḥ in d. But pāda d is not directly
associated with pāda a, which, with b, compares the poet’s pursuit of Indra to the
stealthy tracking behavior of a hunter. Moreover, the other three exx. of sasvár(tā)
(in a tight knot in VII.58.5, 59.7, 60.10) clearly mean ‘in secret’, as opposed to ‘in
the open’ (cf. the contrast in VII.58.5 with āvír ‘openly’). It is true that the standard
etymology of sasvár takes it from √sas ‘sleep’ (see EWA s.v. SAS), but the semantic
development to ‘in secret’ isn’t difficult to imagine -- esp. if Skt. √sas, which
violates standard root structure constraints, was onomatopoetic for the
6
shushing/hushing verbal gesture (English “shh,” etc.). From “keep quiet” to “keep
secret” is a short step. Although √sas is clearly an inherited root, with cognates in
Avestan and Anatolian, the onomatopoetic interpr. could be regularly (re-)actualized
by association with the (near-universal?) living “shh” interjection.
The position of anyā́n in b should, by my rules, make it definite (“the others”).
Though both Ge and WG render it as indefinite, there is no reason why it can’t be
definite: the poet consults with his priestly/poetic colleagues or with those “who
know” (vidváṃs-) Their answer, referring to “we men,” suggests that it is a defined
group, quite possibly the priests performing the morning ritual. The action that
qualifies them for attaining Indra -- waking up (early) -- is surely not simply
reflecting a general sentiment like “the early bird gets the worm,” but refers to
Indra’s attendance at the morning pressing; cf., e.g., IV.35.7 prātáḥ sutám apibo
haryaśva “Early in the morning you drank the pressed (soma), you of the fallow
bays.”

### 30.3  
The syntax in the first hemistich is a little rough. yā́te kṛtā́ni in pāda a
appears to be an embedded relative clause, a construction that is rare to non-existent
in the RV. Its position between the preverb and the verb of the main cl. (prá …
brávāma) makes it difficult to interpret it any other way. The fact that it is a nominal
clause, an NP serving as direct object, may make the embedding seem less of a
syntactic violation. (Note that Ge simply ignores the rel. prn.) The main verb
brávāma is accented because it is effectively in pāda-initial position: the initial
accented voc. índra is extra-clausal.
The second rel. clause yā́ni no jújoṣaḥ “which of ours you will enjoy” appears
to be parallel to the embedded NP, but it is a little skewed semantically. Indra should
not enjoy his deeds, but rather enjoy hearing our recital of them (see Ge “die du von
uns gern hören wirst” [my italics], with ‘hear’ silently supplied). Alternatively it
would be possible to assume that the 2nd rel. is (covertly) conjoined to the first and
refers to different deeds, “(and) which (deeds) of ours you will enjoy” -- but it is
hardly likely that Indra cares about what we do (besides pressing soma), so this
interpr. is pragmatically blocked. WG supply “(in) unseren (Worten)” as the
antecedent to the second rel. prn., such that what Indra will enjoy is our words, not
his deeds (“(in) unseren (Worten), an welchen du Freude hast”); this seems to me to
deploy too much machinery to repair what is simply a somewhat loose expression.
It would be technically possible to take the first hemistich as consisting only
of relative clauses, with the main clause represented by c with an unexpressed
resumptive “(those deeds)”: “Which deeds of yours we shall now proclaim at the
pressing, which you will enjoy, (those deeds) he will learn ...” The accent on
brávāma would then be because it is in a dependent clause. Although this interpr.
would save us from an embedded relative (see above), the rhetoric of the 1st
hemistich, with prá nú vayám … brávāma reminiscent of I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi
prá vocam and similar passages, strongly suggests an annunciatory declaration rather
than a subordination.

### 30.4  
Ge (/WG) assume that c, like d, refers to the opening of the Vala cave. They
therefore either take didyuto ví ‘flashed forth’ as a stand in for ‘broke/split apart’ (Ge,
flg. Sāy.’s vyabhinaḥ) or disjoin didyutaḥ from ví and supply another verb with the
preverb (or so I understand WG’s “… blitzend, zer(sprengt)”). But c and d do not
have to refer to a single feat: a and b do not, and the recital of kṛtā́ni promised in 3ab
covers a number of different deeds in the vss. to come. Moreover, though áśman-
‘stone’ can refer to the Vala cave, it has a number of other possible referents (see 8c
where Namuci’s head is equated/compared with an áśman-), including Indra’s own
weapon. Cf. IV.22.1 yó áśmānaṃ śávasā bíbhrad éti “who [=Indra] keeps bearing the
stone with his power,” with the śávasā found also here. Since √dyut is very
commonly found with ví (including the common and lexicalized root-noun cmpd.
vidyút- ‘lightning’) and since one of the sites to which a preverb in tmesis moves is
directly after its verb (and here also adjoining a metrical boundary), it seems very
likely that preverb and verb belong together -- and have their normal sense. In my
interpr. this lexeme incorporates a simile: ‘cause to flash like lightning’ / ‘cause to
lightning’ (unfortunately English does not have such a verb). In other words, with his
power Indra can make even the dull and homely material stone flash like a lightning
bolt.

### 30.5  
The Pp. interprets paramá as nom. sg. m. paramáḥ, and Ge (/WG) follow
suit. I prefer the equally possible reading paramé, on the basis of several ‘born’
passages with this expression. Cf., e.g., I.143.2 sá jā́yamānaḥ paramé vyòman
(though the subj. is Agni there).
In my view cid often takes Wackernagel’s Law position, even when it seems
to limit a different word in the clause. Hence my “even the gods,” though devā́(ḥ) is
at the end of the pāda. Its positioning there may be to take advantage of its adjacency
to víśvā(ḥ) across the pāda boundary. Although the latter is fem. and must modify acc.
pl. apáḥ ‘waters’, its position evokes the common locution “all the gods / the All
Gods.” In fact, the expression “all the waters” is vanishingly rare — besides this
passage I have found only VII.95.1 — and so “all” belongs more naturally with the
immediately preceding “gods” than with its grammatical partner.
Note the switch from 2nd ps. ref. to Indra (rel. cl. 5ab) to 3rd ps. ref. (main cl.
5c, new cl. 5d).

### 30.6  
Referent shift continues: 2nd ps. in ab, 3rd in cd.

### 30.7  
There are several uncertainties in this vs.
As often the function and syntactic affiliation of janúṣā are unclear. I construe
it with mṛ́dhaḥ, but Ge and WG (in different ways) take it with Indra. This is also
possible.
The participial phrase dā́nam ínvan “stimulating giving” seems oddly
embedded in the distracted VP ví ṣú mṛ́dhaḥ … áhan “you hewed apart the negligent
ones.” The positioning between the preverb and its verb in tmesis may be a kind of
8
iconic reflection of the separation sense of the preverb (‘apart’). For a similar ex. see
I.103.2. On the participial phrase see further below.
I have been puzzled by the phrase gávā … saṃcakānáḥ, though I think I now
see a solution (see below). For one thing, √kā [/kan] is not otherwise found with sám
(anywhere in Sanskrit, at least judging from Monier-Williams); for another, this root
is not construed with the instr. (pace Gr, whose supposed exx. should all be interpr.
otherwise). And finally I cannot think of a (solitary) cow that figures prominently in
Indra mythology, either as a companion (as I took it in the publ. tr.) or as a source of
enjoyment. Ge remarks (n. 7a) that Indra gives abundantly as long as he is “im
Genuss der erbeuteten Kühe.” I suppose this is possible but it assumes a fairly
extensive backstory. Like me, Kü (143) takes the cow as comitative: “mit Rindvieh
… dich zusammenwünschend.” I was happy to have company in this tr., but I frankly
didn’t understand what either his or mine is actually meant to express. WG also seem
to have a comitative reading, which is similarly opaque: “du erpicht darauf wirst, mit
dem Rind beisammen zu sein.”
On reconsideration of the passage I now see a possible solution. It is striking
that gávā is the only apparent occurrence of the instr. sg. to this stem in the RV. In
context it appears directly before maghavan. I now think the original form may have
been gen. pl. *gávām, with simplification of the double -m m-. The meter is
unaffected, and a gen. pl. would fit the sense much better, as I will now show. This
hymn contains four other examples of this very gen. pl. (4d, 11d, 12b, 13b), as well
as nom. pl. gā́vaḥ (10a). The examples in 12 and 13 are in a dānastuti, but the others
refer to the cows that Indra freed from the Vala cave (and are in the same metrical
position as our form). I see two possible ways to construe my putative *gávām. Since
forms of √kā can take the genitive as a source of enjoyment (e.g., X.54.16
dráviṇasaḥ), it may go with saṃcakānáḥ: “enjoying the cows,” referring to Indra’s
pleasure in his deed and its products. But in vs. 11 Indra, having drunk soma, púnar
gávām adadād usríyāṇām “gave again of the ruddy cows.” This seems to refer to a
redistribution on the ritual ground of the cows that Indra had freed. Bringing together
11d gávām adadāt with 7ab dā́nam ínvan … *gávām, I am inclined to think that the
cows are the content of the gift and would now alter the tr. to “setting in motion the
gift *of cows” vel sim. Under this interpr. saṃcakānáḥ is used without complement:
“taking pleasure, enjoying yourself” (for a similar absolute use of this participle, see
IV.16.15 and Kü 143). Thus the hemistich contains a brief précis of the myth: Indra
hews apart those who block his freeing of the cows [I would now probably change
my rendering of mṛ̥́dhaḥ as ‘negligent’ here], which allows him to set in motion the
ultimate giving away of the freed cows, and he thoroughly (sám) enjoys the whole
process. The occurrences of gávām in the dānastuti (esp. 12b gávāṃ catvā́ri dádataḥ
sahásrā) simply replicate the mythic model provided by Indra’s generous sharing out
of the freed cows.
I am not certain what pāda d is conveying. How is it that Indra’s setting
Namuci’s head to rolling involves “seeking a way for Manu”? Unfortunately we can
glean too little about Namuci from the RV (where he is mentioned only 9x) to know
what threat he posed that required Indra to kill him. On the other hand, judging from
9
the usual troubles caused by Dāsas and, particularly, from vs. 9 (see publ. intro.),
these foes stand in the way of Ārya movement into new territory. Thus Indra by
eliminating Namuci would open the way for Manu and the rest of the advancing
Ārya.

### 30.8  
Though this vs. follows thematically on vs. 7, it seems disjointed and has
given rise to much discussion (see esp. Old and his skepticism about Ge’s interpr.; Bl
RR) and incompatible interpretations, which I will not treat in detail further here.
The first question that arises is who is the 1st
-ps. speaker in pāda a. Ge
suggests that it is Namuci himself, a suggestion rejected by both Old and Bl. I think
the root aor. ákṛthāḥ is the clue. It is rare that the aorist, esp. the root aorist, is used
as a narrative tense, esp. to a root well outfitted with other preterital possibilities. I
take pāda a as a parenthetical interruption of the Namuci story, prompted by the last
pāda of vs. 7, esp. the mention of Manu. With Old I take “me” as referring to the
present-day priest, and in my view he is asserting his ancestral and vocational
connection with the primal priest and representative Ārya, Manu. The speaker
suggests that Indra’s current partnership with him (“for you have made me your
yokemate” with the aorist of the recent past) is evidence of Indra’s active concern for
his ancestor Manu in the mythological past. After this interruption ā́d íd functions as
a resumptive expression, returning us to and carrying on the story of the myth
narrated in 7cd.
In 8c the referent of the “whizzing stone” (áśmānam … svaryàm) is disputed.
I very much doubt that it is a mountain, despite the occurrence of the same
expression in V.56.4, where it definitely is a mountain, and despite Old’s
championing of this identification. I think it more likely that the phrase resonates
with I.32.2 vájraṃ svaryàm, where svaryà- refers to Indra’s mace. Namuci’s
whirling head is being compared to a weapon whirling through the air and making a
whizzing sound.
The “rolling, whirling” image is carried further in the next pāda, with the
simile “(rolling forth) like two wheels.” The simile makes fine sense with
vártamāna-, but what are the two world-halves (ródasī) doing there? As it turns out,
though it may seem counter-intuitive in real-world terms, the two worlds (under
various designations) are regularly associated with the root √vṛt (cf., e.g., V.43.2,
VI.8.3, VII.80.1, VIII.6.5). In some of these passages the rolling out of the two
worlds is part of a cosmogonic exercise; in some it refers to the visual (re-
)appearance of differentiated earth and sky at dawn.
I have no idea what the Maruts are doing here.

### 30.9  
For women as weapons see not only I.104.3 mentioned in the publ. intro. but
also X.27.10 and disc. ad loc.
For my interpretation of the sense of this vs., see publ. intro. I am tolerably
certain about my reading of the first hemistich, but pāda c is more challenging and
has given rise to some curious interpretations. Ge tr. “denn er hatte darunter seine
zwei Frauenbrüste entdeckt,” commenting (perplexingly, at least to me) “Die beiden
10
Milchbrüste für seine beiden Frauen” (n. 9c). (One would assume there would be
four in all, at any rate.) Old thinks the two dhéne refer to the two liquids in the
Namuci myth and ultimately (see his ref. to his own NGGW 1893 art. [=KlSch.
635ff.]) to the Sautrāmaṇī ritual and its two separate oblations, milk and surā.
Schmidt (Ged. Nyberg), more or less flg. Bloomfield, suggests that Indra recognizes
two streams within himself, songs and libations, but this linkage of the literal and
metaphorical through an elliptical dual seems quite unlikely. WG’s “Darunter aber
hat er dessen beide Ströme erblickt” is literally close to mine, but they provide no
guidance on what they mean by “his two streams.”
My own tr. (“distinguished both his [=Dāsa’s?] streams”) is also not as
informative as it might be. One problem is the meaning of the lexeme antár √khyā.
To √khyā ‘see’ antár should add the sense of either ‘look within’ or ‘distinguish
between’. The similarly formed antár √paś seems to have both these meanings: ‘look
within’ in I.132.3 and ‘distinguish between’ in II.27.3. (In the latter passage JPB tr.
‘look within’, but I consider that the less likely sense in context.) In the only other
occurrence of antár √khyā, I.81.9, I tr. ‘detect’ (flg. Ge’s ‘endecken’ for this passage,
V.30.9), a sense that can be somewhat tenuously derived from ‘look within a mass of
stuff — and visually locate’. It’s also possible in that passage, which concerns the
possessions of the impious, which Indra is supposed to bring to us, that he is
distinguishing between those possessions and the ones that belong to deserving
people and should stay put. In our passage here we might in the first instance think
that ‘distinguish between’ would be a promising candidate, given the dual object. But
I don’t think Indra is supposed to be seeing a difference between the two streams, but
rather perceiving that they are just streams and therefore not formidable weapons --
thus encouraging his advance to fighting in pāda d. I am tempted to emend the publ.
tr. to “detected/recognized both of his (weapons) as (just) streams.” Though the
weapons (ā́yudhāni) were plural in pāda a, I think that is a general statement about
turning women into weapons, whereas pāda c concerns the particular situation Indra
confronts, the two barrier rivers -- the same situation as in I.104.3, which also
contains two troublesome rivers.
V.30.12, 14: The Anukr. takes ṛṇaṃcayá- as the PN of the king, and the standard
interpr. follow this, incl. the publ. tr. I now wonder if it is at least a speaking name –
and perhaps not a name at all but a descriptor: “requiting debts.” The royal patron
who distributes largesse to poets and priests at a sacrifice is, from the point of view
of the ritual economy, requiting his debts to them, who attracted the gods to the
sacrifice and entertained them, leading them to grant tangible and intangible rewards
to the patron.
V.30.13–14: The two pāda-final sequences páritakmyāyāḥ (13d) and páritakmyā yā́m̐
(14a) in adjacent pādas are puzzling. The publ. tr. reflects emendations of both forms
to loc. sg. páritakmyāyām. This loc. occurs 6x, always pāda-final, including in the
next hymn, V.31.11 -- by far the most common form to this stem. Moreover,
VI.24.9d is identical to 14d, save for having the loc. páritakmyāyām -- a variation
11
that Bl (RVReps) finds “baffling.” The arguments in favor of emendation are the
dominance of the loc. sg. and its appearance both in the next hymn and in the
otherwise identical pāda in VI.24.9. However, these arguments cut both ways: it is
difficult to understand how these forms would have become mangled – especially
given the dominance of that same loc. sg. It cannot be claimed that the redactors
misunderstood the forms because they had never seen their like. I therefore now feel
that we must accept that the forms were in the urtext, deliberately produced by the
poet, who was playing games with this well-known pāda-final temporal expression. I
still believe that the intent of both forms is the same as the loc., but that the loc. has
been deliberately altered, in two different ways, conditioned by the immediate
context.
In 13d aktór vyùṣṭau páritakmyāyāḥ the form has been given a genitive ending
to conform, superficially, to the gen. aktóḥ. Gr takes it to an adjectival stem
(páritakmya-, which doesn’t exist) as a modifier of aktóḥ, which, as Old points out,
would then have to be fem. here, rather than its normal masc. Old suggests it might
be a gen. of time, though he prefers to supply rā́tryāḥ or to have it depend on vyùṣṭau.
I consider this over-thinking: the poet gives us the loc. form we expect, right up to
the very last segment (-ḥ rather than -m) and then springs the surprise, capitalizing
on the superficial resemblance to the gen. sg. áktoḥ.
In 14a aúchat sā́rā́trī páritakmyā yā́m̐the final syllable of the loc. has been
truncated and given an accent. The anunāsika can be taken as hiatus-breaking
nasalization of a final -ā́before ṛ; this is the standard interpr. (see esp. Old, Noten,
with ref. to Prol.). This yields the nom. sg. fem. rel. prn., which allows an interpr. as
a nominal rel. clause páritakmyā yā́, which specifies immediately preceding sā́rā́trī.
A pāda-final rel. pronoun and the resulting nominal rel. clause (“… the night, which
is páritakmyā”) would be highly unusual, but as a poetic trick involving resegmentation of a well-known form it shows a proto-śleṣa sensibility.
The fact that the poet alters the expected form in two different ways in
succeeding pādas should alert us to the fact that he is playing verbal tricks, secure in
the knowledge that his audience would expect and interpret both as underlyingly
locatival. For a different manipulation of the stem, see comm. ad I.31.6. In any case
the publ. tr. should have an * before “at its final turn” in both instances.

### 30.14  
The primary reading of ajyámānaḥ is surely “being driven,” as the standard
interpr. have it. But it could also be the passive of √añj ‘anoint’ and inhabit the same
semantic realm as “well-ornamented with thousands of cows” in 13ab: he would be
anointed with prize cows.

### 30.15  
The idiom ā́√dā ‘take’ is ordinarily in the middle, whereas ā́dāma here is
active. I consider this active form a secondary formation based on the (pseudo-
)active ā́dat ‘took’, for which see comm. ad V.32.8.
## 31 Indra
12

### 31.1  
Against the Pp., which reads vy ùnoti, and despite Old’s objections, I read
ví
yunoti, that is, ví yunoti ‘keeps separate’ -- an idea that goes back to Wh’s Roots
(s.v. √u)(see also Old’s other reff.) and is accepted by EWA (s.v. YAV2
); see also
Gotō IIJ 31 (1988) -- even though this 5th class pres. is not otherwise attested to this
root. Note the same lexeme, ví √yu, in the immed. preceding hymn, V.30.10 …
gā́vaḥ … vatsaír víyutā yád ā́san “since the cows were separated from their calves.”
This interpr. is, not surprisingly, reflected in WG’s tr., but not Ge’s ‘mustert’ (survey,
inspect, further glossed in n. 1c as “er wählt den rechten Wagen aus”), whose root
affiliation is not clear to me.
This verb seems to work slightly differently in simile and frame. In the simile
the herdsman is separating flocks, sorting them on some principle or other (sheep
from goats? flock belonging to A from that belong to B? young animals from older?
etc.). In the frame I supply rátham as object (from 1a) and, as I see it, Indra keeps his
chariot separate from the other chariots in the race or chariot drive in order to be first,
a position reflected in pāda d. WG slightly different: Indra drives the other, opposing
chariots apart.

### 31.2  
WG take píśāṅga- in the cmpd píśāṅga-rāti- as referring to the color of cows
(“Gabe rötlichbraune (Kühe)”), whereas I follow Gr, Ge in taking it as a reference to
gold. Either is possible, and it is true that the adj. qualifies other animals -- a dog
(VII.55.2), horses (I.88.2, V.57.4) -- though not cows. Nothing rides on the choice.

### 31.3  
Ge and WG take sáhaḥ as the only subj. of ájaniṣṭa, while I take sáhaḥ as an
appositive qualifying the unexpressed subj. índraḥ. Again the difference is minor, but
I favor my interpr. because the birth of Indra and the prodigous feats he performs
immediately thereafter are frequent topics in the RV.
V.31.5–6: Vs. 5 is syntactically problematic, in that it has two subordinate clauses,
one marked by yád in pāda a and one marked by yé in pāda c, but no obvious main
clause. The rel. cl. beginning in c must extend through d, which contains the accented
imperfect ávartanta, but the extent of the yád clause is unclear. It must go as far as
the end of pāda a because of the accented subjunctive árcān, but the status of b is in
question. Since the vs. otherwise lacks a main clause, Ge and WG make b the
nominal main clause, e.g., Ge “…, da waren die Presssteine, die Aditi einverstanden.”
This is possible, but seems conceptually weak, and both Ge and WG fail to render
the subjunctive value of the verb in the yád clause -- Ge silently changing it into a
preterite (“anstimmten”) and WG using a simple pres. (“singen”).
But I think the subjunctive should be taken seriously, esp. given its contrast
with the impf. ávartanta in d. My solution is to assume the main clause is postponed
till vs. 6, whose first pāda contains the familiar annunciatory pseudo-subjunctive prá
… vocam “I shall proclaim.” Thus, vss. 5–6 depict a ritual situation in which the
noise of the pressing stones is, as so often, configured as ritual speech (see, e.g., vs.
12c vádan grā́vā in this same hymn), to which the poet responds in vs. 6. I now think
that vṛ́ṣaṇaḥ in pāda a is not a separate subject (“the bulls and the pressing stones” of
13
the publ. tr.), but instead qualifies the stones (“the bullish pressing stones”; for
pressing stones as bulls, see, e.g., III.42.6, VI.44.20), and I would change the tr. to
“When for you the bull, o Indra, the bullish pressing stones will chant a chant …”
Sāy., cited approvingly by Ge in n. 5a, identifies the bulls of pāda a as the Maruts,
and WG also accept this identification, but again the subjunctive makes difficulties:
the actions of the Maruts should not be prospective, but located in the mythic past
(hence, presumably, Ge’s switch to the preterite).
So the skeleton of the sentence spread over two vss. is “When the pressing
stones will chant a chant to you, I will proclaim your deeds.”
A few loose ends remain in vs. 5. The presence of Aditi in b at first takes one
aback, but as Ge points out (n. 5b), soma is said elsewhere to be prepared “in the lap
of Aditi,” so her proximity to the pressing stones is a ritual given. I take áditiḥ
sajóṣāḥ as a separate mini-constituent, with the nom. sg. of the -s-stem adjective
serving for the fem. as well as the masc., as usual. The second hemistich detours into
a conceit -- involving an unexpressed comparison of the pressing stones with deadly
wheel rims that have crushed the enemy; cf. a similar passage in X.27.6 ádhy ū nv
èṣu vavṛtyuḥ “The wheel rims should now roll over them.” In part the conceit
responds to the chariot-focused theme of this hymn, esp. the chariot conflict depicted
in vs. 11; in part it highlights the pressing stones’ demon-killing power, found, e.g.,
in X.76.4.
The subjunctive vibhárā(ḥ) in the yád clause is potentially troublesome for my
interpr. of árcān in 5a, for it seems to refer to past, cosmogonic deed(s) of Indra’s --
the separation of the two world halves and the winning of water for mankind (two
events not usually connected). This surprising usage of the subjunctive is noted by
Delbrück (AiSyn 322: subjunctive where we expect the indicative of a narrative
tense). Old is undisturbed by the subjunctive and points to 5a as similar, which is
exactly what I would prefer to point away from; see my explanation of árcān above.
Hoffmann (244–45) classifies it as “Konjunktiv in präteritalem Sachverhalt” and
suggests that the subjunctive in its prospective use can take on a timeless sense (“…
einen ausserzeitlichen Sinn annehmen kann”). Ge simply translates it as a preterite
(trenntest) without comment, but WG take the subjunctive seriously here (though not
in 5a): “… dass du … trennen und … gewinnen willst,” without further comment. I
do not have an entirely satisfactory answer, but I think the yád clause must be
evaluated in the context of what precedes: 6ab announces that I will proclaim Indra’s
previous deeds (pū́rvāṇi káraṇāni) and “the current ones which you have done”
(nū́tanā … yā́cakártha). This latter expression, which is found identically in
VII.98.5, seems temporally incoherent: if they are his current deeds, he should not
have already done them; yā́cakártha should limit only the first phrase, pū́rvāṇi
káraṇāni. A fuller expression of this proclamation announcement, with the time of
action correctly sorted, is found in nearby V.29.13 vīryā̀… yā́cakártha / yā́co nú
návyā kṛṇávaḥ “The heroic deeds that you have done and the new ones that you will
do,” with the perfect cakártha qualifying the deeds already done and the subjunctive
kṛṇávaḥ the new ones. Immediately afterwards it is said prá … tā́… bravāma “we
shall proclaim these,” like our prá … vocam. I think we should interpret our 6cd in
14
the light of V.29.13. The rel. clause yā́cakártha should, properly speaking, limit only
the pū́rvāṇi, while the nū́tanā ‘current (deeds)’ are further specified by a single
example (or perhaps two), expressed by the yád clause in cd using the subjunctive. A
problem remains: as noted above, the separation of the two worlds is one of Indra’s
standard cosmogonic deeds as is, in the Vṛtra myth, his winning of the waters. We
should expect these to be classified among the pū́rvāṇi. But of course one of the
reasons for celebrating older, mythic deeds is to persuade / compel the god to
perform these deeds again in the present for our benefit, and we can interpret the yád
+ SUBJUNCTIVE clause here in that way. The separation of the two world halves is, on
a smaller scale, accomplished every morning when dawn reveals the horizon where
the darkness had kept earth and sky undifferentiated. And winning waters is
something that needs to be repeated at least yearly. The subjunctive here indicates
that our focus is on the re-creation of these older deeds, not simply on celebrating
their original performance. In this context mánave ‘for Manu’ would have the
extended sense ‘for mankind’.
V.31.7–8: The recital of Indra’s deeds now reverts to the past tense, to a series of
insistently augmented imperfects: 7b ámimīthāḥ, 7c agṛbhṇāḥ, 7d asedhaḥ, 8b
áramayaḥ, 8c ayātam, ávahaḥ. (In 8d the Pp. reads unaug. áranta, but in its sandhi
situation [uśánā́ranta] it could as easily be ā́ranta; the accent should be on the
augment because it’s in a subordinate cl., but ā + áranta would come out this way.
Either way, it’s not an imperfect, but either a plupf. or a root aor., but this is a minor
quibble.) However, note that this series is introduced by 7a tád ín nú te káraṇam
“Just this now is your deed,” where the current situation (nú) remains in the forefront
of the poet’s mind.
With Ge (and contra WG, who suggest Śuṣṇa), I take the strong one (ugrám)
in c as Uśanā. This is the usual, if wispy, account of Indra and Kutsa’s journey to
Uśanā’s house for advice before the Śuṣṇa battle; cf. X.22.6.
The 2nd sg. ávaho ha kútsam “you (sg.) conveyed Kutsa,” following
immediately on the 2nd du. ayātam “you two drove,” seems a quick correction or
explanation. The 2nd du. ayātam may have seemed to suggest an equality and
mutuality between Indra and Kutsa that might have seemed insulting to Indra’s
divinity and greater power -- though the return of vām in d and the dual dvandva
índrākutsā and dual verbs of vs. 9 show that the attempt to reestablish hierarchy was
momentary.

### 31.9  
I take this as the direct address of Uśanā to Indra and Kutsa, with his advice
and encouragement before they take on Śuṣṇa. In b both Ge and WG have complex
and fanciful interpretations of the phrase ápi kárṇe. In VIII.97.12 the same
expression seems to indicate close, intimate contact -- perhaps close enough to
whisper into someone’s ear. In my interpr. Uśanā is recapping their journey to him,
suggesting that they should come close enough to hear his intimate counsel.
Although of apparently identical (thematic) formation, dhámathaḥ and
varathaḥ are modally distinct, the first being an indicative present, the second a
15
subjunctive. Although it is tempting to take them both as subjunctives (as WG do),
the stem dháma- is robustly enough supplied with diagnostic forms (a number of
augmented 2nd/3rd sg.) that it would be hard for a poet to mistake the morphology. I
therefore assume there is a reason for the distinction in mood. Perhaps dhámathaḥ
presents a successful attack on Śuṣṇa as a given (though it has not yet happened), and
this success will have the further happy effect stated in d.

### 31.10  
Ge supplies a separate verb (“Lenke”) in pāda a, but this seems unnecessary,
since the subj. of b, the sage poet (kavíḥ) can have gone (ajagan) to the horses of a as
goal. The identity of the kaví- isn’t made clear, but I think the best candidate is Indra.
In I.121.12 he is urged to mount (tíṣṭhā) the easily yoked (horses) of the wind
(vā́tasya suyújaḥ, as here), while in I.130.9, addressed as kave, Indra went (ájagan) to
Uśanā, just as here. Indra is also said to be ‘seeking help’ (avasyú-) in IV.16.11 in
connection with the same story, also as here. In other words, all the phraseology
points to Indra as subject, with the sly twist that he is called kaví-, which evokes the
patronymic of one of the other participants, Uśanā Kāvya, who is also on many
occasions referred to as kaví-.
The plupf. ajagan may have anterior sense here. Kü (159) allows a value of
“fernere Vergangenheit” in this passage.

### 31.11  
The mixture of tenses and moods in this vs. is at first glance bewildering,
but I think the uses can be sorted out. We get, in order, a root aor. subj. (karat b), a
pres. injunc. (bhárat c), a pres. indic. (riṇāti c), and a future (saniṣyati d), as well as a
pf. part. (jūjuvā́ṃsam b) and a redupl. pres. part. (dádhat d). The vs. seems to be a
sort of “color commentary,” recounting the chariot race or contest with vivid
immediacy. The first hemistich, as I see it, contains a general prediction of what is
going to happen. Since karat is a subjunctive expressing prospective action, the perf.
part., generally used to express anteriority, does so here, but as a present action/state
(“[now] speeding”) anterior to the future expectation of karat (rather than a past
anterior as is usual). The second hemistich lays out in sequence a past action (bhárat
‘bore’), a present action (sáṃ riṇāti ‘restores’), and a future one (saniṣyati ‘will
gain’), with the participial (puró dádhat ‘putting in front’) reprising what has gone
before. Beyond this I cannot go, as I still do not understand what happens in the
Etaśa and sun’s chariot passages. The perplexing nature of this fragmentary myth can
be seen in the diametrically opposed translations it receives, with WG exactly
reversing the change in position of the chariot in b (from behind to in front, contra
Ge and me: from in front to behind). I cannot judge which is right.
Adding to the uncertainty is the lexeme sám √ri, which occurs in the RV only
here and three times in I.117 (4, 11, 19) of miraculous repairs of the Aśvins. Since
√ri means ‘let flow, dissolve’, I take sám as a preverb that both implicitly reverses
that action and expresses unity: ‘put back together’ à ‘restore’.
This is the last vs. before the return to the here-and-now, and the verbal
fireworks may mark a poetic climax.
16
## 32 Indra
As indicated in the publ. intro., although this hymn focuses on the Vṛtra myth,
the standard formulaic encapsulation of that myth -- áhann áhim “he/you slew the
serpent” -- does not appear in it. Instead there are formulaic transformations in the
early verses: 1d áva (dānaváṃ) han / 2cd áhim …, jaghanvā́n ... (the closest to the
standard formula, involving only morphological transformation of the verb) / 3b
(mṛgásya vádhar) jaghāna / 4d ní jaghāna (śúṣṇam).

### 32.1  
Old is disturbed by aramṇāḥ ‘brought to peace / to a stop’, when we would
expect Indra to releasing the waters to flow. I’m not sure this is a problem: since the
floods were hard pressed (badbadhānā́n), Indra could be soothing and quieting the
tormented waters. Cf. also in the previous hymn V.31.8 apáḥ … áramayaḥ “you
brought the waters to rest,” the same sentiment with the same root. However, it could
also be an example of alluding to a sub-surface word by the overt use of its opposite,
like bodháya- for *svāpáya in I.103.7; see comm. ad loc. In other words, aramṇāḥ
could be signaling ‘set in motion’ by opposition to its literal sense ‘bring to a stop’.
In any case the expected action is expressed later in the vs.: d sṛjó ví dhā́rā(h) “you
set loose the streams,” in a species of poetic repair. See also comm. on vs. 2.
Note the stylistic quirk of post-verbal preverb in ásrjo ̥ [/sṛjó] ví OBJ (pādas a,
d) versus ví … váḥ (c) and áva … han (d). The latter VP also contains a phonetic
figure in áva dānavám.
In c the usual placement of the rel. pronoun after at most one constituent is
precariously observed (if at all), and in any case the yád is descriptively found deep
in its clause. However, its placement (almost) conforms to the letter of the law: the
voc. indra is extraclausal for these purposes, and mahā́ntam … párvatam though
heavy is a single constituent. It’s the ví that may tip the balance towards noncompliance. On the other hand, the configuration PREV yá- VERB is so standard that
this may determine the position of yád here.
Technically speaking the opening clause of d may be part of the dependent
clause in c (“when you pried apart … (and) set loose …”), with áva dānaváṃ han the
sole main clause, but since in Vṛtra narratives there’s usually a cause-and-effect
relationship between opening the mountain and letting the waters flow, I think the
publ. tr. is the better choice.

### 32.2  
The first hemistich redeploys vocab. from the 1st vs.: 1) The two members of
the NP útsān … badbadhānā́n in pāda a were both found in 1ab, but not in the same
constituent. 2) áraṃhaḥ ‘you sent speeding’ in b rhymes with aramṇāḥ in 1b and is
its antonym. This antonymic pairing might support the suggestion floated just above,
that áramṇāḥ is meant to evoke its semantic opposite.
The function of the instr. ṛṭúbhiḥ is unclear. I take it as an instr. of extent of
time with the part. badbadhānā́n (so approx. also Ge; see his n. 2a, though I doubt
that a ref. to menses is involved: útsa- is one of the few masculine nouns for water
and water sources, so if the poet wanted to make that sort of reference, he could have
his pick of fem. nouns). WG take the instr. with the main verb (“sent speeding”),
17
with the sense that after their release the waters now flow regularly (“Du liessest die
… Quellen nach geregelten Zeitabläufen … auslaufen”). This is certainly possible,
though I somewhat favor the former because ṛṭúbhiḥ is nestled in the middle of the
NP útsān … badbadhānā́n.
The form ū́dhaḥ is contextually problematic. Formally it is the well-attested
nom./acc. ū́dhar, but I find it difficult to construe an acc. in this sentence. As an acc.,
it should be the obj. of áraṃhaḥ ‘sent speeding’, but the udder of the mountain
should not be subject to such an action, whereas it makes perfect sense as a locatival
expression. Both Ge and WG tr. as an acc. obj., but don’t explain what they think is
actually happening. I am inclined to take the form as a nonce locative, though I
recognize the strong arguments against this: 1) ū́dhar is very well anchored as a
nom./acc.; 2) this r/n stem has two reasonably well-attested locatives already, ū́dhan
and ū́dhani. Nonetheless, I wonder if ū́dhar could have been taken as belonging with
the sporadic -ar locatives like vanar ‘in the wood’, uṣar ‘at dawn’ (though the
presence of undoubted neut. acc. vádhar in the next vs. [3b] might make this harder).
It might be worth noting that ū́dhan(i) is confined to pāda end (except one late Xth
book ex.), whereas ū́dhar here is medial. Alternatively, and on second thought, if we
take ‘udder’ as referring to the contents of an udder, namely milk, it is possible to
interpret it as the acc. it appears to be. For a somewhat similar use of ū́dhaḥ as ‘milk’,
see IV.1.19. I would therefore suggest an alt. tr. by deleting the parenthetical “(in?)”
and adding a comma after “seasons”: “you … sent speeding the wellsprings that had
been hard pressed through the seasons, the udder [=milk] of the mountain.”
The ppl. práyuta- is variously rendered: Gr ‘achtlos, sorglos’, Ge ‘nachlässig’
(careless, negligent), WG “(alle und alles) verscheuchend” (scaring away). However
in all its occurrences it seems to mean ‘spread out, dispersed’. There are four
attestations in the RV. Two passages involve cows wandering without a herdsman
(III.57.1, X.27.8); in the third (III.55.4) Agni has been dispersed into various hearths
and lies spread out at a distance (śáye … práyutaḥ), very much like here (práyutaṃ
śáyānam). Since this root √yu means ‘separate, keep apart’, my suggested meaning is
closer to the root meaning than the suggestion registered above. It is also possible
that it does mean ‘scattered, dispersed’ here, if it is interpreted proleptically: after
having been smashed, the various parts of the serpent’s body lie spread across some
distance. A similar picture is given in I.32.7 purutrā́vṛtró aśayad vyàstaḥ “Vr̥tra lay
there, flung apart in many pieces,” with a form of √śi as here. I would then suggest
an alternative tr. “having smashed the serpent (so it was) lying dispersed.”
V.32.2–3: An etymological sequence -- táviṣīm (2d), táviṣībhiḥ (3b), távyān (3d) --
that also builds to a climax, from singular ‘(a) power’ to plural ‘powers’ to the
comparative ‘more powerful’, all associated with Indra.
The sequence of vs.-init. t(i)yá- cid ‘that very one’ discussed in the publ. intro.
begins in 3a with t(i)yásya cid (and continues with t(i)yáṃ cid in 4a, 5a, 6a, 8a). Note
that it follows distracted vs.-init. t(u)vám in 2a and second-position cid in 2c:
combining the two produces, by variation, t(i)yáṃ cid. That cid in 2c follows áhim
‘serpent’ provides the referent for the t(i)yá- forms to follow. The sequence comes to
18
a temporary close in vs. 6, with táṃ cid opening pāda c a variant of t(i)yáṃ cid
opening 6a. There is then a brief revival of the phrase in 8a, after skipping a vs.

### 32.3  
In c ékaḥ … apratíḥ “alone (and) unopposable” applies to (the unnamed)
Vṛtra, but these two words appear elsewhere similarly juxtaposed but applied to
opposing referents: IV.17.19 bhū́rīṇy éko apratī́ni hanti “alone he smashes the many
unopposable things” and VIII.90.5 tváṃ vr̥trā́ṇi haṃsy apratī́ny éka íd “You, alone,
smash the unopposable obstacles.” This is another example of this hymn taking
standard phraseology and turning it on its head. Note that an almost identical phrase,
ékaḥ … ápratītaḥ (again with the two words in the same case with the same referent),
is applied to Indra in 9b in the triumphant announcement of his universal superiority
(see publ. intro.). Though Vṛtra thought (mányamānaḥ) he had these qualities in our
3c, Indra possesses them for real -- as shown by the phraseological transfer from the
one to the other.

### 32.4  
The major problem in this vs. is the identity and syntactic affiliation of the
gen. pl. eṣām. The standard opinion, found in Ge, Scar (100), and WG, takes it as
referring to the gods and construed with svadháyā. There are several arguments
against this. First, the gods are never mentioned or even alluded to elsewhere in the
hymn (though goddess(es) are found in 9c and 10a). Second, though svadháyā √mad
is a remarkably common locution (I.64.4, 108.12, 154.4; III.4.7=7.8; VII.47.3;
X.14.3, 7, 15.4, 124.8), svadháyā never has a dependent gen. in those passages. The
standard opinion is also hard-pressed to make sense out of the phrase. Ge takes
svadhā́- here as ‘Lebenselement’ and further glosses this as water, but even if
“reveling in the Lebenselement/water of the gods” were a possible tr. of this phrase,
it is a notion that seems foreign to the Vṛtra myth. Scar and WG have a more
reasonable interpr. -- that Vṛtra is reveling in what actually belongs by nature to the
gods, that is, as WG say in their n., “Der Dämon usurpiert die Natur der Götter.” But
this still requires conjuring up the gods out of thin air and assuming that the audience
could do so too, on the basis of an unemphatic, unaccented gen. pl. pronoun. And
again the image produced is not a standard part of the Vṛtra myth.
My solution starts, appropriately, by seeking a referent in the context;
dānavásya in the 2nd hemistich seems a reasonable choice. Although dānavá- never
appears in the plural in the RV, this stem (related to dā́nu-, the name of Vṛtra’s
mother, which I consider a backformation from the demonic ethnonym; see comm.
ad I.32.9) names “eine Dämonen-Klasse,” as Mayrhofer remarks (EWA s.v. dā́nu-),
and fluctuation between sg. and pl. can happen in such cases (as with the Maruts,
plural, versus the Marut flock, singular). The pl. is found in the AV (AVŚ IV.24.2
[with vs. 1 referring to Indra as vṛtrahán-), X.6.10; AVP IV.39.3 [≅AVŚ IV.24.2],
VII.12.8, XVI.43.2) and elsewhere in early Vedic as well as later (esp. epic) Skt.;,
and the corresponding Avestan dānauua-, also the name of an inimical group, is
found in the pl. in Yt. 5.73 and 13.37–38. In the latter it is associated with vǝrǝϑra-
(vǝrǝϑrǝm dānunąm). It therefore seems likely that even in the RV dānavá- is not
simply a designation of Vṛtra but of the class of beings to which he belongs, and the
19
absence of the plural in the RV is either due to accident or a desire to concentrate on
the arch-Dānava, Vṛtra. The gen. here may be construed either with t(i)yáṃ cid (“this
one of theirs”) or be a free-floating indication of appurtenance, as the publ. tr. takes it.
Or indeed, because eṣām is in (modified) Wackernagel’s position, it could have
originated with any of the descriptors of Vṛtra found later in the verse.
With svadháyā freed from its supposed genitive dependent, the phrase
svadháyā mádantam now makes sense in a Vṛtra context. He is “drunk on his own
power” on the basis of his faulty assessment of this power presented in 3c. The
locution recalls a similar one in the great Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32, where in 6a Vṛtra is
described as ayoddhéva durmádaḥ “like a non-warrior badly drunk” (lit. ‘having bad
intoxication’), foolishly challenging a far more powerful opponent. (I use ‘drunk’ in
both instances, instead of our more usual ‘exhilarated’, because it better captures in
English the state of mind of the one so affected.)
The sense of vṛ́ṣa-prabharmā is secured by 5c prábhṛtā mádasya “at the
proffering of the invigorating (soma)” -- hence, as Gr takes it (sim. WG, Scar, and
me), “dem der kräftige (Soma) vorgesetzt ist.” This also makes sense in context --
Indra needs to receive the soma before smashing Vṛtra -- and is reinforced by the
usual sense of the lexeme prá √bhṛ ‘bring forward, present’. However, Ge renders it
“wie ein Bulle angreifend (?),” and I was tempted somewhat in this direction, to
‘having the bearing/deportment of a bull’; prá √bhṛ can, esp. in the middle, mean
‘display, present oneself’. I think both possibilities are latent in this word, and we can
view the anchoring 5c prábhṛtā mádasya as another example of poetic repair -- or
perhaps a poetic thumb on the scales, pressing the choice of one of the options over
the other. It is then itself somewhat undercut by 7c vájrasya prábhṛtau “at the
proffering of the mace.”
In c note the echo … -prabharmā … bhā́maṃ.
The last word of this vs. is śúṣṇam. Generally, of course, this is the name of a
different opponent of Indra’s, and a number of tr. take it so here. But I think it has its
etymological sense ‘snorter’ (√śvas ‘snort’; cf. EWA s.v.). Our poet is once again
toying with us: withholding the real name of the opponent in this hymn, Vṛtra, he is
falsely offering a different possibility here.

### 32.5  
Unlike 4a where I separate the identically positioned enclitic gen. from the
following instr., I do take asya here with krátubhiḥ, which, unlike svadháyā, is
frequently found with a gen. With Ge I think the referent is Indra (contra WG, who
take it to be Vṛtra-Śuṣṇa).
I take níṣattam as proleptic, depicting Vṛtra’s position after the action of ní
jaghāna in the immediately preceding pāda (4d). With Ge I consider 5a essentially a
continuation of 4d and supply the same verb.
In b I supply ‘thinking himself’ with amarmáṇaḥ on the basis of 3c and of the
almost identical III.32.4cd … viveda, amarmáṇo mányamānasya márma. The verb in
b, vidát, is accented because of the following íd (see Gr s.v. íd 5, though there are
fewer clear examples than he presents, since many of them are also pāda-initial).
20
The Indra-reference shifts from 3rd to 2nd between the first and second
hemistich, but this is scarcely novel.

### 32.6  
Though Gr refuses to tr., katpayám seems to contain the pejorative kaprefix; see EWA s.v. ká1
, p. 285.
For ápa √gṝ ‘taunt’ see comm. ad V.29.4. As Oberlies (Relig. I.401) points
out, this gerund depicts a pre-battle boasting/insulting match -- trash talk (needless to
say, this last is not Oberlies’s formulation).
What to do with uccaíḥ is unclear. Most take it with the gerund apagū́rya; so
Ge “hoch ausholend,” with his interpr. of the gerund as belonging to a √gṝ ‘hold
out’; with the assignment to ápa √gṝ ‘insult’, Schaeffer “nachdem er laut
Schmähreden geführt hat”; Oberlies “nachdem er ihn [zuvor] mit lauter Stimme
geschmäht hatte”; WG “indem er ihn von oben herab verspottete.” The Schaeffer /
Oberlies interpr. of the adverb as ‘loud’ is appealing, but uccā́is always positional in
the RV. The WG interpr. recognizes this fact, but insulting from above seems an odd
activity. I take it rather with jaghāna. A fatal blow is more likely to come from above
than a taunt, and it is notable how often in the hymn it is emphasized that Vṛtra was
smashed down: 1d áva … han, 4d ní jaghāna, 5a níṣattam, 7d adhamám, 8d ní …
āvṛnak. To depict Indra as correspondingly acting above provides the thematic
complement. Note also úd … índraḥ … vádhar yámiṣṭa (“… held up …”) in the next
hemistich, 7ab.

### 32.7  
vádhar appears here in the same metrical position as in 3b. There the weapon
was Vṛtra’s (which Indra struck away), while here it is Indra’s. Another example of
vocab. first used of Vṛtra reassigned to Indra -- like ékaḥ … apratíḥ in 3a and the
similar expression in 9a. Indeed, ápratītam appears here in b, characterizing Indra’s
weapon, which is ‘might’ itself (sáhaḥ). The use of sáhaḥ as an appositive here
supports my view of the same usage of this word in V.31.3 (contra Ge [/WG]). There
it characterizes Indra himself. It is even possible that sáho ápratītam here is
nominative and an appositive to índraḥ, rather than an acc. and appositive to vádhar,
though the juxtaposition of the two terms in b makes that unlikely. In any case note
the similarity in phrasing: 31.3a # úd yát sáhaḥ ... 32.7ab # úd yád ... sáhaḥ; the verbs
in these clauses are also rhyming: 31.3 ájaniṣṭa, 32.7 yámiṣṭa.
As noted ad vs. 4, the poetic repair effected by prábhṛtā mádasya in 5c is
somewhat muddied by 7c vájrasya prábhṛtau. What exactly this latter phrase means
is not clear. I doubt that Ge’s “im Schlag mit der Keule” is correct, since ‘strike’ is
not a standard sense of prá √bhṛ (the closest we get is ‘bear down on’). WG’s “beim
Vorführen des Vajra” is similar to my “at the proffering of the mace” (‘proffer’
having been chosen to match the tr. of this lexeme in 4c and 5c). The English idiom
“present arms” is a direct correspondent, though the action in the English phrase is a
gesture of respect, not (as here) of intimidation. The point of both úd … vádhar
yámiṣṭa “held up his weapon” and vájrasya prábhṛtau seems to be to show Vṛtra the
unbeatable power of the vájra-. See also the mahatā́vadhéna in 8c.
21

### 32.8  
The verb ā́dat ‘took’ is superficially active, though the idiom ā́√dā ‘take’ is
ordinarily middle. As was seen already by Wackernagel, the form must be a remarked form of the older 3rd sg. middle root aor. The underlying form would be *ā́da,
which can represent either an old -t-less 3rd sg. mid. ending (as in impf. *áduha à
áduha+t) or, more likely, the simplification by degemination of an old *ā́d+ta with
an originally -t-full ending. Of course this preform should have yielded *ā́tta, but
the fact that all other forms of the root aor. have a single d- (ádāt, etc.) could have
induced the geminate to simplify (in this metrically non-diagnostic position after ā)
and restore the d of the root. (Kü [Stativ 50–51] bases the -d-form on 3rd pl. ā́diran*.)
In any case the t-less *ā́da would have been activized like the t-less middle
imperfects of the áduhat type. The resulting “active” stem could spread elsewhere; cf.
1st pl. ā́dāma in nearby V.30.15. For disc. and previous lit. see Kü ref. above. The
form is very differently explained by Old, who assigns it to ā √dṛ ‘tear out’ by way
of the sandhi form *ā́daḥ (< 2nd/3rd sg. *ā́dar) and what seems to me a somewhat
sketchy remarking with -t (as if 2nd sg. = *ā́das, so 3rd sg. should = *ā́dat?). The
morphological machinery required seems too complex for its purpose, to avoid a
slightly aberrant use of ā́√dā, and since ā́√dṛ doesn’t take personal objects (Old
finds one late ex.), its usage here would be aberrant as well. Ge assigns it to ā́√dā,
as do WG (with ref. to Kü, Stativ).
For the third time in the hymn, Vṛtra is described as śáyānam ‘lying’, each
time in the same pāda-final position (2c, 6a, 8a), and pāda-final níṣattam (5a) ‘sunk,
lit. sitting, down’ may be a sort of semantic pun on this positional characterization. In
I.32, the Indra-Vṛtra hymn with clear phraseological and thematic parallels to this
one, √śi ‘lie’ is also Vṛtra’s signature verb, esp. describing his position after his
defeat, rather than before, as here.
Ge suggests that árṇam is an anticipatory haplology (not his term) for
*arṇapám ‘drinking the flood’, immediately before madhupám. He is followed by
Scar (313 n. 444) and WG. I see no reason to accept this. The stem árṇa- exists; the
stem *arṇapá- (/-pā́-) does not. More importantly, Vṛtra is known for confining the
waters, not drinking them. As was just noted, √śi ‘lie’ is a defining verb for Vṛtra in
both I.32 and this hymn. In the former he lies there as the released waters stream
over him (I.32.8ab … amuyā́śáyānam, … áti yanty ā́paḥ; cf. also 8d, 10). Here, in
complementary fashion, he is depicted as lying over them before his defeat.
Although most take atrá- as a PN, I still prefer the older derivation (see, e.g.,
Gr) from √ad ‘eat’ with simplification of the geminate (*at-trá-), pace EWA s.v.
átri-. It does not have to have anything to do with the seer Atri (átri-), but átrin-
‘voracious’ is, in my opinion, derivationally connected.

### 32.9  
As noted in the publ. intro., the question káḥ … varāte “who can obstruct …?”
covertly introduces Vṛtra, the defeated enemy who remained unnamed in the first 8
vss., by way of the verb built to the root √vṛ ‘obstruct’ that furnishes Vṛtra’s
transparent name. The implicit answer is “no one, since Obstacle himself could not.”
22

### 32.10  
The devī́svádhitiḥ in pāda a is much disputed, and for good reason. The
stem svádhiti- means ‘axe, hatchet’, but the presence of such an implement here is
puzzling. Ge, flg. Sāy., wants to take this instance of the stem as independent and
equivalent to svadhā́- ‘autonomous power’. Given the occurrence of svadhā́- in 4a
and the derived possessive adj. svadhā́van- in pāda d of this same vs., it is hard not to
suspect some connection. On the other hand, svádhiti- ‘axe’ is too well established
for that sense not to be the first reading, or at least to intrude, and, furthermore, pāda
a is twinned with b, which also contains a thing not a quality (and is also a pun).
I therefore think we are dealing with a pun. On the one hand, even the
“heavenly hatchet,” which sounds like a formidable weapon, bows to powerful Indra.
The hatchet’s submission to Indra is a measure of his might and may also put this
weapon into his hands. There may even be another intertextual reference to I.32, as
Teigo Onishi suggested to me. In I.32.5c Vṛtra lies “like branches hewn apart by an
axe” (skándhāṃsīva kúliśenā vívṛkṇā). Though this is a simile, not a direct reference
to the narrative, and though a different word for axe, kúliśa-, is used, this imagery
may be a common trope in the Vṛtra story. As for the reading “the goddess
Autonomous Power,” the phonological similarity and possible identical formation of
svádhiti and svadhā́- (with sva- looking like a first cmpd member in both, and -dhiresembling -dhā́-, with connection to √dhā at least possible [the etymology of
svádhiti- is “nicht klar” acdg. to EWA s.v.]) make such a reading very easy in this
context.
As just noted, pāda b also seems to contain a pun. The way (gātú-) yields to
Indra, but, acdg. to the Anukramaṇī, Gātu Ātreya is also the poet of this hymn --
though since only this one hymn in the RV is attributed to him, the name may have
been plucked from this context.
This vs. contains another example of the transfer of vocabulary from Vṛtra to
Indra. As we saw, in 4a Vṛtra was intoxicated by (his false assumption about) his
autonomous power (svadháyā mádantam), but here it is Indra who possesses
autonomous power (svadhā́van-) for real. With svádhiti in pāda a also (partly)
expressing Indra’s acquisition of this power, his triumph is complete. This sets the
stage for the transition to the last two verses, where the poet announces his own
contact with Indra’s fame and what that will mean for his own good fortune.

### 32.11  
I think that this vs. is structured by the implicit contrast between jātá- and
náviṣṭha-, both used of Indra, but I seem to be alone in this (though see Gr’s lapidary
comment s.v. náviṣṭha). Ge (/WG) take náviṣṭham as adverbial (Ge “aufs neue,” WG
“zum letzten Mal”). This is certainly possible, but if it is taken as modifying Indra,
the sense becomes more complex and interesting. In the first hemistich “I” announce
the famous stable Indra of myth and authority, born (jātám) for these roles and
continuously occupying them, but in the second hemistich it is the Indra of the ritual
who’s the focus -- the Indra who is newly brought to every new ritual and whose
epiphany is like a new creation every time, caused by the ritual actions themselves.
23

### 32.12  
I take maghā́as object of both yātáyantam and dádatam; it is neatly
positioned between the two participles. Ge renders ṛtuthā́yātáyantam as “dass du
pünktlich vergilst” (repay, requite), but this is not a standard meaning of √yat. WG’s
“dass du … die (verdiente) Stellung verschaffst” is closer to the sense of the root, but
lacks the obj. one expects with an -áya-transitive. A locution very close to my interpr.
is found in IX.39.2 jánāya yātáyann íṣaḥ “arranging the refreshments for the people.”
Contra Old, who assigns garhate to √grabh, I take it to √gṛh ‘complain’; see
EWA s.v. GARH and esp. Hoffmann “Vedisch grh̥ 'klagen” (MSS 14 [1959]: 35–38
= Aufs. 439–41) cited there. There is likely a phonological play between this verb
and jagṛbhre in the previous, twinned, verse.

### 33–34  
Indra
These two hymns attributed to Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya are full of puzzles,
many insoluble.
## 33 Indra
Although the general outline of this hymn is pretty straightforward, it is full
of interpretational problems and grammatical and syntactic obscurities, and the meter
is very messy.

### 33.1  
The first hemistich begins and ends with an etymological figure: #máhi mahé
… taváse átavyān#. The taváse also repeats the same form from the preceding pāda.
I supply śrávaḥ ‘praise’ with máhi, since this is a frequent collocation. Sim.
Ge, though Kü (258) and WG take it as adverbial.
With Ge (/WG uncertainly) I reluctantly interpr. pāda-final nṝ́n as a gen. pl.
(or standing for a gen. pl.), as is sometimes necessary. Old interpr. it rather as a dat.
pl., which I don’t understand.
With Ge I construe itthā́with taváse; I assume it adds strengthening to that
repeated word. Kü (258) instead takes it as an expression of the method of praise:
“auf diese Weise,” so apparently also WG, though muted (“also”).
In the 2nd hemistich the referent of asmai is at issue. The standard view (Ge,
Old, WG) is that it refers to the singer, the “not so strong” I. In Ge’s interpr. this
involves rendering asmai sumatím … cikéta as “der … diesem (Sänger) seine Gunst
zugedacht hat.” That sumatí- could refer to Indra’s benevolence is easy, but
‘zudenken’ as an interpr. of cikéta is hard. This pf. stem ordinarily means either ‘take
note of’ or ‘appear as’ (latter generally middle). WG give the pf. its usual meaning
but this leaves asmai without much to do in the clause. By contrast, I take Indra as
the referent of asmai. It is not rare for enclitic forms of this pronoun to refer to the
subject: a reflexive is not necessary. Under this interpr. sumatí- has its common
meaning ‘good thought’ = poem, and Indra takes cognizance of this sumatí-, which is
“for him.” Cf. VII.31.10 prácetase prá sumatíṃ krṇ̥ udhvam where the sumatí- of the
poets is intended for a god (Indra, in fact) in the dative who is characterized as prá
√cit.
24

### 33.2  
The (pseudo-)participle dhiyasāná- clearly patterns with dīdhi
ye in 1a, hence
my complementary ‘being conjured up’. I take it to mean that Indra’s epiphany at the
sacrifice is brought about by our chants (arkaíḥ), that his appearance there is literally
“thought up” by our thoughts. This notion is close to what is found in the previous
hymn V.32.11 (at least by my interpr.), that every sacrifice brings a “newest Indra,”
that the Indra of the sacrificial epiphany is newly created by sacrificial activity every
time. The standard interpr. of dhiyasāná- by Ge [/WG] is more pedestrian: Indra
becomes attentive (“aufmerksam geworden”) through our hymns. The other
occurrence of the stem, in X.32.1, in my opinion fits my interpr., but to be honest
neither passage is absolutely clear. As for the stem itself, dhiyasāná- does not pattern
with the majority of -asāná- stems discussed ad IV.3.6, and I do not have a
satisfactory account of it.
The sá tvám phrase does not conform to my rules for the use of sá with 2nd ps.
reference (see my “Sá figé”), and I likewise can’t account for it.
The yā́(ḥ) beginning the 2nd hemistich is problematic. If it is a rel. prn. it has
to be a fem. pl., and there is no obvious referent in the context (hárīṇām in b
belonging to a masc. stem hári-). Therefore with Ge (/WG) and, very cautiously, Old,
I take it as a verb form, belonging to √yā ‘drive’. (Note the past part. yātā́ḥ in 5b.)
Because it is followed by two subjunctives, vákṣaḥ and sakṣi (the latter a “siimperative” derived from a subjunctive), I take yā́(ḥ) as subjunctive as well. Indeed,
if it is read yāah, the extra syllable would fix the meter of this pāda -- but since the
hymn is full of metrical disturbances, this is not a strong argument. Neither Ge nor
WG indicates how they interpr. the morphology, but both tr. as an imperative, as they
do the two following verbs.
Both Ge and WG take aryáḥ and jánān as parallel acc. pl., while I make aryáḥ
a gen. sg. dependent on jánān. There is no way to tell; Thieme (Fremdl., 11 n. 2)
refuses to deal with the passage at all.

### 33.3  
The sense of the first hemistich -- that by reciting the (yoking-)formulation
we will do our part to ensure that your (Indra’s) horses will be yoked -- is fairly clear,
but the syntax is messy. First, it’s couched as a triple negative construction: “it is not
that X will not happen because of not-Y,” which already puts it on the edge of
parsability. The parsing problem is slightly increased by the fact that the content of
the negative “that” clause is expressed through a periphrasis involving a negated
participle+copula (áyuktāsaḥ … ásan “will be/remain unyoked”). Then, the position
of yád is utterly non-standard, being found deep in the clause, after several different
constituents, right before the final word. I tried various ways to produce a
conforming subordinate clause from the text, but failed. The publ. tr. “if it's for lack
of a (yoking) formulation” (as if abrahmátā yád were a separate embedded clausette)
gives the appearance of (almost) succeeding, but it doesn’t accurately represent the
text (though I still think it might represent the purport of this odd word order). A
more accurate tr. would be “Since these horses …. because of a lack …,” as the
dependent clause for the main clause in cd. I remain disturbed by the structure of this
dep. cl.
25
A separate problem is the abhí asmád in pāda a. The abhí is stranded in the
middle of the pāda (though immed. after the caesura) and in any case has no verb
from which it could have been separated in tmesis. In the absence of anything else to
do with it, the default option seems to be to construe it with asmád, and this phrase
has long (see Old’s reff.) been compared to I.139.8 asmád abhí, likewise in the
middle of the pāda though in opposite order. The problem is that abhí as a
preposition seems otherwise only to take the acc. Nonetheless, connecting the two
seems the best bet, with a meaning such as “with regard to us” or, better reflecting
the ablative, my “because of us.” So Old, WG. Cf. also Humbach et al. (Gāthās…
and the Other Old Avestan Texts, II.118), ad Y 35.5 (Yasna Haptaŋhaiti) ahmaṭ hiiaṭ
aibī, a phrase meaning (in his view) “which is with us,” with which he compares both
our passage and I.139.8. However, Narten (YH, 271–72), fld. by Hinze (Zoroastrian
Liturgy, 77-78), interprets this three-word phrase, occurring twice in the YH (Y 35.5,
40.1), as containing a postposition aibī governing the neut. acc. hiiaṭ not the abl.
ahmaṭ, with the whole meaning “from us towards which,” thus “as far as we are
concerned” (Hintze, 78).

### 33.4  
Another troubled vs., though the first hemistich is more transparent than the
second. The first thing to notice is that the accent on cakártha in b indicates that b
must still be under the domain of yád in pāda a, as parallel dependent clauses. Ge
(/WG) attempt to make initial purū́a single-word main clause on which they both
depend (“Viel ist, was …”). This assumes that purū́is a neut. sg. here. Although the
existence of a neut. sg. in -ū is standard doctrine (see Lanman, Noun Inflec., 406–7,
AiG III.145, etc.), this grammatical truism rests primarily on Gr’s identification of
twelve forms of purū́as sg. (see Lanman and AiG), but in only one instance, the late
X.94.5, does this seem the likely interpr. (There is also one form of urū́and, for
Lanmann, two of míthū, which is better taken as an adv.) I do not therefore think that
-ū is a possible neut. sg. ending, except, perhaps, in X.94.5. Here the most obvious
way to construe purū́is with pāda-final neut. pl. ukthā́, the subject of sánti. The
attempt to impose a singular interpr. on purū́, as antecedent for the following relative
clause with plural subject, yields the awkward rendering of Ge: “Viel ist, was deine
Preislieder sind” with mismatch of number (WG more elaborate, but not less clumsy).
For b the only adjustment is to carry purū́over from pāda a and supply a term
like kṛtā́ṇi or kármāṇi, easily generated from cakártha: “many are (the deeds) you
have done …”
The 2nd hemistich is more problematic. The first question is how to relate pāda
c and d. Ge takes them as parallel independent clauses with the same verb tatakṣé,
while WG takes it as a single cl. (also Kü 207). With Ge I take them as two clauses
and agree that they share a verb, but think that c is a dependent clause still under the
control of yád in pāda a and parallel to ab, with d the main clause resuming them all.
A related issue is the apparent change of person from 2nd sg. address to Indra
in ab and (supposed) 3rd sg. reference to him in cd. The only evidence for this 3rd ps.
reference is the verb tatakṣé, which is one of only two medial forms of this pf. in the
RV. It has no obvious medial value here, and in fact the presence of a dat. of benefit
26
(sū́ryāya) eliminates one possible way of accounting for the middle form. (Kü [207]
suggests a “Bedeutungskomponente” ‘(auch) in seinem eigenen Interesse’, which
seems a bit desperate.) The puzzle of the middle is somewhat reduced if we interpret
the form as second sg. mid. The presumed preform *tatakṣ-ṣé would surely come out
as our tatakṣé, and it would make sense to substitute this nonce middle form for the
non-transparent active 2nd sg., which should be *tatákṣ-tha à *tataktha -- whereas
the active 3rd sg. tatákṣa is non-problematic and indeed well attested. So the supposed
change of person and the middle form can be accounted for by the same explanation.
After confronting these formal issues, there remains the very knotty problem
of what the hemistich is expressing, and part of this depends on whether the relations
between Indra and Sūrya here are friendly or hostile: elsewhere they are sometimes
one, sometimes the other. (Here I think they are friendly.) A syntactic questions is
whether nā́ma is the only object of tatakṣé or if the clause in c (if it is a separate
clause) has a different object. Ge opts for the former choice, I for the latter, and I also
think that the verb is used in different senses in c and d, positive in c, negative in d.
In c I supply purū́again from a and tentatively supply ‘paths’ as the object,
bringing to mind the various passages in which a god (usually Varuṇa) makes or digs
out paths for the sun to follow through the sky -- e.g., I.24.8 urúṃ hí rā́jā váruṇaś
cakā́ra, sū́ryāya pánthām ánvetavā́u, VII.87.1 rádat pathó váruṇo sū́ryāya. In one
late passage (X.111.3) it is Indra who is named as pathikṛ́t sū́ryāya “pathmaker for
the sun.” It’s also worth noting that, leaving aside this one, 5 of the other 10
occurrences of the dat. sū́ryāya occur in a path-making context. Though, admittedly,
I have no parallels using the root √takṣ ‘fashion, carve’, it seems in the right general
semantic range. As for ókasi své this can refer either to Indra’s or to Sūrya’s “own
home,” since both of them inhabit the same celestial realms; I favor the Sun’s.
As for d, as is recognized by all, the similarly phrased X.23.2 áva kṣnaumi
dā́sasya nā́ma cit must be compared. In that passage Indra says “I whet down even
the name of the barbarian,” in my tr. Though this passage is the obvious
comparandum, it is hardly transparent in itself or in its bearing on our passage, and in
fact I think the two passages are less close semantically than their joint isolation
invites us to think. In X.23.2 Indra seems to be boasting about his victory over the
Dāsa, which is so complete that even his name is obliterated or at least violently
ground down. But √takṣ generally refers to creating something by carving off bits or
fashioning in some other way. Perhaps here it means that Indra, just by fighting (and
presumably defeating) the Dāsa, has still made the latter’s name conspicuous, as if by
carving it into a surface. (Or perhaps, closer to X.23.2, Indra has obliterated the
Dāsa’s name as if by gouging it out of a surface.) But either of these interpr. raises a
crucial question: what would it mean literally to carve a name into (or gouge it out
of) a surface before the existence of writing?!
In any case I think that the contrastive positive/negative use of √takṣ in c and
d makes the verb sit uneasily in both and poses special challenges to the audience to
decode the metaphor in each pāda.
As should be obvious, I do not consider my interpr. of this vs. or most of its
part settled and sure. I also don’t understand the sequence of ideas. As indicated in
27
the publ. intro., I think that the first pāda, positing many hymns for Indra, may refer
to the existence of competing (Ārya) sacrifices. The second pāda cites his activities
as a warrior on earth; the dat. “for the cow” may either mean that Indra has fought in
order to obtain cows (for the Ārya warriors he is fighting beside) or that he has won
meadows for (the Āryas’) cows to graze in -- in either case advancing the Ārya cause.
In contrast c sets out his beneficial cosmic activity -- keeping the sun on track (if my
interpr. of the details of the pāda is correct), which in turn is beneficial to mankind.
In at least the first two cases I think there’s an implicit Ārya presence, which
contrasts with the explicit Dāsa in d.

### 33.5  
What constitutes the predicate in ab is disputed. Flg. Old and the model of
VII.30.4, I take ab as constituting an “X and which Y” construction, with doubled
“and which Y” (more accurately schematized as “X and which Y and (which) Z”).
The predication is simply te “of you, yours,” an assertion of possession. It is
predicated of us (vayám té) as well as “which men” (yé ca náraḥ) and “(which)
chariots” (… ca ráthāḥ) -- literally “we and which men and (which) chariots are
yours.” Both of the latter two are further characterized in b, the men by a participial
phrase (śárdho jajñānā́ḥ “having been born as a troop”), the chariots by a simple
participle (yātā́ḥ ‘driven, driving’). WG seem to follow this interpr. as well, though
with some filigree in the middle that seems over-elaborate. Klein (DGRV I.49 n. 10)
sets out the schema as above and tr. sim. (I.196). Ge by contrast takes the predication
to be śárdho jajñānā́ḥ, applied to both us and the men, with the chariots left hanging:
essentially “we and the man are born as your troop, and the chariots.” Besides the
syntactic isolation of the chariots in Ge’s rendering, it also unduly extends the
reference of śárdho jajñānā́ḥ. The “men” of pāda a must be, as often, the Maruts, and
it is only they who “have been born as a troop,” not also us. The word gaṇá- is
almost exclusive to the Maruts, and the birth of the Maruts is a common topic (e.g.,
I.64.2, 4).
The phrase rátho ná yātáḥ appears in I.141.8. See comm. there, where I
suggest that a yātá- rátha- is a particular kind of chariot, perhaps one meant for long
journeys, rather than referring to the current state of motion of any specific chariot(s).
The problem with pāda c is the clash between the voc. ahiśuṣma and the 3rd sg.
verb jagamyāt with its nom. subj. sátvā. The stem sátvan- in the sg. is almost always
used of Indra, and in this context -- a hymn dedicated to Indra and both praising his
powers and begging him to deploy them on our behalf -- it is difficult to imagine that
we would then express a wish that some indefinite or at least unidentified warrior
should come our way instead (as in Ge’s “Uns möge … ein Krieger kommen”; WG
almost identical). Surely Indra is the warrior we want! This would require a shift
from 2nd to 3rd ps. ref. between ab and cd, but this is not problematic. What is
problematic is the voc., which should also refer to Indra. Gr solves this by positing a
bahuvr. ahiśuṣma-sátvan- ‘whose warriors have a serpent’s hiss’ (‘dessen Helden
wie Schlangen zischen’). Unfortunately the accent is definitively against this interpr.
I have no neat solution, but am firm in my belief that the sátvā is Indra. For a similar
28
vocative/nominative cross, see vasavānaḥ in the next vs. (6a); these two problems
may be connected.
I take the simile in d as an elaborate pun, playing on the double sense of the
three members, bhága-, hávya-, and prabhṛthá-. The first can be both the name of
the god Fortune and a common noun ‘portion’; hávya- can belong to √hū, hvā ‘call’
or √hu ‘pour, offer’; pra √bhṛ can refer either to the presentation of arms (and the
carrying off of booty) in a hostile situation or to the presentation of offerings at a
sacrifice. Cf. the double sense of prá √bhṛ in nearby V.32.4–5, 7 and comm. there.
The first meanings just given for the three items coalesce into one simile, the second
ones in another.

### 33.6  
The first question about this vs. is the structure of the first hemistich. The
standard interpr. (Ge, WG, also Old, Klein [DGRV I.263–64]; see also Kulikov -yapres., 580) takes the two pādas as separate clauses with ca conjoining them. There
are several problems with this division: 1) ca is not comfortably at home as clauseconjoiner and usually conjoins NPs; 2) with nṛmṇā́ni in the domain of the 2nd clause,
it must be the obj. of the participle (or pseudo-participle; see below) nṛtámānaḥ, but
non-causative forms of √nṛt ‘dance’ are never transitive. Both difficulties disappear
if we take nṛmṇā́ni ca as conjoined with immediately preceding ójaḥ as joint subject
of the first clause in the hemistich (so also Lowe, 251; see below). The phonological
play between nṛmṇā́ni and nṛtámāṇaḥ may account for the postponing of nṛmṇā́ni till
the second pāda, inserting a pāda break between the two conjoined nouns. This
phonologically driven positioning may also help account for the very late positon of
hí. The loc. prn. tvé ordinarily takes initial position in its clause/verse line, and hí
would be expected to follow in Wackernagel’s position. But the whole structure may
have been shifted rightwards to allow nṛmṇā́ni to neighbor nṛtámāṇaḥ.
nṛtámāṇa- presents difficulties of its own, even after its supposed object has
been eliminated. This participle is the only occurrence of the supposed them. aor. (or
6th cl. pres.) in all of Sanskrit. Although, since all forms of this root are poorly
attested in the RV, this is not necessarily problematic on its own, the -ya-present (1x
in RV) does continue post-RV (see Kulikov, Vedic -ya-presents, 578-80), and
moreover all other verb forms to this root in Vedic are active. Lowe (Participles in
Rigvedic Sanskrit, 250–51) suggests that it is an artificial form based on the wellattested splv. nṛ́tama- ‘most manly, most heroic’. This is an attractive hypothesis --
among other things, Indra is frequently called nṛ́tama-; the word regularly appears in
immediate post-caesura position, as nṛtámāṇaḥ does here; and it would be playing
not merely phonologically but also etymologically with nṛmṇā́ni. Lowe (p. 152) tr.
“being the most heroic,” reflecting its nonce jury-rigged participial form. I do think,
however, that the form also consciously references √nṛt ‘dance’. Indra is regularly
called a nṛtú- ‘dancer, prancer’, and note the pun involving nṛ́- ‘man’ in VI.63.5 nárā
nṛtū (of the Aśvins). I would therefore modify the publ. tr. to “As the most manly [/
the prancing] immortal …”
In c rayím must be fem., as occasionally elsewhere, given the fem. adj. énīm.
29
The stem vásavāna- ‘possessing goods, winning goods’ (?) is attested 5x,
once as an unaccented voc. sg. vasavāna (X.22.15), otherwise accented and with
orthodox -a-stem forms, incl. nom. sg. vásavānaḥ (I.174.1). The form here looks of
course like a nom. sg. but lacks accent. Gr calls it “fälschlich unbetont”; Lub. gives it
an accent and a rightward star (vásavāno*). This seems the best course; I think an
attempt to assign it to different stem (perhaps an aberrant -as stem) is too elaborate,
esp. in this hymn with numerous “off” forms: see esp. the voc. ahiśuṣma for expected
nom. in 5c. The publ. tr. pays more attention to the lack of accent and tr. as voc.; it
would be equally possible to weigh the nom. sg. ending more heavily and tr. it as an
appositive subject: “as winner of goods, give us dappled wealth.” Despite the tr.
“winner of goods,” I do not think the stem contains a form of √van but is rather a
pseudo-participle (another one, but athematic) built to vásu- ‘good(s)’. Elsewhere I
render it ‘goods-lord’ and the like.
In d prá … stuṣe dā́nam “I will start up the praise for the gift” is an analytic
expansion of the noun dānastuti, which, however, is not attested in Vedic or, it seems,
anywhere else in Sanskrit lit., though the term is in common use in Vedic scholarship.
The last three (or possibly four) vss. in this hymn constitute such a dānastuti, and the
poet seems to signalling that it is coming up. In the publ. tr. I identify the arítuvimaghá- as Indra; I now would be more circumspect, since I now think the phrase
applies both to Indra and to the patrons praised in vss. (7 or) 8–10. See also aryáḥ in
9d.

### 33.7  
This vs. provides a transition between the praise-hymn proper and the
dānastuti. On the one hand, it straightforwardly makes requests of Indra, as hymnfinal vss. tend to do, and it begins with evā́, a frequent introducer of the final
summary vs., but it also turns its attention in cd to those who facilitate the sacrifice,
i.e., the patrons. The participle dádataḥ ‘giving’ that characterizes them is telling. Ge
suggests that the dānastuti begins with 7c and notes that like 7c the vss. of the
dānastuti begin with utá.
The meter of the first hemistich is badly mangled. Old blames the poet
“dessen Formgefühl unzweifelhaft schwach war.” But it may be a good strategy to
mark the new section with a metrical jolt. Curiously the vs. is mostly free of the
verbal knots that bedevil the earlier parts of the hymn.
Ge suggests plausibly that the “skin of the honey” is the skin on which the
soma is prepared.
V.33.8–10: As just noted, 7c begins with utá as do vss. 8–10, but those vss. of the
dānastuti proper are further unified, all beginning utá tyé mā.

### 33.8  
It is unclear whether the horses in ab and those in c are the same or different.
In the publ. tr. they are treated as the same; the standard tr. take them as separate
groups. The two occurrences of mā (a, c) may support the standard view, in which
case vahantu needs to be supplied in the first hemistich (so Ge, etc.).
30
I take saśce in pass. sense: “I am followed/accompanied.” Ge (/WG, also
Klein I.425) take it to mean “be in agreement with,” but I do not know of other
occurrences of √sac with this meaning. (Ge’s overelaborate set of explanatory
glosses in n. 8d and n. 2 to that n. may attest to his discomfort with it.) The
‘intentions” by which I am attended are G’s intentions to give; see the expansion on
krátu- in 9b. I think the point is not that the poet thinks it’s a good idea for G. to give
horses to him (that is, agrees with G), but that G’s intentions to give are the poet’s
escorts, as it were. (One is reminded of the curious beings known as rātiṣā́c- ‘Giftescort’.) Indeed these “intentions” may be the actual horses given; see 9b where the
“bounties” produced by such intention are also actualized as horses.

### 33.9  
In pāda a the publ. tr. reads “And (let) these (convey me)”; the “me” should
not be in parens.
The bahuvrīhi krátvāmagha- is curiously formed, with instr. krátvā as its first
member, and the publ. tr. “the bounty of his intentions” oversimplifies its structure in
order to avoid impossibly awkward English: a full tr. of b would be “(the horses
displaying/constituting) the bounty (produced) by his intention at the time of giving
in[/of] the ceremony.” In other words, the horses that the poet receives possess (that
is, embody) Mārutāśva’s bounty effected by his intention (to give). See 8d.
Ge takes vidáthasya as a PN, the patron whose patronymic is Mārutāśva, and
Mayrhofer (PN s.v.) seems to agree. But there seems no reason not to interpr. it as an
example of the well-attested common noun ‘ceremony (of distribution)’, esp. since it
fits this context so well. WG do not follow Ge.
The part. dádānaḥ appears to be the predicate of this clause. Though rare,
med. forms of √dā without ā́seem to mean ‘give of oneself / one’s own goods’. See
also IX.52.3.
I don’t entirely understand d. ānūkám is a hapax, but I follow Old in taking it
as an adverbial meaning something like ‘afterwards’; so apparently also WG. Ge, fld.
by Klein (I.425), takes it as the obj. of ārcat, as ‘last (song)’. See Ge’s n. 9d.
The standard interpr. (Ge [/WG], Old, Klein I.425) take aryáḥ as nom. sg.,
referring to Cyavatāna of c, and Thieme (Fremdl. 85) also thinks it’s probably nom.
sg., but declines to discuss the passage because of the obscurity of ānūkám. But a
patron like Cyavatāna should not be chanting or singing; that is the province of the
poet-priests he is patronizing. Moreover, aryáḥ echoes gen. sg. aryáḥ in 6d, which
announced the dānastuti to come, and I think the form should be interpr. in the same
way in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In 9d I think that the gift of the arí- is
still in question (as in 6d). The unnamed poet praised (‘sang’ ārcat) his gift for the
wonder (vápuṣe) of it -- of its over-the-top munificence.

### 33.10  
As in 9a “me” should be removed from parens.
The notion of enclosure in cd puns on the name of the Poet Saṃvaraṇa
‘entirely enclosing’ vel sim.
## 34 Indra
31

### 34.1  
A personified (/divinized) form of Svadhā ‘autonomous power’ is found in
this set of hymns; cf. the apparent ref. to her also in V.32.10.

### 34.2  
The overall structure of the vs. is the first issue to address. The first
hemistich begins with a rel. clause (in a) with accented verb ápiprata; the second
pāda begins with another accented verb, ámandata, which can owe its accent either
to its pāda-initial position or to being part of the rel. cl. of pāda a. I choose the former
interpr., making b into the main cl. of the vs. (so also Hoffmann, Injunk., 244). Ge
and WG choose the second, with ab containing two parallel rel. clauses. Since the 2nd
hemistich consists of a dep. cl. beginning with yád in c, with its accented verb yámat
in d, this leaves the vs. without a main cl. WG remedy this by providing a main cl.
frame “Zur Stelle (war er) …” This posited main clause consists entirely of the
preverb ā́that begins pāda a (see their n.), a slender reed indeed. Offhand I cannot
think of any other examples where a preverb by itself constitutes a clause. This
interpr. is esp. unlikely because ā́is an extremely common preverb with √pṛ / prā
‘fill’, and its default interpr. here is as a preverb in tmesis with ápiprata.
This structural question is connected with the problem of yámat in the yád cl.
of the 2nd hemistich. This form should be a subjunctive to the root aor., but it is
difficult to construe it as such, viewed in conjunction with the augmented imperfects
of ab. In order to hold onto the subjunctive interpr., Hoffmann (Injunk., 244) takes cd
as a purpose cl. (“Der Freigebige … berauschte sich …. auf dass ihm … Uśanā …
die tausendspitzige Waffe reiche”), but Indra doesn’t drink soma so that Uśanā will
give him a weapon, but does so at the same time and occasion when Uśanā gives him
the weapon (see, e.g., I.121.12). WG’s “Zur Stelle (war er)” is obviously designed to
provide a better pragmatic foundation for the purpose cl. (see their n.), but I have just
treated the weakness of their interpr. I therefore think that yámat here has to be a
nonce injunction with preterital value, rather than the subjunctive it appears to be.
The pivotal form that allowed this reanalysis is 3rd pl. yaman. This form is
morphologically ambiguous: it could be a subjunctive or an injunctive. Although
those forms are normally differentiated by the grade of the root (e.g., subj. gáman
versus injunc. gmán), a zero-grade injunc. *imán is too radical and would be blocked.
In fact, yaman, which occurs 4x (once as a rep.), is only found in mā́prohibitives and
therefore must be an injunc. in every case. To this form, which could also be injunc.
to a thematic stem, a 3rd sg. thematic-type injunc. yámat can be backformed.
On them. ápiprata see Narten 1969 = Kl. Sch. 108–24, esp. 109, 121–24.

### 34.3  
On ū́dhar / ū́dhan- as ‘cold’, beside the homonym ‘udder’, see comm. ad
VIII.2.12. Note the phonological echo at the end of pādas a and c: ū́dhani# / ūhati#.
There is considerably more phonological play in the 2nd hemistich: tatanúṣṭim
ūhati, tanū́śubhram, enclosed within unbroken a's: ápāpa śakráś ... maghávā yáḥ
kavāsakháḥ. This phonological pattern may help account for some of the difficulties
of interpr. this hemistich.
32
Before addressing the three hapaxes in cd, tatanúṣtim, tanū́śubhram, and
kávāsakhaḥ, note that the āmreḍited preverb ápa-apa (that is, ápāpa) superficially
reads as a stem ‘not evil’. I doubt if that is accidental, esp. since doubled preverbs are
quite rare; we will return to it below.
The first two of the hapaxes form the object of ápa … ūhati. The lexeme ápa
√ūh means ‘pull away’. It is used of the extended penis in cosmic incest in X.61.5;
more to the point, in AV XVIII.2.57 it is used of a garment that is to be removed (…
vā́saḥ … ápaitád ūha yád ihā́bibhaḥ purā́). A garment could well be described as
tanū́śubhra- ‘resplendent on the body’; cf. I.85.3 tanū́ṣu śubhrā́ḥ of the Maruts’
ornaments. I therefore supply ‘garment’ as the obj. here. (For a possible variant of
this see disc. below.)
Ge refuses to tr. or discuss tatanúṣṭi-; AiG is entirely silent on it; Old is noncommittal. Nonetheless, the formation of tatanúṣṭi- looks fairly transparent, if quite
unprecedented. As WG also suggest, it appears to be a -ti- abstract built to the weak
grade of the pf. part. to √tan ‘stretch’. WG gloss ‘die Sich-ausgebreitet-haben-schaft’,
which in their interpr. is then also applicable to someone who has this quality. They
thus assume a personal object for ápa ūhati, a dandy (Geck): “den, der sich
ausgebreitet hat … den Geck.” I’m not sure what a “sich ausgebreitet” person would
be, and there are other reasons to prefer supplying ‘garment’ or something similar as
the referent of these two acc. First, there is the AV passage just cited, where
‘garment’ is the obj. of ápa √ūh. Second, garments are objects of √tan elsewhere
(I.115.4, 134.4; X.106.1). And third, a personal object requires the meaning of ápa
√ūh to be seriously attenuated (WG’s abschieben: ‘push away, get rid of’). I
therefore take ‘spread-out-ness’ to be a quality attributed to a garment or garmentlike object. However, this analysis causes problems of its own. For one thing, why
not simply use the pf. part. alone to qualify the underlying ‘garment’? Forming a
derivational monstrosity -- a -ti-abstract based on a pf. part. -- and then turning this
stem into a possessive adj. seem a tremendous amount of bother to go to when the
participle by itself would convey the sense. Further, the standard words for garment
are neut. (vā́sas-, vástra-), and tatanúṣṭim must be masc. (see the adj. tanū́śubhram
agreeing with it). A proper neut. sg. adj. built to a -ti-stem should end in -ti (though
as far as I can tell, there are no exx. in the RV), so if tatanúṣṭim is an adj., it is in the
wrong gender for the posited noun it modifies. On the other hand, if we try to take
tatanúṣṭim simply as the -ti-abstract, not an adj. based on it, the masc. gender of the
qualifier tanū́śubhram clashes, since -ti-abstracts are fem. I have only an ad hoc
answer to these problems: assuming the form is an adj. whose underlying referent is
neut., the bare neut. -ti ending may have seemed anomalous and a more orthodox
looking acc. substituted for it, encouraged also by the fact that the next word begins
with a vowel and an inserted -m would avoid the hiatus. Meter would be unaffected,
and tanū́śubhram can of course be neut. instead of masc. But I do not find this
explanation compelling, and a different possibility is discussed below.
I have discussed the third hapax, kavāsakhá-, in some detail in Fs. Jasanoff
(2007: 163), reviving the old, but generally now rejected, analysis of the first
member as the old nom. sg. of kaví- matching the Aves. nom. sg. kauuā with its
33
hysterokinetic inflection. That this inflectional type may be preserved here may be
signalled by the 2nd member -sakháḥ, whose inflection remains hysterokinetic in
Vedic and whose nom. sg. is ordinarily sákhā. The current standard interpr. of kavāhere assigns it to a stem (*)kava- ‘humiliating, degrading’ (see EWA s.v. kavatnú-).
So, e.g., Ge’s rendering of the cmpd as ‘falsch Freund’, with some semantic
weakening.
How one analyses the cmpd. depends on what one thinks is going on in the
hemistich in general. The first question is who is the referent of the cmpd.? It is
found in a two-word nominal rel. cl. yáḥ kavāsakháḥ. Both Ge and WG take its
antecendent to be the obj. of the verb ápa … ūhati (e.g., WG “… den Keck, der die
Genossen geringschätzt”), but as was just discussed, it is not at all certain (and in my
opinion unlikely) that the object of that verb is a person. Moreover, word order -- an
often helpful, though of course not sturdily reliable guide in the RV -- favors Indra as
referent: the verse ends … maghávā yáḥ kavāsakháḥ.
If my analysis is correct -- that the cmpd. contains kaví- ‘poet’ and that it
characterizes Indra -- how can I fit it together with the rest of the vs.? I think the
cmpd. has a double sense. On the one hand, the kavā part refers to Uśanā Kāvya, who
figures in vs. 2. In fact, note that in 2d uśánā appears in its usual position,
immediately after the caesura following an opening of 5. If we superimpose 3d over
2d, kavā- would immediately follow uśánā: [x x x x x / uśánā kavā(-sakha)], the
composite yielding a simulacrum of his full name. And of course, as vs. 2 shows,
Indra and Uśanā are partners and companions. Uśanā is referred to as kavíelsewhere, with kaví- a substitute for his patronymic; see, e.g., IV.16.3, 26.1.
But the other sense I see here is more sinister and requires considering vs. 3 in
connection with the flg. verse. Vs. 4 is a curious, counter-intuitive, and indeed
dispiriting vs.: even if Indra kills all your relatives, he still expects you to continue to
offer to him. The usual comforting notion in the RV -- that Indra will do well by you
if you do well by him, while the non-offerer will get badly treated -- is overturned
here. Indra can act cavalierly and arbitrarily to ruin your life no matter how
devotedly you serve him. I think the same unsettling idea is presented in vs. 3.
Though the standard interpr. of vs. 3 (see, e.g., Ge’s n. 3cd) is that the first hemistich
depicts the pious man happily rewarded, while cd shows the impious one getting his
just deserts, I take the whole vs. as referring to the ups and downs of the pious somapresser. First, his labors pay off: he becomes dyumā́n ‘heaven-bright’. But in the
second half Indra snatches away this brightness, which is spread across him like a
garment, “resplendent on his body” (tanū́śubhra-), an appropriate characterization of
such brightness. In this reading kavāśakháḥ is ironic; Indra was indeed a companion
and partner of the poet, until he wasn’t.
If this interpr. is correct, it may help explain the use of the peculiar formation
tatanúṣṭi- discussed at length above. In pāda b the lucky soma-presser is dyu-mánt-,
lit. ‘possessing dyu-‘. And by my analysis, it is this purported dyu- that is resplendent
on his body. But the well-attested possessive adj. dyu-mánt- has become lexically
separated from div-/ dyu- ‘heaven’; there is no independent dyu- ‘brightness’ that can
become the property of a person. (The root noun dyút- is rare without preverb and
34
means yet again something different.) It may be that “spreading-ness” is an attempt
to capture the quality of heavenly light without having a firm grammatical base, an
identifiable independent noun, to found it on. One of the standard tropes using the
root √tan is light or a source of light spreading through heaven and other cosmic
realms; cf., e.g., X.88.3 of Sūrya yó bhānúnā pṛthivī́ṃ dyā́ṃ utémā́m, ātatā́na ródasī
antárikṣam. And so tatanúṣṭi- may embody this whole complex of heavenly light
spreading across the man’s body as if through heaven. By this analysis the tatanúṣṭiis not a garment, as I first suggested, but like a garment.
Another piece of evidence may support my view of cd as expressing the
undeserved and capricious reversal of fortune of the soma-presser who was riding
high in ab. Remember that cd begins with the double preverb ápāpa, which could
also be the voc. of an adj. ‘not-evil’. I suggest that this is a despairing address to the
soma-presser of ab: “o un-evil [/blameless] one, see what can happen to you anyway.”

### 34.4  
As noted in the publ. intro. and in the disc. of vs. 4 immediately above, the
sense of this vs. -- which seems surprisingly clear -- is hard to square with our usual
notions of Rigvedic reciprocal responsibilities, for the vs. states that Indra can kill all
your relatives and still demand your offerings, with no attempt even to deny or
distance himself from what he did. Ge and Old pass over this unsettling doctrine in
silence; WG suggest that the vs. shows that Indra doesn’t fear a blood feud
(Blutrache), but this seems to let Indra off too easily. There is no sign of the
reciprocity that “blood feud” implies: the hapless man whose relatives have been
slaughtered does not seem to have done anything injurious to Indra, nor did his dead
relatives -- at least as far as the vs. allows us to see. The killings appear to be the
arbitrary acts of a powerful god just because he can. It may be no accident that Indra
is called śakrá- ‘able’ here and in 3cd, where he also arbitrarily exerted his power.
(Of course, śakrá- is a common epithet of Indra in the RV and later, and I would not
suggest that it is always used with this nuance -- only that our poet exploited the
literal sense of the word.) The fact that the word kílbiṣa- is used of Indra’s deed
supports the view that what he did was simply wrong; see publ. intro.
I take práyata- in its usual sense, referring to offerings or bounties ‘held forth’
or ‘presented’. Cf. nearby V.30.12 práyatā maghā́ni, X.15.12 práyatā havī́ṃṣi, etc. I
cannot get anything else out of this sentence than that Indra still wants the aggrieved
man to keep making giving him oblations. WG tr. “Darreichungen,” but suggest in
their n. that it refers to “Reparations-, Satisfaktionszahlungen.” But what right would
Indra have to seek reparations when he was the one who inflicted the damage?
yataṃkará- is a hapax, and the identity of neither of its parts is as sure as the
standard interpr. take them. Gr suggests yataṃ belongs to the ppl. of √yam, therefore
morphologically identical to the immediately preceding (prá-)yatā, but this analysis
is rejected, rightly in my view, by Ge and WG, who take it (the former implicitly, the
latter explicitly) as the acc. sg. of a root noun to √yat, found also in the cmpd
saṃyát- in 9c. Although the uncompounded root noun is not found elsewhere and it
is not mentioned by Schindler in his Root Noun diss. or Scar in his disc. of √yat
(403-4), I think this must be the correct analysis, with the noun meaning ‘(proper)
35
arrangement’ or the like. The publ. tr. ‘arranger’ reflects this analysis of yataṃ, while
taking 2nd member -kará- from √kṛ, hence ‘make arrangements’ à ‘arranger’. I now
think this interpr. of the 2nd member is wrong. This pāda-final compound matches
final ākaráḥ of the next pāda, which, construed with preceding vásvaḥ, means
‘distributor of goods’. This -kará- does not belong to √kṛ, however, but to √kṝ, kir
‘scatter’, which occurs with ā́in just this phrase: cf. IX.81.3 ā́naḥ … kirā vásu
“scatter/distribute goods to us.” This strongly suggests that the parallel cmpd
yataṃkará- contains the same form, which leads to a sense ‘scattering the
arrangement’ -- viz., destroying it, blowing it to smithereens and scattering the
resulting particles. This accurately reflects what Indra has done in this vs. -- violating
the arrangement between men and gods -- worship and offerings in return for
protection, aid, and material goods -- by smiting the family of his devotee, though he
still provides goods. I would therefore change the publ. tr. from ‘the arranger’ to
‘scattering/destroying the arrangement’.

### 34.5  
The usual arrangement beween Indra and mortals is re-established in this vs.,
where Indra’s punishment comes only to the stingy and the non-worshipper, and the
pious man gets rewarded.
There is a difference of opinion about the sense of pāda a, because of different
interpr. of the acc. inf. ārábham and of the numerical expressions. Ge takes ārábham
as ‘sich verbinden’ and the expressions of numbers as referring to people or gods --
the sense being that Indra doesn’t want to team up with others because he’s strong
enough on his own. But ā́√rabh does not have that meaning, but only ‘to grasp, grab
hold of’. WG also take the numbers as personal: “Nicht wünscht er mit fünf, mit
zehn (Leuten) das Erraffen (von Beute),” which I confess I don’t understand. Is the
intent that he wants to pile up his booty all by himself? By contrast, I take the
numbers as referring to the means of grasping the offerings/goods -- either by the
number of gifts (=in increments of five or ten) or by handfuls: one (=five fingers) or
two (=ten fingers) -- and he doesn’t want to acquire the goods in such trifling
installments.
In c the question is the function of amuyā́. I cannot identify a part of the WG
tr. that represents amuyā́. Ge’s interpr. is minimalistic: íd amuyā́“nur so,” which
Klein (II.160) helpfully expands to “only in that circumstance (viz. when a wealthy
person does not have soma pressed for him).” This may well be right. However, I
compare X.135.2 cárantam pāpáyāmuyā́“going along yonder evil way.” In our
passage this may refer to highway robbery: the offending non-presser gets robbed as
he makes his way along the road. Or it may be metaphorical: if the non-presser
continues to pursue this behavior he’ll be punished.

### 34.6  
There is puzzling agreement about the meaning of the hapax cakramāsajá-.
The standard interpr. run counter to the clear structure of the cmpd: a tatpuruṣa with
the first member the acc. sg. of cakrá- ‘wheel’ (the acc. blocking hiatus before a
vocalic 2nd member) and the 2nd derived from ā́√sa(ñ)j. The lexeme ā́√sa(ñ)j means
‘attach, affix, hang’ (I.191.10, X.124.7); yet this cmpd is universally interpr. as
36
meaning ‘impeding/stopping the wheel’ (Gr, Ge, AiG II.1.183, EWA s.v. SAÑJ) or,
acdg. to WG, ‘die Wagen bremsend’ with cakra- as pars pro toto. I do not understand
this consensus that the verbal portion should be given a meaning not found with the
verb itself, particularly since the context does not impose it. (Sāy.’s gloss
rathacakrasyāsañjayitā does not seem to be responsible for it either.) Only WG
attempt to trace a semantic pathway to the meaning attributed to āsajá-, but it is not
persuasive. I suppose all these interpr. are thinking of the myth in which Indra tears
the wheel off the sun’s chariot, but there is no other indication in context that this
myth is at issue -- and tearing off and stopping are quite different actions. Given
these objections, I prefer to stick with the standard meaning of ā́√sa(ñ)j and assume
1) that it refers to the restoration of the sun’s wheel mentioned in regard to Etaśa in
nearby V.31.11, or 2) that is refers to an incident in an unknown story, or 3) that it
refers to some pre-batttle preparation or battle tactic. I prefer the first.

### 34.7  
The lexeme sám √aj is used elsewhere of ‘driving together’ cattle (I.33.3);
here the bhójanam of the niggard is presumably livestock. Though paṇéḥ here is used
oppositionally to dāśúṣe in b (see Ge’s n. 7ab), the word also summons up Indra’s
opponents, the Paṇis, who stole his cows -- so stealing them back (muṣé) is only
justice.
The syntax of c is quite challenging. Let us begin with víśva ā́purú. The
phrase purú víśva- appears to be an idiom, or at least is found twice in the RV,
meaning “all the many”: I.191.9 purú víśvāni “all the many (bugs),” VII.62.1 purú
víśvā jánima “all the many tribes.” Here, however, the words are in opposite order,
with the preverb/adposition ā́intervening, and the referent is singular (víśva[ḥ] …
jánaḥ). Nonetheless, I think the locutions are essentially the same, though I tr. “each
and every” to capture the singular number.
I do not know what to do with ā́. It is possible that it is a preverb with dhriyate,
but 1) though ā́is found with √dhṛ, it is not common, and 2) preverbs in tmesis
generally move to metrical or syntactic boundaries, and ā́is not so placed here. The
standard interpr. do not comment on it. I have no solution.
The last issue is the use of caná. Ge (/WG) take it as neg. ‘nicht einmal’ (not
even). The sense of the clause, acdg. to them, is that a people that has provoked
Indra’s anger can’t hole up for a long time even in a place that’s hard to penetrate.
Thus by their interpr. durgá- is a desirable, fortress-like location for the offending
people, but they can’t hold onto it. But durgá- is always otherwise an undesirable
place, where no one wants to be -- where we wish Indra to send our enemies
(VII.25.2) but from which we want to be rescued. I therefore think that the point of
this clause is that Indra’s antagonists get confined to such a place and therefore caná
does not have a negative sense here. Twice loc. durgé is followed by cid ‘even’
(VIII.27.18, 93.10), and durgé caná here may be a variant of this usage. Although he
unfortunately does not discuss this passage, Klein’s general disc. of caná (DGRV
I.285–92) as essentially borrowing negative value from the negative contexts in
which it’s ordinarily found allows for an original underlying positive value ‘even’.
The publ. tr. should be slightly altered to “Even in a (place) …,” though I’m not sure
37
what sense ‘even’ adds -- perhaps that not only are the people confined but they are
confined in a really nasty place.

### 34.8  
The identity of the verb ávet in b is disputed. Gr takes it as an opt. to √av
‘help’; Old rejects that analysis but suggests that either √vid ‘know’ or √vī ‘pursue’
is possible. Ge and WG (see also Oberlies RdV I.535) opt for √vid and take the rest
of the ab as indirect discourse controlled by this verb (“when he found out that …”).
This is possible, but I find it hard to integrate subordinate yád clause in ab (with
plupf.) with the hí cl. of c (with root aor.) and the main cl. of d (with pres. indic.). I
find that the sequence of tense works better if ab is a separate unit, with subord. yád
cl. in a and main clause in b (ávet accented because pāda-initial). Then c is the causal
grounds for the main cl. in d and expresses immed. past.
My analysis requires supplying a verb in pāda a, linked to the preverb sám
(which by the other interpr. must be construed with √vid, a combination not found
with ‘know’, though it is with √vid ‘find’). A good candidate for a verb to supply is
given by sámṛti- ‘clash’ in 6a, and verbal forms to this idiom (sám √ṛ) are fairly
common. Cf. VII.25.1 … yát samáranta sénāḥ “when armies clash together.” My
analysis also depends on a different analysis of ávet, which I assign to √vī ‘pursue’.
Note véti opening 4c.
The def. anyám ‘the one’ in c, referring to one of the two opponents in ab,
more or less demands a responsive ‘the other’, as Ge and I supply in d.
Old questions the existence of the stem pravepanín-, suggesting that
pravepanī́is an adverbial instr. to a pravepanī́- (fld. by WG). I don’t see that a stem
pravepanī́- is appreciably better than an -ín-stem and follow the older analysis.

### 34.9  
The sense of saṃyát- ‘continuous(ly)’, root noun cmpd. to √yat (see yataṃin 4c and disc. there), must have developed from ‘taking their places together, one
after the other’. For further disc. of the stem, see comm. ad IX.86.15.
## 35 Indra

### 35.3  
ābhū́bhiḥ ‘ready at hand’ lacks an overt referent. I supply ‘(forms) of help’
from context -- ávas- is the signature word of this part of the hymn. Ge takes it as a
nominalized ‘Kräfte’, though he suggests the Maruts as an alternative referent in n.
3d; WG personified ‘helpers’.

### 35.4  
The syntactic boundaries do not coincide with the pāda boundary in ab -- a
welcome syncopation in this otherwise simple hymn. The hemistich is divided into
three clauses: vṛ́ṣā hy ási / rā́dhase jajñiṣé / vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ, but the pāda boundary
breaks the second into two one-word halves. It might be possible to fold the third
proposed clause into the second (“you were born as bullish strength”), if we were
willing to be cavalier about the position of te and indeed its presence (“you were
born as your bullish strength”?), but the nominal clause in VIII.3.10 tád indra vṛ́ṣṇi
te śávaḥ supports the analysis as a separate unit, if more support be needed.
38
On the anomalous form vṛ́ṣṇi (for expected vṛ́śn(y)am), see comm. ad
VIII.96.19.
satrāhám is a neut. sg. qualifying paúṃsyam. It looks like a them. neut. and is
in fact classified under satrāha- in Gr and Lub (see also Scar 697). Nonetheless, it
belongs with the class of root noun cmpds with -hán-. The neut. sg. of such a stem
should probably be *-ha (like nā́ma to nā́man-, assuming radical -n-stems work like,
or get assimilated to, derived -n-stems). I might tentatively suggest that the final -m
was first inserted (as anunāsika) to avoid the hiatus *satrāhá indra and then reinterp.
as a them. neut. ending (see also Lanman, Noun inflection 478, AiG III.239). But it is
the case that such nasalizations are rare within pādas and almost always concern long
-ā (see Old, Prol. 469–72). Moreover, the similarly formed neut. vṛtrahám in
VI.48.21 precedes a consonant with the -m making position.

### 35.5  
Ge takes adrivaḥ as ‘du Herr des Presssteins’, but in context a stone as
weapon seems more likely (so WG ‘du mit den Schleudersteinen’, flg. Gr).
I interpr. sarvarathā́as an adverbial accompaniment to the victim whom Indra
runs over: “(him), chariot and all.” It is not clear from Ge’s “mit ganz Wagenzug”
whose chariot he thinks it is, but WG take it to be Indra’s chariot, interpr. sarva- in
its stronger lexical sense ‘hale, healthy’: “… so, dass dein Wagen heil bleibt.” This
purpose-clause reading attributes more, and more unambiguous, structure to this
single word than I think it can properly bear, and I also don’t understand the intended
sense: should Indra endeavor to keep the victim’s blood from splashing his wheels or
his body from making dents?

### 35.6  
Note the phonol. figure pūrvī́ṣu pūrv(i)yám, though the words belong to diff.
stems. The referent of fem. pūrvī́ṣu is not clear. Gr suggests ājíṣu from 7b, and this
seems to have met general acceptance (Ge, with ?; WG; Bloomfield RReps, 256),
even though ājí- is actually masc., a fact no one remarks on. (Gr cites a single. fem.
form, in I.116.15, but nothing in that passage signals that gender.) We could, of
course, suggest a different word for ‘battle’ with fem. gender, like pṛ́tanā or samád-;
there is weak support for both (/either) of these because they both are construed in
the loc. pl. with ugrá-, which is also found here: ugrám … samátsu in an oft-repeated
pāda (III.30.22, etc.); VII.56.23 ugráḥ pṛ́tanāsu, VIII.61.12, 70.4 ugrám (…)
pṛ́tanāsu. An entirely different referent is also possible: ‘peoples’ comes to mind,
picking up the jánāsaḥ of pāda b, with several different possible fem. stems as
substitute: kṣití- from 2c or the developed sense of carṣaṇí-, extractable from 1c (cf.
III.43.2 pūrvī́ḥ … carṣaṇī́ḥ) or víś- (cf. VII.31.10 víśaḥ pūrvī́ḥ).

### 35.7  
This vs. has a riddle structure: the accusative qualifiers pile up until their
referent, the chariot (rátham) is given at the very end, immediately preceded by the
verb (avā) on which the preceding accusatives depend. It proved difficult to capture
this effect in tr.
sayā́van- means ‘drive along with’ (the useful German ‘mitfahren’, for which
there is no precise English equivalent). It is ordinarily either construed with an instr.
39
of the fellow traveller or is in the instr. qualifying the fellow traveller(s). Here there
is no such overt expression, but we can assume it is Indra.

### 35.8  
The structure of ab mimics that of 7, which has (a) #asmā́kam … / (d) … avā
rátham#, while 8 has (a) #asmā́kam … (b) #rátham avā .... Another verbal expression
is inserted within this structure in pāda a: éhi naḥ. Ge tr. as two separate clauses,
silently postponing the asmā́kam to the second one (“komm zu uns, begünstige
unseren Wagen”). WG take éhi naḥ as an insertion: “Unserem -- Indra, komm her zu
uns! -- (unserem) Wagen hilf …” This interpr. seems possible -- save for the position
of the voc. indra, which is unaccented and precedes éhi naḥ so cannot belong to that
phrase. (A slightly altered tr. would be “Ours, Indra -- come to us! -- (our) chariot
…”) By contrast I take éhi … avā as a pseudo-serial verb construction (“come help”),
though I admit that the naḥ might be problematic for that interpr.
Ge (/WG) take both diví as ‘today’, but outside of diví pāryé ‘on the decisive
day’, a phrase characteristic primarily of VI and VII, diví always refers to heaven, as
far as I can tell. ‘Heaven’ makes fine sense here, and cf. the similar expression

### 13.2  
... stómam manāmahe ... divispṛ́śaḥ “we shall conceive a praise-song (for
Agni), who touches the sky.”
## 36 Indra

### 36.1  
The publ. tr. takes the phrase vásūnām … dā́mano rayīṇā́m as nested
genitives (vásūnām and rayīṇā́m depending on dā́manaḥ), whose head noun is dā́tum.
Both Ge and WG break up the nouns into two phrases (though in different ways),
with WG taking the verb cíketat in two different ways (pf. subj. / plupf. injunc.) with
two different complements: “… der auf das Schenken von Gütern [i.e., vásūnām …
dā́tum] achten soll, weil er sich ja auf die Schenkung von Schätzen [i.e., dā́mano
rayīṇā́m] versteht.” This is more elegant than my pile-up of gifts and may well be
right, though I’m not sure there’s sufficient signalling of the double meaning.

### 36.2  
The simile in ab depends on the double meaning of the root √ruh, which
means both ‘climb, mount’ and ‘grow’. It also hinges on two different senses of
sóma-, as the prepared ritual drink and the plant from which it is extracted.
In cd there is mismatch in number between the simile in the singular and the
frame in the plural, whose number is emphasized by víśve ‘all’. The point of the
simile is that the person “driving his steeds” would be verbally urging them on to
greater speed.

### 36.3  
The slightly “off” nature of the similes in this hymn continues here. In ab the
point of comparison between the rolling wheel and the poet’s mind is the trembling
(vepate). The cause of the trembling -- fear -- is applicable only to the mind, not the
wheel.
As disc. in the publ. intro., ráthād ádhi “from the chariot” is a curious phrase,
and the standard treatments struggle with it. Both Ge and Old think that the singer is
40
expressing a wish for a chariot, but it is hard to see how to make that work
syntactically. WG (in n.) suggest that it’s either Indra’s chariot or that it represents
the poet’s hymn, but neither of these fits the context well. As indicated in the publ.
intro., I think this is a punning allusion to the poet’s patron Śruta-ratha (lit. ‘having a
famous chariot’), praised in the dānastuti in vs. 6. In this scenario the hemistichinitial ablative, referring to the patron, is linked to the hemistich-final word
purūvásuḥ, referring to the poet. Though Ge (/WG) take this as a PN, giving it its full
lexical meaning (‘having many goods’) makes the verse work better. The singer
praises Indra on behalf of his patron Śrutaratha, in order to become “One of many
goods” -- from/because of (Śruta)ratha. As Mayrhofer points out (PN, s.v. purūvásu-
), purūvásu is synonymous with Prabhūvasu, the name of the poet acdg. to the
Anukramaṇī, so the vs. puns both on the name of the poet and on that of the patron.
This might be clearer in the publ. tr. if it were reordered: “Surely the singer will now
praise you … (to become) one possessing many goods from the (Famous-)chariot?

### 36.4  
The semantically complementary expressions referring to giving with the left
and right hands have different morphological realizations: instr. savyéna and the
hapax adv. dakṣiṇít. The latter is, of course, anomalously formed; it appears also in
the cmpd. pradakṣiṇít (6x), which may be the basis here as well -- note immediately
preceding prá. Thieme (KZ 69 [1951] = KlSch 71) suggests that it’s a cmpd with the
root noun to √i ‘go’ (with the expected empty -t stem final); others that it contains
the relic of a PIE instr. ending in -t/d. For a full disc. see Scar (42–44). Since the first
is not straightforward functionally (“going to the right” is not its sense) and the
second depends on a highly dubious morphological reconstruction, I withhold
judgment on the source of the form, but see ubhayāhastí (or -ī̇) in V.39.1 below. The
lack of morphological parallelism in this passage is not surprising, since the hymn
tends towards slightly skewed expressions.

### 36.5  
I take cd as a single clause (contra Ge [/WG]), because the sá with 2nd ps. ref.
that opens c is easily explained if it’s construed with the imperatival 2nd sg. injunctive
dhāḥ at the end of d, but would otherwise be anomalous. See my “sa figé.”
Strictly speaking, vṛ́ṣakrato is of course a voc. In the publ. tr. I render it as
nom., because of the parallelism vṛ́ṣā vṛ́ṣarathaḥ … vṛ́ṣakrato vṛ́ṣā, with 2 nom. vṛ́ṣā
adjoining 2 bahuvrīhis with vṛ́ṣa- as 1st member.

### 36.6  
The sudden intrusion of the Maruts here is somewhat puzzling, but final vss.
often open out to a wider set of gods.
## 37 Indra

### 37.1  
As was noted in the publ. intro., the first pāda of this first hymn attributed to
Atri provides the clue to the solution of the mythical puzzle posed by the narrative in
Atri’s V.40.5–9 in which Svarbhānu (svàrbhānu-) pierces the sun with darkness and
Atri restores the sun to heaven. The name Svarbhānu means ‘having the radiance of
41
the sun’, and here Agni aligns himself “with the radiance of the sun” (bhānúnā …
sū́ryasya). As I demonstrated at length in my book The Ravenous Hyenas and the
Wounded Sun, Svarbhānu is simply an epithet of Agni, who inflicted the wound on
the sun for cause (cosmic incest). This pāda signals the underlying connection of
Agni and Svarbhānu with a minimum of fuss.
The dawns are ‘non-neglectful’ (ámṛdhra-) because they never fail to appear
every morning.

### 37.2  
Both Ge and WG take jarāte as ‘be awake’, even though Gotō himself (1st
Klasse, 151 and 154) identifies this particular attestation of jára- as ambig. between
‘be awake’ and ‘sing’. Although both meanings are probably present, I think ‘sing’ is
the primary one. The subject’s yoked pressing stones speak (grā́vāṇaḥ … vadanti) in
the next pāda (2c), and throughout the RV there is generally an equivalence between
the noise of the pressing stones and the speech/singing of the priests. See in
particular in the immediately preceding hymn, V.36.4 grā́veva jaritā́… íyarti vā́cam
“Like a pressing stone, the singer raises his voice,” with the agent noun belonging to
the same root.
On the Adhvaryu’s trip to the river to fetch water on the morning of the
pressing day, see Ge’s n. 2c.

### 37.3  
See the disc. of this vs. as omphalos and riddle in the publ. intro. As
indicated there, I identify the bride as Dawn and the husband as the Sun, while the
dominant opinion (see Ge [/WG]) is rather Speech and Indra. The latter is certainly
not excluded, and the fact that the stem iṣirá-, used to qualify the speech of the
pressing stones in 2c, also characterizes the wife in 3b may give some support to that
view. Cf. also IX.84.4 vā́cam iṣirā́m uṣarbúdham “the vigorous speech awakening at
dawn.” Still, the Dawn/Sun interpr. follows naturally from the dawn ritual setting in
the first two vss., and the long journey in d would refer to the daily trip across the
sky.
As also noted in the publ. intro. śravasyād ráthaḥ “the chariot will seek fame”
recalls the name of the patron in the immed. preceding hymn, V.36.6, Śrutaratha,
which was also punned on in V.36.3.
With Ge I take purū́sahásrā as a measure of distance and pári vartayāte as
intrans./reflex., based on its middle form. This is disputed by WG, who take the verb
as transitive (but “affektive” [whatever that means], the value that accounts for its
middle form). They supply ‘men’ as the referent of purū́sahásrā. The idea is that the
noise of Indra’s chariot will cause many thousands of them to turn around and look at
it. I suppose this is not impossible, but again it requires supplying much more than is
found in the context: a huge crowd of people and the presupposition that “cause to
turn” implies “turn to look.”

### 37.4  
“Whose comrades are cows” (gósakhāyam) modifying soma refers of course
to the milk mixture added to soma to make it less unpalatable. (It is somewhat
surprising that sóma- is also called tīvrá- ‘sharp’ in the same pāda, since this is
42
usually of unmixed soma.) But the gó- ‘cow’ of this cmpd provides a clever
transition to the next pāda. Pāda c contains a verb (ā́…) ájati ‘drives’, which
ordinarily takes an object -- and indeed frequently that object is cows: e.g., I.83.5 ā́
gā́ājat, V.2.5 ā́jāti paśváḥ. I therefore supply ‘cows’ as the object in c, extracted
from a different use of the ‘cow’ word in b. This then produces a reference to the
Vala myth, with the satvanaíḥ ‘warriors’ representing the Aṅgirases as elsewhere (cf.
III.39.5, also nearby V.34.8 for association with cattle raiding). Thus pāda c depicts
the king protected by Indra as performing a Vala-like deed (ā́satvanaír ájati) as well
as the/a Vṛtra slaying (hánti vṛtrám), ascribing (equivalents of) the two signature
deeds of Indra to this earthly king. Neither Ge nor WG make much sense of the ájati
clause.
The accent on ájati is contrastive with the adjacent hánti.
Both Ge and WG take kṣitī́ḥ with kṣéti (“er bleibt in seinen Sitzen” and “weilt
sicher in seinem Reich” respectively; see also Oberlies Relig. RV I.441, II.171–72),
but √kṣi ‘dwell’ without preverb does not otherwise take the acc., whereas √puṣ
‘prosper, thrive’ can take a personal acc., and so I construe kṣitī́ḥ with púṣyan. In my
interpr. the poet juxtaposes the cognate words (kṣéti kṣitī́ḥ), but separates them
syntactically.

### 37.5  
The pāda-framing #kṣéti … púṣyan# of 4d recur adjacent at the beginning of
5a #púṣyāt kṣéme in different morphological form; kṣéme ‘peace(ful dwelling) is also
paired with its opposite yóga- ‘hitching up, war’, with two contrastive clauses framed
by the subjunctives #puṣyāt … bhavāti# predicting success in both peace and war.
The war theme is further developed in the following pāda. I take ubhé vṛ́tau
saṃyatī́as an implicitly subordinated clause with pres. part. as main verb (an interpr.
that WG come close to as an alternative considered in their n.). It would be possible
to take this phrase as acc. obj. of sáṃ jayāti (so Ge, WG, Oberlies [Relig. RV II.172]),
but it doesn’t make sense that the king would conquer both clashing forces, when one
of them is likely his own. Rather I think the point is that Indra will favor him over the
opponent and therefore his side will prevail. See V.34.8, where Indra links himself to
one of two opposing troops and helps his clients win.
## 38 Indra
For the general contents, see disc. in publ. intro. WG interpr. it as plea to
Indra for rain -- a purpose that I find very hard to discern and that results in
farfetched interpr. of details.

### 38.1  
The first hemistich is somewhat awk., with (by my interpr. and Ge’s) a
genitive phrase uróḥ … rā́dhasaḥ “of your broad largess” dependent on an almost
synonymous nom. phrase vibhvī́rātíḥ “extensive giving.” WG apparently take the
first not as gen., but as abl., indicating the source of the giving: “Von deiner …
weitreichenden Gunst aus entfaltet sich die Gabe.” This seems like a good idea and
mitigates the awkwardness. I would then change the publ. tr. to “Your extensive
giving (comes) from your broad generosity.”
43

### 38.2  
As in several instances in the last few hymns, WG impose extra structure on
the first hemistich that is not supported by the phraseology. They supply a verb to
govern śravā́yyam, which then forms the foundation for a 2nd subordinate cl.
consisting of íṣam … dadhiṣé: “Was du … Ruhmvolles (zustande gebracht), dass du
dir die Labung … verschafft hast.” In their introduction to the hymn they explain
what lies behind this interpr., adding even further unsupported assumptions. The
‘praiseworthy’ thing that Indra accomplished was his action of freeing the life-giving
liquid (íṣ-), which they presumably take both as the waters imprisoned by Vṛtra and
(proto-)rain. But they give no justification for dividing ab into two clauses,
separating the apparently parallel objects śravā́yyam and íṣam, and providing a verb
to govern the first that cannot be generated from context or formulaics. It is worth
pointing out that śravā́yya- is never used of a deed or action and most often modifies
rayí- ‘wealth’ or vā́ja- ‘prize’. Although I can’t see any obstacle to qualifying a deed
as śravā́yya-, there are no familiar phrases containing that notion that would come to
mind when encountering an undefined śravā́yya-. Though I confess I can’t identify
the referent(s) here, I find the WG interpr. implausible and forced. For further on this
vs. see comm. ad V.39.2 below.

### 38.3  
The WG interpr. becomes even more forced in this vs., which is summarized
in their intro. by “Die Maruts lassen es regnen,” despite the absence of any reference
to the Maruts or any verb for ‘rain’ -- the operative word for ‘rain’ is supposed to be
the adverbial instr. mehánā generally taken as ‘in profusion’. The single word
śúṣmāsaḥ is supposed to incorporate “Sturm, Drang, Blitz,” and the Maruts are
supposed to be the other half of the dual expression ubhā́devāú “both you gods” --
that is, Indra and the Maruts -- a highly unlikely use of the dual. The distortion of the
text to fit the interpretational preconceptions goes much too far.
To stay closer to the actual wording, the question is how to distribute the
various pādas in relation to each other. Ge takes ab as the subject of a clause whose
object is in c, though with an unexpressed verb: “Deine Kräfte … (bringen) beide
Götter zur Übermacht.” I prefer to take ab as an extension of vs. 2, adding another
quality of Indra’s (his tempestuous force) that extends itself along with fame. Then
the two gods of c can be the subject of rājathaḥ in d, with abhíṣṭaye an infinitival
complement. A similar interpr. is given by Scar (598), who takes ab as a nominal
clause, “Die ungestümen Kräfte, die dir [sind, sind] in Menge [vorhanden] und
gehorchen deinem Willen,” and cd more or less as I do.
As for who the other god is, besides Indra -- Old refuses to speculate, saying
it’s an unknown ritual situation. Ge suggests Varuṇa, and this seems the likeliest
possibility. Dual forms of √rāj generally have Varuṇa as one half of the subject, the
other usually being Mitra; cf., e.g., in this maṇḍala V.63.2, 7. But VII.83.5, a hymn
to Indra and Varuṇa, the verb has those two as subject: yuváṃ hí vásva ubháyasya
rā́jathaḥ “For you two rule over goods of both sorts.”
44

### 38.4  
The brief excursion into the dual in vs. 3 is over, and Indra is the sole subject
again.
The first hemistich is again syntactically incomplete. The standard interpr.
construe the genitive phrase asyá kásya cid dákṣasya táva loosely with nṛmṇám (e.g.,
Ge “von welcher deiner Geisteskraft es auch sei, … bring uns Mut”). This is possible,
but I prefer to take ab as an extension of 3cd (as 3ab was to 2cd), supplying ‘rule’ to
govern the genitives, using slightly different senses of ‘rule’.

### 38.5  
I tr. slightly differently from the standard, supplying another form of syāma
for ab, rather than making the whole vs. into a single cl. The difference is trifling.
Notice that abhíṣtibhiḥ echoes abhíṣṭaye in 3c.
WG suggest that this vs. is a joke: asking Indra to be in his śárman
(‘protection, shelter’; German ‘Schirm’) is like asking to be under his umbrella
(Regenschirm). This is a joke that may work in German but seems to have little to do
with Sanskrit, which, as far as I know, does not have the concept of a rain-repelling
umbrella. Shelters of that physical type are more likely used against the sun, and
certainly I know of no use of śárman- in a rain context.
## 39 Indra
As was noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is twinned with V.38 in Vālakhilya
fashion, though it does not give as much help as it might in interpreting the previous
hymn.

### 39.1  
The poet re-uses mehánā from V.38.3 and rā́dhaḥ from V.38.1, as well as
adrivaḥ (though that voc. is quite common in this run of hymns). Because of their
commitment to mehánā as ‘rain’ in 38.3, WG are forced to insert rain here, though
the context is hardly favorable.
The Pp. reads ubhayāhastí with short -í, which is assigned to an -i-stem by Gr,
as a neut. modifying rā́dhaḥ, though he also suggests that it might be read -ī́, as the
masc. nom. sg. of an -ín-stem. The latter works better morphologically than the
former: hastín- is well attested and well formed, whereas there is no straight -i-stem
hastí- and no easy mechanism for producing one -- though a nonce back-formation
from the well-formed adj. -hasti
ya- might be possible. See esp. ubhayāhasti
yā́vásu in
I.81.7. (A neut. to the -ín-stem would likewise probably come out as -í, and this may
be an easier solution). I nonetheless tentatively suggest that ubhayāhastí here (if that
is the reading) might be compared with the problematic dakṣiṇít ‘with the right
(hand)’ in nearby V.36.4, which appears in the same kind of context, concerns hands,
and has a problematic suffixal short -i-, followed there by a morphologically
mysterious dental final.

### 39.2  
Although this vs. is lexically and syntactically quite distinct from V.38.2,
they seem to share a thematic core. First, note that váreṇi
yam at the end of pāda a is
positioned identically to śravā́yi
yam in 38a, with the same type of formation and
roughly the same meaning, and both are introduced by yád ‘which’ at the beginning
45
of their pādas. Here the adj. clearly designates some good thing that Indra should
bring us; recall that śravā́yi
ya- also usually refers to wealth of some sort. In the
second half-verse Indra’s limitless capacity for giving is expressed in a vivid image -
- Indra as unbounded ocean -- while in 38.2cd the unidentified praiseworthy thing
spreads itself out longest, also an image of unbounded expanse. The means of
expressing the concept are quite different, but the concept itself seems the same.

### 39.3  
I take ab as nominal rel. clause with a predicated grdv. prarā́dhyam, while
Ge (/WG) simply take it as a nom. cl. (“what is your thought…”). My tr. should be
modified slightly to make it clear that the ásti is accented: “Which thought of yours,
famed and lofty, eager to give, is to [/should] be realized, with it …”
In cd both Ge and WG separate the two pādas and supply a second verb (or,
as far as I can tell, a 2nd exemplar of the overt verb ā́darṣi in different usage). I
interpr. ā́darṣi as taking a double acc. in a condensed expression: “split X for (its
contents) Y.” The lexeme ā́√dṛ can take as obj. either the container or the contained;
for a similar double acc. with both see III.30.21 ā́no gotrā́dardṛhi … gā́ḥ “Split
open the cowpens for the cows.”

### 39.4  
Ge [/WG] take the enclitic vaḥ exclusively with pāda a where it is located
(Ge: “Euren Freigebigsten der Freigebigen…”). In light of the next vs., I think that it
refers to the Atris, who strengthen Indra with their words in 5, and that they are the
subject of the infinitival dat. práśastaye in c. It has migrated to Wackernagel’s
position in the larger clause (as often), which accounts for its distance from
práśastaye.
As I have discussed elsewhere (e.g., Ṛgveda between Two Worlds, Chap. 4,
esp. 146–48), the genre of práśasti- and the verbal lexeme prá √śaṃs are associated
with the praise of kings already in the RV; praśasti is the standard term for royal
panegyric in later Sanskrit and MIA. Note that here the term is used for Indra as king
(pāda b rā́jānāṃ carṣaṇīnā́m).
With the standard interpr., I supply a verb of calling in c.
In d Ge takes pūrvī́bhiḥ … gíraḥ as co-referential, with gíraḥ acc. rather than
instr. metri causa. This seems too tricky as well as unnec. With most (incl. Gr, Old,
and WG) I supply práśasti- with pūrvī́bhiḥ (cf., e.g., VI.45.3 pūrvī́ḥ … práśastayaḥ).
WG in their n. suggest that pūrvī́bhiḥ is a “predicative instr” to gíraḥ, a construction
that I don’t understand and that also seems unnec. Why not an instr. of
accompaniment -- hymns along with eulogies? If I am correct that práśasti is a
specialized verbal product already in the RV, the differentiation between it and gírhere would be perfectly understandable.

### 39.5  
The distinction between verbal products continues here, with kā́vyaṃ vácaḥ
‘poet’s/poetic speech’, ukthám ‘solemn word’, bráhman- ‘sacred formulation’, and
gíraḥ ‘hymns’ all offered to Indra. For the connection between práśasti- (here, 4cd)
and kaví-, kā́vya- see ṚV between Two Worlds cited above.
46
V.40 Indra and Svarbhānu
The hymn given as V.40 consists of two metrically and, more important,
thematically ill-assorted pieces, vss. 1–4 and 5–9. The first three vss., in Uṣṇih, are a
banal celebration of the word vṛ́ṣan- ‘bull’ addressed to Indra. The fourth is in
Triṣṭubh and does not contain any form of the word vṛ́ṣan- (though see vṛṣabhá- in
4a), but the thematic connection is clear and it climaxes with the appearance of Indra
at the Midday Pressing. The second part, vss. 5–9, is the exquisitely crafted account
of the Svarbhānu myth, which on its own constitutes a perfectly balanced omphalos
hymn. Metrically it consists of two framing vss. in Anuṣṭubh (5, 9), with the three
internal vss. (6–8) in Triṣṭubh. Further evidence of the omphalos structure: the two
outer vss. are multiforms of each other; the middle verse (7) is the only direct speech;
the immediately surrounding vss. (6, 8) both mention Atri in the sg., both deal with
the māyā́of Svarbhānu, and have complementary vocab.: diváḥ / diví, sū́ryam
/sū́ryasya, gūḍhám /aghukṣat, bráhmaṇā / brahmā́.
All of the evidence points to a pair of originally independent hymns, which
were later redactionally combined, and this hypothesis also fits their position in the
maṇḍala. At four vss., the first part (V.40.1–4) would be the appropriate length to
follow on the five-vs. V.39 as an independent Indra hymn, in accordance with the
usual principles of Saṃhitā arrangement. The Indra cycle of V would come to an end
there; the seams between cycles are where later Anhangslieder get inserted, and
V.40.5-9 can be such an Anhangslied, with no original connection to 1-4 at all.
Although Indra has a bit part in the Svarbhānu saga (see 6ab, possibly 7c), the story
is otherwise independent.
The idea that the two parts of V.40 were originally two separate hymns has a
long scholarly history, going back at least to Bergaigne and Lanman, who both
thought the division was rather 1–3 / 4–9. See Old, Proleg. 198 and, in detail, Noten
ad loc. In the Noten Old seriously considers the possibility that the two parts formed
an originally unitary hymn, primarily on the basis of V.78, which he sees as having a
similar bipartite structure. I think this is unlikely: V.78 falls into three parts, not two,
and in our hymn the Svarbhānu portion is far more intricately structured than
anything in V.78. Nonetheless, it is possible that the two separate hymns were joined
into V.40 on the model of V.78. For a possible reason for the introduction of the
Svarbhānu account just here, see below ad vs. 4.
I treated the Svarbhānu portion at great length in my 1991 Ravenous Hyenas
in conjunction with the brāhmaṇa prose versions of the myth, and I will not repeat all
the details found there. In Hyenas (264–67) I identify Svarbhānu, the piercer of the
Sun, as Agni, who is frequently said to have the bhānú- (‘radiance’) of the sun. For
support for this identification see disc. there, as well as comm. ad V.37.1 above.
V.40.1–3: In the refrain (1–3cd) the pl. ‘bulls’ (vṛ́ṣabhiḥ) accompanying Indra were
identified with the Maruts already by Sāyaṇa. Since this section culminates in the
Midday Pressing (4d), this identification makes sense, since that pressing is shared
by Indra and the Maruts.
47

### 40.4  
In Hyenas (pp. 249–51) I suggest that the Svarbhānu section is introduced
after this vs., because there are several connections between the Midday Pressing and
the Svarbhānu story. In later śrauta ritual a descendant of Atri (an Ātreya) is given
gold at the Midday Pressing of the Aśvamedha. The gold is clearly a symbol of the
sun (as often), and the Svarbhānu story is often told in brāhmaṇa prose texts to
justify this ritual action. There is also a disguised ritual reenactment of the freeing of
the sun (also symbolized by gold) at the Midday Pressing. The suggested connection
still seems to me reasonable, but I was more inclined in that book to accept V.40 as a
unitary hymn, not a secondary composite. I now think that the independent
Svarbhānu hymn was slipped in here at the end of the Indra cycle because of the
mention of the Midday Pressing in the final vs. of the originally separate hymn, now
V.40.1–4.

### 40.5  
On vs. 5 as a variant of vs. 9, see Hyenas 140–41.

### 40.6  
On the “fourth formulation,” see Hyenas 251–60.
The “circling magic spells” (māyā́ḥ … vártamānāḥ) of Svarbhānu are the
plumes of Agni’s smoke rising to heaven and obscuring the Sun’s light (Hyenas 271–
73).
ápavratena ‘against commandment’ is generally taken to refer to the darkness
deployed by Svarbhānu, but I argue (Hyenas 297–300) that it actually refers to the
Sun’s original action, incest with his daughter, that led to his punishment by Agni
Svarbhānu.

### 40.7  
On this speech of the Sun’s, see Hyenas 281–88.
This vs. is usually taken as evidence for the “eclipse” theory of the Svarbhānu
story, which aligns it with the later Rāhu myth in which Rāhu swallows the sun. But
there is no other evidence for this connection in Vedic, and ‘swallow’ can be
accounted for by inner-Vedic parallels. See the cited disc. in Hyenas.
Although Atri is usually considered the addressee of the entire vs., for reasons
having to do with the Vāyav Indraś ca construction in cd, I suggest (Hyenas 284–86)
that Indra is the referent of the 2nd ps. in c, conjoined with Varuṇa in d.
V.41 All Gods
As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn consists of verses dedicated to a
sequence of gods, both major and minor, seemingly unordered. The full list consists
of 1 Mitra and Varuṇa / 2 Mitra, Varuṇa, Āyu, Indra, Maruts, Rudra / 3 Aśvins,
Rudra / 4 Trita, Wind, Agni, Pūṣan, Bhaga / 5 Maruts / 6 Vāyu / 7 Night and Dawn /
8 Men (Maruts?), Lord of the Dwelling Place, Tvaṣṭar, trees, plants, Holy Place / 9
Mountains, Āptya / 10 Trita, Apām Napāt, Agni / 11 Maruts, Bhaga, waters, plants,
woods, mountains / 12 Agni, Waters / 13 Maruts / 14 Indra (maybe) / 15 Shielding
Goddess, Rasā / 16 Maruts, Ahi Budhnya / 17 gods / 18 gods, goddess / 19-20 Iḍā,
Urvaśī. The Maruts regularly recur in this sequence, and though, as noted in the publ.
intro., there is little Marut imagery (though perhaps more vocab. than I recognized at
48
the time), if there is focus in this hymn, it is probably the Maruts, who dominate
much of the rest of the maṇḍala after the All God hymns.

### 41.1  
The conjunction vā ‘or’ dominates this vs.: there are 4 overt occurrences
(twice in b, once each in c and d), as well as covert encodings, beginning with vā(m
mitr)āv(aruṇ)āv (the latter two inverted) in pāda a and ending with the last word of
the vs., vā́(jān). The end of the 2nd pāda, vā dé, with two monosyllables that, inverted,
produce dévā(ḥ) (though with wrong accent for *devā́ḥ), draws further attention to vā.
As noted in the intro., the prominence of vā may establish a theme of choice or
alternatives appropriate to the mass of gods mentioned in the rest of the hymn, and
vā also echoes the last syllable of the phrase víśve devā́ḥ “All Gods,” to whom the
hymn is dedicated.
Given the plethora of vā-s and the absence of any finite verb, save for
intrusive trā́sīthām in c, it is not surprising that interpretations of the structure and
syntax of the vs. are all over the map. In addition to the standard tr. (Ge, Re [EVP IV,
V], WG), see also Old, Lü (Varuṇa 585–86), Schindler (Root nouns, 24–25), Klein
(II.203–4), Scar (581), Keydana (Inf. 155 n. 142). I will not rehearse them all here.
Like many of these interpr., I take the three vā-s of bc as defining a tripartite
structure of roughly parallel entities. I then assume that the vā of d is situated on a
higher level of structure and is contrasting abc with a new clause inaugurated in d.
The two clauses (abc and d) are separated by the independent interjection trāsīthāṃ
naḥ closing c. As Ge points out (n. 1c), trāsīthāṃ naḥ has a similar role elsewhere
(IV.55.1, VII.71.2); IV.55.1 is especially similar, since it is in the first vs. of an All
God hymn that begins kó vaḥ (like kó nú vām here), with Mitra and Varuṇa as the
subjects of trā́sīthām.
My interpr. of the larger structure rests on taking dé at the end of b as an infin.
(with many, but not all) and assuming that the poet has exploited the voice neutrality
of infinitives to give it passive value in abc (“[is] to be given”) and active value in d
(“[is] to give”). This further assumes that káḥ refers to the (mortal) recipient in abc
and, resupplied in d, to one of the gods. With these assumptions in place, the case
relations in the two syntactically distinct parts of the vs. fall into place: the nom. káḥ
… ṛtāyán “who, performing the truth …” of pāda a is the mortal worshiper and
recipient of the gods’ largess; his counterpart in d is the dat. yajñāyaté. The vām of
pāda a is to be interpr. two different ways: in the first part it expresses the divine
beneficiaries of the mortal’s service; resupplied in d, it should be construed with
likewise resupplied káḥ (or better kataráḥ) “which of you two?”
The tripartite vā structure of bc details the three sources of gifts that may be
given to the worshiper: heaven, earth, and the ritual ground. They are subtly
unparallel: ‘heaven’ is a straight noun, either in abl. (as in the publ. tr.) or gen.; earth
is represented by a deriv. adj. ‘earthly’ in the gen. (pā́rthivasya). It is a partitive gen.,
and if diváḥ … máhaḥ is gen., it too is partitive. If it’s an abl., it expresses the source.
The third term, “at the seat of truth” (ṛtásya … sádasi), expresses the place where the
gift is to be given. Scar supplies ‘at the seat’ for all three terms. This is not
impossible, but the poet seems to be aiming for slightly skewed and off-balance
49
phraseology, and three different types of expressions for three parallel terms would
suit his purposes admirably.
In the new structure of d, with active value of the infinitive dé, vā́jān is its
object. The last grammatically unparallel functional parallel is yajñāyaté … paśuṣó
ná. Assuming that it is a gen. sg. (Old and Re take it as acc. pl.), paśuṣáḥ ‘of one who
wins cattle’ is in some sense parallel to yajñāyaté ‘for the one who sacrifices’, in that
the vā́jān (‘prizes’) come to both. But paśuṣáḥ is a gen. dependent on vā́jān, while
yajñāyaté is the indirect object with the infin. dé.

### 41.2  
After the cat’s cradle of vs. 1, this vs. comes as a welcome relief -- or at least
in its first half, which consists of a list of gods in the nom. and a verb they can all
serve as subject to. With 6 gods (and an epithet -- or 7 gods if ṛbhukṣā́is taken
separately) to fit into 22 syllables, the poet can’t get into too much trouble.
The 2nd hemistich is slightly more complex. It consists of an elliptical vā rel.
cl.: “or (in those) who …,” with the gapped ‘those’ parallel to enclitic naḥ in pāda a.
The final word sajóṣāḥ I take as referring to the gods; the stem(s) sajóṣa(s)- is
generally used of gods (see sajóṣāḥ in 4b), and note that their verb juṣanta ends the
first hemistich. But, with the standard tr., it may refer to the mortals providing the
gods’ praise.

### 41.3  
I take the passively used inf. huvádhyai with a gapped agent “by the priests”
vel sim., to match the implicit 2nd pl. subj. of prá … bharadhvam in the 2nd hemistich.
The use of a passive inf. in the 1st half, contrasting with an active usage (though not
an inf. here) in the 2nd half, recalls the structure of vs. 1. In our vs. there is a switch of
2nd ps. reference from the (two) gods in ab to the (pl.) mortal officiants in cd.
The use of the derived adj. ráthya- ‘belonging to the chariot’ rather than its
base noun rátha- recalls pā́rthivasya in 1c substituting for a form of the noun pṛthivī́-.
Ge (flg. Sāy.) identifies the “lord of heaven” (divó ásura-) as Rudra, on the
basis of parallels (see his n. 3c).

### 41.4  
The parade of ill-assorted divinities and semi-divinities continues. The
sequence is made more muddled by the fact that Trita is always a shadowy figure,
who is probably (but not certainly) the same as Āptya in vs. 9 (Āptya being Trita’s
usual patronymic) and Trita in 10 and who is probably (but not certainly) the referent
of pāda a here: “the heavenly victor with Kaṇva as Hotar.” If he is the referent of
pāda a, it is slightly odd that he is both qualified as ‘heavenly’ (divyáḥ) and said to be
‘from heaven’ (diváḥ, pāda b). It might be best, with Ge (/WG) to take diváḥ as the
place-from-which of all the figures mentioned; however, Wind and Agni are
normally associated with the midspace and the earth respectively, and Pūṣan and
Bhaga are not particularly heavenly deities. It’s worth noting that divyá- continues
the poet’s habit of using deriv. -ya-adjectives in place of (or perhaps here beside)
their nominals, and so the doubling divyá- / diváḥ might not be so odd after all.
I do not know exactly what to do with prá initial in the vs., but it is
noteworthy that it fits into a sequence of prá-initial expressions, where the preverb is
50
in tmesis, beginning with 3d prá … bharadhvam and continuing with 5a prá …
bharadhvam again and 6a prá … kṛṇudhvam (followed by initial prá in 6b and 7b).
In our vs. there is no finite verb to construe it with in tmesis, but note the loc.
prabhṛthé in c. My assumption is that vs.-initial prá simply reinforces prabhṛthé in a
vs. sandwiched between two full prá … bharadhvam expressions. It could also be
construed with jagmuḥ in d, though one might expect a more prominent, metricalboundary-adjoining jagmuḥ in that case.
The loc. prabhṛthé and the acc. ājím both serve as goal with jagmuḥ -- another
ex. of the poet’s penchant for slightly off-balance parallels.

### 41.5  
The first hemistich consists of a syntactically “active” 2nd pl. verb (‘present!’
prá … bharadhvam, though it is morphologically middle) paired with a passive
(‘should be produced’ dadhīta) without overt agent, structurally similar to vs. 3 with
a passive infinitive (huvádhyai) without agent and the same “active” 2nd pl. prá …
bharadhvam. This structure is further reminiscent of vs. 1 with passive and act. uses
of the same infinitive dé.
In this vs. it is not altogether clear who the 2nd pl. subject of prá bharadhvam
is. Ge thinks this is about the dakṣiṇā and suggests as subj. either the
Opferveranstalter or the Maruts. I don’t see the dakṣiṇā connection, and given the
reciprocal relationship between gods and men depicted already in the hymn (vss. 1
and 3), in the next vs. (6) with dhiyé dhuḥ playing off dadhīta dhī́ḥ in our 5b, and
elsewhere, I think it likely that the 2nd pl. addressees here are the (All) Gods in
general, who are asked to provide tangible wealth in exchange for the praise
embodied in the dhī́- ‘visionary thought’ produced by the poets. The use of the exact
same verb prá bharadhvam in 3 and 5, with opposite but complementary subjects
(priest-poets / gods), is a neat reversal.
The standard tr. take auśijásya as a PN and construe it with hótā. This is not
impossible, but since, as we’ve seen, the poet is fond of using -ya-deriv. adjectives
for nouns, I think it more likely that it stands for uśij- ‘(type of) priest’ in the pl.
Assuming as usual, that the Hotar is Agni, who mediates between men and gods, it is
reasonable that he would be pleased both by the activities of this priestly group and
by those of the gods, represented by the Maruts. For the association of Hotar and
auśijá- see also IV.21.6–7, though that passage is exceptionally opaque.
The vs. contains several instances of phonological and morphological play. In
b the pāda-final phrase dadhīta dhī́ḥ shows tight phonological similarity though the
two words belong to different roots. The same play is found in the next vs. (6d),
likewise pāda-final, in dhiyé dhuḥ -- same noun dhī́-, verb to the same root √dhā --
though the phonological relationship is not as tight. In 5b dadhīta dhī́ḥ yields a very
bad Triṣṭubh cadence, whereas 6d dhiyé dhuḥ provides a completely orthodox
cadence. This may be an example of metrical poetic repair, where the metrical
violation of the first calls attention to the phrase, which is satisfactorily resolved in
the next vs.
In the second hemistich we find # (suś)éva éva(ir) ... # (y)é va évā, evoking
(d)eva- again. Pāda d lacks a syllable. It is tempting to emend the opening to yé *vā
51
va évā, given the prominence of vā in the hymn -- as Old also suggests. But this
emended sequence makes less sense and also disturbs its phonological echo of pāda c.
It should also be noted that yé va évā is also found in 13a in a different metrical
position and cf. also scrambled evayā́in 16b. If *vā were to be inserted, the tr. could
be changed to “is well disposed because of the ways of the … Priests or (those)
which are the ways of you powerful ones, o Maruts.”

### 41.6  
There are again a number of ways to construe this vs., and I will concentrate
on my own. Given the alternation I see in this hymn between the actions of gods and
men, I think (with most) that the 2nd pl. subj. of prá … kṛṇudhvam is back to the
mortal ritual officiants (as in 3cd), rather than the gods (as in 5a). I also take prá
kṛṇudhvam to be the verb of all of abc, reinforced by prá opening b. This further
means that the nominatives of c (iṣudhyáva ṛtasā́paḥ) refer to the mortals and the
púraṃdhīḥ is acc. pl., not nom. as many take it. Crucial to this interpr. is the parallel
cited by Old, X.64.7 prá vo vā́yuṃ rathayújaṃ púraṃdhiṃ, stómaiḥ krṇ̥ udhvam
sakhyā́ya pūṣáṇam. “Set in front with your praises Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot,
Plenitude, (and) Pūṣan for partnership,” with clear acc. púraṃdhim a parallel obj.
with vā́yuṃ rathayújam (as here) to prá … kṛṇudhvam.
I then take d as displaying the usual reciprocity found elsewhere in the hymn,
but with a grammatical twist. The last set of divine beings honored by mortals, the
acc. object púraṃdhi- of c, are, in my opinion, the unexpressed subjects of d and
participate in a grammatical play. The noun púraṃdhi- is fem., though it is at most
the animatization of an abstract ‘plenitude, abundance’. Furthermore, it looks
synchronically like a cmpd. with a form of √dhā, even though that is not the current
standard etym. (cf. EWA s.v.). I therefore think that the pl. obj. púraṃdhīḥ of pāda c,
reconfigured as subjects of d, are depicted as explicitly female -- as ‘good wives’
(vásvīḥ … pátnīḥ) -- and serve as subject to a form of √dhā (dhuḥ) folketymologically extracted from púraṃdhi-. The unexpressed obj. is then (missegmented) *púram *‘plenty’. As was discussed ad vs. 5, dhuḥ also participates in a
figure with dhiyé that reverses dadhīta dhī́ḥ in 5d.
I do not entirely understand the position of ā́, which appears to be a preverb
with dhuḥ (so Gr), but appears to have been moved in tmesis to a position adjacent
neither to a metrical boundary nor to a syntactic one (though this would be easier to
argue). It may have been flipped (from a putative *dhiyé ā́dhuḥ) to allow the figure
just discussed (dhiyé dhuḥ picking up 5b dadhīta dhī́ḥ).
On iṣudhyú-, see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming article “Vedic
iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.”

### 41.7  
The hymn contains three exx. of éṣe (5b, 7a, 8d). Though Lub classifies them
all as locc. to the thematic stem éṣa-, I follow the standard tr. in taking the one in this
vs. as a 1st sg. pres., while the other two are locc. in the phrase rāyá éṣe “in the quest
for wealth.” The parallel for 7a cited by Ge, I.186.4 úpa va éṣe … uṣā́sānáktā, seems
to clinch this interpr., and the next vs. (8), beginning abhí vo arce, also PREV vaḥ 1st
-
sg. VERB, reinforces it.
52
In d I read ā́hā not ā́hā (a change only in the Pp. not the Saṃhitā text), and
analyze this sequence as ā́+ áhā, the neut. pl. of ‘day’. This is one of only two
supposed exx. of the particle ha with long vowel; the other one (IV.31.5) also follows
ā́and is susceptible to the same analysis. See disc. there.

### 41.8  
Ge takes nṛ́̄n as gen. pl. rather than acc., but this is unnec. The stem nṛ́- is
regularly used of gods, esp. the Maruts, so there is no reason that they cannot be
addressees here (so Re, WG).
The standard tr. take dhányā sajóṣā dhiṣáṇā as nom. sg. and parenthetic; e.g.,
Ge “—einverstanden ist die reichmachende Dhiṣaṇā—” But the instr. sg. in -ā to fem.
-ā-stems is still quite common in the RV, and that is how I construe the phrase here.

### 41.9  
svaítu- in b is a hapax. Following a tentative suggestion of Ge’s (n. 9b), I
take it as a vṛddhi form related to Aves. xv
aētu- ‘family’, pace Narten (YH 266 n. 59),
who, however, does not give reasons for her rejection of the association (though it’s
true that we should really expect a thematic *svaitava- or the like). I confess,
however, that my rendering of ab is merely a guess (as, it seems, are the other
divergent tr.). I don’t know why the mountains should be associated with our
production of offspring; the sexual connotation WG suggest in their n., that
mountains are felsenhart and knotig, seems farfetched. My own tentative suggestion
is that the progeny here belong to the mountains, not to us, and refer to the material
goods originating from mountains that we will enjoy: see I.55.3 párvataṃ ná bhójase
“like a mountain to be enjoyed” and Ge’s parallels adduced there; also passages like
VII.37.8 ā́rā́yo yantu párvatasya rātaú “let the riches of the mountain come here at
(the time for) giving”; II.24.2 vásumantam .. párvatam “the goods-filled mountain.”
If I am correct, the simile, in which the mountains are said to be vásavo ná vīrā́ḥ
“like good heroes” may be a bit of a pun, with vásavaḥ actually referring to the
material goods of the mountains. To make my interpr. clearer, I might slightly emend
the tr. to “to thrust out their progeny for us.”
The alternative etym. of svaítu- found in Gr, favored by Narten, and
represented in the tr. of Re and WG analyses it as svá-etu- ‘having their own going’,
which seems singularly inappropriate. It is regularly emphasized that mountains
can’t be moved — except when they’re in fear of some greater force (like the
Maruts) — so “going” should not be one of their properities. It could refer to the
myth of the winged mountains (the wings then clipped by Indra), but this does not
seem the context for a reference to this myth. WG attenuate the sense to a figurative
“die ein Eigenleben führen,” which avoids the mountain-movement problem, but
essentially denies the force of the etymology. By contrast, a reference to ‘family’ fits
comfortably with the production of progeny.
I don’t know what Āptya is doing here, either. Again, the sexual connotation
suggested in WG’s n. is invisible to me. It does seem likely that he is the same figure
as Trita in 10b, since both are associated with the production of praise. Trita in 4b is
less clearly tied in.
53
Note śáṃsaṃ náryaḥ, which reminds of nárā-śáṃsa- (though they don’t
belong to the same syntagm here) and also continues the poet’s fondness for -yaderivatives.

### 41.10  
WG take Trita as the persona of the 1st ps. speaker of astoṣi (“ich, als Trita
…”), whereas I follow Ge and Re in supplying a 3rd ps. form of √stu for b.
The form etárī is, of course, problematic, but is most likely a loc. sg.; for disc.
see Tichy (-tar-stems, 59–61). It is found only here and in VI.12.4, in the same pādafinal phrase etárī ná śūṣaíḥ. In our passage there is some phonetic justification for the
form (though not in VI.12.4); note the ni/ri sylls: gr̥nīté agnir etárī ... / ... ní riṇāti.

### 41.12  
This vs. presents a number of difficulties. The first is the easiest solved:
who is the referent of ab? Although this is almost universally taken to be the Wind, I
think it is more likely Agni. Only Agni is called ūrjā́m páti- “lord of nourishments”
(otherwise only in the voc. ūrjām pate), also ūrjó nápāt “child of nourishment.”
Given this exclusive identification, it seems unlikely that the audience would assign a
different referent, esp. since ūrjā́m pátiḥ is the first epithet encountered and sets the
frame of reference; the others only show up in pāda b. Moreover, though párijman-
‘earth-circling’ is used of the Wind, it also refers to other entities, including, fairly
often, Agni (VI.2.8, VI.13.2, VII.13.3, I.127.2, III.2.9). The other descriptor in b,
iṣirá- ‘vigorous’, is applied to a variety of beings and things, including the Wind, but
also Agni (III.2.14, 5.4). The only activity posited of the subject of this hemistich is
nábhas tárīyān (for which see below), which is also applicable to either.
The pāda-final sá in pāda a is quite unusual. A cursory glance through Lub for
parallels yields only II.35.1, III.13.3, (VII.86.6 sā́), IX.71.8, IX.79.3, X.108.4 (a
careful search might produce a few more). All of these exx. are either rhetorically
contrastive, or sá takes its proper position in a new clause. Although it is possible
that the sá here also begins a new, purely nominal clause with b, this seems clumsy. I
have a quite speculative suggestion about it, linking it with the immediately
following nábhas tárīyān. The standard — and quite persuasive — interpr. of this
phrase is “quicker than a cloud,” but this imposes an abl. sg. interpr. on nábhaḥ,
which should then belong to a root noun nábh- ‘cloud’, beside the standard s-stem
nábhas-. This root noun does not otherwise exist: the supposed root noun nábh-
(glossed ‘Zerspalter, Zerbrecher’ by Gr) in I.174.8 is more likely a verb (see comm.
ad loc.). And in any case we should expect an accent *nabhás. Re’s suggestion that
nábhas is simply haplology for *nábhasas is probably correct, but I suggest that it
left a trace of its vanished final -as in the pāda-final sá immediately preceding — a
tangible sign of the effects of speed: the final syllable got cut off and left behind.
The second hemistich is very puzzling and has given rise to very different and
incompatible interpr. (WG being esp. distant from the rest). Mine more or less
follows Old (or one of his alternatives), who discusses the passage with his
customary acuity; I will not discuss other renderings in detail. I am not at all certain
that mine (/Old’s) is correct, however. The framework of the passage compares the
waters, subjects of the verb, with fortifications (púraḥ), the point of comparison
54
being their resplendant appearance (śubhrá-). So far also Ge; Re also follows this
structure, but floats the possibility that púr- can mean ‘corps’, which would be
convenient but is of course unsupported. With Old and Ge (we now lose Re, who
takes d as a separate clause with the ladles as subj.), the fortifications are those of a
mountain (ádreḥ), and this mountain is characterized as pári … babṛhāṇá- ‘enclosing’
(pári √bṛh has this meaning in the Brāh.). Although we would not ordinarily expect
tmesis of a participle, esp. a part. in an oblique case, the tmesis here is iconic: the
enclosed object is located between preverb and participle. This object is srúcaḥ
‘offering ladles’. Now of course in a literal interpr. a mountain enclosing a bunch of
ladles sounds very odd, Old cleverly suggests that the ladles stand for cows -- living
ladles, as it were, from which ghee comes as it does from the offering ladles. These
cows are then the cows trapped within the Vala cave. The hemistich thus starts
jointly in the physical world and on the ritual grounds, since the listening waters are
probably both “real” natural waters and the waters standing by for the soma sacrifice.
It then moves, via the simile, to the natural world (mountain fortifications) and the
world of myth (the Vala cave), and back to the ritual ground, with the enclosed ladles.
If this interpr. is correct, it is a very condensed and clever expression.

### 41.13  
Another opaque vs., whose difficulties begin with the first word vidā́. This
is taken as the 2nd pl. pf. by Gr, Ge, WG. (Re unaccountably takes it as a 1st sg. ‘Je
sais …’, without comment -- presumably a careless error for véda.) I follow Old in
taking it as the instr. of the root noun to the same root.
The phrase yé va évā(ḥ) recurs from 5d though in a different metrical position.
Here as there it refers to the “ways” (évāḥ) of the Maruts (so Ge, Re, flg. Sāy., contra
Old’s tentative Ādityas) -- the ways which by our knowledge (vidā́) we are in a
position to proclaim (brávāma), presumably in the form of a hymn, for which we
expect reward (vā́ryaṃ dádhānāḥ “acquiring what is choice”) -- just as in vs. 5 a
visionary thought (dhī́ḥ) was to be produced in return for wealth (rāyá éṣe ávase “for
help in the quest for wealth”). The part. dádhānāḥ has almost a purpose function, and
to make the reciprocal action clearer I might emend the tr. from “as we acquire” to
“while acquiring …” or even “for acquiring.”
The first sticking point in the second hemistich is caná. This is universally
taken as negative (as caná generally is). However, in this case I think that it is simply
equivalent to ca ná (so also Klein I: 289–91 with n. 8) and that the ná here is serving
as the simile-marking particle, not the negative. váyaḥ is often used in a simile at the
beginning of a pāda: I count 7 #váyo ná passages, incl. V.59.7 in this maṇḍala, where
it’s the Maruts who are compared to birds (cf. also I.87.2 #váya iva marutaḥ) —
though I do have to admit that 2 #váyaś caná passages (I.24.6, 155.5) contain the
negative.
Therefore, contra all the standard tr./interpr., I take the subject of cd not as
‘birds’ (váyaḥ), but as the Maruts compared to birds (like V.59.7, I.87.2). The adj.
subhū́- ‘of good essence’ is regularly used of the Maruts in this maṇḍala (V.55.3,
59.3, 87.3) and would identify them as the referent to an alert audience. In this 2nd
55
half-vs. we make good on our promise to proclaim the ways of the Maruts -- this
exploit is one of these ways.
Unfortunately exactly what that exploit involves is unclear. That the Maruts
should come down like birds is unproblematic: they regularly fly through the
midspace and come down to interact with mortals, generally at the ritual. But the
target of their descent, expressed in pāda d, has no parallels, as far as I can find. In
my interpr. the mortal (mártam) to whom they come is in distress and receives their
help. Unlike the standard tr. I take the hapax root noun instr. kṣubhā́as characterizing
the Maruts’ movements (fluttering like birds), not the state of the mortal, which is
expressed by ánuyataṃ vadhasnaíḥ “held/controlled by murderous weapons.” I
assume that he is under attack by hostile forces and requires the Maruts’ assistance to
free him.
The phonological play with va/ā that we noted earlier in the hymn
(particularly vss. 1, 5) has returned here: … yé va evā́, brávāma ...vā́ryaṃ ...
váya(ḥ) ... subhvà(ḥ) ... vadhasnaíḥ — which draws attention to the thematic
connection between this vs. and vs. 5.

### 41.14  
Since Indra is several times called súmakha-, I assume he is the referent
here -- though nothing much depends on it in this generic vs. and both Ge and Re
take it to be the sacrificer or the patron of the sacrifice.
WG suggest that candrā́grā(ḥ) modifies both ‘days’ and ‘hymns’; this is a
good idea, with ‘gold, gleam’ used in two slightly different senses. The days begin
with the gleaming of the golden sun, while the hymns offered to the gods are
metaphorically tipped with the gold given by the gods in response to praise.
In d udā́is generally taken as the instr. sg. of a root noun ‘water’ (so, e.g., Gr
and all the standard tr., though Ge hesitates), beside the more common oblique nstem instr. udnā́. However, I follow Schindler (Root nouns, 12–13), who argues that
it is better taken as the nom./acc. pl. to the same -n-stem.
The somewhat curious expression abhíṣātā árṇāḥ “conquered floods” finds its
formulaic match in nearby V.50.4 árṇā … sánitā ‘winner of the floods’; this may
well be a general reference to the progress of the Ārya into the Punjab, winning
territory river by river. Ge cites as parallel I.131.5 té anyā́m-anyāṃ nadyàm
saniṣnata “They kept winning one river after another.”

### 41.15  
The action in pāda a is a positive one: the speaker is assured to make it to
old age. See 17de and disc. there, as well as X.59.4, which will be disc. further below.
The construction in b, which expresses the agent of ní dhāyi, is complex. Its
underlying model is the “X and which Y” construction, but it is inverted, with the rel.
cl. member first: “(by her) who is … and by the protectors.” Moreover, it contains
both vā and ca. As Klein says (II.174–75), “the construction should most likely be
viewed as a conjunctive anacoluthon in which the poet begins by intending
alternative conjunction and finishes with an additive sequence. Within each member
the conjunction occupies its normal enclitic position: (várūtrī vā śakrā yā́) (pāyúbhiś
ca).”
56
On ṛjuvániḥ see Scar 467–68. Note that this form produces a bad cadence.
On the connection between cd and vss. 19–20 see disc. below.

### 41.16  
As does upamātivániḥ in 16e. On this form and on the meter of both -vániḥ
forms, see Scar 467. On úpamāti- see comm. ad VIII.40.9.
The opening of the vs., kathā́dāśema, echoes 11a kathā́… bravāma. In both
cases the object of our action is the Maruts. Another echo is found in evayā́(ḥ), which
is a scrambling of yé va évā(ḥ) of 5d and 13a (though yé and -yā(ḥ) are completely
different grammatically), in both cases of the Maruts. The sequence in our pāda b,
evayā́marútaḥ “the Maruts traveling their ways,” is also matched by the punctuating
exclamation evayā́marut found in every vs. of the Anhangslied to the Maruts that
ends this maṇḍala (V.87.1–9, tr. there “Maruts on the march”).

### 41.17  
As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 16–17, in a different meter from what
precedes (and follows), seem to provide a summary of the preceding hymn, esp. 17,
with its self-conscious internal quote íti cin nú “in just these (words) now.” See
Janert (Dhāsi, pp. 16–17), who argues this position in some detail.
All the standard tr. (as well as Janert, 42) agree in taking d and e as separate
clauses and supplying a verb for c. All consider the clauses contrastive: in d I hope to
be granted a pleasant or benevolent dhāsí- for my body, while in e I express the wish
that Nirṛti should swallow my old age. But this is directly contrary to what was said
in 15ab, where the securing of his old age was an occasion for celebration by the poet.
It is true that two different words for ‘old age’ are involved: jarimán- in 15, jarā́- in
17, but these words do not contrast semantically elsewhere as far as I can see (cf.
X.32.5, 8, which contains jarā́- followed by jarimán-) (even though Re remarks
“noter l’opposition”). An important parallel is provided by X.59.4 dyúbhir hitó
jarimā́sū́no astu, parātaráṃ sú nírṛtir jihītām “Throughout the days let our old age
be secured for us. -- Let Dissolution move herself further away.” There old age is
‘secured’ (hitáḥ) as it was in our 15a jarimā́ní dhāyi (both to √dhā), and Dissolution
(nírṛtiḥ) is urged to move away. (It should be admitted that that pāda is a refrain to
the first three vss. of X.59 and so not necessarily as closely tied to the preceding pāda
as it might be.) I therefore doubt that in our vs. the poet is hoping that Dissolution
will swallow the old age that he (and other poets) elsewhere want to keep safe.
Instead I think de is the expression of his fear that if he fails to win the gods (abc)
Dissolution will succeed in depriving him of his wished-for old age. I have pushed
átrā perhaps a bit too much -- to ‘otherwise’; I would prefer a ‘lest’ (néd) clause or
even a mā́clause, but néd, which becomes well developed in Vedic prose, barely
exists in the RV and the poet may have been casting about for a way to express this
modality. A further piece of evidence in favor of my interpr. is the word dhāsí.
Although this word often means ‘well-spring’ or ‘source’ (see comm. ad I.62.3,
140.1), in some cases it seems to mean ‘place, depository’ and be associated with
(/derived, at least synchronically, from) √dhā. Here the dhāsí- seems to be the
nominalization of ní dhāyi in 15 (cf. hitáḥ in X.58.4) — that is, the place in which old
age is securely held. I therefore take it as coreferential with jarā́m in e.
57
V.41.18–20: If, as suggested above, 16–17 are the finale of the hymn proper, these 3
(or 2 ¼) were tacked on. They certainly lack the complications of the rest of the
hymn. The dominance of female figures is striking.

### 41.18  
Despite the word order, I follow Janert (contra the standard tr.) in
construing pāda-final góḥ with íṣam, rather than with immediately preceding śásā,
which saves us from determining what the recitation or instruction of the cow is.
V.41.19–20: The single pāda of 20 simply continues vs. 19 thematically and
syntactically, as Old points out. They constitute a single vs.
The signature word of the beginning of the hymn, vā, returns in force: urváśī
vā ...urváśī vā brhaddi ̥ vā́... ūrṇvānā́. Note also urváśī ... urváśī ... abhyūrṇvānā́...
ūrjavyàsya.
This vs. sequence seems inspired by 15cd. Vs. 15 has a similar focus on
female figures, and 15c #síṣaktu mātā́mahī́rasā́naḥ is echoed by 20a #síṣaktu naḥ,
whose subject is likewise a female. The ‘mother’ mātā́of 15c is matched slightly
earlier in this vs. sequence, in 19a, and there she is accompanied by rivers (smán
nadī́bhiḥ 19b), even as the mother of 15c is identified as the river Rasā.
In fact 19–20 depict a matriarchal lineage of sorts, as Ge points out (n. 19bc).
Besides Iḍā, explicitly “the mother of the flock” (yūthásya mātā́) here, there is Urvaśī,
twice: 19b and 19c. I am not entirely sure what to make of this doubling. I doubt that
two different Urvaśīs are meant, rather the familiar Urvaśī in two different guises (so
Ge). In 19b she is associated with rivers. This reminds us of the attendance of her
fellow Apsarases and of the rivers on the birth of Urvaśī’s son in X.95.6–7, with
Urvaśī herself qualified as ‘watery’ (ápyā in X.95.10b) and her son as “born from the
water” (jániṣṭo apáḥ, X.95.10c). Urvaśī Bṛhaddivā (‘of lofty heaven’; on the accent
bṛhaddivā́- see AiG II.1.109, 120) in 19c may refer to a return to her residence in
heaven after breaking with Purūravas (not, however, mentioned in X.95). In any case,
Urvaśī’s son is named Āyu; his paternal grandmother is Iḍā, the mother of Purūravas
(addresed as aiḍa in X.95.18), so the title ‘mother’ given to Iḍā in 19a has another
resonance. Because of Urvaśī’s relationship to Āyu, with Ge and Re I supply ‘mother’
in 19d and 20a to govern the various genitives. Thus with Iḍā, Urvaśī, and Āyu we
have a three-generational family.
I am uncertain what to do with ūravyàsya in 20 (PN or not), and I also do not
know what abhyūrṇvāṇā́in 19d is conveying.
V.42 All Gods
As noted in the publ. intro., like V.41 this hymn enumerates a number of
divine dedicands with no apparent ordering, save for the middle vss. (7–9), where
Bṛhaspati dominates. The list includes 1 Varuṇa, Mitra, Bhaga, Aditi, Aryaman / 2
Aditi, Mitra and Varuṇa / 3 Savitar / 4 Indra / 5 Bhaga, Savitar, Aṃśa, Vāja, and
Puraṃdhi / 6 Indra / 7-8 (-9) Brhaspati ̥ / 10 Maruts / 11 Rudra / 12 Sarasvatī,
Brhaddiv ̥ ā, Rākā / 13 Tvaṣṭar (+ Viśvarūpa?) / 14 Parjanya / 15 Maruts / 16 Earth
58
(etc.) / 17 gods / 18 Aśvins. Note no Agni, unless he's hidden in 1cd. The hymn is
much more straightforward, and less interesting, than V.41, but provides a relaxing
interlude in the overheated rhetoric of the All God hymns of V.

### 42.1  
As Ge (etc.) point out, átūrtapanthāḥ is the clue to the identification of the
referent of cd, since this epithet only occurs once elsewhere in the RV, in X.64.5,
where it is explicitly used of Aryaman. In that passage he is also qualified as
saptáhotā ‘having 7 Hotrars’, like páñcahotā here. And of course Aryaman makes
sense in this highly Ādityan context. Nonetheless, I think pāda c (pṛ́ṣadyoniḥ
páñcahotā) flirts with a different identification -- of Agni -- before sealing that of
Aryaman by átūrtapanthāḥ in d. Agni could plausibly have a womb of dappled
(ghee) (pṛ́ṣadyoni-), similar to ghṛtáyoni- ‘having a womb of ghee’ used of Agni in
V.8.6, as Ge points out (n. 1cd), and of course Agni is both associated with Hotars
and is the Hotar par excellence himself. Since, as noted above, Agni is not otherwise
found in this hymn, the poet may have gestured towards him covertly in 1c.

### 42.2  
This vs. is quite straightforward until we reach pāda d, where the nom. ahám
‘I’ demands a verb that isn’t there. Keeping in mind the theme of divine/human
reciprocity that runs through the last hymn and the rest of this one and employing our
usual method of attempting to supply missing material from context, it seems best to
supply a form of práti √grabh complementary to práti … jagṛbhyāt in a with Aditi as
subject. The poet wishes to grasp the bráhman- produced by the gods (c) in order to
turn it into praise (stóma-) for the gods (a). This reciprocal relationship may be
signaled by the first word in the vs. práti ‘in return, in response’.
The other question in d is what to do with the untethered locc. mitré varuṇé. I
have followed Ge in loosely construing them with mayobhú ‘joy itself’, even though
this stem does not elsewhere take a loc. Ge (n. 2d) cites a series of parallels with locc.
mitré váruṇe that seem to have similarly loose beneficial value.

### 42.3  
Note the distinction in no. between the two 2nd ps. impvs. in ab: sg. úd īraya
and pl. unátta. As commonly, the sg. is probably a self-addressed by the poet to
himself; that his object is “the best poet of poets” (kavítamaṃ kavīnā́m) simply
emphasizes the closed loop of reciprocity. The pl. impv. is presumably addressed to
his fellow celebrants, in this case the priests charged with the physical activity (the
Adhvaryu and his helpers, quite possibly). The pl. impv. unátta has a strong stem
form where we properly expect weak, but the expected form *und-ta à *untta à
(probably simplified to) *unta would have been difficult to parse.

### 42.4  
Ge thinks it’s our mánas- that’s at issue, but context makes it more likely to
be Indra’s (so also Re and WG).
Pāda c is a minor variant of 2c and in fact makes clear what the structure of 2c
is and where the rel. cl. begins. A minor example of syntactic repair.

### 42.5  
In pāda a it is unclear with what noun to construe gen. rāyáḥ. Ge and Re take
it with savitā́(Ge: “der Zuweiser … des Reichtums”), while WG seem to agree with
me in taking it with áṃśa(ḥ). Since Savitar is a far more defined divine being with a
name that, though having the literal sense ‘impeller’, is normally used just as a name,
I think Aṃśa, whose animatization is fairly shaky, is more likely to be used in a
literal abstract value and construed with a gen. of the same type.
The problematic form in the vs. is saṃjítaḥ. Properly speaking, this should
either be an abl./gen. sg. or a nom./acc. pl. of the root noun cmpd saṃjít- ‘complete
victor’. Gr analyzes it as gen. sg., modifying vṛtrásya, as, apparently, does Re, while
Ge and WG take it as nom. pl., presumably applicable to all the gods listed singly
before. All construe the gen. pl. dhánānām with it (e.g., Ge “die Erbeuter der
Schätze”), but this leaves vṛtrásya stranded, since it would be perverse to attribute
the victory over Vṛtra to Bhaga, Savitar, and Aṃśa in addition to Indra. Therefore all
the standard tr. supply sg. *hantā́(vel sim.) as an appositive to Indra, to govern
vṛtrásya. I consider this unnec. Our pāda seems to be based on a much-repeated pāda,
couched in the acc. sg., in the Triṣṭubh refrain vs. of the Viśvāmitras’ Indra hymns:
III.30.22 (etc.) ghnántaṃ vṛtṛā́ṇi saṃjítaṃ dhánānām. I consider our pāda a nonce
adaptation of the orig. pāda, construed as if orig. saṃjítam belonged to a them. stem -
- in other words saṃjítaḥ is a thematic back-formation, nom. singular, that allows the
formula to remain metrical. The last part of 7b, with sg. sanitā́raṃ dhánānām, gives
some support to this interpr., and note that Indra alone is called jiṣṇú- ‘victor’ in the
next vs. (6a). Of course, it must be admitted that in III.30.22 vṛtrā́ṇi is the obj. of a
form of √han and so supplying such a form here (as the standard tr. do) also gets
some support. But vṛtrá- has been transformed from acc. (pl.) to gen. (sg.) in our
passage and should be parallel to dhánānām.

### 42.7  
The splv. śámbhaviṣṭha- recalls śáṃtama- in 1a. Both stems are reasonably
well attested, though śáṃtama- has the edge. They do not seem to be consistently
distinguished in usage, but śáṃtama- seems more common qualifying inanimates
while śámbhaviṣṭha- and its base śambhú-/-ū́- are more common with animates. Such
is the case in this hymn, where śáṃtamā in 1a modifies ‘hymn’ (gī́ḥ) and
śámbhaviṣṭhaḥ in 7c modifies Bṛhaspati. Nonetheless, the tr. of the two forms should
be harmonized.

### 42.8  
The standard tr. (incl. also Schmidt, B+I 84 and Scar 202) take ab as a
separate nominal cl. The difference is trivial.
Less trivial is the difference between my rendering of the last part of d and
that of all the others. They take subhágās téṣu rā́yaḥ as the nominal main clause to
the rel. cl. (yé aśvadā́ḥ …) that occupies the rest of the hemistich. Cf., e.g., Ge
“denen gehören die beglückenden Reichtümer.” In contrast I take subhágāḥ with the
rel. cl., qualifying the givers, and rā́yaḥ as acc. pl. in the main cl., and in the main cl.
I supply a verb ‘confer’ (vel sim.) extracted from ratnadhéyam in 7a. In favor of the
standard tr. are the facts that by accent rā́yaḥ is better analyzed as nom. than acc.
(though acc. pl. so accented are not rare) and that no verb need be supplied. Although
60
I am usually reluctant to supply material, in this case there are countervailing factors.
First, with the exception of one late passage (X.140.5), subhága-, which is quite
well-attested, is only used of animate beings, not of wealth or the like. Moreover, the
standard rendering leaves Bṛhaspati with little to do. The givers are “accompanied by
your help” (távotíbhiḥ), but otherwise seem to do quite nicely on their own --
whereas we might expect him to be acting on their material behalf by giving to them,
just as in the next vs. he is asked to strip the niggardly of their possessions and do
worse by other anti-ritualists. By my interpr. the vs. expresses the usual Rigvedic
trickle-down theory of material redistribution: the gods give goods to the patrons of
the sacrifice (kings, etc.), who then confer them on the priests and poets.

### 42.9  
The stilted nominal syntax with dummy verb √kṛ + acc. masc. abstract
(visarmā́ṇaṃ kṛṇuhi, lit. “make dissipation”), which together govern a neut. acc.
vittám, must result from the lack of a transitive pres. to √sṛ ‘flow, run’ -- pace Narten
(“Ai. sṛ …” 1969: 83 and n. 16 [=KlSch 130 and n. 16]), who characterizes several
forms of ví √sṛ as “transitiv,” though the acc. expresses the goal/place-throughwhich, not a real transitive object.
The expression prasavé vāvṛdhānā́n is not entirely clear and is variously
rendered — Ge “'die im Befehl gross sind,” Re “qui (se croyant) renforcés pour la
compétition,” Schmidt (B+I 85) “bei (unserer) Regsamkeit wachsen,” WG “obwohl
sie in ihrem Unterfangen erstarkt sind” — differing primarily in what prasavá- is
taken to mean. By my interpr. these foes, who violate all the norms of Ārya society
by refusing to participate in reciprocal exchange, by acting contrary to vratá- (the
chains of command that structure Ārya society), and by hating the verbal
formulations that express the Ārya view of the cosmos and their place in it,
nonetheless show their strength on the attack, the forward thrust. All the tr. reflect
this notion one way or another: the regretable strength of the enemies despite their
antisocial behavior.

### 42.10  
This vs. continues the theme of the impious foe, though the divine ally the
poet calls on to destroy the foe has changed from Bṛhaspati to the Maruts. Here (pāda
a) the enemy chooses to praise demons (rakṣásaḥ) when gods (deva-) are being
invited to the ritual and (c) mocks the ritual labor of the devotee. Because of the
strong association of sweat with ritual labor in the RV (see my “Avestan xšuuīd: A
Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 25 [2011
(2015),] and for √śam ‘labor’ with √svid ‘sweat’ I.86.8), I assume that the enemy
himself is engaging in (what we hope will be fruitless) ritual in pāda d, perhaps in
service of the demons, not the gods (cf. pāda a). In post-RVic texts the Asuras would
probably serve as the polar opposition to the gods, not the Rakṣasas, an indirect piece
of evidence for the well-known fact that the Asura-Deva opposition almost entirely
postdates the RV.
In the publ. tr. óhate in pāda a is tr. as an indicative (‘whoever lauds’), but it
should really be a subjunctive (“whoever will laud”), both on the basis of the
61
morphology (it belongs to a root pres., whose 3rd plural is also óhate) and of the
parallel subjunctives in the passage, cd yáḥ … nindāt, … karate.

### 42.11  
One of the striking passages in which the same divinity, in this case Rudra,
is called both devá- and ásura- (námobhir devám ásuraṃ duvasya “with acts of
reverence offer friendship to the god, the lord”), strong evidence that the strict
division and eternal enmity between Devas and Asuras in later texts has not yet
developed.

### 42.12  
The grammar of this vs. is quite straightforward; what difficulty it presents
lies in the uncertain and permeable boundary between PNs and common
noun/adjectives. In b vibhvataṣṭā́ḥ, modifying the rivers, is universally taken as
containing the PN Vibhvan, hence ‘fashioned by Vibhvan’. Since the referents of
pāda a are the Ṛbhus and Vibhvan is the name of an Ṛbhu, this makes some
contextual sense. However, fashioning a river seems beyond even the Ṛbhus’
expertise, and, further, in VI.61.13 Sarasvatī, a river after all, is vibhváne kr̥tā́“made
for wide extension / wide ranging.” I think that sense is meant here as well, and there
is simply some sly play on the Ṛbhu’s name.
I am less certain about what to do with bṛhaddivā́in c. In the immediately
preceding hymn (V.41.19) I take the same form as an attributive adjective with
urváśī: Urvaśī Bṛhaddivā “Urvaśī of lofty heaven.” Here it could likewise be
attributive to Sarasvatī or it could be a separate goddess. See Klein (I.328–29, 337)
on this mild dilemma. If Bṛhaddivā is a distinct entity, she is featureless, so there is
little at stake here.

### 42.13  
The phrase návyasīṃ jā́yamānam “the newer (hymn), being born,” with
comparative of ‘new’ and the pres. participle seems designed to refer to the current
hymn in the process of composition.
Tvaṣṭar is both the possessor and producer of “all forms” (cf. I.13.10
tváṣṭāram … viśvárūpam) and the father of a being called Viśvarūpa (likewise
viśvárūpa- ‘possessing all forms’ (cf. II.11.19, X.8.9 tvāṣṭrá- viśvárūpa- with the
patronymic tvāṣṭrá-). In one sense the second hemistich seems to be an attempt to
reconcile these two aspects: Tvaṣṭar as a lone creator god, the fashioner of all forms,
“(ex)changing his forms” (rūpā́minānáḥ) as sole agent -- but doing so “bulging (?) in
the body of his daughter” (āhanā́duhitúr vakṣánāsu)(if that’s what it means), which
introduces a sexual (indeed incestuous) element that would be appropriate to the
fathering of a son. On the one hand, we seem to have a model of primitive
embryology, with the fetus changing and developing within its mother’s womb; on
the other hand, the half-vs. mirrors the later Sanskrit notion that the father enters the
body of the mother and is reborn as the son. Unlike the incest of Dyaus and of
Prajāpati, the story of Tvaṣṭar’s incest (if that’s what this is) is otherwise muted and
not securely attested elsewhere.
The meaning and etymology of the s-stem āhanás- are deeply uncertain. In
context it seems to mean ‘swollen, bulging, luxuriant, lubricious’. As for the etym.
62
see EWA s.v. and, for a recent etymological attempt, Kulikov in the Lubotsky Fs.
(2018). The word has gained a certain notoriety in IEist discourse because it is
argued that it preserves the old suffixal accent of s-stem bahuvrīhis (see Stüber, sstems [2002] 27, 189). However, it is dangerous to pin the reconstruction of a whole
category on a word whose meaning, structure, and etymology are radically uncertain.
For disc. of the word, as well as demolition of the accentual theory it is supposed to
support, see JL “αἰνοπαθής.”
On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.
V.42.14–16: This trio of vss. echoes vs. 1 and ring-compositionally seems to bring
the hymn to a close, with the single pāda of 17 and the final vs. 18 tacked on (and
indeed the 2nd hemistich of 16: see below). The template is prá [HYMN, etc.] [GOD]
nūnám aśyāḥ, realized in 1ab as “May the hymn (gī́ḥ) now reach Varuṇa (etc.).” In
14ab we again have all the elements, while 15ab omits the initial preverb prá in favor
of úd immediately preceding the verb and omits nūnám entirely and 16ab reinstates
prá but still lacks nūnám:
1ab prá … váruṇam (etc.)… gī́r … nūnám aśyāḥ
14ab prá suṣṭutíḥ … iḷás pátim … nūnám aśyāḥ
15ab eṣá stómo mā́rutaṃ śárdhaḥ (etc.)… úd aśyāḥ
16ab praíṣá stómaḥ pṛthivī́m (etc.) … aśyāḥ
The impression given by this sequence of syntactic and lexical parallels -- that this is
the finale of the hymn -- is supported by the fact that the rest of the hymn, 16cd–18,
is repeated as15cd–17 in the next hymn, V.43.

### 42.14  
Despite the position of prá, opening a pāda that ends with the part.
ukṣámāṇaḥ, I take the prá not with that participle but with immediately preceding
pāda-final íyarti. For one thing, prá is found elsewhere with íyar- while it is not with
√ukṣ, and in addition tmesis of preverb + participle is fairly uncommon (though
certainly not unheard of). Ge and Re seem to follow the other route, taking it as
license to interpr. íyarti as intrans. or at least objectless (Ge ‘heraufzieht’, Re
‘s’avance’). But íyar- is otherwise always transitive, and though we would prefer the
two world halves not to be in motion, the point here is that Parjanya’s thunderstorm
is powerful enough to shake them. WG’s interpr. is like mine.
V.43 All Gods
This listing impulse so evident in the last two hymns (V.41–42) is less
pronounced here, though a variety of gods receive praise -- with Agni especially
prominent, as indicated in the publ. intro.: 2 Heaven and Earth, 3 Vāyu, 5 Indra, 6
Aramati, Agni, 7 Gharma pot, 8 Aśvins, 9 Pūṣan and Vāyu, 10 Maruts, 11 Sarasvatī,
12 Brhaspati ̥ as Agni, 13 Agni?, 14 Agni?, 15 Agni, Earth.
63

### 43.1  
On mahó rāyé see comm. ad IV.31.11. Again the publ. tr. carelessly follows
Ge’s tr., which takes the two forms together, as if they were an adjective-noun
syntagm despite the difference in case. I would now take maháḥ adverbially with Old.
See further ad VI.1.2.
The seven lofty and joy-bringing feminine beings (bṛhatī́ḥ saptá …
mayobhúvaḥ) in cd, the target of our invocation, are not further specified. I have
supplied ‘cows’ on the basis of ab and IX.86.25, which contains saptá dhenávaḥ, but
this is by no means certain. See other suggestions in Ge’s n. 1. The problem is that
there is no reason for the cows to number exactly seven; either ‘seven’ is, as Oberlies
(Rel. RV II.74) suggests, simply an indication of totality, or some more standard
group of seven, like the rivers, is being referred to (either via the image of cows or
directly).

### 43.3  
The subject of the impv. in c must also be Vāyu, because he regularly
receives the first drink of soma.

### 43.4  
In b the agent noun śamitár- most naturally belongs with the forms of √śam
referring to ritual labor. See, e.g., in the preceding hymn V.42.10 śámīṃ
śaśamānásya “the (ritual) labor of the one laboring.” However, already in the
Aśvamedha hymn of the RV it has acquired the euphemistic meaning ‘queller’, that
is, slaughterer, of the sacrificial beast; cf. I.162.9–10, as well as the simile in V.85.1
ví yó jaghā́na śamitéva cárma “who like a butcher a hide split apart …” in this
maṇḍala. I think it likely that both senses are meant here; in post-RVic ritual texts
Soma is regularly presented as a sacrificial victim.
In the 2nd hemistich Ge and WG (cf. also Old) take c and d as separate clauses,
utilizing the verb duduhe for both and supplying a priest (Ge: Adhvaryu) as subj. of c.
The reason is nom. sugábhastiḥ lit. ‘having good fists’, which must otherwise modify
aṃśú- ‘plant’. With Re, in the publ. tr. I take cd as a single clause with sugábhastiḥ
… aṃśúḥ a single NP, assuming that ‘having good fists’ of the soma plant means that
the plant has received good handling from the fists of its preparer. (Re, by contrast, tr.
“aux beaux rameaux,” with gábhasti- referring metaphorically to the growth habits
of the plant.) I now think my interpr. pushes the bahuvrīhi further than it should go,
so I would now emend the tr. to “(The priest,) having good fists, has milked out the
sap of the honey that dwells on the mountain; the plant has milked out its own
shimmering, pure (sap).” It is likely that the verb underlying pāda c should be active
(perhaps *dudoha); when middle forms like duduhe take an object, the subject is
usually a cow or cow-substitute (as here) producing milk from itself.

### 43.7  
On the position of this vs. in the hymn and its significance, see publ. intro. If
the vs. is an omphalos, it may focus attention on the mysteries of the Pravargya ritual.
The vs. is structured as a riddle, with the referent of yám (pāda a) withheld till d, with
three similes and several technical references to ritual activities in between.
The first simile (pāda a) is oddly structured, in that one expects something to
be compared to the unidentified acc. yám but there is no overt acc. expressed. Instead
64
we must supply this acc., as the most likely object of the participle pratháyantaḥ
‘spreading’ (transitive), which, in default of the acc. obj. itself, carries the simile
particle ná. The object to be supplied is barhíḥ ‘ritual grass’, which at every ritual is
spread as a seat for the visiting gods. Generally the verb in the expression “spread
(barhis)” is √stṛ ‘strew’, not √prath, but, as Old points out, √prath can also be used,
generally for the intransitive sense “(barhis) spreads” (V.5.4, X.70.4, etc.). The
object of transitive √prath is generally something much more prominent, like ‘earth’.
It may be that √prath was used here to give a cosmic resonance, but it may also be
partly ascribed to the alliteration in the vs.: prathayanto ... víprā, vapā́vantam ...
tápantaḥ / pitúr ná putrá upási práyiṣṭha(ḥ). The barhis is also sometimes anointed;
cf. II.3.4 barhíḥ … ghṛténāktám. Thus, the absent barhíḥ is at the intersection of the
two ritual verbs ‘spread’ and ‘anoint’, and supplies the missing point of comparison
in the simile “They anoint ‘which one’ (yám) like X.” The poet is inviting his
audience to solve for two variables -- the identity of the focus of the vs. expressed by
the rel. prn. yám and the object to which it is compared, but he makes the second
riddle easier by providing two verbs that could govern it. The overlap of the two
produces the answer.
The next simile, in b, targets a different ritual substance to compare with the
still unidentified yám. This time an accusative does appear on the surface, but it in
the form of an associated adjective, vapā́vantam ‘possessing the/an omentum.” In
classical śrauta ritual the omentum (vapā́) is the first and probably the most
important part of the sacrificial animal to be dealt with; after the death of the animal,
the omentum is removed and heated on two different fires, first preliminarily singed
on the Śamitar’s fire (NB: see vs. 4 and comm. thereon), then cooked on the
Āhavanīya fire (see my Hyenas, pp. 104–5). Here we can assume that what is
identified as ‘possessing an omentum’ is the sacrificial animal (an identification
supported by the occurrence of vapā́vantam in ŚB XIII.7.1.9), which itself is cooked
on the fire. Sacrificial animals are also anointed; see IV.6.3 paśvó anakti in a hymn
that treats the animal sacrifice in some detail. Once again, the incompletely identified
target of the simile is at the intersection of two ritual actions: ‘heat’ and ‘anoint’. In
this case the similarly unidentified yám, the gharma pot, is also subject to both these
actions in the Pravargya ritual.
The third simile, in pāda c, is the only one with all its parts, and is also the
only one without a ritual reference. It is a version of a standard trope.

### 43.8  
The last pāda is difficult, primarily because of dhúram. This would ordinarily
be the acc. of the root noun dhúr- ‘chariot pole’, and indeed that is how I take it. Ge
interprets it rather as an acc. infinitive (‘festzuhalten’) to √dhṛ. But that aniṭ root has
no seṭ forms in dhur- (unless dhúr- ‘chariot pole’ itself; so Whitney Roots, but see
now standard alternative etymology in Schindler, Rt nouns, and EWA, both s.v.).
WG’s semantic interpr. (‘zur Sicherung’) is similar to Ge’s, though derivationally
distinct: they see it as a secondary abstract(ion) from the ‘chariot pole’ word. Either
of these analyses eases the interpr. of the pāda. But given the chariot-part vocab. in
the rest of the pāda (āṇí- ‘axle-pin, peg’, nā́bhi- ‘wheel-nave’), it seems highly
65
unlikely that a standard word for a part of the chariot would in just this context not be
so used -- and cf. sudhúr- ‘amenable to the chariot pole’ a few vss. back (5c). I think
dhúram has to be an unmarked simile, an acc. goal parallel to nidhím. The Aśvins are
asked to go to the nidhí- as draft animals come tamely to the dhúr-, then to enter it as
the pin enters the nave.
I supply ‘honey’ with nidhím on the basis of the phrase nidhí- mádhūnām used
twice in Aśvin hymns with sim. vocab.: I.183.4 ayáṃ vām bhagó níhita iyáṃ gī́r,
dásrāv imé vām nidháyo mádhūnām “Here is the portion deposited for you, here the
hymn, o wondrous ones, and here the deposits of honey for you” / III.58.5 éhá yātam
pathíbhir devayā́nair, dásrāv imé vāṃ nidháyo mádhūnām “Travel here along the
paths leading to the gods. Wondrous ones, these stores of honey belong to you two.”
Since 'honey' is thematic in the previous parts of this hymn (1b, 2c, 3a, d, 4c, 6c),
supplying it here (esp. in Aśvin context) is easy.

### 43.9  
The function of utá in the pāda-final phrase utá tmán is unclear. Klein (I.347,
349) treats it as an example of an X Y utá construction (suggesting several diff.
possibilities), but does not consider the positional tendency of tmán(ā) or the dossier
of rhetorically similar phrases. Both tmán and tmánā have a distinct preference for
pāda-final position, with a word consisting of two light syllables preceding as here --
frequently iva, also úpa, etc. As a parallel to our passage, cf. esp. IX.88.3 …
draviṇodā́iva tmán. I'm inclined to think that utá is in fact empty here (though
perhaps orig. adapted from places where it made sense) and Klein's piecemeal
attempts to make sense of the various passages misplaced. Here the utá was perhaps
slotted in because iva was inappropriate. One can also keep in mind that -a tmánrecalls (and replicates metrically) ātmán-. Re’s characterization of utá tmán as “type
de clausule inert” seems close to my “empty.”

### 43.10  
The instr. pl.s nā́mabhiḥ and rūpébhiḥ identically positioned in pādas a and
b seem both to refer to individuated Maruts and also to make reference to the concept
later to be called nāmarūpa ‘name and form’ referring to the pairing of words and
things differentiating the separate entities of creation. This unusual distinguishing of
individual Maruts is then countered by the insistent repetition of víśve ‘all’ referring
to them as an undifferentiated class in pāda d. In that pāda I take the first víśve as voc.
pl. with marutaḥ (accented because pāda-initial) and the 2nd as a nom. with the verb,
but this grammatical separation may not be nec. if the two víśve-s are there to match
‘names’ and ‘forms’ respectively. Viśve Marutaḥ also semi-equates them with the
Viśve Devāḥ.

### 43.13  
In d tridhā́tu-śṛṅga- ‘having tripartite horns’ may refer to the three hearths,
though see the tripartite cows (tridhā́tavaḥ … gā́vaḥ), probably of Agni, in nearby
V.47.4.

### 43.14  
On rāspirá- see comm. ad I.122.4.
66

### 43.15  
Both Re and WG take pāda a as a separate nominal clause. This is certainly
possible, and an alternative tr. of the hemistich could be “to you, the lofty one, there
(belongs) lofty vigor, Agni. The … (priestly) pairs attend upon (you).”
V.44 All Gods
On the manifold difficulties of this hymn and a possible framework in which
to interpret them (as a hymn simultaneously applicable to Agni and Soma), see publ.
intro.

### 44.1  
Save for the fronted pronoun tám, this hymn opens with a remarkable series
of universalizing adverbs, identically formed with -(á-)thā suffix and linking the
current ritual situation (the final one in the series, imáthā ‘in this way here’, a hapax)
to that of every time and place: pratnáthā pūrváthā viśváthā. This may give us a
foretaste of the poet’s laying bare the underlying identity of the two central ritual
substances, fire and soma, and of the service accorded them in the sacrifice.
The poet then, in my opinion, produces a red herring: most of the descriptors
found in this vs. could apply to Indra -- esp. āśúṃ jáyantam; cf. āśúṃ jétāram of
Indra in VIII.99.7. And most interpreters fall into this trap: as Ge says in his n. 1, “all
commentators” identify tám as Indra -- incl. Ge himself, Re, and Old (WG forego
referents). However, both Agni and Soma receive these or similar descriptors
elsewhere. Agni and Soma are both located on the ritual grass (Agni: III.14.2, etc.;
Soma: I.16.6, etc.); both are called svarvíd- (more often than Indra; Agni: III.3.5, 10,
etc.; Soma: VIII.48.15, etc.), jyéṣṭha- (Agni: I.127.2, etc.; Soma: IX.66.16, etc.), and
āśú- (Agni: IV.7.4, etc.; Soma: IX.56.1, etc.). Soma is qualified as jáyant- (I.91.21,
etc.), and though Agni is not modified by this participle, he is the subject of verbal
forms of √ji (e.g., VI.4.4). All of these are, of course, fairly generic
characterizations; the point here is that nothing requires us to leap to the conclusion
that Indra is the referent.
Another way to approach the question of the referent of tám is to consider
what referent is appropriate as an obj. to dohase ‘you will milk’ -- which first may
require us to identify the subj. of this 2nd sg. verb (by most lights: Re takes it as a
sigmatic 1st sg., which seems unnec. and doesn’t fit the semantic profile of -se 1st
singulars). With Sāy. and Ge., I take it as the self-address of the poet, who will
perform his milking task ‘with song’ (girā́). The middle of √duh generally takes milk
(either real or metaphorical) as its object, and both Agni and Soma can be conceived
of as milk products -- the churning of the fire sticks and the pressing of the soma
plant both involve physical actions not unlike milking and what is produced is a fluid
or something (fire) that behaves rather like one. Indra is not entirely excluded,
however; he could be configured as a cow, “milked” with a praise hymn for him to
produce goods. However, as I just said, the milk itself, rather than the cow, is the
typical obj. of medial √duh, and so the substances fire and/or soma are more likely
referents.
Let us now turn to pāda d. This also contains a 2nd sg. med. present, várdhase,
in a relative clause whose rel. prn., fem. loc. pl. yā́su, has no possible referent in the
67
rest of the vs. Before turning to that problem, I will first say that I do not consider the
2nd sg. subj. of várdhase to be the same as that of dohase. Instead I think we have
switched to the unidentified god/ritual substance referred to by the acc. sg. in the rest
of the vs. Although this introduces an interpretational complication, I would point out
that in the next vs. (2cd), the god/substance definitely appears in the 2nd person, and
note also 8b, which contain a similarly structured rel. cl. … yā́su nā́ma te#, where the
2nd ps. refers to the god/substance. And, most important, the rel. cl. of 1d shows a
closer affinity to Agni and Soma than the generic epithets in the rest of the vs.
But first we must identify a possible referent or referents for the fem. yā́su.
The standard ploy, which I think is basically correct, is to supply a fem. pl. obj. to
jáyantam ‘winning’ -- generally ‘cows’ (Ge, Re, WG). Old suggests rather ‘waters’,
which Ge argues against (n. 1d). Certainly both ‘cows’ and ‘waters’ (both fem. pl.)
occur as objects to √ji -- and I see no reason to choose between the two; in fact the
reason for not specifying either one is to allow both to be understood, under the
neutralizing rel. prn. yā́su. Both Agni and Soma have connections to both cows and
waters: Agni is nourished by the streams of ghee (a milk product) poured into the fire,
and in a well-known myth he ran away and entered the waters. Soma is mixed with
cows’ milk, as is endlessly emphasized in the IXth Maṇḍala, and before soma is
pressed, it is soaked in water to swell the stalks. A third possible fem. pl. referent
connected with Agni is plants, in which he is invisible and inherent until kindled. Let
us consider some passages whose phraseology resembles our own. In II.13.1 ...
apáḥ ... ā́viśad yā́su várdhate Soma, unnamed, “entered the waters among which he
grows strong.” (Note the nearly identical rel. cl.) For Agni cf. I.95.5 ... vardhate ...
āsu “he grows strong among/in them” (here prob. = plants); I.141.5 ā́d ín mātṝ́r
ā́viśad yā́su ... ví vāvrdhe ̥ “Just after that he entered into his mothers, within whom ....
he grew widely” (again prob. plants; note that vāvṛdhe, as transmitted without accent,
is not part of the rel. cl. If the transmitted form is correct). The connection of a fem.
loc. pl. and a form of √vṛdh in these passages is striking, and it is Agni and Soma
who participate in this phraseology.
Thus, in my opinion, by the end of the vs. the poet has narrowed down the
possible referents and set up the rhetorical situation that will dominate the rest of the
hymn: an unidentified masc. sg. referent, who can be simultaneously Agni and Soma,
and a set of fem. pl. attendants, likewise unidentified, who are connected to the
masculine figure.

### 44.2  
The first hemistich of this vs. contains those same personnel, again without
overt identification, and with the further complication that there is no finite verb until
pāda c. Pāda a contains fem. plurals, at least partly in a relative clause (here nom. pl.
yā́ḥ, versus loc. yā́su in 1d); pāda b has an unidentified masc. sg. as subject. This is
the same configuration as 1d. Again I think the duo Agni / Soma is lurking under the
masc. sg., and the fem. pl. refers to phenomena associated with each. In addition I
take the gen. kakúbhām (a fem. cons. stem) in b as the referent of the fem. rel. prn.
yā́ḥ in a, rather than attempting to construe it one way or another with acodáte, as
most interpr. do.
68
Most take Agni as the referent of the masc. sg.; I think this is correct, but
doesn’t go far enough. Certainly Agni is an appropriate referent for virócamānaḥ
‘shining forth’, as he is elsewhere (e.g., I.95.2), and the lovely fem. pl. entities of
pāda a can easily be his flames (or, in my scenario, the tips [kakúbh-] of his flames).
Their collectivity can be identified as “the sun of the lower realm” (úparasya …
svàḥ). (I see no reason, with Ge [and, at least in tr., with Re] to take svàr here as gen.,
referring to Agni.) But the same phraeseology can also be applied to Soma. Although
nowhere near as commonly as Agni, Soma can also serve as subj. of √ruc (e.g.,
IX.11.1 dhā́rā sutásya rocate), and the streams of soma are often compared to the
rays of the sun (usually with masc. raśmí-, but cf. fem. tvíṣīḥ … sū́ryasya “the
glitterings of the sun” IX.71.9). Moreover, pāda c, whose subj. is most likely the
same as that in b, is almost identical to IX.73.8a ṛtásya gopā́ná dábhāya sukrátuḥ of
Soma, which strongly invites a Soma identification here.
Another problem is acodáte in b. This form looks like a dat. sg. to a negated
participle, but the accent is wrong (expect *ácodate), a discrepancy that leads Lowe
(Participles in RV, 274 n. 81) to reject this interpr., in favor of a t-stem acodát-. I’m
not at all sure that in this hymn one can make arguments of the type “can’t be X
because of some grammatical feature that usually holds,” and in any case Lowe does
not seem to suggest a different case/no. interpr. or different semantics. For further
disc. of the accent see AiG II.1.216 and Old ad loc. Because I construe kakúbhām
elsewhere, I supply rā́dhaḥ ‘largesse’ as the obj. of this apparent part., since rā́dhasis frequently the obj. of √cud. The idea would be that the ritual fire and ritual soma
shine for the generous and stingy alike. However, the supplied obj. may not be nec.,
and the sense would be something like “for the unrousing / unstirring one.”
In d I borrow hitáḥ from 3d (see also dhā́yi in 8c), producing “was
(set/placed) in truth,” but the pāda can certainly be interpr. simply with the pf. āsa
“was in truth.” I take “your name” (nā́ma te) to refer to both Agni and Soma.

### 44.3  
Some of the challenges of this vs can be approached by noting the series of
phonetic plays it contains: sacate sác ca dhā́tu ca / dhā́tu ca, áriṣṭagātuḥ / sá hótā
sahobháriḥ / sahobháriḥ … barhír.
Let us begin with the first. The curious double ca phrase sác ca dhā́tu ca is
difficult to render on its own. On the surface it appears to form part of a conjoined
NP with the subj. havíḥ ‘oblation’, but its ill-assorted nature comes out in tr. like
Ge’s “die Opferspende und das Seiende und das Element (?).” Moreover, though
dhā́tu- does not otherwise occur uncompounded in the RV, after the RV it is masc.,
while this form must be neut, which would be anomalous if it is a noun here. Ge
suggests (n. 3a) emending to the bahuvrīhi saptádhātu ‘having 7 parts’ (RV 3x),
though this is not reflected in his tr. As a bv the neut. gender would be proper, as a
modifier of havís-. Re suggests rather that sác ca dhā́tu “resolves” an old cmpd.
*sad-dhā́tu, tr. “et (sa) foundation est réelle.” I am in accord with his rendering but
analyze the underlying form differently: I take sác ca as a play on MIA sacca-, the
Middle Indic product of satyá-. (That Middle Indic phonological developments are
already to be found even in the RV family books needs no further demonstration.)
69
The whole sequence gestures towards a bahuvrīhi *sacca-dhātu-, whose neut. gender
would be appropriate. Note that very similar satyá-dharman- (RV 5x) is found at

### 51.2  
[in this VD seq] and V.63.1, the only attestations in the family books. The
putative first member sacca here is then provided with an alternative Sanskritic
analysis, sác [i.e., sȧt] ca -- I’m not suggesting an emendation here, but a word play.
The second ca connects the underlying bahuvrīhi to the noun it modifies, havíḥ,
hence an underlying sequence havíḥ … *saccá-dhātu ca. I further suggest that this
word play is actualized in a different word in the first word of the pāda, átyam, which
rhymes with satyá- (save for accent).
As just noted, pāda b participates in a number of phonetic plays: -gātuḥ
echoes dhā́tu in pāda; sá hó(tā) anticipates immediately following saho(bháriḥ), and
-bháriḥ is a scrambling of barhír in the next pāda. This last is particularly worth
noting because -bhári- is a Vedic hapax (Whitney, Rts., lists it as RV.C., and its only
RV occurrence is here) of somewhat unusual formation (see AiG II.2.295). It is
clearly a contextually inspired nonce here and should be given no weight in
considering i-stem morphology.
The last lexical problem in the vs. is visrúhā in d, otherwise found only in
VI.7.6. Gr glosses ‘Strom’ and connects it with √sru ‘flow’, which is phonologically
impossible (where would the -h come from?). Ge tr. ‘Arm’, which is just a
contextually inspired rendering, as far as I can see. Re tr. ‘flamme’ (fld. by Kellens,
Noms rac. 82–83), though ad VI.7.6 (EVP XIII.127–28) he floats (only to reject) the
possibility that it is a variant of vīrúdh- (‘sprout, shoot, growth’) on the basis of the
similarity between VI.7.6 and II.35.8, which contains a form of vīrúdh-. This
suggestion fits with Sāy.’s gloss oṣadhi- ‘plant’ (for this passage; in VI.7.6 Sāy.
glosses the pl. visruhaḥ as nadyaś ca gaṅgādyāḥ “rivers, Gaṅgā, etc.’). The word has
received the most attention from Scar, first in his Root noun book (464–65) and then
in the n. to V.44.3 in WG (in which Scar is responsible for Maṇḍala V). In the
former Scar pronounces visrúh- “ganz unklar,” echoed by the somewhat less
pessimistic “unklar” in WG, where he tr. “Reisig und Zweigen” and suggests it’s
derived from *vi-sr-u- ‘sich weit erstreckend’, contaminated with -rúdh-, -rúh-, with
the result reminiscent of vīrúdh-. I also believe that the word is in the semantic realm
of plant growth and that it should be connected with √ru(d)h ‘grow’; this is esp. clear
in VI.7.6, which contains a verbal form of that root: vayā́iva ruruhuḥ saptá visrúhaḥ.
However, I do not think that √sru or √sṛ needs to be brought in, at least directly.
Instead I attribute the extraneous -s- to a sort of analogical backformation involving
the preverbs ví, ní, and nís, starting from the form vīrúdh- cited above. Although the
lengthening of the preverb ví in that form results from the initial laryngeal of the
etymon of √rudh (see EWA s.v. RODH), it appears synchronically to result from the
sandhi form of a byform *vis before r-, just as there is a nís beside ní (with different
meanings in that case of course). In particular note the form nīrohá- in a TS mantra
repeated 3x (III.5.2.5, IV.4.1.3, V.3.6.3 sam̐rohò ’si nīrohò ’si), which could be
derived either from ni+√ruh (cf. Keith’s tr. ‘descender’) with the same lengthening
as in vīrúdh- or from nis+ruh (so Viśva Bandhu). I therefore explain our visrúh- as a
learned (and/or playful) but false “restoration” of the putative *vis- underlying
70
vīrú(d)h-. It is here that √sru may have played a part, by facilitating a false
segmentation of vis-rúh- into vi-srúh- (on the basis of the phonological similarity of
the roots) and thus blocking the application of morpheme-boundary sandhi between
*-s and r-. I tr. ‘outgrowth’. On a separate but related note, I do not think we need to
emend the form to gen. pl. *visrúhāṃ, an idea that goes back to Sāy., tempted Old
inter alia, and is accepted by Scar in WG.
Having dealt with the details of this vs. piecemeal, we should now consider
whether it too can be applied to both Agni and Soma, and the answer is yes. átya- is
regularly used of both in passages too numerous to cite. Though Hotar is an esp.
characteristic role of Agni’s, Soma is also compared to a Hotar sometimes (IX.92.2,
6, etc.). Both are called both vṛ́ṣan- and śíśu-. We have already noted their
positioning on the barhis ad 1b. Both are called yúvan-. The ‘outgrowth’ can be the
flames of Agni and the traces of the spreading of the soma juice on the filter, often
depicted on IX. However, it does seem that Soma is never qualified as ájara-
‘unaging’ -- a minor lack. The vs. situates both substances on the ritual ground at the
moment of the offering.

### 44.4  
My interpr. of both the syntax and the referents of this vs. generally differs
from those of others. I will not undertake a detailed disc. of these differences.
However, I will note that Ge (n. 4) suggests that both Agni and Soma may be the
topic of the vs., in agreement with my general thesis.
In my opinion, a new element enters the ritual scene here, namely ritual
speech, referred to by the unidentified eté of pāda a. Given the masc. pl. pronoun, the
exact referent must be masc. -- perhaps stómāḥ ‘praises’ (cf. nearby V.42.15 eṣá
stómaḥ …, 16 praíṣá stómaḥ in the same All God cycle, reminscent of our prá va eté
…). These praises are conceived of as horses, which are easy to yoke (a: suyújaḥ)
and directed by easily controlled reins (c: suyántubhiḥ … abhī́śubhiḥ). As Ge points
out (n. 4c with reff.), the reins of priests are their speeches, an association that makes
the identification of ‘praises’ as the subject of pāda a all the more likely. The 2nd ps.
enclitic vaḥ refers in my view to the priests who are launching/driving the praisehorses. The prá … yā̐man “forth on the course/journey” invites a verb of motion to
be supplied, perhaps a form of √sṛ, suggested by prasársrāṇaḥ beginning the 2nd
hemistich of the previous vs. (3c).
The other question confronting us in pāda a is the identity of the datival inf.
iṣṭáye, which is of course multiply ambiguous: it could belong to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’,
√iṣ ‘send’, or √yaj ‘sacrifice’ (on this issue, see Old, ZDMG 62: 473-78 = KlSch
282-87). With Old, I take it to the first, but I also think it takes an acc. goal/obj., and
that that acc. is the fem. acc. phrase in b, nī́cīḥ … yamyà ṛtāvṛ́dhaḥ. Old also takes
this phrase as acc., though he supplies a different verb to govern it; the other interpr.
take the phrase as nom. and the subject of an independent nominal clause. With Ge (n.
4b) I take the downward-facing twinned sisters to be both the streams of ghee offered
into the ritual fire and the streams of water with which soma is rinsed (the milk
streams with which soma is mixed could also be in play). The praises’ seeking of
these streams expresses the union of verbal and physical activity in the sacrifice, with
71
the hymns accompanying the pouring of the liquid into/onto the ritual substance. The
dat. prn. amúṣmai I take as the goal of this pouring: the fire and the soma
respectively. The use of the comparatively rare distal deictic asaú is noteworthy,
since this stem generally refers to the upward or heavenly world or items located
there, esp. the sun (for the sun, cf., e.g., I.105.3, 191.9, VIII.12.30). Yet here the
streams are going ‘downward’ towards it. This paradox can be resolved by recalling
the phrase in 2a úparasya … svàḥ “the sun of the lower realm,” which made
reference to well-known conceptions of Agni and of Soma. Agni is frequently
considered the earthly counterpart of the heavenly sun, since both blaze brightly and
they also make their appearance at the same time (dawn) of the ritual day. Soma,
likewise, is often compared to or identified with the sun because of its bright gleam,
and there are both a heavenly Soma and his earthly counterpart depicted in the IXth
Maṇḍala. Here, in my opinion, amúṣmai makes implicit reference to the heavenly
Sun [=Fire] and heavenly Soma, while depicting the ritual activity centered on their
earthly embodiments, thus erasing the distance between heaven and earth and the
distinction between the entities found therein.
Pāda d, which I take as a separate clause, brings its own set of problems, not
least with the always enigmatic word krívi- (on which see also comm. ad I.30.1).
First, however, note the phonological echo of b amúṣmai / d muṣāyati, though this
does not help with the interpr. As for krívi-, I take it here as a conflation of two
putative stems. On the one hand, at least once (I.30.1) krívi- seems to refer to a race
horse (there compared with Indra). Since the intertwined Agni/Soma figure in this
hymn was just referred to as a steed (átya-) in 3a, krívi- here seems to be picking up
that joint referent. Ge [n. 4d] makes the same identification of átya- with krívi-, and
he also suggests that the pāda expresses the entry of the butter offerings into the fire
and/or the streams of water in the soma. I think he is correct as far as he goes, but I
think there is a third referent, the poet who is responsible for the praises I suggest are
the subject of pāda a. In this case krívi- can be seen as a hyper-Sanskritization of
kaví- (as if from *kṛvi-) with the ri that interchanges with ṛ in words like kṛ́mi-/krími-
‘worm’ (cf. AiG I.33 and Nachtr. 19, 21), aided of course by the krívi- already
referring to Agni/Soma. See also disc. ad 9c below.
What does it mean that this krívi- “steals (their) names”? Here Old’s
suggestion is surely correct for the Agni/Soma krívi- (for Old, only Soma): that the
streams (of ghee/water) lose their identities when they merge into Agni/Soma, and
the result is simply called fire/soma. As for the poet whom I consider the third
referent of krívi-, he may “steal their names” by using them in his poetry, or perhaps
by referring to them but not naming them, as he does in this vs. (and throughout the
hymn).

### 44.5  
As usual in this hymn, this vs. swarms with difficulties (Re calls it “une suite
de cruces”), but it continues to depict a relation between a singular masc. entity and a
group of feminines. I see this as the thread that leads us through the labyrinth of this
hymn. Note also that, as in vs. 3, there are phonetic figures: ab: saṃjárbhurāṇas
tárubhiḥ ... susváruḥ / sutegṛ́bham ... cittágarbhāsu (with mirror-image su).
72
The instr. tárubhiḥ in pāda a is a hapax, obviously built to a stem táru-. Both
Ge and Re both take it as ‘tree’, which is tempting given the following vayākín-
‘twiggy’. But II.39.3 járbhurāṇā tárobhiḥ, with the instr. pl. to the better-attested sstem built to √tṝ ‘endure, etc.’, suggests that táru- is more likely connected to that
root (see on this point EWA I.630). However, I confess that my tr. “quivering with
your powers of endurance” conveys little sense. I think the instr. here may do little
more than reinforce the intensive (that is, frequentative) value of the participle: the
subject keeps quivering with continued force (“staying power”).
As usual, I think the subj. of the participle saṃjárbhurāṇaḥ is simultaneously
Agni and Soma. Agni is elsewhere subject of this intensive (e.g., II.10.5), clearly
with reference to his flickering flames. The semantic connection with Soma is not as
strong, and Soma is nowhere the subject of this verb, but the scintillating, undulating
waves of soma are a common trope in Maṇḍala IX.
Both these substances are aiming towards the vayākín-. The most sensible
interpr. of that word is as an -ín-possessive built to an unattested diminutive *vayāká-
‘little branch, twig’ to vayā́- ‘branch’, hence ‘twiggy’ (see Scar’s n. in WG, referring
to his treatment in Rt Noun Cmpds). For Agni this twiggy substance can be
brushwood or kindling; the association with Soma is again less straightforward, but it
can either refer to the twigs of the soma plant itself or, more likely in my opinion,
refer metaphorically to the tufts of wool on the sheep’s fleece filter that catch the
impurities in the pressed soma juice. This suggestion is supported by the cmpd
modifying it, sute-gŕbh- ‘grasping at the pressing’. If the vayākín- is the fleece filter,
it most definitely ‘grasps’ the solids that accidentally end up in the pressed juice. For
Agni, ‘grasping at the pressing’ is less clear, but the firewood may seem to hold onto
the fire burning in it, and the ritual fire burns during the soma pressing.
The rest of the first hemistich consists of cittágarbhāsu susváruḥ. The
standard interpr. all analyze the latter word as containing sváru- ‘(sacrificial) post’
(though note that Gr does not provide a gloss for it). Although this analysis works
formally, it does not fit easily into the vs. semantically. I am inclined instead to take
it as containing a form of √svar ‘sound’; cf. svará- (2x, unfortunately with different
accent), svarí-, etc. Ge (n. 5b) in fact suggests an alternate tr. ‘schön tönend’
(vaguely following Sāy.). -sváru- would show the same conversion to a u-stem as the
hapax táru- in pāda a and perhaps follows that word in accent as well. The noisemaking capacities of both Agnia and Soma are well known.
On cittágarbha- ‘visibly pregnant’ see Ge’s n. 5b and the TB passage cited
there. These females would be, in the Agni realm, the pieces of firewood, which are
frequently depicted as having an embryonic Agni inside; for Soma most likely the
waters in which the soma plant is soaked, swelling him as their embryo, or perhaps
the cows whose milk is mixed with him.
I follow Old (ZDMG 62 [=KlSch 284 n.1]) in taking dhāravākéṣu as referring
to a particular ritual moment, the litanies or recitations when the streams of the
oblation are offered, but the equational metaphorical interpr. “recitations (like)
streams” found in most tr. is also possible.
73
The voc. ṛju-gātha ‘whose song is straight’ is somewhat puzzling. I think it is
best illuminated by II.26.1 rj̥úr íc cháṃsaḥ, a phrase I take as a decomposed
bahuvrīhi (see comm. ad loc.) meaning ‘whose laud is straight on target’. I would
now slightly alter the tr. here to ‘whose song is straight on target’ to make the voc. a
little less opaque.
The last pāda is surprisingly straightforward, at least for this hymn. The
subject of várdhasva is once again Agni/Soma, who derive their strength from their
wives (pátnī), the plants/firewood and waters/cows’ milk respectively.

### 44.6  
As I pointed out in the publ. intro., the first pāda is both a cruel joke --
insisting on the utter transparency of the subject of the hymn -- and a claim on the
poet’s part that his verbal formulations about the subject are in complete conformity
with the underlying reality, however obscure they may at first seem.
My interpr. of the rest of this vs. differs significantly in both syntax and
semantics from the standard ones, which I will not treat in detail. I take pāda b as
having an unexpressed masc. sg. obj., with cd further characterizing that obj. The
object is simultaneously Agni and Soma, and it is in this pāda that the identification
of the two is most clearly expressed in the hymn (until the last 2 vss.). The
unidentified subj. ‘they’ -- most likely the poets and/or priests -- put together / unite
the one (of Agni and Soma) with the other, his counterpart or ‘shadow’ (chāyā́-). As
the two central deified ritual elements, they are mirror images of each other. The
union takes place in the waters (apsú) for several reasons. Both Soma and Agni have
significant presence in the waters -- Soma of course through the ritual use of waters
both to swell the dessicated soma plant and to rinse it, Agni in two mythological
guises, both as Apāṃ Napāt and as the runaway ritual fire that hid in the waters.
Moreover, it is also the case that water reflects and was indeed probably the only
reflective material readily at hand in this period, so the uniting of one substance and
its conceptual equivalent as visual reflections of each other would most naturally take
place in water.
The clearest part of pāda c is the cmpd. uru-ṣā́m ‘winning wideness’, which I
take as a modifier of the unexpressed masc. sg. obj. of b (that is, Agni/Soma). (Since
the 2nd member is the rt. noun sā́-, the cmpd can be masc.) I take the other
accusatives in cd, mahī́m, urú jráyaḥ, and sáhaḥ with its modifiers, as objects of an
underlying form of √sani
/sā, extracted from uru-ṣā́-. For a similar play between a
root noun cmpd with 1st member obj. and an independent acc. obj., see VIII.1.2 and
comm. thereon. Although this syntactic interpr. may seem over-tricky (to others, not
to me), it saves us from positing an extraneous creation myth as Ge and Re do. In my
interpr. the various objects won are well within the powers of Agni and Soma to
deliver to us. Note that Agni is once called urujráyas- (V.8.6, in this maṇḍala) and
both Agni (III.5.8, V.24.3 [this maṇḍ.], X.176.4, etc.) and Soma (I.91.15) can be subj.
of the verb uruṣyá- ‘make wideness’.

### 44.7  
Again my interpr. differs markedly from those of others. Again I think the
unexpressed subj. of the whole vs. is Agni/Soma, not the sun (sū́ryaḥ) with most
74
others. The nom. sū́ryaḥ is instead used to characterize both, since both Agni and
Soma can be identified with the sun; that is, each is (equivalent to) the sun in his own
way. Cf. “the sun of the lower realm” in 2a with reference to phenomena related to
both Agni and Soma.
In pāda a I take the two adj. ágruḥ ‘unmarried’ and jánivān ‘possessing
wife/wives’ as expressing two stages in the development of Agni/Soma, rather than
as paradoxically simultaneous with Ge and Re (WG interpr. resembles mine). The
position of vaí supports an interpr. with two clauses. In the first stage Agni/Soma
pursues females/wives; cf. VII.96.4 janīyánto nv ágravaḥ “bachelors in search of
wives.” Again we have unidentified (and here unexpressed) plural females -- in
Agni’s case I surmise they are the plants that supply firewood and/or the streams of
ghee poured in the fire; in Soma’s the cows, with whose milk he is mixed, or even
the waters that swell him. Once Agni and Soma have “married” these females and
are jánivān ‘possessed of wives’, each can use the extra power acquired from these
females to best his rivals. In this second clause I supply a second verb, perhaps a
form of √tṝ, because √vī does not otherwise occur with áti, whereas tuturyāma+áti is
found in the next hymn (V.45.11).
In cd I take the verb vanavat in two senses, negative and positive, both well
represented for this stem. With the obj. ghraṃsám ‘heat’, the verb has the sense ‘win’
= ‘vanquish’, as in nearby V.29.9 ávanor ha śúṣṇam “you combatted / vanquished
Śuṣṇa”; with the obj. śárma ‘shelter’, ‘win’ = ‘gain’. I take rákṣantam as a qualifier
of śárma (more or less; see below), with the participle itself taking the obj. gáyam
(“shelter … protecting our patrimony”). In taking gáyam as obj. of rákṣantam I am
flg. Old, who cites as parallel I.74.2 árakṣad dāśúṣe gáyam, which seems pretty
conclusive to me. There are also two passages (VI.71.3/X.66.3) in which gáyam is
the object of the semantically parallel verb pári √pā ‘protect all round’ (e.g.,
X.66.3 ... pári pāhi no gáyam); note pári immed. flg. rákṣantam here. By contrast,
Ge, Re, WG all take gáyam as an immed. object of vanavat, modified by rákṣantam,
which itself governs ghraṃsám (cf., e.g., Re “Qu’il nous assure une demeure
protégeant de toutes parts de (son) ardeur …”). This interpr. not only ignores the
√rakṣ + gáyam parallel, but also requires a significant attenuation of the meaning of
√van (see Re’s n. on the pāda), and I also don’t know of parallel uses of √rakṣ
meaning ‘guard against / from’. Against this we must balance one clear defect in my
interpr., that śárman- is neut. and the part. rákṣantam is masc. To account for the
gender discrepancy I would suggest that the immediate referent of rákṣantam is not
śárma, but a different, underlying, masc. noun to which śárma is an appositive --
perhaps kṣáyam ‘peaceful dwelling’, as in I.133.7 vanóti … kṣáyam. Or it might be
enough to invoke the distance between rákṣantam and śárma in the hemistich, which
might account for the gender mismatch. (I prefer the former, grammatically
blameless, possibility. In this case the tr. might be slightly changed to “will win
(peaceful dwelling) as shelter for us, protecting (our) patrimony on all sides.”)

### 44.8  
Old’s stark statement about this vs., “Ich wage keine Erklärung,” is
somewhat lowering to the spirit. Nonetheless, I think some sense can be wrung from
75
it. As I said in the publ. intro., I think a new figure enters the scene at this, the
midpoint of the hymn -- namely the poet, learning and perfecting his craft -- and in
my opinion he is the subject of the vs., though Agni and Soma are still very much
present.
By my interpr. the unnamed would-be poet “pursues/proceeds
towards/practices” (carati) “the older (/superior) sonority of the seers” (jyā́yāṃsam
… ṛṣisvarám), that is, he imitates and aspires to the sound of the legendary poet-seers
who preceded him. He does so by means of asyá yatúnasya ketúnā “by the beacon of
this yatúna.” Unfortunately yatúna- is a hapax, and there is no agreement on its
meaning or etym. (see, e.g., EWA s.v.). However, we can approach the sense of this
phrase from several angles. The most promising of these, in my opinion, is the
recognition that the phrase yajñásya ketú- “beacon of the sacrifice” is a very common
expression in the RV (I.96.16, I.113.19, etc. etc., incl. in this maṇḍala V.11.1).
Moreover, both Agni and Soma are identified as yajñásya ketú-; Agni: the three
passages just cited, plus I.1127.6, III.11.3, etc.; Soma: IX.86.7. I take yatúna- as a
nonce substitute for yajñá-, with vaguely similar phonology, built to √yat ‘arrange’.
(This is the root affiliation suggested by most [cf., e.g., AiG II.2.485].) Unfortunately
this root does not seem to be generally used in ritual context, but a generalized
abstract ‘arrangement’ can stand in for the more specific ‘sacrifice’. This hapax
yatúna- echoes immed. following instr. ketúnā (though obviously the morphology is
different) and also reminds us of the two unexpected -u-stems in 5: táru- and -sváru-.
Putting all this together, I would claim that the poet is pursuing the model of the
previous poets by means of the beacon of the sacrifice (/‘arrangement’), and that this
beacon is actually the usual amalgam of Agni and Soma, who, as we just saw, can be
so called. In other words, the shimmering leaders of the sacrifice, the two ritual
substances fire and soma, provide the (en)light(enment) as the poet follows the
progress of the sacrifice as it leads him to his poetic goal.
Unlike most interpr. I take the loc. rel. cl. ending b (yā́su nā́ma te) as parallel
to the one beginning c (yā́dṛ́śmin dhā́yi), also with a loc. expression. Both remind us
of 2d … ṛtá āsa nā́ma te; besides the identical final nā́ma te, note the echo between
yā́su and āsa. The fem. loc. yā́su refers to the now familiar mix of fem. plurals --
waters, cows [=milk], streams of ghee -- with the possible addition of fem. words for
mental and verbal products: insights, hymns, etc. In any case the poet finds the
jyā́yāṃsam … ṛṣisvarám he is looking for at the place where the names of Agni and
Soma have been set -- that is, at the heart of the sacrifice. I take the referent of tám to
be ṛṣisvára- of b. To find it he needs not only the beacon provided by Agni/Soma but
also his own industry (apasyā́-).
The final pāda reiterates that the poet must rely on himself: he must make the
journey to poetic mastery by himself, and if he does, he will get it (that is, the poetry)
right. The phrasal verb áraṃ karat of course reminds us of alaṃkāra, the later
technical term for poetic ornament. Cf. already in the RV VII.29.3 kā́te asty
áraṃkrti̥ ḥ sūktaíḥ for a connection between hymns and proper preparation. (Contrary
to the standard tr., I do not think that yá u svayáṃ váhate has anything to do with
marriage and bringing the bride home.)

### 44.9  
In my interpr., the first half of this vs. depicts the offering of ritual oblations,
while the second one connects the poet, whom we first met in the previous vs., with
this ritual activity.
The fem. phrase āsām … agrimā́“the foremost (fem.) of these (fem.)” must
refer yet again to the females we’ve met before: waters, cows, streams of ghee, as
was just noted above. In pāda a the first such female goes down into the ocean
(samudrám); this could be the ocean of soma as often or the undulating flames of the
ritual fire (see I.71.7 where the offerings entering the fire are compared to streams
entering a samudrá-). In pāda b the word sávana- ‘pressing’ limits the reference to
soma, but throughout the hymn we have seen phraseology that is more appropriate to
one of the gods than to the other (generally, in fact, in favor of Agni). That b is a
clear soma pāda does not, in my opinion, invalidate the general interpr. of the hymn
as applicable simultaneously to the two gods. It is also worth noting in passing that
sávana-, which occurs approx. 100x in the RV, is found only once in the IXth
Maṇḍala.
Why it is necessary to state that the pressing is not harmed when the female
enters it is not clear. Perhaps it is meant as understatement: it is not only not harmed,
but is positively benefitted. Or perhaps there is a whiff of the fear of contamination
caused by females.
Pāda c brings us another impenetrable hapax, kravaṇá-. The first thing to
notice, perhaps, is that it rhymes with sávana- (though it does not match it in accent).
As with the hapax yatúna- in 8a beside ketúnā, one of the contributors to the
formation of the hapax may be phonological echo. There is, as usual, no consensus
on the etym. or sense of the word; Ge and Re (inter alia) take it as a PN -- a
convenient strategy, but in a hymn that contains no other PNs (at least in my opinion)
an unlikely solution. WG take it as ‘Opferschlächter’, related to kravís-, a suggestion
mentioned but not endorsed by Old (see also EWA s.v.). My own tentative
suggestion has no better support. I consider it, like krívi- in 4d, to be another
phonologically scrambled encoding of the word kaví-, here perhaps crossed with a
form of √kṛ, hence my tr. ‘working poet’. (A putative participial -āṇá- might have
been remodeled under pressure from sávana- in b.) Although I will not attempt a
spirited defense of this despairing attempt, it does have certain points in its favor.
First, if kriví- in 4d and kravaṇá- here are both deformations of kaví-, which itself
appears in 7b, we have a little ring of references to the poet in the midsection of this
hymn. More important, reference to a poet in 9c fits well with the subordinate clause
in 9d. Just at the time when oblation is made and the soma is prepared (9ab), the poet
who is not intimidated (“his heart does not tremble”) finds the poetic expression
(matí-) that connects him to the purified ritual substances soma and fire. (Though
pūtá- almost always refers to soma and never to fire directly, other forms derived
from the root √pū, like pāvaká-, are standard qualifiers of Agni.) If I am correct that
vs. 8 depicts an apprentice or neophyte poet embarking on his journey to poetic
mastery, then 9cd shows him achieving his first success at a climactic moment in the
sacrifice, which provides inspiration to his undaunted heart.
77

### 44.10  
Ge and Re deal with the difficulties of this vs. by taking all (or almost all)
the genitives as PN, a solution going back to Sāy.: (Ge) Kṣatra, Manasa, Yajata,
Sadhri, and Avatsāra, to which Re adds Evāvada. (Note that the Anukr. ascribes this
hymn to one Avatsāra Kāśyapa, but this is, in my opinion, based on a later
misunderstanding of this vs.) Since all of these forms, on the one hand, either are, or
bear a strong resemblance to, real words in the language and, on the other, are not
used as names elsewhere, the Ge/Re PN strategy seems like an evasion of
responsibility. It is to the credit of WG that this makeshift is not resorted to; all these
forms are given full lexical weight. And the WG interpr. of ab is not too distant from
mine, in that they take the subject to be a/the poet, who has some connection to the
cítti- of the figures mentioned in the gen. (WG: “Denn er is es [ein Ṛṣi?] durch die
Einsichten dessen …”), though our treatments of the genitives differ.
My interpr. of the relation between sá and cíttibhiḥ calls upon the ‘bond’
(bándhanī) of 9d, where the poet found the thought that binds him to the ritual
substances soma and fire. I think 10ab elaborates on this notion, by ascribing the
insights to Soma and Agni themselves.
The second set of genitives, evāvadásya yajatásya sádhreḥ in pāda b, by my
interpr. refer to Agni and Soma simultaneously. Both Agni and Soma are elsewhere
described as yajatá- ‘worthy of the sacrifice’ (Agni, e.g., I.128.8; Soma, e.g.,
IX.86.14). Assuming that the hapax evāvadá- has the sense ‘speaking thus’ it
transparently presents, it can apply to both Agni and Soma because both substances
are often said to speak or sound: for Agni cf., e.g., VI.4.4, 13.6; for Soma cf. esp.
IX.113.4, 6. As for sádhreḥ, the obvious connection with sadhryàñc- ‘directed
towards the same goal’ is affirmed by Gr, AiG II.2.154, EWA s.v sadhrī́m, etc. It is
the morphology that is puzzling, made more complex by the fact that it should be
trisyllabic with a short penultimate, hence *sádhriyaḥ? (so approx. Gr). (HvN simply
pronounce the pāda as having 11 syllables, but since this would be a metrical
irregularity in a Jagatī hymn and since there is no independent stem *sádhri- to
which sádhreḥ would obviously belong, it seems better to perform the metrical
distraction.) I have no answer for the morphology or for the accent, but given the
morphological flexibility in the rest of this hymn, this is not surprising.) The “same
goal” that Agni/Soma are aiming at is the eloquence that the poet is also seeking to
harness.
I take this second set of genitives, referring to Agni/Soma, as dependent on,
not parallel to, the first pair of genitives, kṣatrásya manasásya. My “mental lordship”
refers to the mastery those two gods have of the poetry and the insights that produce
it. The adj. manasá- is a hapax, but it fits a common pattern of deriving suffixaccented thematic adjectives to s-stems; cf., e.g., vacasá- ‘eloquent’ to vácas-
‘speech’ and AiG II.2.136.
The second hemistich takes advantage of the double meaning of ráṇa- and its
derivatives (ráṇa- ‘joy / battle’, raṇvá- ‘delightful / battle-lusty’, etc.). I take the
referent of the pl. ráṇvabhiḥ to be poems (or perhaps the ‘insights’ cítti- of pāda a).
As warriors fighting alongside us they allow us to win the prize (spṛṇavāma … 
78
vā́jam), but as poems they are also delightful or joy-bringing. That winning the prize
requires wisdom, not just brute strength, is expressed by vidúṣā cid árdhyam “to be
brought to success only by the wise,” a signal that it is insights or their products,
poems, that are being deployed.
It remains to identify “the stealthy one” (avatsārá-), assuming as I do that it is
not a PN. As I just noted, not only do Ge and Re (but not WG) take it as a PN, but the
Anukramaṇī ascribes this hymn to Avatsāra Kāśyapa, who is also purported to be the
Soma hymns IX.53-60, a group of short Gāyatrī hymns with no obvious connection
to V.44. It seems obvious to connect the word with the lexeme áva √tsar and the root
√tsar ‘creep’ more generally. The root is poorly attested, and áva √tsar only occurs
once (I.71.5 in the notorious heavenly incest story). Agni is once the subject of √tsar
(I.145.4), and the occurrence of áva √tsar is found in an Agni hymn (though not with
Agni as subject). Soma is never subject of this verb, but its rarity makes this
unsurprising. Both Agni and Soma can be conceived of as creeping or stealthy
because of their slow and gradual movements -- Agni as the fire slowly catches in the
kindling, Soma as the juice spreads across the filter.

### 44.11  
If it is possible for this hymn to get more obscure, it does so in this vs.
(Note that Old simply gives up in vss. 11–13.) Nonetheless, I think a consistent
interpr. can be constructed and one that fits well with the increasing pace of the
depiction of the ritual in the last few vss. The theme that unifies the vs. is that of
ritual binding and unbinding -- conveyed by the words áditi-, which I take as the
abstract ‘unboundedness’ not the name of the goddess, kakṣyà- ‘girding’, and viṣā́na-
‘unharnessing’.
The first half of pāda a (śyená āsām áditiḥ) refers to the pre-ritual situation.
While Soma is still a falcon, swooping about in freedom before the sacrifice begins,
he is/represents freedom also for the classes of females we keep encountering: waters,
cows, hymns. Neither the waters nor the cows (=milk) have taken on their ritual roles,
and the words have not yet been pressed into service as ritual speech. (It’s important
to note that Soma himself is often called a śyená- in IX; the bird is not simply the
conveyor of the stolen soma.)
In the second half of pāda a (kakṣyò mádaḥ) Soma has been transformed into
the máda-, the exhilarating ritual drink, and that change in turn brings about the
girding of the female entities in question. They are hitched up in their various ritual
roles, and the sacrifice begins. This ritual commencement is both for the benefit of
and involves the active participation of the two gods, Soma and Agni. It is thus that I
interpret the genitives in pāda b (viśvávārasya yajatásya māyínaḥ (note the
recurrence of yajatásya from 10b), also referring, in my opinion, to Agni/Soma.
(Once again both Ge and Re take all three genitives as PNs; once again WG do not.)
In pāda c I take the priests as the subject of arthayanti ‘cause to seek as goal’.
They are now directing the ritual proceedings. The first object of arthayanti is
unexpressed, in my view: it is the female ritual elements, waters, milk, hymns. The
priests send them to their ritual tasks, the waters and the cows’ milk to soma, the
hymns to Soma and Agni. The two gods are here represented by the āmreḍita anyám-
79
anyam ‘the one, the other; one after the other’. So far in the hymn the two gods have
been fused into one, verbally speaking; here the āmreḍita is an intermediate step
towards separating them, a step that allows for the introduction of a third god, Indra,
in the next vs.
In pāda d the priests realize that with the mobilization of all the elements of
the ritual performance -- the soma, the ritual fire, the waters, milk, and hymns -- the
climax of the sacrifice has been reached. The unharnessing of these elements can
take place because all that remains is for the prepared soma to be drunk. This sets the
stage for the premier soma-drinker, Indra, to appear on the scene, which he does in
the next vs. The parallel forms viṣā́ṇam paripā́nam are both best taken as -ana-nouns
to -ā́-roots, although Gr identifies the first as a root participle. Cf. AiG II.2.193.

### 44.12  
As I just said, I think this vs. represents the epiphany of Indra, come to
drink the just-prepared soma. Although, in keeping with the practice of the hymn, he
is not named, the presence of a new actor in the hymn is strongly signaled by the
verb phrase in pāda a: ví dvíṣo vadhīt: Indra is almost always the subject of verb
forms to the root √vadh. Although the subject of pāda a is also called yajatá-, a word
used in the two preceding vss. (10b, 11b) of Agni/Soma (in my opinion), ‘worthy of
the sacrifice’ is a generic descriptor of gods, is used elsewhere of Indra (e.g.,
II.14.10), and can be so applied here. And ‘always giving’ (sadāpṛṇa, though a hapax,
is a good description of Indra -- or at least as we wish him to be.
In b Ge and Re take the three words bāhuvṛktáḥ śrutavít táryaḥ as PNs yet
again. I think they are all further qualifications of Indra. The first depicts the physical
actions of the priest, who by the ritual activities performed by their arms (bāhú-),
“twist” Indra to the ritual ground. (For the use of √vṛj to refer to bringing a god to
one’s ritual, see VIII.76.1.) There is also a sly echo of the common bahuvrīhi vṛktábarhis- ‘having twisted ritual grass’, a ritual action that would indeed by performed
by the priests’ arms. Indra is also easily qualified as śruta-víd- ‘finding [/knowing]
what is heard (=praise)’. The third term táryaḥ, a hapax, is more difficult. It may
simply be a -ya- deriv. to √tṝ (see WG “der Überwinder [?]”), though this isn’t
terribly satisfying morphologically. I tentatively take it as a primary comparative to
√tṝ, with the short suffixal form -yas- rather than -īyas- (tárīyas- 1x in nearby
V.41.12); cf. návyas- / návīyas-. In that case it would be an adverbially used neut.
(‘surpassingly’) and the predicate is the vaḥ sácā “(is in) partnership with you.” For
another predicated pāda-final ENC + sácā see VIII.92.29 ádhā cid indra me sácā
“And so, Indra, (you are) in partnership with me.”
The second hemistich begins with an explicitly marked dual ubhā́… várā,
separated by a nom. sg. sá. Here we have the triad that has just, in this vs.,
interrupted the fused identification of Agni and Soma. With Indra represented by sá,
the two other gods are for the first time in the hymn separated into a grammatical
pair (though see the forerunner anyám-anyam in 11c), rather than sharing
grammatically singular descriptors applicable to each. (For ubhā́… várā referring to
animate beings, see X.85.9, where the two are the Aśvins -- though in that case várameans ‘wooer’.) Indra “comes in response” (práty eti) to these two, i.e., to the ritual
80
fire where offerings will be made to him and to his own ritual drink. The second verb
bhā́ti ‘is radiant’ is not a typical Indraic verb, but pāda d with its reference to the
gaṇá- ‘troop, throng’ easily brings the rhetoric back to Indra and his close ties with
the Maruts, so often identified as a gaṇá-. The lexeme prá √yā, found here in
suprayā́van- ‘driving forth easily’, is also particularly associated with the Maruts; cf.
III.29.15 marútām iva prayā́ḥ, and verbal instantiations like I.37.14 prá yāta, also
I.165.13, V.53.12, 58.6. I've supplied 'chariots' because rátha- several times used in a
simile with pra √yā (IV.19.5, VII.74.6, IX.69.9).

### 44.13  
As indicated in the publ. intro., in this last real vs. of the hymn I think the
poet, who has been learning his trade, is extravagantly celebrated as the figure on
whom the whole sacrifice depends and the representative of various sacrificial
personnel and equipment. By contrast, Ge and Re once again opt for a PN, this time
Sutambhara whom they consider to be the patron of the sacrifice. I take sutambharáas the transparent cmpd it appears to be, conforming to the model of other -bharátatpuruṣas (cf., with acc. 1st member, puṣṭim-bhará-, vājam-bhará-, etc.) For the
underlying syntagm see VIII.66.7 sutám bhara, where the subject is a priest or
similar figure (also IX.6.6 sutám bhárāya). I construe the gen. yájamānasya with the
1st member sutam, though it could also be a gen. of benefit (‘for the sacrificer’) and
loosely construed with the whole cmpd. I do not think it is dependent on sátpatiḥ,
pace Ge, Re, and WG.
The 2nd pāda identifies the poet with the source (the cow’s udder, ū́dhaḥ) and
distributor (the ladle or scoop, udáñcanaḥ) of all poetic visions (víśvāsām … dhiyā́m),
which are here equated with ghee oblations. (For ud √añc meaning ‘turn / scoop up’,
see V.83.8, AV X.29.8, etc.; in AB and ŚB udañcana- is a 'dipping vessel'.) The
conflation of poems with liquid offerings we have already met before in this hymn,
though it is only here that the dhī́- is explicitly referred to.
In c the Pp and the standard interpr. take dhenū́as the sandhi form of nom. sg.
dhenús before r-. This is of course perfectly possible; however, I take the form as
given, as the dual nom./acc. of the same stem. By this interpr. the poet who was the
subj. of ab remains the subj. here, with the -bhará- of the cmpd in pāda a extracted
and converted into a finite injunctive bhárat. Who are the two milk-cows he bears? It
is of course tempting to identify them as Agni and Soma, the pair that has been
hiding in this hymn all along. And in part I think that is the correct answer: the poet,
whose verbal formulations are the foundation of the sacrifice, thereby supports the
two ritual substances (/gods) that provide the material realization of the sacrifice.
Agni and Soma would be called dhenū́because of the benefits they provide through
sacrifice. But dual dhenū́is several times used of Heaven and Earth (of the other four
occurrences, at last III.6.4, IV.23.10), so that the poet through his sacrificial labors
may be supporting the whole cosmos. Moreover, the milk of Heaven and Earth has a
special connection with poetry. Cf. the curious passage I.22.14 táyor íd ghrtávat páy ̥ o,
víprā rihanti dhītíbhiḥ “The inspired poets lick the ghee-filled milk of this very pair
[=Heaven and Earth; see vs. 13] with their poetic insights,” though the meaning of
this vs. is obscure (see comm. ad loc.).
81
In any case their milk is brought to perfection (śiśriye) in the rest of the pāda.
Contra Narten (1987: 281) and Kümmel (p. 528), who follows her, in the publ. tr. I
take this med. pf. as passive, contrasting with the act. trans. aśiśrayuḥ (2x). However,
it is possible that the verb is transitive, as they take it, and the poet remains as subj.:
“he brings/has brought their milk to perfection.” This might be preferable, in that it
emphasizes the poet’s control over the sacrifice and its cosmic resonances.
The final pāda of the vs., and thus of the hymn, brings us back, abruptly and
somewhat reductively, to the poet’s training: “pay attention to your teacher; don’t
nod off or go wool-gathering.” The lexemes ánu √brū and ádhi √i belong to
pedagogical vocabulary (for the latter see Apālā VIII.91.3 and comm. ad loc.). The
final phrase ná svapán “not the one who sleeps” provides a transition to the final two
responsive verses with their insistently repested jāgāra ‘is/stays awake’.
V.44.14–15: As was just noted, the final ná svapán of 13d provides a segue into this
two-verse appendix with its 6 occurrences of jāgāra ‘is/stays awake’. The two vss.
are strictly responsive -- so strictly responsive that the replacement of yó in abc by
agnír produces an awkward set of 12-syllable lines with Triṣṭubh cadence, an
awkwardness surely meant to call attention to their tight twinning. The vs. pair is
structured as a riddle + solution, though, given what we have just waded through, not
a very challenging puzzle. The focus seems to be on Agni, since he is the solution to
the riddle; the balance of the two ritual substances found in the rest of the hymn (if I
am correct) thus appears to be disturbed. But I do not think that this means that Agni
is the sole subject of the hymn, as Scar suggests in his final comment (in WG).
Rather the final word is found in the last pāda of both vss., the direct address of
Soma to Agni (tám ayám sóma āha “to him does this Soma say”): távāhám asmi
sakhyé nyòkaḥ “I am at home in fellowship with you.” It is the fellowship of Agni
and Soma, intimately joined here and identified by name, though neither of them was
named previously in the hymn, that we are left with and that allows us to revisit the
many obscurities that preceded this statement.
V.45 All Gods
On the structure of the hymn and the grammatical patterning that supports
that structure, see publ. intro. Note that this patterning imposes presential renderings
of the injunctives in the first three vss.

### 45.1  
The Pp. interprets vidā́as vidā́ḥ, and this interpr. is followed by Sāy., Gr, Ge,
Re (EVP XVI.107), and WG inter alia. It has the merit of providing a verb form for
the opening pāda, but the 2nd sg. subjunctive it appears to be does not fit well in
context. I prefer to take it as instr. sg. of the root noun víd- (vidā́against the Pp.), as
tentatively suggested by Old and, in different ways, adopted by Lüders (Varuṇa 325),
Thieme (rev. of Lüders, ZDMG 101 (1951) 417 [=KlSch 652]), Schmidt (B+I 175–
76), and Hoffmann (Inj. 173–74). My interp. follows Hoffmann in particular in
taking pāda b as parenthetical, with the singular verb appropriate to pāda a postponed
until ápāvṛta in pāda c. I far prefer this solution to allowing the sg. part. viṣiyán in
82
pāda a to be construed with the pl. phrase arcíno guḥ in b, with Lü et al. The sg. subj.
of a,c is most likely the sun.
In b arcín- is interpr. either as ‘having chant, singing’ (by most) or ‘having
rays, bright’. Again with Hoffmann, I prefer the latter. Hoffmann (174 n. 125)
suggests supplying ketú- ‘beam’, regularly associated with the dawns, and this seems
contextually appropriate.
Pāda c contains another -ín-stem, this time a hapax, vrajín- ‘possessing
enclosures’, in the fem. acc. pl.. Gr, Ge, Hoffmann, and WG take the referent to be
‘cows’, but the usual obj. of ápa √vṛ is the cow-enclosure (often the base of vrajín-,
namely vrajá-) or the doors thereto, and ‘door’ is also fem. This noun, dúraḥ, is
found in the next pāda as the obj. of the nearly identical lexeme ví … āvaḥ. In taking
‘doors’ as obj. also of ápāvṛta I am in agreement with Lü, Thieme, and Schmidt.
With Hoffmann and against the Pp. I take ápāvṛta as an injunc. ápā + vṛta.
The verb of d, ví … āvaḥ, is undeniably augmented, however; I take it as a summary
comment on the description found in the rest of the vs. See Hoffmann’s disc. 174–75.

### 45.2  
On ámati- see comm. ad I.73.2.
The problematic pāda is c. The rivers who are its subject are not, in my
opinion, either real-world rivers (so, it seems, Ge) or the heavenly streams so
beloved of Lü. Rather, to fit the context, they must be, metaphorically, the
outpourings of light at dawn, which are so intense that they threaten to destabilize the
world with their floods -- a threat countered by the solidity of Heaven described in
pāda d. The two bahuvrīhis in c, dhánv-arṇasaḥ … khā́do-arṇāḥ, have been much
discussed. Noteworthy first is the fact that they have (almost) the same final member:
if both cmpds are nom. pl. the 2nd members are -arṇas- and -arṇa- respectively.
Thieme rejects the variation in stem, taking both as containing -arṇas-, which
requires the 2nd form to be nom. singular. In his interpr. the many rivers described by
dhánvarṇasaḥ have joined into one, modified by singular khā́doarṇāḥ. It is a clever
solution, but rather over-clever and in fact unnecessary. Both árṇas- and árṇa- exist
independently, and the plural built to a cmpd. with árṇas- as final member (that is, -
arṇasaḥ) would not fit a Triṣṭubh cadence, while one built to the parallel stem -arṇadoes nicely, as if truncated from a Jagatī cadence with -arṇasaḥ (see such a cadence
in I.182.7).
What then do the cmpds mean? Again, a variety of interpr. have been
suggested. I take dhánv-arṇas- as an equational bv., ‘whose floods are dhánu-’. A
dhánu- appears to be a high flat plain or steppe; two of its five occurrences in the RV
are characterized as bṛhatī́- ‘lofty’. In our context I think it refers to what we often
call a “wall of water,” a mass of oncoming water far above flood stage, perhaps
already flooding over the banks and across the adjacent land. As for khā́do-arṇāḥ, it
should mean something like ‘whose floods are a biting/devouring’; in this case, I
think Ge (flg. Sāy.) is correct that the rivers are devouring their banks, eating away at
the solid ground. The sturdy pillar of heaven in d provides a bulwark against this
featureless undulating torrent of light.
83

### 45.3  
This vs. describes dawn as happening in response to and as a result of the
hymn recited at this very moment (hence asmaí) at the dawn sacrifice. The two
heavy dative phrases, polarized at both ends of the first hemistich, asmā́ukthā́ya and
janúṣe pūrvyā́ya, have different functions in the clause. The gaping mountain is an
allusion to the opening of the Vala cave, metaphorically applied to the advent of
dawn from the night darkness.
In the second hemistich, in c “heaven achieves success” must, in my view,
allude to the successful emergence of dawn’s light from the heavenly realm. This is
contrasted with d, where an unnamed plural subject is desiring to win the earth
(āvívasantaḥ … bhū́ma) -- in my opinion, this refers to the fact that features on the
earth come only slowly to visual definition at dawn, even as the light comes
streaming out of the sky. The unknown subjects are probably the poets responsible
for “this hymn here” (asmā́ukthā́ya) in pāda a; they must continue their verbal
efforts, “exhaust themselves” (dasayanta), in order to bring the earth into focus.
Supplying ‘poets’ as subj. generally follows Hoffmann, who thinks esp. of the
Aṅgirases (174 n. 126), contra Ge, who takes bhū́ma as subj. (sim. Lü). On
dasayanta, see my -áya-Formations, p. 59. Some take the verb rather to √daṃs
‘work wonders’; see esp. Thieme (loc. cit., n. 7), fld. by Schmidt, WG. This cannot
be excluded, but I find the ‘exhaust’ meaning more poetic compelling.

### 45.4  
The vaḥ in Wackernagel’s position can be construed in a number of different
ways. I take it as the poet’s address to his colleagues to praise and importune the two
gods. Since the next two vss. (5–6) consist of 1st pl. exhortations to proceed with the
sacrifice and achieve effective ritual poetry, my interpr. fits the larger context well.
Ge also seems to assume the referents are human, but are rather the potential
beneficiaries of the poet’s own plea to the gods (sim. WG). By contrast Schmidt (and
less clearly Lü) take it as direct address to the gods; Schmidt “… wollen wir jetzt
euch, Indra und Agni, zur Hilfe rufen.” Given the number discrepancy between pl.
vaḥ and the dual dvandva índrā … agnī́, this seems unlikely. Note also that the noninitial accent on agnī́precludes a voc. interpr. of the dvandva, though that alone
would not prevent vaḥ from referring to them.
I do not understand the intrusion of the Maruts here. They are not gods of the
dawn sacrifice, nor are they associated with the Vala myth or with the Aṅgirases.
Perhaps their prominence elsewhere in the Vth Maṇḍala (esp. V.52–61) is
responsible for their brief appearance here, prompted by the mention of Indra. They
are presumably not only the objects of yájanti but also of āvívasantaḥ: “winning”
them would involve persuading them to come to our sacrifice.
V.45.5–6: As noted in the publ. intro., these two vss. form an omphalos and are
structurally parallel, with the poet addressing his priest-poet colleagues with
hortatory subjunctives. The immediacy of the vss. and the sacrificial context of the
hymn make this a more likely scenario than Sāy.’s suggestion that the Aṅgirases are
speaking these vss. For strenuous arguments against Sāy.’s interpr., see Lü p. 327.
84

### 45.5  
As suggested already by Ge (n. 5b) and, independently, Thieme (ZDMG 95
[1941] 82–83 [=KlSch. 7–8]) and accepted by all subsequent tr., a better reading is
obtained by segmenting duchúnām inavāma, against Pp. duchúnā minavāma. This
requires no emendation to the Saṃhitā text.

### 45.6  
Unlike the first hortatory vs., this second one is not entirely tied to the hereand-now; rather it provides three separate historical/mythological models for the
effective poetic vision (dhī́-) that we are aiming to create now (pāda a). The first
model (b) appears to be a variant of the Vala myth so prominent in the rest of the
hymn, but those in c and d are obscure.
In b the first question is the grammatical identity of yā́. It is generally taken as
nom. sg. fem., but Old suggests that it might alternatively be a (short) instr. sg. fem.
In the former case the referent of yā́would be the dhī́- of pāda a, which would be the
subj. of ṛṇuta and identified with the “mother of the cow” (mātā́… góḥ); in the latter
it would be parallel to the two instr. sg. fem. yáyā opening c and d. I favor the second
interpr.; although the former is not impossible, I find the syntactic parallelism a
stronger argument, and yā́could owe its abbreviated form to being displaced from
initial position by the preverb ápa. If the instr. interpr. is correct, this leaves the subj.
of ṛṇuta and referent of “mother of the cow” open. Old and Ge both consider it to be
Uṣas. Again, this is not impossible, but I think it may be Saramā, whose finding of
the cows is treated in vss. 7–8 -- though Dawn as “mother of cows” (gávām mātā́) is
found in vs. 2 and is also a strong candidate.
Ge remarks apopos of pāda c “sonst unbekannte Sage” (see also Lü, p. 329),
and it is likely that we will not get further than that. Ad VII.99.4 Old tentatively
suggests that the name of a Dāsa, vṛṣaśiprá, that occurs in that passage might have
something to do with our viśiśiprá-, but even if so (and it’s certainly possible), this is
a deadend, since all we know of Vṛṣaśipra is that he’s a Dāsa and killed by Indra and
Viṣṇu. Like the Maruts in 4d, the fleeting intrusion of Manu here is unexpected and
unexplained.
Even more so the “wandering merchant” (vaṇíg vaṅkúḥ) of d. On vaṅkú- see
comm. ad I.51.11 and, esp., I.114.4. Although the standard rendering is ‘flying’ (see,
e.g., Ge, Schmidt), its derivation from √vañc ‘move crookedly, meander’ makes
‘meandering, wandering’ more likely. In I.114.4 it modifies kaví-. I suggest there
that it refers to an itinerant poet, and merchants are at least as likely as poets to be
itinerant, following a meandering course as they peddle their goods. But who this
particular merchant is meant to be and how and why he needs a dhī́- to attain his
pū́rīṣa- remain unclear. If I had Dumézilian tendencies, I might suggest a
trifunctional interpr.: pāda b = 1st function, c = 2nd function, and d = 3rd function (at
least the latter two might work -- 1st
-function b is a bit of a stretch). But even if this
interpr. were persuasive, it doesn’t explain what the material is doing in this hymn at
this point.
V.45.7–8: Here the mythic model of the dawn accompanying the dawn ritual, the
opening of the Vala cave through the verbal efforts of the Aṅgirases, is spelled out.
85
Note the variant versions of the phrase “Saramā found the cows”: 7c sarámā
gā́avindat, with augmented imperfect; 8d sarámā vidad gā́ḥ, with aor. injunctive
(per Pp.) or aor. indicative (sarámāvidad, with augmented avidat is a possible
reading). For Hoffmann’s interpr. of this vs. pair see Injunk. 164–65.

### 45.7  
Note that 3 of the 4 verbs are augmented (ánūnot, ā́rcan, avindat), the 4th a
preterital pf. (cakāra).

### 45.8  
The subordinator yád comes quite late (2nd position pāda b) in the
subordinate clause presumably occupying the first hemistich, and it is preceded not
only by the subj. (víśve) but by a heavy temporal loc. expression (asyā́vyúṣi
mā́hināyāḥ) -- in violation of standard RVic subordinator placement. This anomaly
may have led WG to take pāda a as a nominal main clause: “Sie alle (waren) …
(zugegen).” I am sympathetic, but think the clause division is unnecessarily radical.
It is possible that b is a conversion into a subordinate clause of IV.3.11b sám
áṅgiraso navanta góbhiḥ with pāda a acting as a preposed afterthought.
The 2nd hemistich brings another syntactic problem: in c the Pp. interprets útsa
(before a vowel) as nom. -aḥ, a grammatical ident. that in turn requires that c be an
independent clause. The Pp. reading is defended by Old and fld. by many, incl. Ge,
Hoffmann (Injunk. 165), WG. With Lü (385 n. 2; fld. by Schmidt p. 177, Janert p.
10) I prefer the loc. útse, parallel to paramé sadhásthe, and defining the place where
Saramā found the cows in d.

### 45.9  
The first hemistich is metrically problematic. HvN put the pāda break after
saptā́śvaḥ and distract sū́ryo, yātu, and saptā́śvaḥ; their 2nd pāda, beginning kṣétram,
has a caesura after 3 (though see their n.). It is also possible to take kṣétram as the
last word of pāda a (see Schmidt’s layout, p. 178) and to restrict the distraction to a
single word, either sū́ryaḥ or saptā́śvaḥ, though this produces a bad cadence. In that
case I would suggest that the 2nd pāda orig. began *yád yád; reading *yád yád asya
produces an opening of 4 and, with post-caesura urviyā́dīrgayāthé, makes a fine
Triṣṭubh. The 2nd (or 1st) yád would be the neut. sg. N/A participle to √i.
Even if this possible emendation is not accepted, it is still possible to take yád
as the neut. participle, not the subordinator: this interpr. is represented in my tr. by
“stretching” and by the lack of a relative cl. With double yád the tr. would read “to
the tract of land which is stretching widely at (the end of) his long course.”
The 2nd hemistich contains a pres. injunctive, patayat, and a pf. [/redupl. pres.]
subjunctive dīdayat. In the publ. tr. they are both rendered as imperatives, matching
the pattern set by yātu in pāda a. I now think that this interpr. lacks refinement and
should be altered. The vs. in general concerns the coincidence between the sunrise
and the ritual activities of the dawn sacrifice. We hope for the sunrise (hence the
impv.), which is in fact realized in the next vs. By contrast, the ritual activities in the
2nd hemistich are under our (=priests’) control and can therefore simply be described.
Exactly what the referents of the falcon (c) and the young poet (d) are is disputed
(see the various interpr., incl. those that do not consider them ritual referents at all
86
[notably Lü 329–31]). Starting with d, yúvan- kaví- is frequently an epithet of Agni
and √dī is a typical Agni verb, so it seems likely that this is a reference to the
kindling of the fire at the dawn ritual. Although “going among the cows” sounds
more like soma (mixing with milk), the cows here can be the ghee oblations poured
into the fire, which will cause it to flame more brightly. If d refers to Agni, then c is
likely to refer to Soma; certainly the ándhas- ‘stalk’ is Soma vocabulary, and the
falcon is Soma’s vehicle in the Somaraub. What exactly is going on eludes me,
however. As for the tense/mood distinction between patayat and dīdayat, it may be
that the distinction is illusory: one of them was simply brought into superficial
harmony with the other, so that both end in -ayat, though they should be inj. and subj.
respectively. Or it may be that the injunc. is followed by a subj. to indicate that the
2nd action follows the first (“the falcon flies to the stalk; the young poet will shine
…”).

### 45.10  
The structure of this vs. matches that of the last one: the first half describes
a cosmic event outside of human control; the second ascribes control to the ritualists.
What is striking is that the same event is treated in both halves: the rising of the sun.
In ab the Sun has agency; he yoked his own horses and mounted the sky. But in c it is
the priest-poets (“the wise” dhī́rāḥ) who guide him, through the waters that stand still
for this progress, “giving heed” (āśṛṇvantī́ḥ) presumably to the poets’ words. (I owe
the germ of this interpr. to Dieter Gunkel [p.c.].)

### 45.11  
Most interpr. construe apsú with dadhiṣe and tr. the latter as ‘you have
placed’, hence “you have placed your dhī́in the waters.” But med. forms of √dhā
generally mean ‘acquire, assume’, and furthermore the standard interpr. is either
nonsensical or requires a substantial backstory -- such as Old’s “[ein] Zauber für
Wiedererscheinen der Sonne nach langen Regengüssen.” I follow Ge in taking apsú
with svarṣā́m “das … die Sonne im Wasser gewinnt”; the sun was manifestly in the
water(s) in the immediately preceding vs. -- however metaphorically we wish to
interpret those waters (I would take them as the floods of dawn light we encountered
in vs. 2). Thus “winning the sun in the waters” is simply an expression for causing
the sun to rise at dawn. For further disc. on the place of this vs. in the hymn, see publ.
intro.
The number discrepancy between 2nd pl. vaḥ and 2nd sg. dadhiṣe is easily
accounted for in the same general manner as the vaḥ in vs. 4 (see comm. thereon):
dadhiṣe is the poet’s self-address to himself, while vaḥ is addressed to his colleagues.
As in vss. 5–6, these two distinct 2nd ps. references are joined in a joint 1st pl. in cd
(syāma … tuturyāma).
V.46 All Gods
On my hypothesis concerning the reason for this hymn, viz., support for the
ritual innovation of the Patnī, see publ. intro. Save for the final two vss. devoted to
the wives of the gods, there seems no rationale for the deities included or excluded
from the enumerative vss. or for the repetition of some and not others.
87

### 46.1  
As noted in the publ. intro., this preliminary vs., preceding the apparently
unconnected series of enumerative vss. calling on various gods, esp. female divinities
and the wives of the gods, sets up the scenario: in pāda a the poet-sacrificer has
yoked himself to the chariot pole (dhúr-) along with his wife, the recently introduced
ritual Patnī, an image found elsewhere for the same pairing. Since dhúr- is feminine,
the remaining feminines in this vs. (b tā́m … pratáranīm avasyúvam, c: asyāḥ) can
refer both to the chariot pole and to the Patnī. In b the feminine obj. is said to be
“furthering (the sacrifice)”; though the default obj. of prá √tṝ is ā́yus- ‘lifetime’,
yajñám can also serve as obj.: cf., e.g., III.17.2 yajñám prá tira. (On avasyúvam see
comm. ad vs. 7 below. One might also note that, while ‘seeking help’ makes sense in
context, esp. when read with vs. 7, this word could also be taken as a phonological
scrambling of ā̛yus-.) In c the speaker asserts that he does not wish to revert to the
old ways or be released from the yoked pairing. In other words, he has accepted the
ritual innovation of the Patnī.
Most interpr. take patháḥ as gen. sg. with vidvā́n. Since that pf. part. is
generally used absolutely (“[as] knowing one”), I take patháḥ rather as acc. pl. extent
of space with néṣati. For a clear acc. of the path with néṣa- see I.91.1 tváṃ rájiṣṭham
ánu neṣi pánthām.

### 46.2  
Among this group of mainly male divinities we find the Wives (gnā́ḥ, a word
only used for the Wives of the Gods in the RV) and Sarasvatī in the 2nd hemistich.
The first pāda consists only of vocatives, each accented since there is no
inherently accented word preceding. In b the accent on mā́ruta (modifying pādainitial śárdhaḥ) is surprising, however, since it follows the verbal lexeme prá yanta
with accent on the preverb, and the following voc. viṣṇo lacks accent following utá.
Notice the coincidence of verbal endings for two different person / number /
voice combinations: yanta 2nd pl. act. impv. √yam; juṣanta 3rd pl. med. injunc. √juṣ.

### 46.3  
The previous vs. consisted of vocatives in ab and nominatives in cd. Here we
find accusatives, with the governing verb huvé postponed until the beginning of the
2nd hemistich. The first four divinities in vss. 2 and 3 are the same, but the four
individual vocc. ágna índra váruṇa mítra of 2a are arranged in 3a in two dual
dvandvas indrāgnī́and mitrā́váruṇā, in opposite order. The Maruts, Viṣṇu, Pūṣan,
and Bhaga (bhága-) are also repeated from vs. 2. Otherwise the emphasis is on
divinized natural elements. As for female divinities, we find Aditi immediately after
her offspring Mitra and Varuṇa, as well as the waters (apáḥ).
Unfortunately the repetition of bhága- is obscured in the publ. tr. by its
rendering as “Fortune” in 3d, though both 2d and 6c call him Bhaga. “Fortune” in 3
should therefore be changed to “Bhaga.”

### 46.4  
In pāda a asrídhaḥ is clearly pl., though it occurs in dual context (utá …
víṣṇur utá vā́to asrídhaḥ). There seem to be 3 possibilities: 1) it also modifies the
gods in pāda b, the Treasure-giver (draviṇodā́ḥ) and Soma; 2) it refers to the gods in
88
general, as in I.3.9 víśve devā́so asrídhaḥ; 3) it refers to goddesses or the trio of
goddesses so denominated in I.13.9 íḷā sárasvatī mahī́tisró devī́r mayobhúvaḥ / …
asrídhaḥ (note mayobhúvaḥ like máyas karat in our pāda b). There is no clear way to
choose, and it scarcely seems to matter. I would of course prefer the third possibility,
since it involves a female presence in this vs., but the support for this possibility is
not strong.
The vs. contains the 3rd mention of Viṣṇu and the 2nd of the Aśvins; the other
divinities are newly named.

### 46.5  
The Maruts recur for the third time (the 2nd time in the corporate entity, the
Marutian troop [mā́rutaṃ śárdhaḥ]), as does Pūṣan, with Bṛhaspati substituting for
the Brahmaṇaspati in 3c. Varuṇa and Mitra also make their 3rd appearance, this time
with their regular companion Aryaman, rather than the Aditi of 3a.

### 46.6  
The mountains of 3b reappear here; the waters, their companions in 3b, are
replaced by the rivers (nadyàḥ), also feminine of course. Bhaga also recurs from 2d
and 3d. It seems significant that Aditi is the last divinity named before the “wives”
vss.

### 46.7  
The help for which the wives of the gods are insistently entreated (avantu
naḥ, prā́vantu naḥ) reminds us of the adj. qualifying the chariot pole / Sacrificer’s
Wife in 1b, avasyúvam ‘seeking help’ and provides a type of ring.
With Ge and WG, I take tujáye as referring specifically to the propagation of
children, a function appropriate to the wives of the gods, against Re’s insistence that
it refers to the production of inspiration (though in his long n. he admits that there is
“une certaine association entre túj et la notion de procréer”).

### 46.8  
This last vs. is in a diff. meter and also shows some metrical irregularities
(see HvN notes). It seems tacked on, to allow an enumeration of the gods’ wives in
question, most of whom (save for Indrāṇī) have a very shadowy existence. It is also
not clear whether aśvínī and rā́ṭ refer to a single individual or two.
The last phrase, yá ṛtúr jánīnām “which is the regular season for women,” is
somewhat puzzling, made more so by the fact that there is no overt referent in the
main clause for the yáḥ, since the verb vyántu lacks an object (also in pāda a). I
follow Ge (flg. Sāy.) in taking this as a reference to the patnīsaṃyāja offering (or its
forerunner), and I therefore supply ‘offering’ as obj. for vyántu (havís-, etc., is a
common, though not invariable, obj. to this root). The rel. cl. is then also a pun: it
refers not only to this offering, which is the ritual “time/season” allotted to women,
but probably also to their menstrual periods, since ṛtú- is regularly so used later. For
a similar pun, using the adj. ṛtvíyāvatī-, see VIII.12.10, 80.7.
V.47 All Gods
89

### 47.1  
As noted in the publ. intro., I take the subj. of this riddling vs. to be manīṣā́
‘poetic inspiration’, but until this word appears (end of pāda c), the vs. both invites
an identification of the subject with Dawn and makes that impossible. The nom. sg.
participles prayuñjatī́and bodháyantī are characteristic Dawn vocabulary, but Dawn
is also regularly identified as “the daughter of heaven,” which phrase is here in the
genitive: diváḥ … duhitúḥ. It is her “great mother” (mahī́mātā́) who is the
grammatical subj.
My interpr. generally follows that of Old. Others (Ge, Re, WG) seek to make
Dawn subj. at least of the first hemistich and are thus forced into awkward
interpretations of the phraseology and into division of the vs. into two clauses.
Assuming (with Old and me) that manīṣā́is the subj. of the whole vs., the point
would seem to be that the inspiration that produces the poetry of the early morning
ritual has the power to beget even Dawn herself -- the usual semi-hubristic boast by
the poets that even the cosmos is regulated by the ritual performance and the poetry
recited there. The phrase “(coming) from the fathers” (by my interpr.; some others
take pitṛ́bhyaḥ as dative) reflects the transmission of the poetic tradition from older
generations to younger ones. For manīṣā́‘constantly calling’ (jóhuvānā), see VII.24.2
jóhuvatī manīṣā́, also adduced by Old.

### 47.2  
Again I take the vs. as having one referent, while Ge, Re, and WG split it
into two sentences with two different subjects. In my view, the intent is again to
mislead -- that is, in this riddle hymn, to suggest one referent to the audience and
then spring a different one on them towards the end of the verse, in this case the very
last word pánthāḥ ‘paths’. These are presumably the paths that connect heaven and
earth and enable the gods to come to the sacrifice and the sacrificial offerings to
make their way to heaven. Although paths are not ordinarily credited with much
agency -- and the descriptions in the first hemistich attribute bustling activity to their
referents -- the lively traffic between heaven and earth can spill over onto the paths
that bear this traffic.
tádapaḥ is most likely adverbial here (so already Gr), though Ge suggests it is
nom. pl. “mit Abfall der Endung,” for which there is no motivation.
The “nave of the immortal one” (amṛ́tasya nā́bhim) can refer both to the ritual
ground and to the height of heaven, again suggesting the connection between those
places that is established by the paths.
For anantá- see disc. ad vs. 4.
For the formula viśvátaḥ sīm pári and the unusual placement of sīm, see my
“Rigvedic viśvátaḥ sīṃ, Or, Why Syntax Needs Poetics” (1998, Fs. Watkins).

### 47.3  
In this riddle vs. the referent is not explicitly named, and in fact an initially
bewildering set of incompatible identifications comes pouring out: a bull, the sea, a
bird, a stone. But all of them are possible aspects of the sun (for similar vocab. see
IX.83.3), and esp. in the 2nd hemistich the position specified (“in the middle of
heaven”) and the actions depicted point strongly to the sun -- a referent generally
agreed upon by interpreters.
90
The “womb of the age-old father” (pū́rvasya yónim pitúḥ) is a gender-bending,
though understated, paradox. It is likely that the sun’s age-old father is Heaven
(Dyaus Pitā) -- on the parental relationship of Heaven and Earth to Sūrya, see esp.
I.160 -- in which case the womb is probably (lower-case) heaven, the place through
which the sun travels. In the next pāda he is unambiguously situated there: mádhye
divó níhitaḥ, so at least in this instance one of the side-riddles of the vs. is solved
almost as soon as it is posed.

### 47.4  
As often elsewhere in the RV, numerology begets obscurity. Nonetheless, the
most likely referent here is Agni. As Ge points out, the four and the ten in the 1st
hemistich may well refer to the four priests (so already Sāy.) or the four arms of the
two main priests, the ten, as often, to the fingers. The “bearing” by the four might
refer to the transport of the new Āhavanīya to the east end of the ritual ground and
the depositing there (hence the “rest”); the ten (fingers) are making offering into the
fire (“giving it suck”), to cause it to flare up. Hence the balanced opposition of rest
and motion in ab.
The threefold cows of pāda c are puzzling, but three is of course a number
closely associated with Agni: the three ritual fires, his three births (e.g., X.45.1), the
three pressings, etc. For Agni’s triads, cf. X.45.2 (right after the three births just
referred to) vidmā́te agne tredhā́trayā́ṇi “we know your threefold triads” (also
VIII.39.9 for his three domains). See also tridhā́tu-śṛṅga- ‘having tripartite horns’ of
Agni in nearby V.43.13, where it may refer to the three hearths – not candidates for
our tripartite cows, I’m afraid. For these threefold cows Sāy (see Ge n. 4c; so also
Re) suggests sun’s rays, WG milk-streams, but ‘threefold’ is not a standard
characterization of either set. Note also tridhā́tubhir áruṣībhiḥ “with threefold ruddy
(cows)” in IX.111.2, where the phrase refers to accoutrements of Soma, and Soma is
a possible, if somewhat unlikely, referent for this vs. as well: the ten (fingers) are a
common trope in the soma maṇḍala, referring to the priests pressing and preparing
the drink. Pāda a is harder to apply to soma, beyond the generic notion of four priests.
The circling threefold cows could, I suppose, be the streams of the heavenly soma.
Still, Agni seems a better, though not perfect, candidate.
Pāda d, with diváḥ … ántān# “the ends of heaven,” echoes 3d rájasaḥ …
ántau# “the two ends of the airy realm,” and both contrast with the “endless”
(anantā́saḥ) paths of 2cd. The dual in 3d points to a straight trajectory from one end
to the other, reinforced by the verb ví cakrame ‘he strode’ (though it’s not in the
same clause with the ends): the sun’s journey across the sky from one horizon to the
other. The plural in 4d is more diffuse, as is the verb caranti pári “they wander/circle
around.” The phrase divó ánta- [pl.] “the ends of heaven” is quite common, but I am
not sure what the plural conveys -- that there are numerous divisions of heaven, each
with its own boundaries? that heaven is effectively end-less (like the anantá- paths of
2) because there are always more ends? In any case the sun’s purposeful trip from
one place to another in vs. 3 seems contrasted with the more comprehensive travels
of the subject of caranti in 4d. Is that subject the threefold cows of 4c? If so, many of
the possible triads suggested above are eliminated. Save for the ‘threefold’ (and, I
91
guess, the cows), Agni’s plumes of smoke would make the most sense in d. But I
confess bafflement.
V.47.4–5: Note the parallel openings of 4a catvā́ra īm bibhrati … and 5c dvé yád īm
bibhṛtáḥ … But this parallelism gains complexity from the fact that √bhṛ is used in
two different senses: in 4 it means ‘carry’, but in 6 it refers to the bearing of children.

### 47.5  
The opening idáṃ vápur nivácanam “Here is the wonder, the enigma”
announces this vs. as potentially even more obscure than what precedes. Each of the
three following pādas is presented as a paradox, but the contents do not seem
significantly more enigmatic than the rest of the hymn; in fact, the explicit paradoxes
point the way to their solution.
The first -- the rivers move, but the waters stay -- seems unconnected to the
themes of the hymn, simply presenting a wonder of the natural world: no matter how
much the rivers flow, there is always water in them (see Ge n. 5b). The verb cáranti
repeats that of 4d (and see cárase in 4b), but does not echo its meaning there.
The second hemistich does continue the ritual and cosmic focus of the rest of
the hymn (see the parallel openings of 4a and 5c cited just above). It treats the
surrogate parentage of an unidentified figure. Ge (n. 5cd) suggests that this figure
can be both Agni and the sun, with two different mother-substitutes referred to
depending on the original identification of īm. In Ge’s view, Sūrya’s “real” mother is
Dawn, but the two other females who bear him are Heaven and Earth; for Agni, the
kindling stick is the mother, but the two other females are Night and Dawn. In both
cases the two have different places of birth, but form a twin pair. Although I am not
overwhelmingly convinced by Ge’s identifications, I do not have better ones. Of his
two suggestions, Agni seems significantly more likely than the sun. The sole passage
he cites as evidence for Dawn as the sun’s mother (VII.63.3) does not seem to me to
say that, and of course Dawn is more commonly his lover. The evidence for Night
and Dawn as Agni’s surrogate mothers is much more robust; the two passages he
cites (I.95.1, 96.5) both depict the two giving suck to Agni using the same verb as
found here (4b), though not in this vs. : I.95.1 anyā́nyā vatsám úpa dhāpayete; I.96.5
náktoṣā́sā … dhāpáyete śíśum ékam.

### 47.6  
This is the last real vs. of the hymn, preceding the meta-reference to the
hymn itself and wishes for its efficacy (vs. 7).
In the first hemistich the subj. of ví tanvate appears to me to be the poets/
ritualists; I am not sure of the identity of asmai, but given its lack of accent, it should
be someone already present in the discourse -- probably the īm of 5c, which, as was
just discussed, can be either/both Agni or/and, less likely, Sūrya. Pāda b continues
the motherhood theme of 5cd. With Re, I consider the mothers here to be an
unmarked simile: the production of ritual poetry by the poets is implicitly compared
to the weaving of baby clothes by mothers.
The “paths of heaven” of vs. 2 return in the phrase divás pathā́(6d) “along the
path of heaven” (note the close sandhi). Who the referents are and what is going on
92
in the 2nd hemistich are unclear, made more so by the grammatical multivalence of
the principal actors in the 2nd hemistich: vṛ́ṣaṇaḥ can be nom. pl. or, less likely, acc.
pl. (or, even less likely though the solution of most [Ge, Re, WG], gen. sg.: the gen.
sg. is otherwise vṛ́ṣṇas and, as far as I know, never read trisyllabically); vadhvàḥ can
be nom. pl. (Ge, Re, WG), acc. pl., or gen. sg.; the part. módamānāḥ can be nom. pl.
masc. or fem. or acc. pl. fem. Ge in his Nachtr. does confront the morphological
problem of vṛ́ṣanaḥ, suggesting that it’s an irregular gen. sg., but he also provides an
alternative transl., with vṛ́ṣanaḥ as nom. pl., that my own tr. follows. In this interpr.,
acdg. to Ge., the gods are the bulls on their way to unite with their wives, “die
Dichtungen der Sänger.” Assuming that the referents of vadhvàḥ are the dhíyaḥ of
pāda a, the sexual union of these thoughts and the gods for whom they’re composed
seems plausible (in a RVic universe). The only question is who is going to whom,
and the two-way street of Vedic ritual allows movement in either direction: the
hymns going to heaven to unite with the gods, or the gods coming from heaven to the
ritual ground to unite with the hymns. I have gone for the latter. See disc. of the paths
ad vs. 2.
With Old I take upaprakṣé as loc. to a them. stem upaprakṣáIf this interpr. of the vs. is correct, it provides the hymn with a thematic ring
compositional structure. The first two vss. provide the materials that will return in vs.
6. Vs. 1 introduces the inspired thought coming from heaven and established at the
sacrifice, thus linking the divine and human worlds, and vs. 2 sketches the highway
linking these two worlds, the encircling paths. In vs. 6 the inspired thought of vs. 1 is
represented by the dhíyaḥ (insightful thoughts) produced by the unnamed priests (ab),
and these thoughts are configured as the new brides of the bullish gods who have
utilized the paths of vs. 2 to come to the sacrifice and unite with them. The interior
vss. present the sun (vs. 3) but concentrate on the ritual fire (vss. 4–5). Given the
emphasis on the ritual and its connection to heaven, I’m not quite sure why the sun
intrudes in 3—perhaps its journey across the sky is compared or contrasted with the
journey between heaven and earth we find elsewhere in the hymn.
V.48 All Gods

### 48.1  
My interpr. follows that of Old in most particulars, but is also informed by
my view that the hymn as a whole is a Dawn hymn (see publ. intro.). I therefore
think that in the 1st hemistich the dative recipient of the poets’ compositions is Agni,
not, per Old, Varuṇa, nor, per Re, Indra. (Ge and WG do not identify the recipient.)
Although the descriptors in b are not strongly typical of Agni, the “own dear
foundation” (priyā́ya dhā́m(a)ne) in pāda a would be appropriate for the
establishment of the offering fire at the beginning of the morning sacrifice.
With Old I take the subject of cd, identified as feminine by nom. māyínī, as
Dawn, and I also follow him in considering the hapax āmenyá- as dissimilated from
*āmemyá-, a thematic nominal deriv. of the intens. to √mī ‘(ex)change’, formed like
vitarturá-, ādardirá-, as he suggests. Modifying rájas- ‘(dusky) realm’, it would
express the constantly changing color of the sky at dawn, and is comparable to the
93
intens. part. in I.96.5 náktoṣā́sā várṇam āmém(i)yāne “Night and Dawn, ever
exchanging their color,” as Old also points out. Whatever the etymology of māyā́-
(whose possessive deriv. māyínī closes the vs.) -- I favor Thieme’s connection with
√mī ‘(ex)change’, which, however, is rejected by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v.) -- the
polarized initial and final words of the hemistich, #āmenyásya ... māyínī#, provide a
phonological and, if Thieme is correct, an etymological frame for the hemistich.
And what happens within that frame? In my view the image is that of dawn in
a partly cloudy sky. The conceit is that the rays of Dawn spreading across the cloudy
sky look like streams of water -- water that Dawn has appropriated from the cloud
(“choosing the waters in the dark cloud” abhrá ām̐apó vṛṇānā́). Since the image
makes sense with the transmitted apáḥ ‘waters’, I see no reason to follow Old (and
partly WG) in assuming it stands for *ápaḥ ‘work’. The same phrase “choosing the
waters” is also found in IX.94.1, though in a very different context. I explain it there
as a deliberate poetic deformation of the common expression apó vasāná- “clothing
oneself in the waters.”

### 48.2  
The image in 1cd is repeated with variation in 2ab. The fem. sg. subj. of 1d
has been replaced by the fem. pl., easily interpr. as plural Dawns, as often. The verb
is held constant, though the root aor. atnata substitutes for the pres. vitanóti. The
waters/rays of light that the Dawn spread out in 1cd are now characterized as
forming a pattern or tracery across the dusky realm (víśvam ā́rájaḥ) that also figured
in 1cd. The spreading performed by the Dawns is done “along the same course”
(samānyā́vṛtáyā) by my interpretation -- that is, the same course that the successive
Dawns follow day after day. I do not understand why their pattern of light is “herostrengthening” (vīrá-vakṣaṇa-). Perhaps this is simply a reference to the usual trope
that dawn rouses all people to undertake their daily labors.
The adjective may also prepare for the more human-oriented 2nd hemistich, in
which the pious man seems to do battle with time itself, embodied by the ever
advancing dawns. The interpr. of the hemistich is complicated by the shifting senses
of the words ápara- and pū́rva-. If these have temporal reference here, the sense
would have to be that the man repels later dawns, while lengthening his life with
earlier ones (so in fact both Ge and Re). But this does not accord with Rigvedic
conceptions of time: there is no preventing the dawning of each new day; even a hero
cannot contravene the cosmic laws of time. It would also be somewhat odd to say
that a man lengthens his life with past dawns; this would seem to indicate that he has
no future, unless he can fight off the dawns to come. It therefore seems preferable to
follow Old (also fld by WG), who takes the two adjectives as spatial: ápara- ‘behind,
to the west’, pū́rva- ‘in front, to the east’. With these values in play, the man sends
each new day behind him -- the dawn facing backwards as she passes from east to
west -- and piles up his future with the dawns in front of him, to come.
This vs. is full of alliteration and sound play, esp. in pāda c: a: tā́atnata
vayúnaṃ vīrávakṣaṇam / c: ápo ápācīr áparā ápejate (noted also by Watkins,
Dragon 109) / d: prá pū́rvābhis.
94

### 48.3  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is the hardest in the hymn and, as the
middle vs., serves as an omphalos. It contains several temporal expressions and thus
continues the theme of the passage of time found in the 2nd half of vs. 2, but the rest
is rather unclear. My rendering is tentative and also differs considerably from those
of others, the details of which cannot be fully covered here.
Already in pāda a the alternation of days and nights is alluded to with the
polarized expression ahanyèbhir aktúbhiḥ. Although the adjectival form of ahanyàseems to invite an interpr. whereby the word modifies the adjacent instr. pl.
grā́vabhiḥ, the result, “with the daily pressing stones” (Ge “mit den täglichen
Presssteinen”), doesn’t make sense, and I prefer to follow Re in considering it “une
variante probable de áhabhir aktúbhiḥ.” Cf. áhobhiḥ ... aktúbhiḥ X.14.9 and, with
lexical substitution, dyúbhir aktúbhiḥ (I.34.8, I.112.25, III.31.16).
A more serious problem is figuring out what action is being performed in the
first hemistich. In literal terms, the subject, whoever it is, sprinkles the/a superior
mace, along with or by means of the pressing stones. Assuming we take the verb ā́
jigharti seriously -- unlike Ge and Re, who tr. contextually (‘schleudert’ and ‘brandit’
respectively), with Ge suggesting a possible derivation from √hṛ not √ghṛ -- the
action is difficult to interpret, whoever the subject is. Why would one ‘sprinkle’ a
mace? Old, flg. Bergaigne, suggests that the mace is really soma, but although we
might think this would get us out of the difficulty, in fact the object of (ā́) √ghṛ is
never the liquid sprinkled, but the object that is sprinkled with it.
Working backward from vss. 4–5, which have pretty clear references to Agni,
I take Agni as the subject of ā́jigharti here. He prepares the mace by “sprinkling” it
with his sparks, a sort of final or symbolic forging, while the soma produced by the
pressing stones is sprinkled on the weapon at the same time. The two acts of
sprinkling make the weapon ritually fit for use. (Agni’s ‘streaming’ rītí- is found in
4a—another configuration of Agni as a liquid or as controlling liquid.) Under this
interpr. the three apparently anomalous forms of ā́√ghṛ in the RV, here and in
IV.17.14 and X.6.4, can be given a unified interpr. All three have Agni as subj. (in
my view), and in all three Agni “sprinkles” an object with his sparks. See comm. on
the two other passages.
The loc. māyíni is a separate problem. The standard view is that it refers to an
enemy at whom the vajra is wielded, hence tr. like Ge’s “… schleudert er die beste
Keule auf den Zauberischen,” which, as we saw, requires the verb ā́jigharti to be
semantically twisted. But the near rhyme māyínī at the end of vs. 1 refers to a
positively viewed figure (in my interpr.), the goddess Dawn, and I suggest that
māyíni here, which occurs in the same prominent hemistich-final position, also
identifies a positive figure -- in fact, Indra. Indra is called māyín- in VIII.76.1 and his
māyā́- are often referred to (see the passages listed by Grassmann, s.v., including

### 30.6  
in this maṇḍala). If it is Indra, the loc. does not have to refer to the goal of a
brandished weapon, but can simply be a type of loc. absolute: “when the māyín- (is
there),” that is, when Indra attends the sacrifice.
The doubled preverb ā́, found both at the beginning of the hemistich and
directly before the verb, seems to be a case of mere repetition.
95
The second hemistich also contains a temporal expression, saṃvartáyanto ví
ca vartayann áhā “rolling up the days, they unroll them (again).” The idiom sám/ví
√vṛt is used of rolling up or out hides (cárma, VI.8.3, VIII.6.5), and this action is
then metaphorically applied to darkness (támas-)(cf., e.g., V.31.3). The rolling up
and out of darkness is thus a way of expressing the alternations of darkness and light,
night and day -- in other words, a more poetic instantiation of the phrase in pāda a
ahanyèbhir aktúbhiḥ. The problem is how to connect this fairly straightforward
expression to pāda c, if it is connected. Although it is an easy assumption that cd has
a subord. clause / main clause structure (so Ge and Re ), it is possible to take c as
attached to the first hemistich and d independent (so WG and me). The next question
is whether the pl. subject of pracáran and that of ví ca vartayan are coreferential, and
if so, who are they? and whose “own house” (své dáme) do they enter? The latter
question is easier to answer: (své) dáme is almost always Agni’s. I therefore think
that yásya also refers to Agni, and this is indirect evidence for my identification of
Agni as subj. of ā́jigharti. But who enters Agni’s house “by the hundred” (śatám)
and rolls up and unrolls the days? In the publ. tr. I tentatively identify the subj. as
“dawns,” with full awareness that this is grammatically problematic: the pres. part.
vartáyantaḥ in d is masc., and so the only way to make this work is to assume that
dawns are the subj. of c, but the subj. of d reverts to a generic masc. I suggested the
dawns as subj. because they are the standard regulators of time (for this see VII.79.2,
80.1 with sám √vṛt and ví √vṛt respectively). Others (explicitly WG) suggest the
gods or some subset thereof, but the gods don’t really have the role of causing the
alternation of days and nights. I must leave the identity of the subject uncertain,
although I am still inclined to think that it is at least an indirect ref. to the dawns.
I do not understand the function of vā in c; JSK does not discuss this passage.
As for the ca in d, I think it contrastively conjoins the preverbs sam and ví, even
though the morphological formations to which these preverbs are attached are not
parallel.

### 48.4  
This vs. is characterized by words regularly (though not exclusively)
associated with Agni: ánīka- ‘face’, várpas- ‘form’, rátnam √dhā ‘establish a
treasure’. This vocabulary gives support to my suggestion that Agni is also the
subject of vs. 3, esp. since the asya in pāda a (and b) should refer to something
already present in the discourse.
As for the tā́m … rītím paraśór iva, most comm. appositely compare V.7.8
prá svádhitīva rī́yate “(Agni) streams forth like an ax.” I consider the rītím to
continue the liquid imagery of 3b. The abstract rītí- in its 4 other occurrences is
either construed with the gen. pl. apā́m (VI.13.1, IX.108.10) or implicitly with other
liquid vocabulary; cf. also the cmpd. rītyā̀p- (2x). The attempts by most interpr. to
impose a different sense (e.g., Re ‘l’élan-destructeur’) on this transparent deriv. of
√rī ‘flow’ seem to stem from discomfort with the image, and esp. the simile of the ax.
But the arc of sparks that sprinkle the mace in 3b (by my interpr.) would look like a
stream, and anyone who has ever watched a person swing an ax (properly) would
96
recognize the image: the fluent movement in a stream-like curve. (There are
numerous You-tube videos.)
For bhárahūti- see comm. ad I.129.2, V.29.8.
Ge, flg. Gr., reverses 4cd and 5ab. I do not see the necessity for this. It puts
the two forms of (-)ánīka- in the same vs. and continues the description of Agni
begun in 4ab, but leaving the hemistichs in their transmitted order certainly causes
less thematic disruption than most changes of topic in the RV.

### 48.5  
Ge emends váruṇo to áruṇo ‘the reddish one’, but this seems completely
unnecessary. Although putting people in their places (generally jána- √yat) is
ordinarily Mitra’s duty not Varuṇa’s, these closely linked gods trade off qualities.
That there is no simile marker is not surprising; gods are often equated directly with
other gods when they perform the others’ functions. See, e.g., the series of
identifications of Agni with other gods in II.1.
V.49 All Gods

### 49.1  
As noted in the publ. intro., the first hemistich seems to pick up the last one
of the previous hymn (48.5cd), where Bhaga and Savitar are identified as the givers
of desirable things. Āyu is always a somewhat mysterious figure in the RV, and in
this case it is difficult to tell whether the gen. āyóḥ dependent on rátnam (also in 2d)
is in possessive or indirect object use -- that is, are the two gods distributing treasure
to Āyu or Āyu’s treasure to others. Ge seems to opt for the former, Re and WG the
latter. In this case, the end of the last hymn may be helpful: V.48.5cd ná tasya vidma
… yáto bhágaḥ savitā́dā́ti vā́ryam “We do not know that from which Bhaga and
Savitar will give what is choice.” The ablatival yátaḥ ‘from which’ indicates the
source from which they will acquire what they then distribute. If 49.1 is in some way
responsive to this, āyóḥ should likewise indicate the source not the recipient of the
treasure.
In the 2nd hemistich I tr. the vocc. narā purubhujā … aśvinā as if acc., to avoid
extra fuss.

### 49.2  
The standard tr. construe vidvā́n with prayā́ṇam ásurasya (e.g., Ge “'Der
Ausfahrt des Asura gewärtig,” with a slightly odd rendering of vidvā́n, perhaps
because he construes it with práti?). But pāda-final vidvā́n, which is quite common,
is generally used absolutely, without an object (and tmesis would be unusual, though
not unprecedented, with a participle). The absolute usage would be reinforced by
likewise pāda-final vijānán ‘discerning’ in c; the two participles define the subject as
a sagacious and perceptive poet/sacrificer.
The referent of the acc. sg. adj. jyéṣṭham is entirely ambiguous: it can be neut.
and modify rátnam or masc. and modify vibhájantam. Since jyéṣṭha- ‘distinguished,
pre-eminent’ is used of both animates and inanimates, there is no way to tell -- and
the decision hardly matters. More interesting is the ca in d, which must link the
phrase jyéṣṭham … rátnaṃ vibhájantam āyóḥ, which refers to Bhaga (see 1b), with a
97
gapped Savitar, who, though present in pāda b and conjoined with Bhaga in 1ab, is
not found in the clause in 2cd. See Klein DGRV 127.

### 49.3  
The hapax adatrayā́is universally taken as an adverbial instr. built to a fem.
*adatrā- with the meaning ‘ohne Geschenk empfangen zu haben’ (Gr), ‘ohne ein
(Gegen)geschenk zu verlangen’ (Ge), ‘nicht geschenkweise’ (AiG III.76), etc. But
the morphology rests on very little (there is no independent fem. -ā stem), and, so
interpreted, the word is also hard to make sense of. If it means ‘in a nongiving/distributing fashion’, it is immediately contradicted by the statement that the
gods do distribute good things (dayate vā́ryāṇi). To make it work somewhat better,
most interpr. sneak in the notion of counter-gift: that is, the gods distribute good
things without expectation of getting something in return. But this hardly fits the
Vedic conceptual universe any better. Gods don’t selflessly hand out “free gifts”;
they expect praise and oblations in return. This is, after all, the reciprocal
arrangement that the whole RV rests on! I therefore suggest an entirely different
analysis of the word, as adatra-yā́-, a root noun cmpd. with √yā ‘travel, drive’ as 2nd
member, hence ‘traveling to those (so far) without gifts’. The accent is correct for
such a cmpd. We need a nom. sg. with underlying final -s, but *-yā́s in sandhi would
yield the -yā́found in the passage, so only the Pp. would need emendation. The cmpd.
would refer to the standard journey of gods to the sacrifice, bringing goods to
distribute to the sacrificers; note the presence of the same root √yā in prayā́ṇam
‘advance’ in the preceding vs. 2a, referring to the same advent of the god(s) at the
sacrifice.
As noted in the publ. intro., the vs. seems to refer to the distribution of
dakṣiṇās, a ritual event that in RVic times happened at the dawn sacrifice (as here:
vásta usráḥ), not at the Midday Pressing as in classical śrauta ritual.
This phrase vásta usráḥ is found 3 other times, all pāda final, with the other
three occurrences (IV.25.2, VII.69.5, VIII.46.26; cf. also VI.3.6 vasta usrā́ḥ)
containing usrā́ḥ. Although Gr classifies vásta as the 3rd sg. med. pres. of √vas ‘wear’
(that is, pausal form váste; so Pp.), it is clear from the phraseology that it must
belong with √vas ‘dawn’, and is most likely a form of the loc. to vástu- ‘dawning’;
see AiG III.153–54 with lit. cited there. I do not entirely understand the mechanism
that produced the form we have, and in fact several different pathways have been
suggested. Wackernagel simply attributes it to shortening of -ā in *vástā usr… <
*vástāvusr…, but I find the shortening hard to motivate. Others (e.g., Oldenberg)
suggest that it rests on a u-stem loc. sg. *-av / -o, which would yield the sequence
directly, but at the cost of positing an alternative loc. sg. ending with little or no
support.

### 49.4  
The standard tr. supply a verb (such as ‘grant’) in pāda a, but this seems
unnecessary. The clause can be an equational expression; gods are called upon to be
várūtham ‘defense’ elsewhere: cf. I.59.8 bhávā várūthaṃ grṇ̥ até ... (Agni); sim.
VII.32.7 (Indra), VIII.67.3.
98

### 49.5  
There is no overt referent in the main clause (c) for the yé in ab, but ‘they’
(namely the poet/sacrificers) are clearly to be the beneficiaries of the good actions in
c, who, in d, appear in the 1st ps.
V.50 All Gods
As often, the poet embellishes a fairly simple message by playing with
personal reference, cycling through all three persons in very short compass. See the
disc. in the publ. intro. as well as more details in the comm. on individual vss. below.

### 50.1  
The vs. (and hymn) opens cleverly: the 1st two words are víśvo devásya, and
until we encounter the genitive ending on the 2nd word, we expect the “every god”
that would be appropriate to an All God hymn. Instead, the 2nd pāda opens with the
real referent of víśvaḥ, namely the polar opposite of ‘god’, mártaḥ ‘mortal’.
On iṣudhyati see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming article “Vedic iṣudhyáand Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” In the course of re-examining
the members of this word family, I have somewhat changed my interpr. of this
passage. In the publ. tr. I take “wealth” as the target or goal of iṣudhyati ‘aims at’;
however, insofar as the Vedic and Avestan verbs express the target, it is in the acc.
(see VIII.69.2), and it is the divine recipient of praise, not the desired countergift to
the praise. The Pp. interpr. rāyá as dat. rāyé, which is neither the desired case nor the
desired goal. It would be possible to read it as acc. pl. rāyáḥ ‘riches’, which could be
an acc. goal (“everyone desires riches”), but since this still deviates from the
preferred expression with iṣudhyá-, I now prefer to supply “god Leader” as the goal,
with dat. rāyé expression what we hope for in return: “Everyone aims (praise) (at
god Leader) for wealth.”
Pādas b and d both contain a 3rd sg. mid. to √vṛ ‘choose’, in the same metrical
position and with the same metrical shape: root aor. vurīta and 9th cl. pres. vṛṇīta.
The first is clearly an optative, though it has a somewhat unexpected shape and is
quite rare (only twice in the RV); its unusual root syllable (vur < *uṛ̯H; expect *ur as
in part. urāṇá-) is found elsewhere only in hotṛ-vū́rya- (2x, with pre-C outcome).
The second, vṛṇīta, is formally ambiguous: it can be an optative parallel to vurīta, as
I have taken it (so also at least Re), or simply an injunctive. I would suggest that the
poet first deploys the rare but unambiguously optative vurīta to set the modal tone
and then uses the more common vṛṇīta as its morphological parallel. But it would of
course be possible to argue that the poet wishes to contrast the two modalities; so I
interpr. Ge.

### 50.2  
As discussed in the publ. intro., this vs. effects a transition from the
undefined 3rd ps. sg. “every mortal” (víśvaḥ … mártaḥ) of vs. 1 to a 1st ps. pl.
referring to us. This has been definitively accomplished by pāda d, which opens with
the finite 1st pl. sácemahi ‘may we be accompanied’, but earlier in the vs. this plural
is carried by the insistent masc. nom. pl. pronominal forms té … yé … té … té. These
forms invite a 3rd plural reading (“they … who … they … they”): although the sá/tám
pronoun is capable of having both 1st and 2nd ps. reference, 3rd ps. is the default. The
99
first 3 pādas of the vs. cleverly avoid forcing the reference by using predicated dative
infinitives (anuśáse … āpṛ́ce), which leave the person unfixed, rather than finite
verbs, which would force such a reading of the person. The poet draws attention to
his syntactic modulation through the singsong effect of té te de(va) …, yé ca … / té
(rāyā́) té (hí āpṛ́)ce, sáce(mahi) saca(thíyaiḥ).
The syntax is further complicated by the parenthetical expression embedded
in pāda c, té hy ā̀pṛ́ce.
The thematic continuity with vs. 1, despite the fancy referential footwork, is
emphasized by d sácemahi sacathyaìḥ, which echoes sakhyám in 1b.

### 50.3  
The reference-shifting game continues here and also pulls in some polarized
lexical choices. The 1st pl. of vs. 2 becomes the 2nd pl. of the impv. in 3b daśasyata
‘[you all,] show favor’, but a trace of the 1st pl. is left in the enclitic naḥ ‘our, for us’
in 3a. This is the familiar scenario whereby the poet addresses his fellow officiants in
the 2nd pl., urging them to do something on behalf of ‘us’ -- with ‘you’ and ‘us’
coreferential but distinguished pragmatically.
Although the identity of the addressees -- the officiants -- and the recipients of
their favor -- the gods and their wives -- is ultimately clear, the lexicon complicates
this interpr. The verb daśasyá- generally has a god or gods as its subj. and a mortal
(vel sim.) as its obj., often naḥ (e.g., VI.11.6 daśasyā́naḥ purvaṇīka hotaḥ “Be
favorable to us, o Hotar of many faces [=Agni]”). Here we must reverse the verbal
arguments. The 1st object in the 1st pāda, nṝ́n is ambiguous: although it of course
means ‘man’ (or ‘superior man’), it is frequently used of gods as well as mortals; it
would be possible to interpr. naḥ … nṝ́n as ‘us men’, rather than taking naḥ as a
genitive (as I and the standard interpr. do). What helps clinch the divine reference is
the 2nd acc. in that pāda, átithīn ‘guests’. This is the only pl. form of this stem in the
RV; the sg. forms are exclusively used of Agni, thus skewing the word towards the
divine, and of course the model of the sacrifice as guest-reception for the visiting
gods is always conceptually present.
The presence of the gods’ wives, pátnīḥ, in b may allude to the shadowy “God
Leader” (devá- netár-) who opens (vss. 1–2) and closes (vs. 5) this hymn, since an
agent noun to the same root √nī ‘lead’, namely néṣṭar-, is the leader of the wives of
the gods and, later, of the sacrificer’s wife in classical śrauta ritual.

### 50.4  
This vs. is quite obscure, but seems metaphorically to depict the soma
sacrifice. The problems are, as usual, conpounded by the fact that the two (or one?)
principal actor(s) are not identified. Interpr. of the vs. differ, and I will not discuss
them all in detail.
In the first hemistich I take the draft animal (váhniḥ … paśúḥ) to be soma, as
often; the adj. dróṇya- ‘belonging to/seeking the dróṇa’ seems to clinch this, since
dróṇa is always the soma cup. The action depicted is the standard flowing of the
soma towards and into the soma vessels, regularly conceived as a (male) animal
running (here √dru) to a goal. The verb dudrávat is a pf. subj.; as I have established
100
elsewhere (García Ramón Fs.), pf. subjunctives are simply subjunctives in value,
with a future (not a future perfect) sense.
I take the 2nd hemistich as the main clause construed with the dependent yátra
clause in ab. Its predicate is the agent noun sánitā lit. ‘winner’. Because of the futurevalue subjunctive in the dep. clause, sánitā looks to me like a good prospect for a
periphrastic future use of the agent noun (so, it seems, Ge; contra Tichy, 229: “Wo
sich … beeilen wird, gewinnt …” [my italics]).
The subject in cd is, in my opinion, Indra. The adj. nṛmáṇas- ‘manly minded’
is used most often of him, and of course it is Indra for whom the soma is destined.
vīrá-pastya- is a hapax, but it seems a bahuvrīhi of the type vájra-bāhu- ‘having an
arm with a mace in it’, hence ‘having a house with heroes in it’, presumably referring
to both divine and mortal warriors that Indra can muster in battle -- his household.
The first two words in the last pāda, árṇā dhī́reva, are problematic, the 2nd
more than the first. For árṇā we must assume a neuter substantivization (‘flood[s]’)
of the adj. árṇa- ‘flooding, undulating’, here in the pl. Given its sandhi position it
could in principle instead represent árṇās, a feminine substantivization; since árṇaseveral times modifies fem. áp- ‘waters’, this might work better -- but it makes it
harder to explain the difficult dhī́rā, which is most easily taken also as a neut. pl.
These floods are surely the floods of soma that are racing in the first half-verse.
As just noted, the simile dhī́reva [= dhīrā / iva] is problematic. It is tempting
to take it as dhī́raḥ with irregular sandhi (so Roth; see Old), but this is of course not a
legitimate interpretational technique. It is also tempting to leave it untranslated, as
Ge does. Sāy. takes it as a fem. nom. sg., but who would this wise woman be? Ge
considers the possibility of an instr. sg., but not seriously enough to tr. it so.
Reluctantly, with a similarly reluctant Old, I take it as a neut. pl., meaning ‘wise
(thoughts)’. This is unsatisfying because the adj. dhī́ra- otherwise only refers to
animates. There are partial parallels for √san with thoughts/wisdom as obj., e.g.,
IX.9.9 sánā medhā́m, X.143.3 síṣāsataṃ dhíyaḥ, but not with dhī́ra-. A possibly more
promising interpr. is suggested by Re, who points out that the only other neut. form
of dhī́ra- is found with janū́ṃṣi ‘races’ in VII.86.1; this also seems to underlie
Tichy’s “wie verständige (Wesen).” I would now emend the publ. tr. to “… like the
wise (races).” This isn’t a great deal better, but it at least deals with the problem of
animate/inanimate.

### 50.5  
As all comm. remark, the meter in pāda b is flawed. Curiously enough, the
other two occurrences of ráthaspátiḥ (in the closely related X.64.10, 93.7) are also
found in metrically wanting pādas—each missing a syllable— as Old notes. The
metrical problem may (or may not) be connected with the morphological anomaly in
this cmpd.: the 1st member ráthas- to the extremely well-attested thematic stem
rátha-. We would of course expect *rátha-páti-, but the problem with this form
emerges immediately on constructing it: 4 light syllables. On this form and similarly
anomalous hapax ṛtas-pati- (VIII.26.21; voc., so unaccented) see Wackernagel’s
rather elliptical treatment (AiG II.1.241, 246–67), where he classifies the two forms
with gen. páti- cmpds, without explaining how he analyzes the -as forms
101
morphologically. I would suggest that the putative, metrically difficult form with
stem as first member was “fixed” by analogy to the common genitival -páti- cmpds
to athematic noun stems (or opaque ones), most esp. bṛ́haspáti-, which is very
common and phonologically similar. However, this does not address the metrical
problem. Arnold (101) suggests reading *ráthasas, which fixes the meter but at the
high cost of inventing an s-stem to rátha-, which makes no sense derivationally
(rightly rejected by Old). Old attributes the metrical disturbance to “laxe metrische
Praxis,” which is, at best, a description, not an explanation. I do not think ráthasrepresents an archaic gen. form—all the less so since it’s not clear that the form was
correctly transmitted. In any case, Old considers the ráthaspáti- a divine being of
some sort; the “Lord of the Chariot” here joins another very marginal figure, God
Leader. ráthaspáti- is found with Bhaga elsewhere (X.64.10, 93.7), and such an
association would fit the emphasis on ‘wealth’ (rayí-) in b and c.
The forms iṣastútaḥ and devastútaḥ in d and e can either be nom. pl. root noun
agentive cmpds or acc. pl. tatpuruṣa action nouns (both with 2nd member -stú-t-); see
Scar 636–7. Although most interpr. (Ge, Re, WG) opt for the former, I have chosen
the latter, on the basis of a number of passages in V where a praise song (vel sim.) is
the obj. of manāmahe: V.13.2 agné stómam manāmahe, V.35.8 diví stómam
manāmahe, V.66.3 ... suṣṭutím ... stómair manāmahe; also VII.82.10 devásya ślókaṃ
savitúr manāmahe.
V.51 All Gods
On the structure of this composite hymn, see publ. intro. It is bland and
featureless throughout, reminding us that there must have been a lot of mediocre
Rigvedic poets and/or ritual occasions that did not require (or pay for) the best of
what the poets had to offer.

### 51.1  
The eponymous phrase víśvaiḥ … devaíḥ opens successive pādas here (b, c),
but the adj. is in fact more narrowly construed with immediately following ū́mebhiḥ.
This is rather like (or, rather, opposite to) the manipulation of the phrase in vs. 1 of
the preceding hymn (50.1).

### 51.3  
On the basis of VIII.38.7 prātaryā́vabhiḥ ... devébhiḥ I construe those two
instr. most closely together.

### 51.4  
On the loc. camū́see AiG III.188.
V.51.5-10: These next 6 vss. are in Uṣṇih, divided into 3 (vss. 5–7) and 3 (vss. 8–10)
by their refrains: abhí práyaḥ# of 5–7 and the full-pāda ā́yāhy agne atrivát suté raṇa
of 8–10. In fact vss. 8–10 are rigidly -- and boringly -- structured, with each of the
first two pādas containing a form of sajū́ḥ ‘jointly’ and as many god-name
instrumentals as can be fit in.
102

### 51.5  
This vs. begins the second hymn in this conglomeration. Note that it repeats
pāda-final havyádātaye from 1c, and the infinitive at the end of its first pāda, vītáye,
rhymes with pītáye at the end of 1a.
V.51.11–15: Considered by Old to be an Anhang even to this set of appended hymns.
Its lexical hero is svastí-, a form of which appears in every pāda between 11a and
15a. The poet seems to be trying to show how many different syntactic constructions
he can plug svastí- into. Unfortunately this is not sufficient to hold our attention.

### 51.11  
anarváṇaḥ receives far more attention than I think it deserves. See esp. Old.
However, now see the abundant references to my own comments on the various
anarvá(n)(a)- stems in the lexical commentary index.

### 51.12  
My tr. of ab differs from the standard, which take bhúvanasya yás pátiḥ as a
rel. cl. limiting sómam. Since the acc. of the god name seems to correlate with “call
upon for well-being (svastáye),” and the rel. cl. is preceded by svastí, which is found
as acc. in the “establish/mete out well-being,” I supply “mete out” here and take the
rel. cl. as the subject without overt antecedent.

### 51.12  
Bṛhaspati’s “whole flock” (bv. sárva-gaṇa-) may refer to the Aṅgirases. In
any case note sárva- rather than the older víśva-, esp. notable in a Viśve Devāḥ hymn
(though víśve devā́ḥ opens the next vs.).
## 52 Maruts
The pattern of the mention of the Maruts’ name in this hymn is worth noting:
it might be called a “versified paradigm” (à la I.1) with a hole in it. The various
oblique forms of the plural stem marút- are densely clustered at the beginning of the
hymn: instr. marúdbhiḥ (1b), gen. marútām (3c), loc. marútsu (4a), dat. marúdbhyaḥ
(5d), and acc. marútaḥ (6d) -- each oblique case represented (if abl. is lumped with
dat.), each once only. In addition there are three forms of the vṛddhied mā́rutam in
the neut. acc. sg. later in the hymn (8a, 13c, 14a). However, though these gods are
frequently referred to in the nom. pl. in the hymn, beginning with yé in 1c, and once
in the voc. (dhṛṣṇavaḥ 14c), there are no forms of the nom. marútaḥ or the voc.
márutaḥ / marutaḥ, although these are the most common forms of this stem in the
RV. After the paradigm has been established in the early part of the hymn (1–6),
there are no further occurrences of the simple stem in the 11 remaining vss. (7–17),
only the three vṛddhi forms. I don’t know what, if anything, to make of this, but it
does not seem by chance.
On the responsions and ring-compositional structure of vss. 1–5, see the publ.
intro. and my “Poetic ‘Repair’ in the Rig Veda” (2006: 133–36), as well as The
Rigveda between Two Worlds (2007: 112–13). The responsions and the versified
paradigm are most likely related; as I argue in “Poetic ‘Repair’” the instr. in the
phrase árcā marúdbhiḥ … in vs. 1 is somewhat anomalous, but it is “repaired” by the
substitution of the expected dat. in 5d … arcā marúdbhyaḥ. To summarize those
103
discussions briefly, in a hymn devoted to the Maruts, beginning with the selfexhortation of the poet “chant forth,” we might expect the Maruts to be the recipients
(dat.) of the chant, not, as it seems, fellow-chanters (instr.) with the human poet. But
putting them in the instr. emphasizes an important part of their profile, that they are
also known to chant, a feature that is alluded to by the hemistich-final adj. ṛ́kvabhiḥ
‘possessing the chant’. Thus the beginning of the hymn seems concerned with the
Maruts’ contrastive and mediating functional roles as expressed by the oblique cases
of the paradigm.

### 52.1  
On the somewhat anomalous expression in the first hemistich, see reff. given
just above.
The 2nd hemistich is also syntactically somewhat compromised. Forms of
uncompounded √mad that mean ‘take pleasure in / enjoy’ seldom if ever (possibly
VII.49.4) take the acc. (as also noted by Re), in preference to instr., gen., or loc.; yet
mádanti here seems to take acc. śrávaḥ as obj. It might be possible to extract ánu
from the cmpd anuṣvadhám ‘according to their own nature’ and construe it with
mádanti, since ánu √mad ‘cheer on’ does take an acc. -- but a personal acc., not the
neut. inanimate ‘fame’ that it would govern here. So an unresolvable syntactic
tension has been set up. I think the tension reflects the double role of the Maruts
already encountered in pāda b. As recipients of Śyāvāśva’s praise chant, they would
“take pleasure in their fame,” but as participants in the chanting they would “cheer
on” the fame of other(s).
Ge and Re seem to take adroghám as an adv., a possibility also mentioned by
WG. However, the other apparent adv. form has initial accent (ádrogham VIII.60.4),
and furthermore the existence of a bahuvrīhi ádrogha-vāc- (2x) and the syntagm
adroghá- vácas- (III.14.6) support a collocation with semantically similar śrávas-.

### 52.2  
It is not clear why the rel. cl. of ab contains sánti, as the clause seems a
simple equational one (“since they are comrades”), and such clauses generally lack
an overt copula. Ge takes dhṛṣṇuyā́as a predication with sánti, as, it seems, do WG.
This is in principle appealing, but given that we get untethered adv. dhṛṣnuyā́in the
previous and following vss. (1a, 4b) and a similar equational (rel.) cl. in 13ab (yé …
kaváyaḥ sánti “who are poets,” it does not seem compelling.
Ge takes dhṛṣadvínaḥ as acc. pl. with śáśvataḥ, but he seems isolated in this
interpr., starting from Sāy., who takes it as the nom. pl. that otherwise universally
prevails.

### 52.3  
As Ge points out, the verb áti √skand ‘spring across/beyond’ is reminiscent
of ádhi √skand, which refers to sexual mounting. He supplies a parenthetical “(auf
die Kühe)” in the simile (so also Re), and I would now also do so: “they spring
across the nights, as streaming bulls spring (upon cows).”
The meaning ‘night’ for the rare and etymologically unclear (see EWA s.v.;
also WG n., with more confidence in the etym.) śárvarī- seems established by later
Vedic and MIA evidence, but I do not know why the word appears in this passage. A
104
fem. word for night is necessary to make the implicit sexual pun work, but the better
attested rā́trī- is of course also fem. It somewhat responds phonologically to likewise
pāda-final śáśvataḥ in 3b, and it therefore might form a web, along with syand(rā́saḥ)
… ṣkand(anti) earlier in the hemistich -- but the phonological connections seem too
slight. Maybe Śyāvāśva just likes words that begin with his initial.
I am not certain what image is being conveyed. Ge suggests that the Maruts’
storms calm down at night and then take on renewed energy in the morning, but the
two passages he adduces don’t seem to support that interpr. Moreover, ‘spring
across/beyond’ seems to me the opposite of what Ge envisions: it’s a vigorous action
not a relaxation into tranquility. I tentatively suggest that it refers to the fact that
thunderstorms (or, rather, the associated lightning flashes) are especially visible at
night and appear to streak across the dark sky.

### 52.5  
This is the vs. in which the problematic instr. of 1b is resolved -- “repaired” -
- but, as discussed in my 2006 paper, the poet produces a new conundrum, though
this one can be, as it were, pre-repaired. The obj. yajñám ‘sacrifice’ is unexpected
with the verb prá … arcā ‘chant forth’; we expect a verbal product as object. But the
yajñám here is picking up the conjoined phrase stómaṃ yajñáṃ ca of 4b, whose
stómam would be an appropriate obj. of prá … arcā.

### 52.6  
This vs. is in Paṅkti; that is, it contains five 8-syllable pādas rather than the
four of Anuṣṭubh, otherwise the meter of the hymn until the end, where the final two
vss. are also in Paṅkti. Here the slight shift in meter seems to mark a boundary: on
the one hand it brings the versified paradigm to a close, with the acc. marútaḥ in d;
on the other it announces the advent of the gods with their storms and inaugurates the
descriptive passages that dominate the remainder of the hymn.
The first pāda lacks a verb; Ge makes a valiant effort to construe asṛkṣata of b
with pāda a as well, in two different senses (see his n. 6; ‘… sind … herangesprengt’
for a, ‘haben … geschleudert’ for b), but the former would be a unique sense for ā́
√sṛj. Gr also invents a unique sense ‘decorate X with Y’ to allow the two pādas to be
construed as a single construction. To avoid such ad hoc contrivances it seems best to
follow Old in supplying a verb of motion with the insistent ā́in pāda a.
The adj. that begins pāda b, ṛśvā́(ḥ), can be either acc. pl. fem. modifying ṛṣṭī́ḥ
‘spears’ (so Gr, apparently also WG) or nom. pl. masc. modifying nára(ḥ) ‘men’.
The pāda break preceding it might favor the former interpr., but 13a, where the
Maruts are definitely called ṛṣvā́(ḥ), favors the latter, esp. since the Maruts are also
ṛṣvá- elsewhere (e.g., I.64.2). Note that in 13a the adj. is also followed by ‘spear’, but
safely bound in a cmpd: ṛṣvā́ṛṣṭívidyutaḥ; this bahuvrīhi ‘whose spears are lightning
flashes’ combines the independent words ṛṣṭī́ḥ and vidyútaḥ of our vs. (pādas b and c
respectively) and enforces their identity. This resolution in 13a of the ambiguity of
6ab can be seen as another example of “repair.” Partly because the poet seems to be
drawing attention to the phrase by resolving it in 13a I am now inclined to take
ṛṣvā́(ḥ) in 6b with both of its possible referents and emend the tr. to “the lofty men
have launched their spears aloft.” It would be one of the reasonably many examples
105
where a grammatically ambiguous descripter is positioned exactly between its two
possible referents.
The hapax fem. part. jájjhatīḥ ‘giggling’ is, of course, phonologically quite
striking. As discussed by Hoffmann (Aufs. 306 and n. 3 = KZ 83 [1969]), the form is
based on the redupl. pres. to √has ‘laugh’ with a Middle Indic (“dialectal”)
development of the cluster *gh-s (rather than the expected -kṣ- found in the masc.
part. to the same redupl. pres. jákṣat- in I.33.7). The use of such a phonologically
exotic word is reminiscent of the equally exotic akhkhalī- in the frog hymn
(VII.103.3). The latter, as Thieme has convincingly argued, is an importation from
pedagogical discourse, conducted for young boys in a preform of Middle Indic. Our
form here seems adopted from vernacular “women’s language” and brings a whiff of
family life: little girls running after their brothers or parents with little-girl giggles --
a life that would, of course, be conducted in a vernacular (pre-) Middle Indic.
Pāda e has several parallels, given by Ge in his n. 6e. The question in our
passage is whether diváḥ is gen., as I’ve taken it (so also Ge and somewhat
differently Re), or abl. (“The radiance arose ... from heaven”; so WG). The parallels
cut both ways: V.25.8 svānó arta tmánā divaḥ and VII.34.7 úd asya śúṣmād bhānúr
nā́rta seem to favor an abl. interpr., but IV.1.17 úd devyā́uṣáso bhānúr arta a
genitive. In the end, I don’t think the choice materially affects the sense of the
passage: whether the radiance is ‘of heaven’ or ‘from heaven’ the result is pretty
much the same.

### 52.7  
This vs. consists of a single rel. cl. (yé … yé) with no main cl. It is most
probably preposed to vs. 8 with its correlative the neut. sg. śárdho mā́rutam “the
Marut troop,” despite the mismatch in number and gender. The end of vs. 6 has no
reference to the Maruts, and, as I noted above, it serves as a boundary vs. The same
structure with number disharmony envisaged here across pāda boundary (7a yé …, b
yé … // 8a śárdho mā́rutam …) is found, more clearly, within a vs. in 13: 13a yé … /
13c tám … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám …, perhaps another example of repair.
The usual tripartite division of the cosmos (earth, midspace, heaven) is here
complicated by the intrusion of a fourth, “the precinct of the rivers” (vṛjánanadī́nām). Re also notes this, but suggests that c does nothing but “enjoliver”
(embellish) a -- that is, that the rivers are a variant of the earth. In a basic sense he is
correct, but I would add that what we have here may be the clash of two formulaic
expressions of contrastive geographic totality -- the standard tripartite model and one,
barely attested, in which a nearer or lower vṛjána- is contrasted with something more
distant. Cf. esp. I.101.8 (with mention of the Maruts) yád vā marutvaḥ paramé
sadhásthe, yád vāvamé vrjáne m ̥ ādayasva, a bipartite phrase where a seat (sadhásthaas here) that is paramá- ‘high/distant’ is contrasted with avamé vṛjáne
‘lowest/nearest enclosure’; a vṛjána- is similarly ávare in II.24.11. Thus, though pāda
c may refer to the same general geographical location as a, namely earth, it also
evokes a paired, rather than tripartite, contrast like that in I.101.8 just cited.
The pf. injunc. 3rd pl. vāvṛdhánta (see Kü 471) is attested several times
elsewhere and manifestly belongs to a redupl. stem. It is worth noting, however, that
106
the poet seems to be playing with its long reduplication. The vā is positioned exactly
where we would expect vā ‘or’ to be (Wackernagel’s position: #yé vāvṛdhánta …),
anticipating the two vā’s in pādas c and d, also in Wackernagel’s position. I am not
suggesting a re-segmentation as vā vṛdhánta, simply pointing to Śyāvāśva’s penchant
for verbal play and for making single forms do double duty. To extend this analysis,
note the beginning of pāda b, ya urā́v …, with ā́v that could be taken as a metathesis
of vā.
V.52.8–9: I don't understand the force of utá sma, which opens 8c and 9a, with utá
opening 9c. Klein (DGRV I.416–17) says that they introduce parallel statements
about the Maruts and represent “concatenation across the stanza-boundary,” halfway
between intrastanzaic and interstanzaic usage. But the role of sma, whatever it may
be, seems downplayed in this description.

### 52.8  
Ge takes syandrā́(ḥ) as acc. pl. fem. and supplies antelopes as the obj. of
yujata. This is not impossible, but syandrā́(ḥ) was already used of the Maruts in 3a
(cf. also V.87.3).

### 52.9  
The phrase páruṣṇyām ū́rṇā vasata is similar to IV.22.2 páruṣṇīm uṣámāṇa
ū́rṇām, but while in the latter páruṣṇīm modifies ‘wool’, here it must be a loc. sg.
The ‘wool’ in both passages is best understood as a metaphor for ‘foam’. The stem
páruṣṇī- is the fem. corresponding to paruṣá- ‘gray’. It is also a river name,
presumably so called because it is covered with grayish foam. For disc. see Old,
Hoffmann (Aufs. 333–35 [=Die Sprache 1974]). The mediating image in this picture
is provided by śundhyávaḥ; I follow Thieme (KZ 79 [1965] = Kl Sch. 219ff.) in
interpr. this form as ‘preening [waterbird]’ (to √śudh ‘clean’). As pointed out in the
publ. intro., the density of imagery is remarkable: the Maruts swathed in clouds (not
explicitly mentioned) are compared to birds in a river covered with foam, with the
foam (again not explicit) characterized as wool.
The instr. sg. pavyā́to the masc. stem paví- shows the older -ā ending, which
becomes limited to fem. -i-stems when the masc./ neut. adopt -inā.

### 52.10  
The first half-vs. consists of fanciful names of the individual Maruts (never
otherwise named), summed up with the instr. phrase etébhiḥ … nā́mabhiḥ “with
these names” in c. The rest of the second hemistich is unclear, however, primarily
because the formal identity and meaning of ohate are disputed. The former issue is
the easier to solve: though Gr identifies the verb as a 3rd sg. and Re hesitates, it must
be a 3rd pl. to the root pres. (of √oh/uh) (see EWA s.v. OH and esp. Narten [Kl Sch.
98–100 =1969]). The basis for considering it a 3rd sg. is the Pp’s interpr. of viṣṭārá as
nom. sg. viṣṭāráḥ, but a loc. sg. in -é is equally possible. It is highly unlikely that
ohate would be 3rd singular in 10d but 3rd plural in 11a, b, as Gr, for ex., takes them.
The questions then are who is the subj. and how does the verb fit with the rest of the
material in the half-verse. Most interpr. take yajñám as the obj. and tr. “praise the
sacrifice,” with either the Maruts or unidentified priests/poets as subj. This is not
107
impossible, but given the two ohate in the next vs., which lack objects (unless yajñám
is supplied, so, e.g., Gr), I prefer to seek a consistent interpr. of the verb forms. The
root is used on a number of occasions as a passive ‘be lauded’ / reflexive ‘vaunt
oneself’ (cf., e.g., V.30.6, VIII.5.39). Here I take the Maruts as subject and the names
in ab to be the verbal content of the Maruts’ vaunt. (Note that the threefold repetition
of ohate here is matched by the three occurrences of vocanta in vs. 16, also with the
Maruts as subj.) Under this interpr. the dat. máhyam, which is problematic in most
interpr., expresses the verbal recipient of the boast. This leaves yajñám viṣṭāré. For
most interpr. the latter word characterizes the Maruts as they come to the sacrifice --
e.g., Ge ‘in breiter Schar’. Again, not impossible. However, the root √stṛ ‘strew’ is
almost always closely associated with the ritual, esp. with the strewing of the barhis,
and I suggest that viṣṭāré is a infinitival locative that takes verbal rection, hence “at
the bestrewing of the sacrifice.” However, I realize that this interpr. has some
problems: -stāré is an unlikely infinitival form, and √stṛ doesn’t elsewhere take
yajñám as object. Moreover, one nominal form of ví √stṛ, namely viṣṭíraḥ in II.13.10,
does seem to have spatial force (JPB ‘far-flung’). I don’t have a good solution.

### 52.11  
My interpr. of this vs. follows from that of 10 and diverges from those of
others. By my interpr. the nom. plurals are further names the Maruts call themselves,
shown most clearly by the íti ending pāda c. Most interpr. take c with d, syntactically
and semantically divorced from ab -- e.g., Klein (DGRV II.102–3, closely flg. Ge)
“(And) the men proclaim it (as worthy) and (their) teams proclaim (it so), and
wondrous (are their) forms, worthy of being seen, (of whom they say,) “(They are)
from the distance.” But the ádhā’s that open pādas a, b, and c impose, or at least beg
for, a parallel interpr. of the three pādas, esp. with the íti closing the last, and the
parenthetical “(of whom they say)” is ad hoc, generated only from the íti of c.
One of the problems not mentioned by the standard interpr. is the intrusive ní
in pāda a. The verb √uh does not otherwise occur with this preverb, and since ohate
is surrounded by identical forms without preverb (10d, 11b) it seems unlikely that
only the middle one would have the preverb. It might be loosely inspired by the ni in
niyúta(ḥ) in b, but Śyāvāśva does not seem the type of poet to throw in verbal
fragments without function. I suggest rather that it continues but varies the naming
pattern of 10ab with PREV-pathi-, here with the ní a very minimalist predication of
náraḥ “men down.”

### 52.12  
This vs. bristles with difficulties. The first to present itself is the hapax
kubhanyú-. There are several competing interpr. of this word, though Ge refuses to tr.
it at all. Re tr. “voués à un rite communiel,” which he derives from Benveniste (BSL
52 [1956] 11–12 [not yet seen by me]), who connected it with Ossetic material: see
KEWA III.676; the Ossetic connection was disputed by Szemerényi; see KEWA ref.
and EWA s.v., and seems in principle farfetched. Another, going back to Neisser (see
EWA s.v.) and followed by Scar (640) and WG, is ‘yelling, shouting’, from √bhan
‘speak’, with the pejorative prefix ku-. (Remmer [Frauennamen, p. 48] also follows
this basic analysis, but takes the ku- in positive sense: “welche Redner!” hence
108
“wortgewaltig.”) More likely is an analysis stemming ultimately from Sāy.’s
udakecchavaḥ (see Ge’s n. 12a “Wasser wünschend”). Ge cites similarly formed
udanyávaḥ ‘water seeking’ in nearby V.54.2, 57.1 (latter also has an útsa-
‘wellspring’ as here). The Kubhā river also figures in this Marut cycle, in the next
hymn V.53.9 in a list of river names. A derived adj. *kubhā-yú- ‘seeking the Kubhā’
can easily have been formed. Given the common interchange of -ā-yá/ú- and -anyá/ú- derivatives (type vṛṣāyá-, vṛṣaṇyá-), *kubhāyú- could have been reformed as
kubhanyú-, esp. under the influence of udanyú-; see also iṣaṇyata in 14d. Here it can
mean either ‘seeking the Kubhā River’ or ‘seeking water’ more generally. Since their
goal in the following pāda is a wellspring (útsam), seeking some sort of water source
makes good sense in the passage.
The meaning of the word kīrí(n)- is disputed, with the two leading contenders
‘bard’ and ‘weak, poor’. The former, the only sense given by Gr, seems to be
currently in the ascendancy after eclipse -- e.g., KEWA glosses it only as ‘gering,
niedrig, arm’, but EWA as ‘Dichter, Lobsänger’, with ‘weak’ banished to the small
print -- perhaps because it is easier to etymologize (√kṝ ‘celebrate’). But the contexts,
esp. the fact that it is regularly followed by cid ‘even’ and often refers to a person
receiving divine aid despite his condition, favor the latter. See also my brief disc. in
Hyenas (251-52). The sense ‘weak, poor’ fits our context less well, since the Maruts
are powerful and outfitted with enough bling to make them rich. But if ‘weak’ can be
interpreted as ‘lightweight, light on their feet’, it can work: the Maruts are dancing to
the wellspring. Another issue is the status of the stem kīrín- to which this form is
assigned. The only other forms possibly belonging to this stem are 3 instr. sg. kīríṇā
(I.100.9, V.4.10, 40.8), but they can also of course belong to the reasonably wellattested simple i-stem kīrí-. Mehendale (“Two Vedic Notes: (1) kīrín?” BSOAS
1974: 670–71) attempts to eliminate the -ín-stem entirely by analyzing our form as
instr. sg. kīríṇā + u, with u replacing the usual cid, and this interpr. is tentatively
followed by WG. But u is hardly equivalent to cid and it is highly unlikely to be
placed here, in the middle of a pāda and a clause. Our understanding of Rigvedic
particle usage has advanced considerably since 1974. If we want to eliminate, or
limit, kīrín-, it should first be noted that of the three instr. sgs., two are in Maṇḍala V
(V.4.10, 40.8), and so it is possible that the poets of V reinterpr. kīríṇā as belonging
to an -ín-stem; there are no unambig. exx. of the plain i-stem kīrí- in V. Certainly
there is no possessive sense associated with the putative kīrín- forms as far as I can
see.
The 2nd hemistich also presents difficulties: how to construe the indefinite
expression ké cid, why the Maruts are compared to/identified with thieves, and
whether c and d form a single expression or two. These questions have been
addressed in various ways in the standard transl.; I will treat only my own. My
rendering assumes that c and d are separate clauses (contra the standard view)
depicting a two-step process. For c I start with the fact that what thieves mostly do in
the RV is hide. I assume that the Maruts are likened to thieves because on their first
approach, enveloped in clouds perhaps, they are indistinct and unidentifiable; this is
also conveyed by the indefinite ké cin ná “like who knows who.” (I do not take ké cid
109
directly with tāyávaḥ, but interpr. them as two different ways of referring to the
stealthy Maruts, again against most interpr.) In d the Maruts suddenly flash out (āsan
dṛśí tviṣé “came to glitter in my sight”) as the storm, or specifically the lightning. As
they become visible in this way, it also becomes clear that they are ‘helpers’ (ū́māḥ);
as usual, the assumption behind this is that the storm, though violent, brings
fructifying rain -- rain which is previewed in the first hemistich, where the Maruts
seek water and prance to the wellspring, while chanting in rhythm, presumably a
reference to thunder.

### 52.13  
On the phrase ṛṣvā́ṛṣṭívidyutaḥ see disc. ad vs. 6; for the number
disharmony in yé … tám see disc. ad vs. 7; for the seemingly unnecessary copula
sánti see disc. ad vs. 2 as well as immediately below.
This vs. serves as another boundary. The Maruts of the thunderstorm,
dominating the middle of this hymn, are reconfigured as ritualists, appropriate guests
and participants at our sacrifice. The ritual context now takes over for the rest of the
hymn. This thematic transition may help explain the sánti. In pāda a the Maruts are
still lofty ones with spears of lightning -- untamed forces of nature -- but in b they are
asserted to be poets and ritual adepts (kaváyaḥ … vedhásaḥ). Perhaps the sánti marks
the two forms in b as predicate nouns in an equational sentence (X IS Y), where X
and Y belong to very different domains.
The address or, as seems likely, self-address to the seer (rṣe) returns us to the
very beginning of the hymn, with Śyāvāśva’s clear self-address in 1ab.

### 52.14  
The self-address of 13c seems important enough to repeat here in pāda with
minimal variation, though the syntactic function of the acc. mā́rutam gaṇám is
different and the rest of the vs. much less clear.
The first hemistich lacks a verb; the parameters of what to supply are set by
the nominal arguments in a -- the seer is commanded (/commands himself) to [DO
SOMETHING] to(ward) (ácha) the Marut flock -- and further limited by the simile in b,
with the nom. maiden (yoṣáṇā) roughly corresponding to the seer and the acc.
friend/ally (mitrám) to the Maruts. I have supplied ‘approach’, others ‘invite, address,
turn’, etc., all more or less acceptable.
The question then is what the simile in b is conveying. Most of the renderings
attribute bolder action to the maiden than I think gently bred Vedic girls would
ordinarily undertake (see esp. Klein, DGRV II.183–84: “… like a maiden entices a
friend”). My solution is to read dānā́twice in two different morphological interpr.
First, with the standard interpr., as the instr. sg. of ‘gift’ (on the possible stems, see
EWA s.v. dāná-). But also as a root aor. mid. participle in the nom. sg. fem. with
passive value. Although such a participle is not recognized by the standard grammars,
it is exactly the form we would expect and fits the gift-marriage model perfectly. The
mitrá- to whom she is given is presumably her spouse; on mitrá- in a wedding
context see X.27.12 and my “The Rigvedic Svayaṃvara” (Fs. Parpola 2001), 309–13.
The final word of b, yoṣáṇā, is anomalously accented (vs. standard yóṣaṇā).
See below comm. ad 15b for a possible explanation.
110
The second hemistich seems to be presented as a disjunctive alternative to the
first, introduced by vā. The “or” does not make much sense; it is tempting to follow
Re’s judgment: “vā irrationnel.” But Klein (II.184) may have rightly divined the
rationale: “the poet first beseeches the Rishi to entice the Maruts to the worship, but
then, as an alternative, appeals directly to the Maruts themselves to come.” I would
tweak this slightly by suggesting that the action to which 14cd is presented as an
alternative is not 14ab, but rather 13cd, of which 14a(b) is a variant. The ṛṣi orders
himself to stop the Maruts with a song (13cd) but then suggests to them that they
initiate the journey themselves (14cd).
The voc. dhṛṣṇavaḥ addressed to the Maruts again reminds us of the
beginning of the hymn, with dhṛṣṇuyā́(1a, 2b, 4b) and dhṛṣadvínaḥ (2c).

### 52.15  
This vs. is a variant of 14, with the parts somewhat differently distributed.
The phrase devā́m̐áchā in b resembles ácha … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám in 14a, and it
therefore seems prudent and economical to supply the same verb as in 14a.
Although in 14ab dānā́belonged to the same syntagm as ácha … mā́rutaṃ
gaṇám, here it is construed with a different part of the sentence, with the opt. saceta
‘would/might/could keep company’. In 14 the poet was offering a gift to the Maruts;
here he “keeps company with a gift” -- that is, receives it -- bestowed by the Maruts.
The situation is the standard reciprocal exchange of praise and worship for the gods
for material benefits from the gods. The givers are first identified as sūrí-s ‘patrons’
(c), and one could think of the human patrons often so called, but pāda d makes it
clear that the Maruts are meant, and the identification of the sūráyaḥ with the Maruts
is even clearer in 16b.
The two instr. in d are off balance: yā́maśrutebhiḥ ‘famed on/by their
course/journey’ modifies the Maruts, but, pace Gr, Ge, and WG, añjíbhiḥ should not,
because añjí- is only a noun ‘unguent, adornment’ (see in the next hymn V.53.4), not
the adj. their tr. require. Re recognizes the problem and suggests that it is an
“instrumental of identification”: “en tant que (porteurs d’) ornements.” I think rather
that yā́ma- and añjíbhiḥ are functionally parallel, both to be construed with śrutá-,
but one in a cmpd and one in an independent syntagm. For similar interplay between
cmpd member and independent word, see comm. ad VIII.1.2.
The real problem in this vs. is vakṣáṇā. In the publ. tr. I follow Ge and Re in
taking it as an acc. pl. of vakṣáṇā ‘udder’, but of course this stem is fem. and the acc.
pl. form here should be vakṣáṇāḥ. Ge (n. 15b) casually suggests that it is
exceptionally neuter or else a mistake for vakṣáṇāḥ, Re that it’s a “nt. insolite.”
Others provide different morphological analysis: Gr sets up a special stem vakṣáṇā
‘Darbringung’ and must take it as a nom. sg.; Old suggests emending the accent to
*vákṣaṇā, allowing it to belong to the stem vákṣaṇa- ‘strengthening’ and takes it as a
neut. nom. pl. (“wie zu den Göttern die Stärkungen”); WG maintain the ‘udder’
analysis but take it as a nom. sg.: “Der … (wendet) sich den göttlichen (Maruts) zu
wie ein Schlauch (der gefüllt sein will).” This last is the most ingenious and does the
least violence to the morphology / repertoire of stems, but the image is an odd one, to
say the least.
111
My explanation, admittedly rather weak, starts from the similar patterning of
vss. 14 and 15: 1) the ácha + acc. gods noted above (though ácha differently
positioned), in each case requiring a verb to be supplied; 2) dānā́(beg. of 14b/15c);
3) the parallel endings of the b pādas: 14b … ná yoṣánā / 15c … ná vakṣánā. The
final word of each of these pādas is problematic: yoṣáṇā has the wrong accent,
vakṣáṇā has the wrong ending. I suggest that the words were mutually adjusted to
each other, either in composition or redactionally. Oldenberg already suggested (in
his n. 2) that yoṣáṇā might owe its accent to vakṣáṇā, but the suggestion was halfhearted since he really wanted to emend the accent of vakṣáṇā to *vákṣaṇā, as I just
noted. However, this seems the best explanation of the accent of yoṣáṇā, and
conversely this allows us also to assume that acc. pl. *vakṣáṇāḥ lost its -ḥ to match
yoṣánā. Although this may seem no different from Ge’s and Re’s arbitrary conferral
of neut. gender, my explanation is contextually tied and has some possibility of being
correct.

### 52.16  
This Paṅkti vs. is the last real vs. of the hymn, since 17 (also Paṅkti) is a
dānastuti. It begins with prá, just as vs. 1 did, and continues with the insistent
repetion of the verb of speech vocanta (pādas b, c, e). The vs. is also reminiscent of
repeated ohate ‘vaunt themselves’ in 10–11; as there, the recipient of the Maruts’
speech here is “me.” The structure of the vs. would be clearer if the tr. read “Those
who proclaimed … they proclaimed P. their mother, then they proclaimed their
father …”
On iṣmín- see comm. ad I.87.6.

### 52.17  
By all standard interpr. the Maruts are the subjects of this dānastuti, but it is
worth noting that they are not named -- and so it is possible that a set of human
patrons, assimilated to the Maruts and thus endowed with their prestige, are the
actual donors praised.
Note the etymological chaining between the subj. of 16e śíkvasaḥ and 17a
śākínaḥ, both deriv. from √śak. This could be evidence of the identity of the subjects
(Maruts both), or it could be another way of conferring Marut qualities on the human
patrons.
The unbalanced āmreḍita ékam-ekā is curiously formed. AiG III.395 suggests
that the pl. ekā has been attracted to the following śatā́, whose attribute it is. It also
seems an attempt, utilizing both sg. ékam and pl. ekā, to express the awkward
distributive, of one hundred per each of seven Maruts, producing a total of plural
hundreds.
## 53 Maruts
For the complex metrical structure of the hymn, see publ. intro. Despite the
numerous different names for the meters, with few meters repeated in adjacent vss.,
they are all combinations of 8- and 12-syllable pādas, and so the hymns is metrically
more harmonious than the long list of meters implies.
112

### 53.1  
Like V.52.14 in the immediately preceding hymn, this vs. contains a vā ‘or’
whose disjunctive alternatives do not seem parallel. While it is true that both
alternatives are questions beginning with káḥ ‘who’, the questions seem ill-matched.
Re’s assessment here is “illogisme de vā́[sic -- he prints it with accent].” Perhaps the
point is that if no one knows as far back as the Maruts’ birth, there may still be
someone who has had long association with them and their habits.

### 53.2  
In b kathā́yayuḥ could be resolved as kathā́ā́yayuḥ “how did they drive
here?” This interpr. might be favored by āyayúḥ in 3a, although it is disfavored by
prá yayuḥ in 12b.
The sandhi form āpáya at the end of c is universally interpr. as the nom. pl.
āpáyaḥ, referring to the Maruts; it could, however, be just as easily dat. sg. āpáye and
refer to the good giver (sudā́se) immediately preceding. In fact, I think it should be
read as both, as reflected in the publ. tr. This double reading is favored by the way
the vs. is structured, a striking pattern discovered by Natalie Operstein (in class,
early 2000s). In general in this verse syntactic constituency is alternating and
interlocked -- that is, constituents have the pattern X Y X’ Y’, etc. So, pāda a:
ā́ rátheṣu
 etā́n tasthúṣaḥ
with the acc. pl. etā́n … tasthúṣaḥ interrupted by the loc. pl. rátheṣu, which is
governed by ā́preceding the acc. pl. The pattern is similar in cd:
kásmai sudā́se íḍābhir sahá
sasruḥ ánv vr̥ṣṭáyaḥ
āpáya
The datives kásmai … sudā́se form a constituent, interrupted by the 3rd pl. verb
sasruḥ, whose preverb ánu follows the dat. sudā́se and whose overt subj., nom. pl.
vṛṣṭáyaḥ itself interrupts the postpositional phrase íḍābhiḥ … sahá. In this
configuration āpáya is not definitively paired: it could go with dat. sudā́se, separated
from it by the prev. ánu, or with the nom. pl. vṛṣṭáyaḥ, likewise separated from it by
a single word, instr. ídābhiḥ. Note also that it is the final word of a 12-syllable pāda,
in a verse whose other pādas are 8-syllables, so it is metrically almost isolated and
could almost (not quite -- it’s only 3 syllables) attach itself to d rather than c. Since
āpí- ‘friend’ is an inherently receiprocal word, its double application is especially
appropriate.

### 53.3  
The referent of té in the opening phrase té ma āhuḥ “They say to me” is not
entirely clear. It is universally taken as the Maruts, and that is probably correct.
Among other things it is reminiscent of the Maruts’ proclamations “to me” in the
previous hymn: 52.10 … máhyam … ohate and 52.16 … me … vócanta. However, it
is possible that the subj. is instead unidentified human associates of the poet. This
would avoid the awkwardness of having the Maruts refer to themselves in the 3rd ps.:
“They say to me, ‘When you see them [expect “us”], praise.’”
In pāda a note the figure āhur yá āyayúr.
113
As Re points out, yá āyayuḥ … máde is the implicit answer to kathā́yayuḥ in
1b. The two instr. in b dyúbhir víbhiḥ have provoked more commentary than they
probably deserve. Ge (fld by WG) takes the former as referring to daybreak and the
birds are then the birds that start stirring at that time. This is not impossible, but
dyúbhiḥ (incl. úpa dyúbhiḥ VIII.40.8) generally means ‘through the days, day after
day’, and that is fine here. The Maruts would then fly “with the birds” because they
come through the midspace, where birds are at home.

### 53.4  
The vs. consists entirely of a nominal rel. cl. without verb, presumably
hanging off vs. 3.
The problematic form is the hapax śrāyā́(Pp. śrāyā́ḥ). It is generally taken as
a nom. pl. thematic deriv. of √śri, so ‘resting in’, attenuated by some to ‘provided
with’ (with loc.). I cannot find particular fault with this analysis, save for its banality
and the unclear source of the root-syllable ā. I am inclined instead to take it as an
instr. sg. (śrāyā́, equally possible in this sandhi situation) to a derivative of √śrī,
parallel to śriyā́, which is regularly used of the Maruts. But I confess I do not know
why śriyā́wouldn’t have been used instead or exactly what the derivational
mechanism would be, incl. again the source of the vṛddhi.

### 53.5  
The construction of this vs. is very problematic and has been much discussed
(see, e.g., Old’s long consideration). In the end my interpr. is closest, but not
identical, to Re’s, though perhaps not arrived at by the same means.
To deal with the easiest issue first, pace Gr and Ge I do not construe ánu …
dadhe together. For one thing ánu √dhā barely exists; moreover a preverb in tmesis
is unlikely to move to the end of the preceding pāda (so also Re). Rather, it surely
governs preceding immediately ráthān, like similarly pāda-final ródasī ánu in 6c. It
can be further noted that ánu is a signature word of this hymn, occurring 6x: 2c, 5a,
6c, 10c, 11c, 16c. With ánu otherwise assigned, the simplex verb dadhe ‘I take my
place’ is then easily construed with the purpose dat. mudé.
The real problem in the verse is what to do with pāda c. The easy sense that
Ge extracts from it (“die wie die Himmel (Tage) mit Regen kommen”) makes a hash
of the grammar. Assuming that he means dyā́vaḥ to be compared with the chariots,
with the point of comparison found in the part. ‘coming’ (yatī́ḥ),
1) dyā́vah must be taken as an acc., which is simply impossible; or
2) the alternative to 1) is to assume the whole simile has reverted to the
nominative, something that doesn’t happen in RV, as I long ago demonstrated (“Case
disharmony…”) though Ge asserts it here (his n. 5c referring to his n. to I.180.3d);
3) the fem. part. yatī́ḥ should modify masc. ráthān or else, by attraction,
dyā́vaḥ, which latter is only fem. in the meaning ‘heaven’, not ‘day’.
A way to a solution (or partial solution) comes from recognizing that the fem.
pl. part. yatī́ḥ regularly modifies ‘waters’; cf. ā́paḥ ná pravátā yatī́ḥ VIII.6.34 = 13.8
= IX.24.2, ā́po ádṛśram āyatī́ḥ X.30.13, apā́m árthaṃ yatī́nām. It is therefore quite
likely, esp. in this rainy context, that ‘waters’ is gapped here, solving the gender
problem -- and also the case problem, because, adding another nominal element to
114
the syntagm allows dyā́vaḥ to take its expected nominative role and respond to the
acc. represented by (apó) yatī́ḥ. Re’s tr. reflects this: “comme les cieux (agréent les
eaux), qui vont avec la pluie.”
The question is then what is the mediating verb? Re’s ‘agréent’ makes sense,
but he doesn’t explain where he got it. I think it is possible to generate it from the
datival mudé of b, either by simply switching emphasis from the finite verb dadhe to
its infinitval complement or, in a trickier move, reading mudé a 2nd time, but this time
as a 1st sg. mid. to a root present: √mud has a hapax med. root opt. mudīmahi, and
though it is generally classified as a root aor., a root pres. is certainly not excluded. It
is worth noting that this opt. is construed with the preverb ánu (VIII.1.14 ánu stómam
mudhīmahi). Assuming this lexeme in our c would simplify the rendering of the
simile. I therefore suggest a slight alteration to the published translation, to “(I
delighting/delight) like the heavens (in the waters) when they come with their rain.”
See also disc. ad 10c, which in some ways repairs this problematic passage.

### 53.6  
As noted by most comm., masc. acc. sg. yám, presumably modifying kóśam,
has no referent in the main cl. Such “improper” relativization is not rare in the RV.
ánu at the end of c can also, secondarily, be read with d: ánu, dhánvanā.

### 53.7  
In c I construe ádhvanaḥ as an abl. with syannā́(ḥ) rather than a gen. with
vimócane. The effective difference is trivial, but the image seems more dynamic if
the horses, unhitched, rush off into the roadside pastures (perhaps in pursuit of the
“dappled females,” though if the latter are antelopes, this would lead to species
crossbreeding).

### 53.8  
The abl. parāvátaḥ is somewhat odd with mā́va sthāta “don’t stay away”; we
would expect loc. parāváti, which is quite well-attested. It may be that parāvátaḥ has
simply been harmonized with the ablatives in ab: divá(ḥ) … antárikṣād amā́t.
However, it’s also possible to take mā́va sthāta in c as a parenthetical exclamation
and parāvátaḥ as a continuation of the abl. phrase of ab: “Drive hither, Maruts, from
heaven, from the midspace, from nearby -- don’t stay away! -- and from a distance.”
This might also explain the unusual pāda-final utá of b. I therefore offer this as an
alternative to the publ. tr.
There is also the question of what the lexeme áva √sthā means here.
Generally it means ‘descend’, often into a river or the like (see Re ad loc.). But that
doesn’t make sense here: if the Maruts are to come here from heaven or the midspace,
as they are invited to in ab, they will have to descend. If we take the áva seriously,
perhaps the idea is that the Maruts shouldn’t perform their descent somewhere else
than here-- at a distance -- perhaps into the rivers named in the next vs. But this
seems overly complex.
V.53.8–9: Note the phonological modulation of #ā́... (8a) to #mā́va...(8c) to #mā́vo
(9a) / mā́vaḥ (9bc). The vaḥ then migrates to the end of 9d.
115

### 53.10  
In some ways this vs. is both a variant and a repair of vs. 5. Like that vs. it
begins with an acc. phrase referring to the Maruts’ chariots. Following (ánu) them
come the rains: ánu prá yanti vṛṣṭáyaḥ, a variant of 5c vṛṣṭī́… yatī́r iva “(fem. pl. )
coming with their rain,” where I supplied ‘waters’ as the referent of the participle.
The syntax is somewhat different, but the elements are there. In this passage the
relationship between the metaphor and the natural world is drawn more clearly: the
chariots and the flock of Maruts represent thunder and lightning (see below), which
are regularly followed by rain.
While a, c may function as repair, the phrase in b, … gaṇám mā́rutam
návyasīnām, introduces a new poetic complication. It is found identically in V.58.1,
where it is even more troublesome. The problem is what to supply with gen. pl. fem.
návyasīnām. Ge and Re, rather bizarrely, choose to supply Maruts -- e.g., Ge “der …
marutische Schar der neuesten (Marut).” This not only contravenes the unmistakable
gender of návyasīnām, but it produces an awkward and clunky pleonastic expression.
It is also unclear to me who the “newer” or “newest” (latter both Ge and Re) Maruts
would be: it is generally emphasized that the Maruts are indistinguishable and “there
is no last one” (V.58.5). Nonetheless the view that návyasīnām refers to the Maruts is
well entrenched. There is no masc. gen. pl. comparative attested in Vedic, and both
Lanman (Noun Inflec. 515) and Macd (VG 234) state that the fem. form is used
instead in these two passages “in agreement with marútām” (Macd, as if gen. pl.
marútām were actually in the passage), due to “metrical exigencies” (again Macd,
but same view expressed by Lanman). The metrical argument is strikingly weak:
although neither a putative masc. gen. pl. *návyasām nor *návīyasām built to the
alternative comparative stem would fit this exact metrical slot even with distraction
of the gen. pl. ending (as here), neither form would have any trouble fitting into other
parts of a Vedic metrical line, and it’s difficult to believe that a poet like Śyāvāśva
would set his heart on putting a comparative just here and then seriously distort the
grammar to shove it in. (Sāy., it should be noted, does not supply Maruts, but still
ignores the gender of návyasīnām by glossing it with the grammatically ambiguous
nūtanānām and then connecting that gen. pl. with ráthānām in pāda a.)
WG have the merit of supplying a fem., namely ‘rains’, borrowed from the
vṛṣṭáyaḥ of c. But this again seems pleonastic: why would the rains follow the rains,
and indeed why would the (temporally unmarked) rains follow the newer rains? I
start by considering what is regularly called ‘newer’. To this there is a ready answer:
hymns, songs, formulations, thoughts, etc. -- the standard verbal products celebrated
in RVic discourse, several of which are fem. In fact, note that in the next vs. (53.11)
two such words are prominently positioned at the ends of pādas: suśastíbhiḥ (11b)
‘good chants’ and dhītíbhiḥ (11c) ‘poetic thoughts’, both of which are elsewhere
modified by návyasī-: VIII.5.25 návyasībhiḥ suśastíbhiḥ; I.143.1 ... návyasīṃ dhītím.
I therefore propose that we should supply such a word with návyasīnām in 10b. (In
the publ. tr. it is ‘hymns’.) But this produces an odd locution, “the Marut flock of
newer (hymns),” with semantically ill-assorted elements joined -- or so it seems at
first glance. But remember that the poet is depicting a metaphorical thunderstorm:
the rains, undisguised, come last, but I think we have both thunder and lightning
116
earlier in the vs.: the flock is tveṣám ‘glittering’ (though, I must admit, the word
sometimes just means ‘turbulent’: see vā́ta-tviṣ- ‘turbulent as the wind’ in the next
hymn, V.54.3), which can represent the lightning. And the flock also consists of
“hymns,” which in this context can be the regular booming of thunder claps.

### 53.11  
The Maruts’ thunder-hymns are then met with our reciprocal offered praise
hymns.
In pāda a va eṣām is taken by all standard tr. as a doubled gen. pl., essentially
“of these you,” though not so tr. I think rather that eṣām refers to the chariots, and
vaḥ is the gen. dependent on the whole NP śárdhaṃ-śardham … eṣām, which simply
reprises 10a táṃ vaḥ śárdhaṃ ráthānām, with gen. pl. of the chariots.

### 53.12  
The question kásmai … prá yayuḥ “to whom have they driven” returns us to
the questions in vs. 2: kathā́yayuḥ / kásmai sasruḥ “How have they driven? To
whom have they flowed?” The referent of kásmai in 2, the “good giver” (sudā́se), is
further specified here as “one who has given an oblation” (rātáhavyāya), though with
different roots ‘give’. This ring-compositional reprise brings to a close the
descriptive portion of the hymn, and the poet turns to requests.

### 53.13  
With the standard tr. I take yéna in pāda as referring to enā́yā́mena in the
previous vs. (12c).
I tr. dhānyà- lit., ‘related to grain (dhānā́), as ‘granular’, because I think it
refers both to the raindrops, shaped like grain, and the actual grain that results from
the rain.
I.57.1 rā́dho víśvā́yu suggests that viśvā́yu belongs to what precedes, rather
than to saúbhagam as Ge and Re take it.

### 53.14  
The standard tr. take usrí as having temporal domain over the whole of
pāda c: “when it rains, the waters at dawn are luck, lifetime, and medicine.” I don’t
see any way to tell, and in fact I don’t see why dawn should limit any of these
predicates.

### 53.16  
Unaccented asya should not modify stuvatáḥ as WG take it. Better the
solutions of Ge and Re, esp. the latter, who separate these two genitives, with Re
supplying “Marut troop” with asya.
## 54 Maruts

### 54.1  
The first word of the hymn is prá, as it was in V.52, the first of Śyāvāśva’s
Marut hymns. It would at first appear to be in tmesis with anajā in b (so Gr and see
Re’s bizarre tr. “je veux lancer-avec-onction”), but √añj does not otherwise appear
with prá. I think it rather belongs with the last word of the vs., arcata. The syntagm
prá √arc is quite common and, more to the point, began the first hymn in this cycle:
117
V.52.1ab prá …, árcā. The rest of our vs., from śárdhāya to dyumnáśravase, is set
into this celebratory frame.
anajā is the 1st sg. act. nasal infix pres. subjunctive, as all the standard tr. take
it, pace its assignment to the pf. by Gr, Wh, Macd.
My tr. of gharmastúbh- ‘with the rhythm of the gharma-pot’ sounds like a
bahuvrīhi, which it is not. Better would be ‘chanting rhymically (like) the gharmapot’ (cf. chandastúbh- in nearby V.52.12). The point of comparison, as is noted by
most comm., is the regular bubbling of the gharma-pot.
My “sacrificing on the back of heaven” agrees with Ge and Re in taking diváḥ
as limiting the first member of pṛṣṭhayájvane. Old allows both this and a syntagm
divá ā́“from heaven,” while WG follow Old’s 2nd alternative and suggest that the
Maruts are sacrificing on the back of the earth (to be supplied). It is difficult to make
a judgment here.

### 54.2  
Like the 1st vs. this one begins with prá. Also like the first vs. the first
hemistich of this one is dense with cmpds, here describing the Maruts’ chariots.
The repetition of párijrayaḥ at the end of both hemistichs seems a bit clunky
and perhaps especially so because, if the forms are nom. plurals (as generally taken),
the supposed stem pári-jri- is ill-formed: we expect an empty final -t- on what looks
like a root noun in short resonant. This supposed stem párijri- occurs once outside of
this hymn, also pāda-final, also as apparent nom. pl. of the Maruts (I.64.5), and the
root noun -jri- is also supposed to be found in urujrí- twice, again as nom./voc. pl.
urujráyaḥ (accented VIII.70.4, unaccented voc. VII.39.3, the only form not pādafinal). Thus all attested forms of the supposed -jri- stem are in the shape -jrayaḥ
(accented or not). The 2nd cmpd exists beside an s-stem bahuvrīhi urujráyas- (twice
in acc. sg. -asam), and a simplex neut. s-stem jráyas- is well attested (approx. 15x),
with Aves. and OP cognates zraiiah- and drayah- respectively. All of this makes the
stem -jri- seem very fishy. Debrunner (AiG II.2.44) explains the forms, which, as we
saw, all end in -ayas, as haplologies from *-ayasas, making ref. to Wackernagel’s
AiG III.80, which presents other possible haplologies to -s-stem *-asas forms.
Though I am leery of systematic haplologies, I think this has a reasonable chance of
being right, esp. in this pāda-final position. However, in our passage I think there is
another contributing factor. Ge (n. 2ab) adduces two passages containing jráyas-:
X.92.5 pariyánn úru jráyaḥ (IX.68.2, not cited by Ge, is identical) and I.95.9 urú te
jráyas páry eti, with pári (+ VERB OF MOTION) collocated with the -s-stem jráyas-. In

### 54.2  
párijrayaḥ seems almost like a univerbation of a prepositional/adverbial
phrase pári *jráyaḥ “around the (broad) expanse.” It is even possible that one of the
forms in this vs. is meant to represent the adverbial phrase -- so, possibly, ab “forth
(go your chariots) around the expanse,” referring to the Maruts’ circling the earth or
the midspace -- while the other is a nom. pl. (by old haplology), to be rendered as in
the publ. tr.: “the waters swirling in their stream bed.” This would alleviate the
clunkiness of the repetition, which would then be only apparent.
118
As Ge. remarks (n. 2c), “Trita's Beziehung zu den Marut ist dunkel.” Trita is
associated with the Maruts also in II.34.10, 14. In vs. 10 of that hymn Trita seems to
be associated with making noise, as here; that is as far as I can get.

### 54.3  
Pāda-final parvatacyút- returns here (from 1b) but in a different form: nom.
pl. -aḥ rather than dat. sg. -e.

### 54.4  
The vs. sets up pairs of antitheses: nights/days (a), midspace/dusky realms
(b), with the third only indirectly implied: fields [=dry land]/ *water [via boats] (c).
The īm that interrupts the simile nā́vaḥ … yathā in c is superficially puzzling,
but I think it is related to the implication just noted: it stands for the acc. ‘waters’ in
the full realization of the phrase “like boats (through waters).” It is also worthy of
note that the cadences of pādas c and d are phonologically similar, esp. at beginning
and end, though they achieve this through very different grammatical means: … nā́va
īṃ yathā # … nā́ha riṣyatha #.

### 54.5  
Note the phonetic echoes: (mahi)t(v)aná(m) … (ta)tāna … (é)tā ná …
(áyā)tanā.
I take “greatness” (or “heroism [and] greatness”) to be the unexpressed subj.
of tatāna in b, rather than yójanam with Ge. The latter is an acc. of extent of space,
and the phrase #dīrghám … yójanam# is iconically positioned to express the distance
traversed.
In the second hemistich contra Ge and Re I take c as a separate nominal main
clause, with d a temporal dependent cl. This allows the yád to be properly positioned,
rather than occurring deep in the dependent cl. (The WG treatment is similar to
mine.) The shared characteristic in the simile in c, ‘having ungraspable brilliance’
(ágṛbhītaśocis-), presumably refers to the combination of speed and timidity that
characterizes antelopes, deer, and their ilk and makes them hard to catch. If we were
to speculate more narrowly, the ‘brilliance’ might refer either to the conspicuous
white spots on the coat of the chital deer or the white sides, underbelly, interior legs,
and hindquarters of the blackbuck -- both species that seem native to the right
location.
The puzzle in d is the phrase ánaśvadām … girím “the non-horse-giving
mountain.” In order to approach it, we might first tackle the verb that governs it, ny
áyātanā. The lexeme ní √yā is generally hostile; cf. nearby V.42.10 (also of the
Maruts) yá óhate rakṣáso devávītāv / acakrébhis tám maruto ní yāta “Who(ever) will
laud the demons at the invitation to the gods, run him over/down, Maruts, with your
wheel-less (chariots).” In our passage the sense seems to be that the Maruts trample
down or overrun a mountain whose behavior deserves it. But what is a non-horsegiving mountain? On the one hand, it may simply refer to a stingy mountain,
comparable to a stingy patron, contrasted to aśvadā́- ‘horse-giving’ used of generous
patrons elsewhere. But still, why horses? Mountains can be the source of
nourishment and wealth; cf. I.65.5 gírir ná bhújma “a source of benefit like a
mountain” (also VIII.50.2 and comm. ad I.55.3). But mountainous terrain is not
119
particularly friendly to horses, which are most at home in open, relatively flat
grasslands. I therefore wonder if the operable segmentation of the cmpd is anaśvadā́- ‘giving non-horses’ (rather than an-aśvadā- ‘not giving horses’). This might then
be an oblique reference to the Vala myth and the mountain that yields up cows (that
is, non-horses). However, since the Maruts are not generally associated with the Vala
myth, this may be farfetched. The safest interpr. is Old’s deflection, that the phrase is
“auf unbekannte Erzählung anspielend.”

### 54.6  
My interpr. follows that of Narten (Sig.Aor. 195–96), with the first pāda
consisting of the yád clause, the 2nd the main cl. Both Ge and Re take the first part of
pāda a as the main cl., with the dependent clause starting with yád. Although yád is
better positioned in their interpr. than in Narten’s, they must make arṇasám an obj.
of móṣathā (in unconvincing fashion) and the sequence of tense/mood is badly off:
aug. aor. ábhrāji … aor. subjunctive móṣathā, lit., “it has flashed when you will steal
…” Ge simply renders the subjunctive as a preterite, while Re’s parenthesis in “vous
dérob(i)ez” is masterfully evasive even for him.
As I just said, I am not happy with the position of yád in Narten’s/my interpr.,
since it follows both the verb and part of the subject (plus a voc., but that doesn’t
count). There is another possibility, that yád functions here as a sort of izafe,
connecting śárdhaḥ and arṇasám: “the troop, which is a flood.” In this case ábhrāji
would be a main-cl. verb, and the two pādas, a and b, would be syntactically
unconnected: “The troop that is a flood has flashed; you will plunder …” arṇasá- is a
hapax. Narten takes it as an adjectival deriv. of árṇas- ‘flood’, but it could have been
(re-)substantivized as ‘flood’.
The point of comparison in b between the Maruts and the caterpillar is that
violent storms also strip the leaves off trees.
The sequence vṛkṣáṃ kap(anéva) is oddly reminiscent of Vṛṣākapi, the randy
monkey in X.86, but this must be accidental.
In the publ. tr. the voc. sajoṣasaḥ is not rendered as a voc., since the Engl.
would be awkward.
The s-aor. subj. neṣathā ‘you will lead’ is particularly appropriate to the obj.
arámati-, the personified feminine Proper Thinking, since the verb √nī, esp. in
sigmatic forms, becomes specialized for leading females in ritual settings; cf. the
priestly title Neṣṭar. Although néṣṭar- probably owes its -ṣ- to crossing of the agent
noun nétar- with Tvaṣṭar (tváṣṭar-), who is also associated with ritual females (see
EWA s.v. néṣṭar-), its apparent coincidence with the neṣ of the s-aor. could spread
the semantics.

### 54.7  
In d the sequence ṛ́ṣiṃ vā must have been fronted around the rel. yám, since
the phrase as a whole ṛ́ṣiṃ vā yáṃ rā́jānaṃ vā does not mean “either the seer or
which king” but “which seer or king” -- or even better “which one, whether seer or
king.”
I take the thematic stem súṣūda- as ultimately deriving from a pf. subjunctive,
despite accent. In this particular form, the 2nd pl. indic. pf. *súṣūda, with the rarely
120
occuring 2nd pl. act. pf. ending -a, would have simply been extended by the prim.
ending.

### 54.8  
In the cmpd. grāmajít- the 1st member could have either an acc. or an instr.
relationship with the root noun. Both would be possible: ‘conquering roving band’
(so Gr, Ge, Re, Thieme [M+A 81]) or ‘conquering with/in roving bands’. Although
in such root noun cmpds an acc. relationship is more common, indeed also among
cmpds in -jít-, I follow Scarlatta’s preferred interpr. (156) found also in his tr. (=WG),
although the acc. interpr. is hardly excluded. The parallel I.100.10 grā́mebhiḥ sánitā,
cited by Re, is suggestive.
My interpr. of b follows Thieme (M+A 81), esp. of aryamáṇaḥ, which he
takes as “hospitable ones (hospitable householders who refresh the stranger).” Others
take it as a pregnant pl. referring to “(Mitra, Varuṇa, and) Aryaman.”
The dep. cl. in c, yád inā́so ásvaran, can be construed either with what
precedes or what follows, but sits uneasily with either because of its augmented
ásvaran, which doesn’t match the pres. indic. pínvanti (c) or undanti (d). I chose to
connect it with d, as thunder before rain.

### 54.9  
dyaúḥ is clearly fem. here, given the adj. pravátvatī, but this gender choice
must be conditioned by its standard formulaic partner, fem. pṛthivī́, in the preceding
pāda, modified by the same adj. in the same position.
The nom. pl. jīrádānavaḥ ‘having lively drops’ in d must modify the
mountains (párvatāḥ), but in the immed. preceding hymn it is found in the voc. of the
Maruts (V.53.6, in the same metrical pos.; cf. also I.34.4 a nom. pl. of the Maruts in
the same position). There are no grounds for emending the text by deleting the accent
and making it into a voc. (which would also entail a switch from 3rd to 2nd ps. ref.);
how would it have acquired the accent here? Rather it must be word play: mountains
produce torrents of water when it rains.

### 54.10  
The s-stem adj. sá-bharas- (so accented in X.101.3, though it is an
accentless voc. here), tr. here ‘of equal gravity’, is a bahuvrīhi with the lit. sense
‘having the same burden / weight’, with the same -bharas- as in viśvá-bharas-
‘bringing all’, i.e., lit. ‘having/bringing all burdens’ in IV.1.19.
s
u
varṇaraḥ at the end of pāda a picks up náraḥ at the end of 8a and 10b and
asvaran at the end of 8c.

### 54.12  
Note the repetition of ágṛbhīta-śociṣ- from 5c; this cmpd is found only once
elsewhere in the RV (VIII.23.1, of Agni).
The first hemistich is discussed in some detail by Thieme (Fremd. 68–70),
whose interpr. I basically follow. I would add that the (heavenly) brilliance that
cannot be grasped by the Ārya on earth is shaken down as rain by the Maruts.
There are two basic interpr. of c, depending on what the subject of sám
acyanta is taken to be. For Ge the subj. is the Maruts, with vṛjánā the grammatical
obj. referring to their girthbands: they are girding themselves for battle. WG’s interpr.
121
also takes the reference to be to the Maruts, but with vṛjánā as the subj. referring to
the closing of the ranks (Reihe) of the Maruts, again before some warlike manoeuvre
on their part. In both these interpr. the referent of the subj. of sám acyanta and
átitviṣanta is the same: the Maruts. With Re I instead consider the verbs to have
different subjects: the subj. of sám acyanta, vṛjánā, refers to the circles or
communities of the Ārya, while the Maruts are the subj. of átitviṣanta. I think the two
hemistichs contrast the Maruts’ effects on the Ārya communities: in ab the Maruts
bring them the welcome rain they cannot get themselves, but in cd they cling
together during the violence of the Maruts’ storm. (I cannot decide which strain Kü’s
tr. (224) follows, though WG’s paraphrase of it in their n. leans towards the Re/JB
side.)

### 54.13  
The verb in d, rāranta, presents difficulties both morphologically and
semantically. Formally it has received a variety of analyses: Gr classifies it
(impossibly) with √radh ‘subdue’; as Old notes, in context it would best belong to
√rā ‘give’, but it is hard to make this work formally. Given the long redupl.
characteristic of the pf. to √ran ‘enjoy’, the form most likely belongs there. Lub.
classifies it as a med. (3rd sg.) injunc. to that root, but there are no other med. forms
to this stem or indeed to the root (raṇáyanta being an -anta replacement). I think we
are therefore stuck with the formally most likely analysis, given by Kü, as 2nd pl. pf.
impv., with (as often) irregular full grade (see also Ge n. 13d). This poses problems
semantically. It should mean ‘enjoy’, with the Maruts as subject. The gapped obj. is
qualified by sahasrín- ‘possessing/in thousands’; as Re points out, this is a stable
epithet of rayí- ‘wealth’. And this is the problem: the Maruts have just given us
wealth; we should be the ones enjoying it. Gods never enjoy wealth -- they distribute
it. Ge suggests in his n. that the thousandfold wealth they enjoy is “in Gestalt von
Opfern,” which is certainly a good try (probably the best available). Old tries to
make the verb into what looks like a reflexive causative: “macht [den Reichtum] bei
uns sich erfreuen” -- that is, the Maruts should make the wealth be happy to stay by
us. WG go one step further in the causativization process: “(An diesem Reichtum) …
macht, dass man sich hier bei uns daran freue … am tausendfachen.” But these last
two attempts to separate the Maruts from the enjoyment are unconvincing, because
no other forms to this stem show this causative tendency. I think we must stick with
the meaning imposed by parallel forms (so also Re) and deal, perhaps as Ge does,
with the Maruts enjoying riches.

### 54.14  
The problematic wealth of 13d reappears in 14a as the obj. of a gapped verb
whose subj. is the Maruts, but in this case we can borrow the verb from the next pāda,
avatha ‘you aid’. Ge unaccountably supplies a verb (“gewähret”) that matches
neither what precedes nor what follows.
The pāda-final words in the first hemistich, … spārhávīram# and …
sā́mavipram# are phonologically similar. This partial match may help explain the
odd hapax sā́mavipra-. Although my tr. ‘inspired in his melody’ is structurally
similar to the other standard renderings (e.g., Re ‘inspiré par la mélodie-sacreé’), the
122
cmpd should not mean that. For one thing the 2nd member vípra- is almost never used
adjectivally (pace Gr), but almost always as a noun referring to a type of poet.
Moreover, the accent strong suggests a bahuvrīhi. A literal rendering of such a
bahuvrīhi would be something like ‘whose inspired poet is the melody’ or ‘whose
inspired poet has the melody’ (latter like vájra-bāhu- ‘having an arm that has a mace
(in it)’), which do not work as descriptors of a seer. I wonder if the phonological play
just noted didn’t flip the order of the cmpd members, and the underlying form would
be *vípra-sāman- ‘having the melody of an inspired poet’. Exact parallels are vípramanman- ‘having the thought of an inspired poet / having inspired thought’ in
VI.39.1, where it modifies kaví-, and vípra-vacas- ‘having the speech of an inspired
poet / having inspired speech’ in VIII.61.8.
## 55 Maruts

### 55.1  
The question about práyajyu- is how technically it is meant; I here follow Re.
The first hemistich recalls vs. 11 in the previous hymn, esp. in the bahuvrīhi
rukmá-vakṣas- ‘with brilliants on their breasts’ (lit. ‘having breasts with brillants on
them’, of the vájra-bāhu- type), which matches the nominal phrase V.54.11b
vákṣassu rukmā́, but also in bhrā́jad-ṛṣti- ‘having glinting spears’, whose members
are distributed differently in 54.11a áṃseṣu … ṛṣṭáyaḥ and b agníbhājasaḥ.
The idiom śúbham √yā is used of the Maruts elsewhere, in nearby V.57.2 as
well as I.23.11; cf. also the cmpds śubhaṃ-yā́(van)-. My “drove in beauty” is of
course a conscious echo of Byron’s “She walks in beauty, like the night.” A different
kind of English resonance would be offered by “gone to glory.”

### 55.2  
The verb ví rājatha can mean either ‘shine forth’ or ‘reign over’; both fit the
context and the subject, though given pāda a “you assumed your power,” perhaps
‘rule’ has the edge. The root noun cmpd virā́j- seems confined to the ‘rule’ sense,
when it does not refer to the meter by that name.

### 55.4  
I take ābhūṣéṇya- as a quasi-desiderative gerundive, parallel to didṛkṣénya-
‘desirable to be seen’ -- hence ‘desirable to become’ à ‘to be emulated’. However it
may simply mean ‘to be attended upon’.
The utá introducing the impv. in c is awkwardly rendered as ‘and’. Klein
(DGRV I.454) says it means rather ‘therefore’, which works better in English.
However, ‘therefore’ for utá does not have much support (3 passages cited by Klein
out of over 750) or a clear path of development, and a closer look at the context does
not yield a causal “X, therefore Y” interpr. It is possible that the morphologically
ambiguous dadhātana is not an imperative but an injunctive, which would yield a
more acceptable pendant “and you establish us in immortality.” And it is also
possible that the utá here loosely matches the other 3rd-pāda utá-s in 2c, 7c, while
anticipating 5a #úd.
## 56 Maruts
123

### 56.1  
Ge (/WG) supply “bring,” an impv. addressed to Agni, in the first hemistich.
There seems no particularly reason to do so, since the acc. phrase of ab can be
construed with áva hvaye in c. Perhaps it’s on the basis of the ā́in pāda a, but this is
in the wrong position to be a gapped preverb. I don’t actually know what ā́is doing,
but note that in the ring-compositional expressions in vss. 8–9, the ‘call’ verb is
construed with ā́.

### 56.2  
The question in this vs. is who is the 2nd sg. referent of mányase (a), te (c),
and vardha (d). Acdg. to Sāy. it is still Agni, but Ge suggests alternatively that it
could be the self-address of the poet, a view shared by Re. (WG think Agni, but with
a very peculiar tr. of pāda a). I think poetic self-address is excluded because of the
me in b: the poet is unlikely to refer to himself as “you (sg.)” and “me” in successive
pādas (and then back to “you”), so Agni is the more likely. The point must be that
both Agni and the poet want the same thing -- for the Maruts to come to the sacrifice.
The identification of you as Agni requires that he possess/produce hávana- ‘calls’ in
c. This can refer to the crackling of the fire. Alternatively, flg. Gr, hávana- could
belong to √hu and mean ‘oblations’, but pace Gr none of the occurrences he adduces
need to have that meaning.

### 56.3  
The gender politics of this vs. would not bear modern scrutiny: the idea
seems to be that the Earth enjoys rough sex because she gets nice presents. But it is a
powerful image.
The poss. adj. mīḷhúṣmant- occurs twice in the RV; the other form is found in
VI.50.12, where it is masc. and seems barely distinct from mīḷhvás- ‘giving rewards,
generous’. Here in this fem. form the possessive value of -mant- does have force,
assuming the correctness of Ge’s and Re’s interpr. as ‘possessing a generous
(man/lord/spouse)’. WG take it rather as ‘Soldatenbraut’, interpr. mīḷhvás- as ‘one
who has mīḷhá-’ (booty, etc) and further suggesting that the woman in question was
part of the spoils of war. This is appealing in some ways, but it does not fit well with
the last word of the hymn, mīḷhuṣī́.
As Ge points out (n. 3a), párāhatā may have two senses -- simply ‘beaten
aside’ by the onslaught of the Maruts and ‘(sexually) penetrated’, for which sense he
cites ŚB XI.5.1.1 vaitaséna daṇḍéna hatāt [sic, not Ge’s hatā], the ŚB paraphrase of
Urvaśī’s … mā … śnathayo vaitaséna (X.95.5) “you pierced me with your rod.”

### 56.4  
ní √ri means ‘make flow’, hence ‘liquefy, dissolve’. In I.127.4 the very
similar sthirā́cid ánnā ní riṇāti ójasā has ‘sturdy foods’ as obj., but since Agni is the
subject, the food is presumably wood of some sort. In nearby V.58.6 a middle intrans.
of √ri (though without preverb) takes trees as subj.: riṇaté vánāni “the trees dissolve.”
I therefore supply them as obj. here.
What then does the simile in b have to do with this? Even unruly oxen are
unlikely to dissolve trees. Because the images don’t easily harmonize, I now think
that the simile in b should go with the 2nd hemistich: unruly oxen can cause the
124
ground to shake. This is somewhat difficult to convey in tr. -- I might rearrange it to
“like oxen averse to the yoke / they shake …”
The phrase gā́vaḥ … durdhúraḥ echoes dudhró gaúḥ of 3d phonologically,
even though the adjectives are entirely unrelated.
As often Ge takes cid in c as a simile marker, a function for which there is no
good evidence.

### 56.5  
Ge takes the impv. út tiṣṭha as another self-address of the poet; again the
presence of a 1st ps. sg. in the vs. (hvaye in d) makes that unlikely. I think it is
directed rather at Agni, like the direct addresses in vss. 1 and 2. For the same impv.
cf. IV.4.4 úd agne tiṣṭha (sim. VIII.23.5): the ritual fire is blazing up while the
Maruts are called to the sacrifice. In this case Agni may be commanded to rise up
with praises (stómaiḥ) -- praises like his calls in 2c. Alternatively, there may be a
clause break after the impv., with a new clause beginning with nūnám and continuing
to the end of the vs. (This division was suggested by Natalie Operstein in class in the
early 2000s.) The praises will then be those produced by the 1st ps. poet who is the
subj. of hvaye at the end of the vs.
In b sámukṣita- can hardly be separated from nearby V.55.3 sākám ukṣitā́ḥ,
and V.57.8 brhád uk ̥ ṣámāṇāḥ also supports the root etym. to √vakṣ/ukṣ ‘be(come)
strong’, against Gr’s conection with √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’.

### 56.6  
As Bl (RVReps) and Ge point out, this vs. appears to have been constructed
from textual blocks found in I.14.12 and I.134.3. Our pāda a yuṅgdhváṃ hy áruṣī
ráthe is identical to I.14.12a except for the sg. impv. yukṣvā́hí rather than our pl.
yuṅgdhvám hí. If our pāda is modeled on I.14.12 (or a similar source) it could explain
both the hí with no obvious function and the sg. chariot ráthe for the plural Maruts;
this mismatch in number is repaired in the next pāda yuṅgdhvám rátheṣu rohítaḥ.
This latter pāda has no close parallels in the RV, though I.14.12b ends with rohítaḥ,
which is a further obj. to yukṣvā́in pāda a (I.14.12b haríto deva rohítaḥ) and so may
be a distant source. Our 2nd hemistich yuṅgdhváṃ hárī ajirā́dhurí vóḷhave, váhiṣṭhā
dhurí vóḷhave closely follows I.134.3bc vāyū́ráthe ajirā́dhurí vóḷhave, váhiṣṭhā
dhurí vóḷhave (whose pāda a contains the ‘yoke’ verb: vāyúr yuṅkte …). What I don’t
understand is why Śyāvāśva has made these clumsy adaptations just to produce a vs.
that in context is just treading water -- there’s no need for a yoking vs. here.
Note that váhiṣṭhā vóḷhave “the two best pullers to pull” is an etymological
figure, with both words built to √vah, though it is not at all transparent. Perhaps this
is what attracted Śyāvāśva.

### 56.7  
Whatever the reason for the previous vs., syá vājy àruṣaḥ “this reddish race
horse here” contrasts with the áruṣī(ḥ) ‘reddish (mares)’ in 6a. Although in the publ.
tr. I identified the referent as Agni (and I still think he is a possible secondary
referent), I now accept the view of Sāy., Ge, and Re that it is the Beipferd of the
Maruts (see the parallels adduced by Ge in n. 7a); otherwise the 2nd half of the vs.
makes little sense.
125
The mā́prohibitive in c contains what looks like a root aor. subjunctive karat.
Flg. Wackernagel (Fs. Jacobi), Hoffmann (Injunk. 55–56; see also 92) explains this
potentially embarrassing form as the injunctive to a thematized root aor., which
thematization began from the ambiguous 1st sg. ákaram. He (somewhat
disingenuously) notes that outside of mā́clauses the kara- forms are otherwise only
subjunctives, and he further suggests that his two exx. are found in idiomatic
expressions that belong to the Volkssprache, which could explain the earlier
thematization (cf. also Aufs. II.344 n. 2). (His other ex. of mā́… karat in VIII.2.20 I
explain differently, as not belonging to the mā́clause at all. See comm. ad loc.)
Hoffmann’s thematic aor. explan. has been apparently accepted by Lub, who
classifies the two forms identified thus by Hoffmann under “A-AOR.inj.” I am
generally dubious, because the root aor. of √kṛ is so well entrenched in the RV and
the -a-forms are otherwise found in clear subjunctive usage. However, I am
somewhat sympathetic to the “idiomatic” explanation, esp. combined with a metrical
observation: the injunc. kaḥ expected here is found almost entirely at the end of
Triṣṭubh pādas, but would not work here at the end of a Jagatī pāda. Nonce
thematization, esp. perhaps in a low-register expression, would be a quick fix.
WG produce a curious hybrid of prohibitive and subjunctive: “Nicht soll und
wird er … (euch) langsam machen” (my italics). I do not understand the explanation
given in the n., or at least do not understand what sort of grammatical category is
envisioned: “Uns scheint ein expekativer oder voluntativer Konjunktiv deutlich
mitzuschwingen: >(Auf keinen Fall erwarten wir), dass er euch langsam mache< bzw.
>Dass er euch ja nicht langsame mache!< This clearly builds on Tichy’s analysis of
the function of the subjunctive as “expectation,” but I do not understand how the
subjunctive would interact with the mā́.
V.56.8–9: These two vss. essentially duplicate each other The main verbs of the two
vss., ā́huvāmahe (8b) and ā́huve (9b) resonate with the verb in the 1st vs. (ā́…) áva
hvaye.
The battered-woman Earth who received presents (mīḷhúṣmatī) in 3ab is
balanced here by the glorious Rodasī, standing in apparently equality with the Maruts,
dispensing presents herself (8c suráṇāni bíbhratī, 9d mīḷhuṣī́). I see no merit on flg.
Ge’s acceptance of Sāy.’s interpr. of mīḷhuṣī́as the name of the wife of Rudra.

### 57–58  
Maruts
As Old (Proleg. 204–5) points out these two hymns are parallel and share a
final vs. He attributes their position at the beginning of the four 8-vs. Marut hymns to
this twinning. Otherwise V.58, in Triṣṭubh, should follow V.59, in Jagatī.
## 57 Maruts

### 57.3  
After dyā́m in pāda a we expect *pṛthivī́m, but get phonologically similar
párvatān instead. This disappointed expectation is “repaired” in pāda c, where
pṛthivī́m appears as the obj. of a different but semantically similar verb.
126

### 57.6  
The pf. that ends the vs., pipiśe, produces a bad cadence that would be fixed
by a heavy redupl. syllable. The metrical problem is not mentioned by Old or Kü;
HvN note it but do not suggest a solution. I wonder if it is for intens. *pepiśe; the act.
intens. is found once in the late RV, while the middle begins to be attested in the AV,
with a sense not appreciably different from non-intens. forms. Of course, the t-less
ending -e would have to be accounted for, but several 3rd sg, med. intensives have
such an ending; see Schaefer 44. Of course, this might all be more trouble than it’s
worth for a metrical violation.

### 57.7  
The sentiment in pāda c is somewhat puzzling, though the grammar is
straightforward: práśastim naḥ kṛṇuta rudriyāsaḥ. This should mean “make a eulogy
for us, o Rudras,” with the VP práśastim √kṛ. Though the three other occurrences of
this VP, in I.113.19, 181.1, and II.41.16, do conform to expectations, taking it that
way here would reverse the sacrificial bargain. As detailed in the first hemistich, the
Maruts have given us bountiful riches of all sorts; in return we should be producing a
práśasti- for them -- not they for us. In fact, of course, it is never the gods’ job to
produce praise for humans. In order to make sense of the phrase, I have pushed the
sense of √kṛ from ‘make’ to ‘make good’ -- that is, act such that the praise we are
giving you is true. (You have given us many things; do it again.) Re’s “faites nous
(aujourd’hui une récompense digne du) panégyrique” is similar, despite the
overstuffed parenthesis. There is another, less likely, alternative. As I have argued
elsewhere (RV between Two Worlds, pp. 146–48), even in the RV the práśasti- was
probably a genre of praise appropriate to kings and only secondarily applied to gods.
It might be that the poet is asking the Maruts to render his patron and king deserving
of his [=poet’s] práśasti-, either by redistributing the wealth that they showered on
the king or by the king’s performing some worthy feat. But this seems overly
complex and far less likely, and since práśasti-s in the RV are often directed at gods,
it is unnecessary.

### 57.8  
The vs. consists almost entirely of accented vocatives. Only the last phrase
bṛhád ukṣámāṇāḥ escapes the voc. and that probably because accent conversion
would be tricky.
The juxtaposition (across hemistich boundary) of ṛ́ta-jñāḥ and sátya-śrutaḥ is
striking -- and in my opinion telling with regard to the difference between ṛtá- and
sátya-, both often tr. ‘truth’. Here ṛtá- is something one knows, but sátya- is
something one hears. In my view ṛtá- is the immanent truth -- the principles and
relations that lie underpin the world as we know it -- while sátya- is the realized truth.
In some contexts this can be simply palpable reality, but here I think it refers to how
ṛtá- is realized verbally, in the formulations of poets, available to be heard.
## 58 Maruts
127

### 58.1  
On the phrase … gaṇám mā́rutaṃ návyasīnām with its problematic fem. gen.
pl. návyasīnām, see the extensive disc. ad V.53.10.
There is complete fungibility between the collective sg. gaṇám mā́rutam
“Marutian flock” and the plural yé in the 2nd hemistich referring to the individual
Maruts, which picks up gaṇám mā́rutam by sense though not strictly by grammar.
The eṣām at the end of pāda a seems clumsily pleonastic, however. It must refer also
to the pl. Maruts and depend on the acc. gaṇám (“the flock of them”), doubling the
vṛddhi deriv. mā́rutam. It should not be construed with the fem. návyasīnām.
āśvàśva- shows phonological play, as well as being a buried etymological pun,
if the old connection between āśú- and áśva- holds. It is also a kind of anagram for
the poet’s name śyāvā́śva-. Note that both words must be distracted to 4 syllables
(āśú-aśva and śyāvá-aśva respectively).
The sequence utéśire is entirely ambiguous between utá īśire and utá ī́śire.
The Pp. reads the unaccented verb, but the utá suggests that the verb is conjoined
with váhante and belongs to the rel. cl. and should therefore be accented.

### 58.2  
In my opinion the same switch in number happens in this vs. as in the
preceding one, exactly in the same way -- with yé in c picking up gaṇám in the first
hemistich. The standard tr. take the rel. cl. of c with d: the pl. yé matches the number
of its putative antecedent nṝ́n in d exactly. Although connecting with c thus appears
to be the easier syntactic course, the exact parallelism between 1abc and 2abc makes
that structure more appealing, and in addition the pāda-init. impv. vándasva in d
seems to be marking a syntactic break.
The first hemistich, which consists entirely of an acc. phrase, obviously
simply continues vs. 1, skipping back over the rel. cl. in 1cd to the gaṇám phrase in
1ab.
The bv dhúni-vrata- ‘possessing a turbulent commandment’ has, at first
glance, a curious sense, but the point is that, as the thunderstorm, the Maruts’ job --
their vratá -- is to be noisy, boisterous, and tumultuous.
The orig. s-stem máyas- has become a frozen, synchronically uninflected
form in the RV. Therefore, the accent shift that makes possessive adjectives out of
many neut. s-stems (type yáśas- ‘glory’ à yaśás- ‘glorious’) was probably not an
available derivational strategy -- hence the somewhat clumsy cmpd with bhū́-.
The phrase mayo(-bhúvaḥ) … ámitāḥ appears to be an etymological play but
of course is not.
It’s worthy of note that the vs. contains 3 nominal forms with 1st member
ending in -i, all with different explanations: dhúni-vrata- (a regular -i-stem; AiG
II.2.296), the mysteriously formed (at least to me) dā́ti-vāra-, and tuvi-rā́dhas-
(Caland compounding -i-). To which we might add mahitvā́and the immediately
preceding ámitā(ḥ) with mirror-image phonology.

### 58.3  
The enclitic 2nd pl. vaḥ in pāda a must refer to the assemblage of ritual
celebrants and its referent is not the same as the 2nd ps. ref. to the Maruts in the 2nd
hemistich (voc. marutaḥ, impv. juṣadhvam, vocc. kavayo yuvānaḥ).
128
As JL observed, pāda d has only one accented syllable (the first word etám).
The voc. phrase that ends it, kavayo yuvānaḥ, recurs in the final vs., 8c [=V.57.8c],
but with voc. accent because it is in a string of such vocc.: kávayo yúvānaḥ. As noted
ad V.57.8, that verse consists almost entirely of accented vocc., so the poet seems to
be playing with extremes of syntactically driven accent here.

### 58.4  
The wrong sandhi in d yuṣmád sádaśvo is found in both Aufr. and HvN, but
the Max Müller ed. has the correct yuṣmát. So, a copying error going back to Aufr.,
presumably generated from the yuṣmád beginning c.
The sense of írya- is disputed, and it has no secure etym. (see EWA s.v. írin-).
Schlerath (Königtum) suggests that it’s a deriv. of írā- ‘refreshing drink’, meaning
‘Nass spendend’, and this suggestion has been adopted by Oberlies (RdR II.178).
However, this does not work in all passages, nor with írin- (V.87.3) if that is related.
It seems best to follow the old standard gloss ‘regsam, rührig’, etc., and the posited
connection to √ṛ ‘arise’, etc. (see EWA loc. cit.).
There are two approaches to the interpr. of vibhva-taṣṭá-. One assumes that
the first member is a PN, the name of one of the Ṛbhus (so Re, WG). One of the
occurrences of the cmpd is in a Ṛbhu hymn, IV.36.5, in a vs. with both a form of the
word ṛbhú- and the name of another Ṛbhu, vā́ja-. There the PN interpr. seems correct
or at least a pun. However, in the other passages, III.49.1, V.42.12, and this one, all
lacking a strong Ṛbhu presence, it seems best to see a more general meaning. Ge
seems to follow this course (here and III.49.1, though not V.42.12) but his
“vollendeten” doesn’t give much hint as to how he interprets the first member.
The hapax sád-aśva- appears to be the only RVic cmpd with the first member
sa(n)t- -- assuming, with most, that sát-pati- contains a reduced form of sádas- ‘seat’
(see EWA s.v.). I take it as semantically related to the derived adj. sátvan-, of
warriors ‘the real thing’. So ‘(having) true horses’ in the sense of “good men and
true”; English “trusty” works well. We might have expected s(u)váśva- ‘having
good horses’ parallel to suvī́ra- at the end of the pāda, but perhaps the poet wanted to
vary the expression.
V.58.5–7: Sustained phonetic play, esp. with p and r/ṛ, in prá-pra (5b), pṛ́śneḥ
putrā́(ḥ) (5c), prā́yāsiṣṭa pṛ́ṣatībhiḥ (6a), práthiṣṭa … pṛthivī́(7a).

### 58.5  
Note the phonetic play on initial a and final ā́: arā́... ácaramā́áheva ...
ákavā́.
The syntactic break in the middle of pāda a, after ivéd, and the enjambment
across the pāda boundary, with áheva in pāda a the subj. of the verb prá-pra jāyante
in b, give the sense of unstoppable motion that the similes also provide.
Flg. Hoffmann (Aufs. II.413 [=MSS 10 (1957) 61–62]), WG and Re (though
Re rather mutedly) take ákavā(ḥ) as meaning that the Maruts do not become reduced
in power, and Ge’s rather vague ‘vollkommen’ is in the same realm, though
obviously without the benefit of Hoffmann’s disc. I prefer to take the adj. as outerdirected -- ‘not stingy, unstinting’ rather than inner-directed ‘not retracting’.
129
The VP sváyā matyā́… sám mimikṣuḥ “They have equipped themselves with
their own poetic thought” seems implicitly to contrast with the opening of the
previous hymn, V.57.1 iyáṃ vo asmát … matíḥ “This poetic thought from us for you.”
This should remind us that the Maruts are both recipients and producers of praise
poetry. See the disc. of the opening of this Marut cycle, V.52, where much is made of
this dual role. A number of tr. take matí- as the equivalent of ‘will’ or ‘intention’
(van Bradke [Fs. Roth (1893) 119] Will, Ge, Kü [386] Absicht, WG Antrieb), but
this stretches the meaning of this word unacceptably. In any case the locution must
harmonize with the very similar one in I.165.1 adduced also by Ge: káyā śubhā́…
marútaḥ sám mimikṣuḥ / káyā matī.

### 58.6  
Although the adjacency of pṛ́ṣatībhir áśvaiḥ might seem to lend credence to
the supposed shifting gender of áśva- ‘horse’ due to the clear fem. form of the
preceding adj., it is better to follow the standard tr. in taking the two words as
separate, with the fem. refering to dappled antelopes or simply dappled mares that
serve as the horses for the Maruts’ chariot.
Pāda c is cleverly constructed: ā́paḥ ‘waters’ would be a perfectly acceptable
subject of the following verb riṇaté ‘flow, dissolve’, but it is “bound” to kṣódante
with the accent on riṇaté making the syntactic break clear. But the real subject of
riṇaté, vánāni ‘trees’, is a much less appropriate subj. than what preceded.
VIII.7.26, adduced by Ge, makes it clear that Heaven is roaring with fear, but
the roaring must also represent thunder.
V.58.6–7: The final word of vs. 6 is dyaúḥ, while pṛthivī́appears in the 1st pāda of 7,
implicitly linking this standard pair, although they are contextually separate.

### 58.7  
The first hemistich has distinct sexual overtones, with the Earth spreading
herself to receive the Maruts’ “embryo” -- though it is more decorously phrased than
V.56.3.
It is difficult to get a causal reading from hí in c. It cannot be connected with
the preceding pāda, and the action of c seems irrelevant to d, so connection with the
following pāda seems unlikely. I have settled for the craven ‘certainly’.

### 58.8  
See comm. above on the identical vs., V.57.8. Although it is a repeated vs., it
fits nicely into this hymn: 1) ámṛtā ṛ́tajñāḥ has ring-compositional relationship with
1d amṛ́tasya svarā́jaḥ; note the twisted phonetic relationship between svarā́jaḥ and
ṛ́tajñāḥ. 2) Pāda c: the accented voc. kávayo yúvānaḥ repairs the unaccented identical
phrase in 3d. Perhaps this internal quotation is responsible for the metrical problem,
10 syls. with rest after caesura.
## 59 Maruts

### 59.1  
As was indicated in the publ. intro., the referent of the ‘spy’ (spáṭ) is unclear.
Ge suggests a number of possibilities, none compelling; WG take it as the singer.
130
Most bizarrely, Old interprets the word as an interjection. I think it possible that it is
the sun. One clue is the repetition of the phrase suvitā́ya dāváne “to give good faring,”
which is used of the Maruts in 4d. I therefore think the ‘spy’ must be a being that can
function in the same way as the Maruts and provide the same type of benefit. The sun
is elsewhere called a spy (X.35.8), provides light for creatures to move about, and
appears before and, more importantly, after a storm.
Part of the solution to the foregoing question depends on another problem in
the first pāda, the interpr. of the 3rd sg. verb (prá …) akran. It is regularly assigned to
√krand ‘roar’ (so, e.g., Gr, Lub), and the standard tr. all interpr. it so. But this interpr.
is by no means universal: both Wh (Rts) and Macdonell instead assign it to √kram
‘stride’. (Old, again bizarrely, takes it to √kṛ.) Narten sides with the √krand
contingent (Sig. Aor. 99 n. 254), though without argument, simply asserting “…
kann nicht … zum Wz.-Aor. von kram gestellt werden.” On the one hand, of course,
the argument against √kram is obvious: it is a seṭ root -- its 3rd sg. root aor. should be,
and in fact is, ákramīt. But there are countervailing arguments. √krand is found with
the preverb prá in the RV only in IX.77.1 and, at least acdg. to MonWms., nowhere
else in Skt., whereas prá √kram is common. Vs. 4d, containing the other occurrence
of suvitā́ya dāváne, also contains a verb of movement (at least acdg. to me and Ge),
prá bharadhve ‘press forward’; moreover, suvitā́ya elsewhere in the RV regularly
appears with verbs of motion (cf., e.g., nearby V.57.1 suvitā́ya gantana), whereas it
does not fit easily with verbs of proclaiming (though cf. VIII.27.10 prá ṇaḥ
pū́rvasmai suvitā́ya vocata). As for the morphological problem, from the fairly
common (9x) 3rd pl. root aor. (á)kramuḥ, an aniṭ-type kran could easily be
backformed. If the verb does belong with √kram and the spy therefore strides forth,
rather than roars forth, an entity like the sun makes good sense.
The pāda-initial árcā exactly matches pāda-init. árcā in the opening vs. of the
opening hymn in the Marut cycle, V.52.1. As there, so here, we can read the preverb
prá with that verb, borrowing it either from the vs. initial form or from the third
word in the 2nd pāda. In fact this 2nd prá can be read as a preverb in tmesis either with
árcā or with final bhare (or both), and in the former case, it could be interpr. as
having moved to the end of its clause árcā divé prá right before the caesura with an
opening of 5, rather than being the first word of the 2nd clause prá pṛthivyā́ṛtám
bhare right after the caesura with an opening of 4. In other words, prá is
ambiguously positioned both syntactically and metrically.
Another ambiguous form is táruṣanta (in sandhi) in c, which can be resolved
either as finite 3rd pl. med. táruṣante (so Pp, Gr, etc.) or an act. pres. part. masc. pl.
táruṣantaḥ. In the first instance it owes its accent to its clause-init. position; in the
latter, because it’s a participle. Since this stem has exactly 3 forms in all of Skt. --
this one, an active taruṣema, and a med. 3rd pl. (-anta replacement?) taruṣanta, there
is no way to tell, though, since taruṣanta could also belong to an underlyingly active
stem, I’m somewhat inclined towards the act. part.

### 59.2  
The publ. interpr. of d follows Thieme (Untersuchungen, p. 39). WG draw
attention to Th’s revised interpr., in Kl. Sch. II.998–99 (and 834), in which he takes
131
mahé as a dual and vidathé as a final dative: “sie halten inne, um den Regen zu
verteilen,” closely followed by WG “… haben zwischen den zwei Grossen (Himmel
und Erde) zur Verteilung (des Regens).” Some of this seems worth adopting.
Because of the antár a dual interpr. of mahé is attractive, but rather than separating
vidáthe from mahé syntactically (the interposition of the caesura, invoked by Thieme
and WG, does not seem sufficient reason) and making it a dative (though the stem is
otherwise only thematic and a dat. should be excluded), it seems best to return to
Old’s suggestion that mahé vidáthe is a dual acc. phrase, as it is in VIII.39.1. I would
then emend the tr. to “the men have taken their places between the two great
divisions [=Heaven and Earth].” This is in fact where the Maruts as thunderstorm are
positioned -- in the midspace.

### 59.3  
The various tr. configure these four similes somewhat differently; I won’t
comment in detail on these versions. The most puzzling one is the first, in great part
because it is not clear what the Maruts’ horn would be -- perhaps the superstructure
of their helmets? or their lightning bolts? (Sāy. takes it as their turban.) Ge suggests
that it has a double meaning, horn and Selbstgefühl, but we still need some physical
aspect of the Maruts that could be compared to cowhorns, so the second abstract
sense doesn’t help much.
Most interpr. take sū́ryo ná cákṣuḥ either as a mistake for gen. sū́raḥ (so Gr,
e.g.) or as a decomposed bahuvrīhi, both yielding “like the eye of the sun.” I see no
reason to adopt either interpr. The suggested phrase, with a proper gen., is found in
5d sū́ryasya cákṣuḥ (and, of course, elsewhere) in the same metrical position. If
Śyāvāśva had wanted to say that here, he would have. Instead he must be comparing
the Maruts’ eye to the sun, with both in the nom. Since sū́ryasya cákṣuḥ is a fairly
common expression, its appearance in vs. 5 can be seen as poetic repair of the double
nom. in our vs. In my view the quality held in common by sun and eye is the light
emitted in the journey through space, but this depends on one’s interpr. of visárjane.
Ge gives it a later sense not otherwise found in the RV (Aufhören ‘stopping’, sim.
WG Schwinden); Re takes it as ‘expansion’. I see it as a variant of ví √sṛ
‘stream/run/spread through’. Cf. rájaso visāré I.79.1, used of Agni compared to the
sun. In fact, we might consider the two phrases to be variants of each other; both are
pāda final, with I.79.1 in a dimeter (hence iambic) cadence, while ours provides a
Jagatī cadence.

### 59.4  
Pāda b succinctly summarizes the special skills of the Maruts, which lie in
their ability both to produce praise poetry and to perform hypermasculine feats.
The sandhi of kás kā́vyā is irregular, but connected to similar irregular sandhis
before kaví- elsewhere. See comm. ad VII.18.2.

### 59.5  
The simile in pāda a requires a hidden term of comparison. The “reddish
horses” (áśvāḥ … aruṣā́saḥ) must be, covertly, the flames of a fire; that is why they
have the same lineage, because they all flare up from the same source. I doubt that
the poet was telling us that all red horses have the same bloodlines!
132
The two middle similes (b, c) seem redundantly phrased, in that in each case
one of the terms applied to the subject also provides the verb: prayúdhaḥ prá …
yuyudhuḥ (b), suvṛ́dho vāvṛdhuḥ (c). I do not understand the stylistic point of this
redundancy, but since it’s repeated in adjacent pādas it must be deliberate.
I also don’t understand the utá in b, placed between preverb and verb (prótá
yuyudhuḥ) and with nothing obvious to conjoin. Klein (DGRV I.373–74) takes it as
conjoining b with a, but gives no explanation for its position, whose extreme rarity
he notes.
Another anomaly in b is the metrical shape of the verb, in pāda-final position:
yuyudhuḥ would be far better read *yūyudhuḥ. Although no forms of this poorly
attested perfect is transmitted with long reduplication, it’s worth noting the hapax
redupl. i-stem yū́yudhi- (X.149.4), a variant of yúyudhi- (2x).

### 59.7  
This vs. contains several syntactic ambiguities of not much moment. The rel.
prn. yé in the 1st hemistich can in principle be picked up either áśvāsaḥ ‘horses’ or
eṣām ‘of them [=Maruts]’, and in fact either the horses or the Maruts could easily be
compared to birds. I don’t see any way to decide, though it’s true that the default ref.
of any masc. pl. in a Marut hymn is the Maruts.
In b bṛhatáḥ can in principle be acc. pl., gen. sg., or abl. sg., so that it could
technically modify any of the three nouns in that pāda: acc. pl. ántān, gen. sg. diváḥ,
or abl. sg. sā́nunaḥ, and it is found with both diváḥ and snóḥ (alt. form of sā́nunaḥ)
elsewhere. With the standard tr., I take it with ‘back’. Flg. Ge and Re, I assume that
the ‘back’ is heaven’s -- and in fact the gen. diváḥ could be read both with ántān and
with sā́nunaḥ, between which it is positioned. WG suggest rather that it’s the back of
the earth, namely the mountains, and this is worth considering. If they’re coming
from the mountain, it may explain why/how they have stirred the nabhanú- of the
mountain. Still, the clear phrase diváḥ … sā́nu in the next hymn (V.60.3b) favors
‘heaven’.
On nabhanú- see comm. ad IV.19.7.

### 59.8  
The second clause of pāda a, áditir vītáye naḥ, is underspecified and has been
variously interpr. Since vītáye is frequently used in stereotyped passages of gods
‘pursuing’ the oblation, often with a verb of motion, I supply this context here. For
parallels, cf., e.g., VIII.20.10 havyā́no vītáye gata.
The nom. pl. demon. eté is pāda-final, which seems an odd position for such a
pronoun. But a glance at Lub’s Concordance shows that eté is found in just that place
fairly commonly -- e.g., in the next hymn, V.60.5a.
## 60 Maruts

### 60.1  
The opening of the hymn, ī́ḷe agním, is a flipping of the opening of the first
hymn in the RV, I.1.1 agním īḷe, but this phrase, in both orders, is found a number of
times in the RV. However, it’s worth noting that this is the only other place where it
opens a hymn.
133
This is the only occurrence of the ppl. prasattá- ‘seated to the fore/in front’,
and it here seems a substitute for the standard puróhita- ‘placed in front’, of Agni as
the offering fire on the ritual ground. If ī́ḷe agním is a conscious evocation of RV
I.1.1 (or a templatic Agni hymn), then prasattáḥ could be evoking the third word of
I.1.1 (agním īḷe) puróhitam.
However, the gambling phrase that follows goes off in a very different
direction; as is recognized by all standard tr., the phrase ví cayat kṛtám is dicing
vocabulary. For the VP see I.132.1 and Falk (1986, Bruderschaft und Würfelspiel, pp.
126–28).

### 60.2  
The parallelism between the two loc. phrases pṛ̥ṣatīṣu śrutā́su (a) and
sukhéṣu … rátheṣu (b) seems clear, but this entails that the Maruts are mounted both
on their horses and on their chariots. This is a price that most tr. are willing to pay,
but Re avoids it at the price of the parallelism, by attaching the dappled females to
the chariots: “… qui sont montés sur les chars aisés conduit par les (antilopes)
tachetées.” Since the Maruts are clearly astride horses in the next hymn, V.61.3, I
think we can have them there here as well.
The person changes between hemistichs from 3rd (ab: yé tasthúḥ) in the rel. cl.
to 2nd (cd: voc. ugrāḥ … vaḥ) in the main cl.. This is hardly unusual in the RV. The
standard tr. register this anacoluthon in various ways, WG most sharply, by
supplying a main cl. for ab: “(Sie sind es), die …” and separating the two hemistichs
into two sentences. This seems unnec.
V.60.2–3: Note the concatenation: 2d … párvataś cit# // 3a #párvataś cit … The two
vss. also hold the verb rejate/rejata steady (2d, 3b, though in slightly different
metrical position, both post-caesura, with one pres. and the other injunc.), but in the
first instance it’s earth (pṛthivī́) that trembles and in the 2nd (the back of) heaven
(diváḥ, initial in its pāda like pṛthivī́). So the standard pair heaven/earth are
contrasted and identically positioned, but they are grammatically non-parallel. There
is also a repetition of ‘fear’, though again in different forms -- nominal bhiyā́in 2c,
pf. bibhāya in 3c, both pāda-final. This kind of patterned and varied repetition may
not reach the heights of poetic art, but it is a pleasing demonstration of the way a
RVic poet infuses freshness into the clichéś that are his bread-and-butter.

### 60.4  
The “marks of greatness” of the publ. tr. follows Re’s “signes-de-grandeur”;
máhāṃsi must refer to something that can be visible on their bodies.

### 60.5  
The standard tr. (all ultimately deriving from Sāy.) take Rudra and Pṛśni as
the joint subj. of a verb to be supplied (“prepared,” vel sim.), with sudínā as obj. (e.g.,
Ge “Ihr … Vater … (und) … Pṛśni (haben) den Marut schöne Tage (bereitet)”). This
seems unnec. The first part of this hemistich (through pṛ́śniḥ) seems simply to define
the Maruts’ parentage: pitā́… rudráḥ is answered by pṛ́śniḥ; no ‘mother’ is
necessary, because her role as their mother is virtually her only function in the RV
and because the bahuvr. pṛ́śni-mātar- ‘having P. as their mother’, modifying the
134
Maruts, is used three times by Śyāvāśva in this cycle (V.57.2, 3, 59.6). As for sudínā,
it is used several times in the kind of nominal cl. envisioned in the publ. tr.; cf. IV.4.7
víśvéd asmai sudínā … “All (days) (will be) day-bright for him”; VII.11.2 áhāny
asmai sudínā bhavanti “for him the days become bright shining,” both with dat. as
here.
The epithet sudúghā used of Pṛśni may be somewhat ironically meant. At
least in VI.66 it is said that Pṛśni only once produced milk (vs. 1), that is, she milked
out her sons the Maruts, but that she did not give milk to them (vs. 5).

### 60.6  
The second hemistich has a few complications. We can start with the utá vā:
what is it conjoining? Ge and Re seem to take it as conjoining the vocc. rudrāḥ and
ágne, and Klein (DGRV II.170) explicitly follows this interpr., though giving no
other exx. of conjoined vocatives. But esp. given the various choices of place given
in ab, conjoined by vā, the more natural reading is to assume it offers another
alternative to átaḥ ‘from there’ in c; the most natural of those choices would be “or
(from) here.” WG, by contrast, recognize that a choice of locations is what is
probably meant, but have to supply the 2nd alternative complete: “von da aus … oder
(von wo ihr euch) auch nun (befindet).” My solution may be too tricky to be
acceptable, but I think the ‘here’ is implicit in the asya/asyá. First, note that the
cross-pāda sandhi … asyā́gne … is compatible with either an unaccented or an
accented gen. sg. pronoun. The Pp. takes it as the former, but if it is to be construed
with havíṣaḥ in the next pāda, as the standard tr. (incl. the publ. tr.) take it, as an
adjective it should be accented (asyá). I do think it has an adjectival role with havíṣaḥ,
but I also think this near-deictic is a substitute for an adverb of place like ihá or itás,
and the possibility of non-accentuation is an indirect indication that it can also be
taken independently of havíṣaḥ to express the potential location of the Rudras here
and now on the ritual ground with Agni. I would slightly adjust the tr. to “from there,
o Rudras, or (here and) now, o Agni, be cognizant …” The awkwardness of folding
Agni into the Maruts’ actions is also on view in the next vs.
I do not understand the presence of the future impv. vittā́t. Perhaps with Sāy.
(… āgacchateti śeṣaḥ), we should supply a verb of motion that implicitly precedes
the action of vittā́t: “from there (come here and) take cognizance …” The following
hymn, V.61, gives some support to this scenario. In V.61.17 Night is ordered to carry
off the speaker’s hymns to his patron, with an ordinary impv. párā vaha, while the
flg. vs. contains a future impv. vocatāt (V.61.18) ordering her to speak for him once
she gets there. It may also be that the future impv. was used here for convenience
because the future impv. neutralizes number (also person, but that’s irrelevant here)
and thus can be applicable both to the plural Rudras and the singular Agni. It’s
accented because it follows an extrasentential voc. and therefore counts as being
pāda-initial.
The standard tr. take yád as the neut. rel. prn. with havíṣ- as antecedent (“…
the oblation that we sacrifice”), but √yaj never takes the offering as object, but rather
the god who is the recipient. I therefore prefer to take yád as the subordinating conj.
135

### 60.7  
The first pāda, agníś ca yán maruto viśvavedasaḥ, is a particularly complex
ex. of a reverse vā́yav índraś ca construction, with the subordinator yád placed, in
modified Wackernagel’s Position, after the first term and a voc. adj. attached to the
second. This sequence of three vss. (6–8) contains three different versions of the
awkward pairing of singular and plural entities in a voc. phrase: vs. 6 with its
independent non-adjacent vocc. rudrāḥ … ágne, this vā́yav índraś ca construction,
and 8a ágne marúdbhiḥ with an instr. of accompaniment. Note that the adj.
viśvavedasaḥ, which, since it’s voc., should technically only modify the Maruts, is
more commonly applied to Agni in the RV, and so he should probably be included in
its domain.
The problematic epithet ríśādas- has already been discussed; see comm. ad
I.2.7. As indicated there, the publ. tr. weakly favors Th’s ‘caring for the stranger’
over Hoffmann’s ‘fastidious’. The original meaning is difficult to get to, because by
either etymology (or any other one) the word would by this time be entirely opaque
and, with no synchronic lexical anchoring, it would have been free to float
semantically and get attached to other words secondarily. It is often used of the
Ādityas, both collectively and individually, for whom ‘caring for the stranger’ is a
quite congenial reading. But it is also, as here, often used of the Maruts, where it is
not so good a fit. But generally when it is applied to the Maruts, it is either with
reference to their benevolent and generous aspect (as here, where they are
viśvavedasaḥ ‘affording all possessions’ and are urged vāmáṃ dhatta “establish a
thing of value”) or is found nearby occurrences with the Ādityas (so here and
V.61.16, with Mitra and/or Varuṇa V.64.1, 66.1, 67.2; cf. also I.186.8 riśā́daso
mitrayújaḥ) or both (cf. Agni, the Ādityas, and the Maruts all as both viśvávedasaḥ
and riśādasaḥ in VIII.27.4).

### 60.8  
The publ. tr. takes āyúbhiḥ in c as a PN (as often), thus identifying a separate
group of co-soma-drinkers. The standard tr. take the instr. phrase in c as a further
characterization of the Maruts, with āyú- as ‘langlebig’ (Ge, WG), ‘vigilants’ (Re). I
now think this is the better course and would emend the tr. to “along with the pure,
lively ones who set all in motion.”
## 61 Maruts
For the structure of this hymn and its place in the series, see publ. intro.
Although there is an itihāsa in the Bṛhaddevatā (V.50) that supposedly recounts the
circumstances of Śyāvāśva’s composition, it was clearly constructed secondarily and
fancifully on the basis of the Rigvedic text (see both Old and Ge).

### 61.1  
Note the doubly marked superlative śréṣṭhatama- (also I.113.12), which
therefore ought to be rendered as “the most fairest.” It must be nom., not voc.,
because of its accent, since in a standard voc. phrase it would be unaccented flg.
unaccented naraḥ.
It is somewhat notable that the Maruts are referred to éka-ekaḥ “one by one,”
since they are usually not differentiated at all.
136
V.61.1–2: These two vss. contain a fairly high percentage of the total number of
RVic 2nd pl. active pfs., with the poorly characterized ending -a on the weak stem:
āyayá (1b), śeka, yaya (2b). Macd. (VG p. 358) lists only twelve forms in all of
Vedic (some of which have more than one token) of the 2nd pl. act. pf., and one of
these (anāha) is better interpr. otherwise (see comm. ad VIII.48.5).

### 61.2  
kathā́can be read thus or as kathā́ā́, with the same preverb as in the
univerbated āyayá in the rel. cl. of 1b. The Pp. does not read the preverb. It is
possible that the variation between kathám in the first question of the pāda and kathā́
is meant to enable the preverb reading, and the publ. tr. reflects that.
With Ge and Re I assume a gapped kvà in c and in 3a. WG simply take them
as questions without an explicit interrogative (“Ist ein Sattel auf einem Rücken …?”
etc.). The difference is unimportant rhetorically.

### 61.3  
For this vs. see publ. intro.; as pointed out there, the simile in c can either
refer to sex or to childbirth.
It is interesting that sakthā́ni is plural. Although there are plural ‘men’ (náraḥ)
and therefore twice as many thighs as men, in Classical Sanskrit it is my impression
that the dual would ordinarily be used in such a situation, where a number of men
each spread their two thighs. RV seems more flexible.
V.61.3–4: The final word of vs. 3 is jánayaḥ, while the final word of the 1st hemistich
of 4 is (bhadra-)jānayaḥ, showing the standard distribution of the ‘wife’ word, with
simplex jáni- and jāni- as 2nd cmpd. member. The distrib. here is complicated by the
fact that 3c … ná jánayaḥ produces an unusual cadence of four shorts, which
*jā́nayaḥ would easily repair. But since the long-vowel variant never shows up as a
simplex, we should presumably resist the temptation to emend.

### 61.4  
The 2nd pl. impv. etana shows an unexpected full-grade root syllable in the
Saṃhitā text, but is read with metrically problematic but morphologically “correct”
zero-grade in the Pp (itana). Of course, such full-grade 2nd pl. impvs. are found
elsewhere, but in this case I wonder if it’s a secondary extraction from forms cmpded
with the preverb ā́, as in V.87.8, also a Marut hymn, with pāda-final étana. See also
disc. ad VI.42.2.

### 61.5  
As noted in the publ. intro., the standard tr. (now incl. WG) take sánat as
meaning ‘gave’ (Ge schenkte, Re a donné, WG geschenkt hat), not ‘gained’; Indeed
Re claims that the stem sána- means ‘give’ in dānastutis, but provides no parallels. I
have found none in any of the occurrences of this stem, but by contrast quite a
number of exx. of sána- in dānastutis with the expected meaning ‘gain’ (I.126.3,
V.30.14; VIII.25.22, 24; 46.22, 29; 68.17; X.62.11). Note, however, the honorable
exception of Klein (DGRV I.431) “That one has obtained [my italics] a herd
consisting of horses …”; Grassmann likewise gives the verb in this passage its
137
standard meaning ‘erlangen’. The only possible reason I can imagine that this array
of skilled philologists resolutely turned their backs on the very clear evidence of the
semantics of this root is that they couldn’t imagine that a female could have won or
gained these prizes -- though, as noted in the publ. intro., it would be just as
anomalous for a female to give them. If I am right that the woman in question is a
favored concubine, or even the Favorite Wife (Vāvātā) of later Vedic ritual, of
Śyāvāśva’s royal patron, then he may have indulged her with a little gift at the time
of the general distribution of bounty. She does, after all, perform services for him, as
pāda d shows.
śatā́vayam is almost universally interpr. as ‘consisting of a hundred
(/hundreds of) sheep’, with the 2nd member derived from ávi- (so Gr, Ge, Re, Klein;
also AiG II.2.140 and II.1 Nachtr. 34), and certainly sheep fit nicely into a sequence
with horses and cows. WG demur, suggesting that such a cmpd should rather be
*śatāvya- and proposing an alternate analysis on the model of cátur-vaya- ‘fourfold’
(2x) -- hence “livestock in horses and cows a hundred fold.” However, the -vaya- of
cátur-vaya- is not otherwise found in such cmpds and has no obvious source (see
AiG II.2.906), and the long final vowel of the first member śatā́- would not be quite
as easily explained (though stems like śatā́magha- and śatāvant- also show
unetymological long vowels). I do think WG’s point is well-taken that *avaya- is an
unlikely deriv. to ávi-, esp. since that stem shows “closed” inflection, but -vaya- ‘-
fold’ has its own problems. I suggest rather that the cmpd orig. contained the wellattested deriv. avyáya- ‘sheep-y, ovine’ (hence *śatāvyaya-), which has undergone
haplology of the first y. Note that there's a lot of phononological play in these vss.
(sibilants and v's, with a's), inspired by the poet's name Śyāva-aśva: 5a sā́áśvi
yam ...
b śatā́vayam ... c śyāvá-aśva [or HvN’s śyāvāśu
va] ... 6a śáśī́ yasī ... b … vásyasī,
which could have contributed to the deformation of the underlying cmpd. I would
therefore keep the older meaning, but with a different analysis of the 2nd member.
Note also that the end of c, (-stut)āya yā́, is nearly identical to the ends of 1b
āyayá and 2b (kath)ā́yaya.
V.61.6–8: As indicated in the publ. tr., I consider these vss. a digression reflecting on
the character of women in general, motivated by the introduction of the winning
woman in vs. 5.

### 61.6  
The comparative śáśīyas- is attested only twice in the RV, here and in
IV.32.3. Though they have different senses in the two passages (‘more reliable’ here,
‘more numerous’ there, at least by my interpr.), the semantic dev. from the positive
śáśvant- ‘regularly recurring, in unbroken sequence, each and every’ to the two
senses of the comp. is fairly straightforward. Here, regularly recurring > constant >
reliable. In VIII.1.34 this development takes a sexual turn, with a śáśvatī nā́rī being
one who is “ever ready” for sex (in my interpr.), and a sexual nuance is not ruled out
in our passage either -- though here the emphasis is on her dependable qualities
compared to the unsatisfactory man.
138

### 61.7  
The relativization is loose, at least in the Eng. rendering. Literally it should
be “More reliable than a man is a woman who discerns the thirsting one …,” etc.
The lexeme ví √jñā means ‘discern, recognize’, and a full rendering of the
implication of these VPS would be something like “who recognizes (that a particular
man) is famished …” -- the idea presumably being that, having recognized their
plights, she then sees to them, each in his own need. I have folded this two-step
process into ‘pay attention to’. If she does see to the needs of each, the third in the
series kāmínam ‘the desirous / lusting one’ again introduces the sexual: she feeds,
clothes, and has sex with the three in turn, at least by my interpr. The standard tr.
have a tendency to attenuate the third term -- e.g., Klein (DGRV I.432) “the one
desiring (aid)” -- but in this saucy hymn I think sex is never far from the surface. I do
have to admit, however, that kāmín- is not otherwise used of sexual desire, but has a
more general application, incl. to the Maruts in this same cycle (V.53.16).

### 61.8  
On vaíradeya-, lit. ‘what is to be given for a man/hero’, as Wergeld or blood
money, see Roth (ZDMG 41: 672–76) and Macdonell-Keith Vedic Index s.v. vaira.
Another indirect ref. to the same phenomenon is found in II.32.4 vīráṃ śatádāyam “a
hero (for whom) a hundred (cows) are to be given.” In our case the person in
question is hardly worth the name ‘man’ and would be better off dead than alive,
since his relatives would still receive the standard recompense for a vīrá, whatever
his personal failings had been. It is telling that he is called a paṇí- ‘niggard’, a
reminder to Śyāvāśva’s patron that stinginess is a grave flaw.

### 61.9  
On this vs. see publ. intro. As detailed there, I take the vs. as an elaborate
pun. On the one hand a young woman (yuvatíḥ) is narrating the course of a race (or
perhaps the progress of the horses that are to be given to the poet as his prize) to the
poet -- thus the word vartaní- ‘course, track’ in b and the two chestnut (horses)
(róhitā) in c. (Note also that śyāvá- is not only the short form of the poet’s name but
also, more usually, a horse color term.) But a more intimate scene is signalled by her
low voice (√rap is ordinarily used of murmuring or muttering; see the esp. telling
passage in the Yama/Yamī hymn X.10.4, where it is contrasted with √vad), her use
of a nickname “Dusky” (śyāvá-), and esp. the pf. part. mamandúṣī ‘having
intoxicated, beguiled, seduced’ (I follow Kü [366–67] in taking the pf. as transitive
and supplying ‘me’ as its obj.). And the whole vs. can be read as a description of
sexual intercourse. The ‘course’ would be the course of the sex act, and the two
ruddy ones in c can be any paired female body parts; given the use of the same verb
ví √yam here as in 3b, where men spread their thighs, they may be thighs, but the
labia and breasts are also possible. Both Ge and Re take the dat. purumīḷhā́ya in c as
a PN and therefore not coreferential with śyāvā́ya in b. But it makes more sense to
interpr. purumīḷhá- in its full lexical sense ‘having many rewards’ (so also WG),
describing the poet (víprāya in d) who has received his dakṣiṇā from his patron and
who is in fact Śyāvāśva -- and implying that part of this dakṣiṇā is the seductive
woman in this very vs. On Purumīḍha in later Vedic see comm. on the next vs.
139
As a number of others have noted (e.g., Hoffmann, Injunk. 150), though the
Pp. reads arapat, the actual form may be the injunctive rapat; the Pp’s augment is
not realized metrically or in the transmitted text. This doesn’t affect the interpr. one
way or the other. Though Gr lists práti as a preverb with rapat, this lexeme is not
otherwise found (in all of Skt., if Mon-Wms is to be believed), and given the distance
between the two words and what would be an unusual position for a preverb in
tmesis (pāda-initial but in the pāda after the verb), I think it unlikely that they are to
be construed together. I take práti as adverbial, reinforcing the intimacy of the scene,
hence my ‘face to face’.

### 61.10  
My interpr. of the dānastuti vs. proper differs from the standard, which has
in my opinion been unduly affected by the later Vedic rationalization of the passage.
Both JB (I.151) and PB (XIII.7.12) briefly narrate a tale in which Purumīḍha and
Taranta figure as the two sons of Vaidadaśvi, but as we just saw, purumīḷhá- is better
taken in its literal sense. I also take tarantá- not as a PN but in lexical value. In either
case it is likely a thematization of the pres. participle tárant- (cf. AiG II.2.211),
showing the same accent shift as AV jīvantá- from jī́vant-, and it should mean
‘overcoming, victorious’ à ‘victor’. By contrast I do think vaídadaśvi- is a PN, but a
speaking name, as the vṛddhi deriv. of *vidád-aśva- ‘finding / acquiring horses’ (cf.
vidád-vasu-), an appropriate name for a patron. It is worth noting that both names
Śyāvāśva and Vaidadaśvi have Iranian counterparts; see Mayrhofer Personennamen
s.vv.
How to distribute yáḥ and yáthā and whether to interpr. the latter as a
subordinator or a simile marker are the syntactic problems in this vs., and diff. tr.
have diff. solutions. I take yáḥ as marking a generalizing rel. cl. (‘whoever …’) and
yáthā as a simile marker, with c a nominal cl. functioning as the main clause to ab.
The verb in b, dádat is a short-vowel subjunctive (“whoever will give …”) but can
also be interpr. as a thematized injunc., which in turn can be read with Vaiśvadaśvi
(“as V. did”). If I had had the courage of my convictions, “did” would not be in
parens. in the publ. tr.

### 61.11  
As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. marks the beginning of the second,
more conventional hymn in this composite, at least in my analysis.
Technically speaking ‘horses’ should be in parens.
It is not clear if īm has its usual acc. function: it could anticipate mádhu in b,
though that seems somewhat distant and that participial phrase is otherwise fully
contained in b; it could function as a reflexive marker (“drive themselves”); or it may
be one of the rare instances of functionless īm.
I have silently depluralized śrávāṃsi, since ‘fames’ is not English. Perhaps
the point here is that each Marut has his own śrávas, though, since they are seldom
distinguished, this may be overthinking it.

### 61.12  
This vs. has produced more consternation than it deserves, because of the
reluctance of many interpr. to allow yéṣām to be coreferential with the subj. of
140
vibhrā́jante. In these interpr., if the subj. of that verb is the Maruts, then another
referent for yéṣām must be found; if yéṣām refers to the Maruts, then another subj. of
the verb must be found. See Old’s lengthy disc., which includes the differing
suggestions of numerous scholars (incl. also interpr. yéṣām as *yé eṣām) but doesn’t
reach firm conclusions. Of modern interpr., Re takes yéṣām as the Maruts and makes
ródasī the subj. of the verb: “les Deux Mondes brillent au loin”; in a fractured sense
this goes back to Max Müller’s tr. in SBE 32, but Müller emended the verb to
*bhrā́jate and took ródasī as sg., whereas Re mentions no such emendation and
seems to be taking ródasī as dual, which will certainly not work grammatically with
a pl. verb. WG seem to have accepted the *yé eṣām interpr. Ge, surprisingly, is more
relaxed and allows coreference under the rubric of “der reflexive Gebrauch des
Relativs,” which seems perfectly plausible to me: they flash with their own splendour.
The “bright ornament” of c is the sun: rukmá- is so used elsewhere in clearer
context (VI.51.1, VII.63.4).

### 61.13  
I have taken the two negated adjectives at the end of b and c, ánedyaḥ and
ápratiṣkutaḥ, as predicated, in contrast to all the standard tr. There is, of course, no
way to tell.

### 61.15  
Whose dhī́- is it? Ge, Re, and WG all assume it is the mortal’s (e.g., Ge “Ihr
… führet den Sterblichen recht nach seinem Sinn”), but the placement of the phrase
itthā́dhiyā́right after praṇetā́raḥ and at some distance from mártam at least weakly
suggests that it is the Maruts’s. Since, as I have had occasion to remark many times,
the Maruts sometimes have the role of verbal praisers and sometimes are the
recipients of the same, I think both readings are possible and the poet may have
wanted it to remain ambiguous. Tichy’s tr. (-tar-stems, 300–301) seems to attribute
the dhī́- to the Maruts or at least remains neutral: “Ihr bringt den Menschen vorwärts
… recht mit Bedacht.”
Note that in the cmpd yāma-hūti- it is the Maruts’ journeys (yā́ma-, 1st
member) but the mortal’s invocations (-hūti-, 2nd member).
V.61.17–19: As noted in the publ. intro., the patron’s name Rathavīti (‘pursuit of the
chariot’?) in 18, 19 is punned upon. In 17 (before he is explicitly mentioned, though
the patronymic Dārbhya would presumably evoke him) Night is asked to carry the
hymns “like a charioteer” (rathī́r iva); in 18 the 2nd cmpd. member -vīti- is derived
from the same root √vī ‘pursue’ that supplies the verb ápa veti ‘goes off track’.

### 61.17  
I do not understand why the goddess Night acts as the intermediary between
the poet and his patron; see Ge’s n. 17–19, which doesn’t seem to me entirely
satisfactory.

### 61.18  
The Rathavīti phrase is in the loc.; the publ. tr. renders it as if the addressee,
which is technically incorrect. It is either a loc. absol. without participle or a
141
“chez/bei” expression: “speak for me thus when R. (is present) / at R’s.” Since the
net result is the same, I have kept the easier-to-parse addressee tr.

### 61.19  
Ge and Re take gómatīḥ as a ref. to the Gomatī river; WG to “cow-rich
lands.” I think it’s likely a pun, and I supply víśaḥ ‘clans’ for one half of the pun.
[V.62-78 JPB]
## 79 Dawn
The meter of this hymn is Paṅkti, with five 8-syllable pādas. The fifth in all
vss. is the refrain, a voc. phrase sújāte aśvasūnṛte “o well-born lady, liberal with
horses,” which is essentially detachable. So the hymn comes across as standard
Anuṣṭubh, with an appended and superfluous refrain. As indicated in the publ. tr., the
contents are for the most part uninspired, contrary to most Dawn hymns, though
closer inspection reveals more intricate patterns than a superficial reading turned up.
V.79.1–3: These three vss. follow the same pattern: Dawn is urged to repeat for us
now a previous action she performed in the presence of and for the benefit of a
previous patron. The name Satyaśravas Vāyya appears in all three vss. (The Anukr.
attributes the hymn to Satyaśravas Ātreya, but as Ge points out [n. 1d] he is surely
the patron, not the poet.) Curiously in vss. 1 and 3 Satyaśravas Vāyya is identified as
the previous patron, while in vs. 2 he is the current patron and the previous patron
has a different name. This chronological slippage is somewhat confusing -- and is
emphasized by having identical clauses differing only in the tense/mood of the verb
and the demonstrative vs. relative pronoun:
2cd sā́vy ùcha sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé
3cd yó vyaúchaḥ sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé
The insistence on this generous patron of the past has a purpose: there is a
parallel insistence on the patrons of today in the rest of the hymn. Although only
Dawn is addressed, the poet is clearly sending a message to the patrons, to
generously redistribute the wealth that Dawn will bestow on them, on the model of
Satyaśravas.

### 79.1  
The phrase mahé … rāyé divítmatī is very reminiscent of IV.31.11 mahó
rāyé divítmate, with an adverbial maháḥ but a dat. divítmate modifying rāyé. See
comm. ad loc. It seems likely that our fem. divítmatī is a nonce adaptation to the fem.
context. As for divítmant-, I now tentatively accept the analysis of divít- as
containing the root noun -i-t- and would alter the tr. to “as one coming from heaven”
or “as heaven-sent one.”
V.79.2–3: Is the comparative ‘mightier’ (sáhīyas-) used to assert that Satyaśravas
Vāyya is mightier than Sunītha Śaucadratha?
142
The Pp. reads accented ví even directly before accented aúchaḥ (2b, 3c),
where we might expect univerbation and loss of accent on the preverb. The Saṃhitā
text is of course ambiguous.
sā́with the 2nd ps. impv. ucha simply shows the common use of the sá/tám prn.
with 2nd ps. impvs.; see my 1992 “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?”
Elaborate semantic/functional interpr., like Re’s “de la même manière, dans les
mêmes conditions (heureuses)” (EVP 3, ad loc.) or WG’s yā́… sā́… “welche du …
als solche du” are unnec.

### 79.3  
yó beginning pāda c represents yā́+ u (note Pp. yó íti), but the apparent masc.
form causes a momentary stir.

### 79.4  
With the standard tr. I take cd as the main cl. corresponding to the rel. cl. in
ab, despite the lack of a resumptive pronoun and of a verb. The pattern established in
the first 3 vss. of alternating rel. and main clauses makes this interpr. likely, even
though the subjects have changed.
Contra Ge, who takes ab as referring to the singers and cd to the patrons, I
think both hemistichs refer to the singers. So also Re and WG, an interpr. that goes
back to Sāy. (see Ge’s n. 4). Here the circulation of wealth appears to be a two-way
transaction: the poets praise Dawn and receive bounties. How that happens is laid out
in the next few vss., which complicate the two-way model.

### 79.5  
The two-party sketch in vs. 4 gives way to a three-party model: when Dawn
gives them the go-ahead, as it were, the patrons, who have not yet been mentioned in
the hymn as a class, bestow bounties on the poets.
This vs. presents some difficulties, not least the referent(s) of the various
plurals and their grammatical identity. With most, I take the gaṇā́ḥ to be the
priest/poets who were also the subj. of the preceding vs. and who greeted Dawn with
praise in 4ab. The first hemistich of this vs. expresses the potential reciprocity for
this praise: Dawn considers its producers worthy to be given bounties, the same
bounties referred to in 5c.
I part company with the standard tr. in the 2nd hemistich. Most take the subj.
here to be the patrons, who either physically surround the priest/poets (so I read Old)
while giving to them or have succeeded (using a sense of pári √dhā [‘conclude’ not
found till later]) in giving, finished giving to them (Ge, Re, WG). By contrast I
consider the subject still to be the priest/poets. They surround the patrons, who are
giving to them. dádataḥ is of course grammatically ambiguous: I take it as acc. pl.,
while the rest interpr. it as nom. pl. The use of the word gaṇá- ‘throng’ to refer to the
poets in ab helps explain the surprisingly physical verb ‘surround’ in cd: the picture
is of the over-eager (váṣṭi-) ritual recipients almost ganging up on the patrons.
V.79.6–7: Here the patrons, who have properly compensated the priest/poets, receive
their own reward from Dawn. Interestingly it is not material, but rather yáśas- ‘glory’
-- though glory consisting of heroes (vīrávat), meaning, narrowly, sons, but also men
143
belonging to our side who will perform well in warfare and acquire battle glory. The
emphasis on non-material rewards for the patrons continues in vs. 7 with “lofty
brilliance and glory” (dyumna̐bṛhád yáśaḥ), while the poets receive material gifts,
rā́dhāṃsi áśvyā gavyā́“benefits consisting of horses and cows.” For a similar split
between material rewards for the singers and non-material ones for the patrons see
V.86.6, where the patrons get “lofty fame” (śrávo bṛhát) and the singers get wealth
and refreshment (rayím … íṣam).

### 79.8  
The two-party model returns here, with Dawn bringing the gifts directly to
the priest/poets.

### 79.9  
The last vs. before the summary vs., this one brings the hymn ringcompositionally back to its beginning with its opening impv. vy ùcha ‘dawn forth’, a
lexeme found 4x in vss. 2–3 (2b, 2c, 3b, 3c).
As noted in the publ. intro., this prohibition and its striking simile are the
most notable features of this hymn. The mā́clause contains a present injunctive, not
an aorist. Hoffmann (79) explains it as an inhibitive, not a prohibitive -- his standard
explanation for the use of present injunctives in such contexts. Although IH has
demonstrated that this explanation of the use of pres. injunctives with mā́doesn’t
hold -- they are generally used when an aor. injunc. is not available -- in this case,
Hoffmann’s analysis may be correct. There is a perfectly fine root aor. to √tan and it
in fact occurs once with mā́(I.91.23), so we may need to seek a functional
explanation somewhat in the manner of Hoffmann’s. On the other hand and after
further thought, I wonder if the pres. stem is used in this context in order to express a
durative prohibitive, rather than an inhibitive. That is, starting now, when you dawn,
don’t dawdle at your work. She’s just been ordered to dawn, which makes the start
time now, not in the past, but the poet fears that once she starts she’s going to draw it
out longer than she should. It shouldn’t be inhibitive in KH’s sense, because that
would mean she’s already started the work. On still another hand, however, since this
is functionally the final vs., which refers back to the beginning of the hymn, perhaps
the poet is saying that Dawn has been at work since that beginning and should finish
it up.
It is difficult not to take sū́raḥ as a nom. sg. to a thematic stem (so, e.g., Ge
and Re), although many occurrences of sū́raḥ are better interpr. as gen. sg. to svàr- --
incl. in this same sequence sū́ro arcíṣā in VIII.7.36. WG take it as a gen., but then
must identify a different subj. for tápāti, leading them to introduce Varuṇa and a
superstructure of explanation that seems over-elaborate. As indicated in the publ.
intro., I think the point of contact is the assumption that thieves work at night and if
the sun rises on them, they will be caught out.

### 79.10  
pramī́yase is variously rendered, but ‘diminish’ or the like fits both the root
and the context. Thieme’s principled insistence on ‘tauschen, täuschen’ (ZDMG 41
[1941] 107–8 = KlSch 32–33) produces an unconvincing interpr., requiring further
shoring up: “… die du … nicht getäuscht wirst (= du, deren Absicht zu schenken
144
nicht vereitelt wird).” That Dawn does not diminish in cd harmonizes with the
increase in gifts that the poet urges in ab.
The dat. stotṛ́bhyaḥ may be construed with uchántī rather than pramī́yase,
thus “dawning for the praisers, you do not diminish” (so Re, Th), but this would have
no appreciable effect.
## 80 Dawn
As noted in the publ. intro., every vs. but the first begins with eṣā́‘she, this
one here’.

### 80.1  
In contrast to the relentless nominative representation of Dawn in the rest of
the hymn, this 1st vs. begins with 3 full pādas of accusative describing her.

### 80.3  
I previously accepted the standard view that áprāyu- is a root noun
compound derived from prá √yu (√yu 2 ‘keep away’) and is essentially a variant of
áprayuchant- (cf., e.g., EWA s.v. YAV2
, p. 404 with lit.). There are, of course, two
formal problems with this analysis: the long ā of the preverb, which, notably, is not
found in áprayuchant-, and the lack of the empty -t- suffixed to root nouns ending in
short resonants (cf. dveṣo-yú-t- to this same root). It should also be noted that the Pp.
analyzes áprāyu as ápra-āyu (also in I.89.1); although the Pp. is not always a reliable
guide, its evidence should be considered. The issue has recently been discussed in
detail by Scar (439–40), who in the end rejects the prá √yu interpr. in favor of a
bahuvrīhi with ā́yu- ‘youth, lifespan’, a neut. noun that is less well-attested than both
the neut. ā́yus- ‘id.’ and the derived adj. āyú- ‘lively’. The semantics of this cmpd.
are a little tricky: Vedic people always pray to have their lifetimes lengthened, using
the preverb prá (generally with √tṝ), so *prā́yu- should mean ‘having a lengthened
lifetime’, a good thing, and áprāyu- the reverse, hence a bad thing. However, Scar
suggests ‘nicht alternd, ewig jung’, a good thing. Although it’s somewhat disturbing
that the usually positive collocation of prá and ā́yu(s)- remains positive when
negated, Scar’s reconstruction of the semantic development seems plausible. A
further development from ‘ever young’ à ‘lively’ à ‘not slacking, unremitting’ can
be envisioned -- esp. if, as I think likely, the word ceased to be transparent and got
partially captured by prá √yu and its negated adj. áprayuchant- (a scenario also
sketched by Scar). Note áprayuchan nearby in V.82.8. Though I do not feel that the
publ. translations of áprāyu- need to be altered, my analysis of the form now starts in
a very different place. A somewhat different value is proposed for áprāyuṣ- in
I.127.5, but starting with the same basic elements; see comm. ad loc.
## 81 Savitar
The hymn falls into three symmetrical sections (vss. 1–2, 3, 4–5) based
generally on their verse/pāda-initial elements, but these sections do not correspond to
thematic divisions. The first section, vss. 1–2, is marked by ví. Though the first pāda
of vs. 1 lacks ví, the repetition is insistent starting with pāda b víprā víprasya ...
vipaścítaḥ, followed by hemistich-initial ví in 1c ví, 2a víśvā, 2c ví along with other,
145
internal vi’s: 1c vayunāvíd, 2a kavíḥ# / 2b prásāvīd ... dvipáde / 2d ví rājati#. The ví
may play on the middle syllable of the god’s name savitár-, and it also ties him to the
vípra- he is identified with in 1b. Given that the next hymn (V.82) plays on the first
syllable of his name (su/sav) and the root from which it’s derived, it may not be
farfetched to suggest that this section focuses on the 2nd syllable.
Both hemistichs of the next vs. begin with the rel. prn. (3a yásya, 3c yáḥ), a
relatively low-energy repetition between the vi’s of vss. 1–2 and the utá’s of 4–5. In
these last two vss. the repetition of utá explodes: every pāda save for the last (5d)
begins with utá, seven occurrences in all. Beside these patterns of repetitions, it is
striking that the first and last pādas of the hymn do not participate; the last pāda
serves as an extra-hymnic summary pāda.
The name Savitar is found once in each vs.

### 81.1  
With Ge I take vipaścítaḥ as nom. pl. qualifying the (human) vípra-s, who
attend to the inspiration of “the lofty inspired poet,” namely Savitar (sim., but not
ident., WG). By contrast, Gr, Re, Th (Unters. 21) take vipaścítaḥ as gen. sg.,
modifying Savitar. The latter interpr. requires that the gen. phrase víprasya bṛható
vipáścitaḥ is dependent on mána utá … dhíyaḥ in the previous pāda. In other words,
the poets hitch up the mind and insights of Savitar, not their own. This would not be
impossible but is less likely in the context of Vedic poetic composition, and the
middle voice of yuñjate suggests that the objects of the verb are the poets’ own.
The word páriṣṭutiḥ is a hapax, and the lexeme pari √stu is otherwise only
late and rare. I do not know exactly what it refers to, but it is likely a technical ritual
term.
V.81.2–3: Just as Savitar follows the lead (prayā́ṇam) of Dawn in 2d, the other gods
follow his lead (also prayā́ṇam) in 3a. The masc. rel. prn. yásya beginning 3 makes it
clear that the referent has changed -- which is not clear from the English.

### 81.3  
The publ. tr. takes instr. ójasā as belonging to the gods, whereas the standard
interpr. assign this ójas- to Savitar. Although there is no way to tell from the Skt., I
think “with/through his power” is the better choice, esp. given the parallel instr.
mahitvanā́in d, which is definitely Savitar’s. I would so emend the tr.
The second hemistich at first appears quite straightforward syntactically, but
the syntax clashes with what we expect the sense to be -- and on further inspection
the syntax turns out to be skewed, too. I’m afraid that in the publ. tr. this has
produced regrettable incoherence. Looking at the syntax first, we seem to find a
textbook case of a relative / correlative construction: yáḥ … sá …, with an accented
verb in the rel. cl. vimamé, hence “who measured out the earthly (ones), he …” But
there is a problem, because the direct object of the rel. cl., pā́rthivāni, should be
completed by rájāṃsi, which is technically in the main clause beginning with sá.
This does not bother Ge or Re, who tr. the two acc. pls. together in the rel. cl. (e.g.,
Ge “der die irdischen Räume durchmessen hat …”). WG by contrast do notice the
problem and tr. pā́rthivāni in the rel. cl. and rájāṃsi in the main cl. and supply all the
146
missing parts in each cl.: “(er), der die irdischen (Räume) durchmessen hat, er ist
Etaśa, der … die (irdischen) Räume (durchmessen hat) …,” which is similar to my
publ. tr. -- though a bit more coherent -- but also a bit clumsier. The publ. tr. assumes
that the 2nd set of spaces are ‘heavenly’; cf. IV.53.3 ā́prā rájāmsi divyā́ni pā́rthivā
“(Savitar) has filled the heavenly and earthly spaces.” The semantic problem is posed
by the phrase sá étaśaḥ smack in the middle and apparently starting the main clause,
coreferential with the yáḥ in the rel. cl., which we all had good reason to think was
referring to Savitar. One solution has been to take étaśa- as an adj., ‘dappled’ vel sim
(so Sāy.: etavarṇaḥ śubhraḥ śobhamānaḥ) or ‘hastening’ (so Gr, though not for this
passage). But most take it as the PN Etaśa, the famous, if often enigmatic, horse of
the sun. Following that tactic, as far as I can see we must take it as an identification
or a simile, with Savitar equivalent to Etaśa -- not as a complete change of subject.
There are two ways I can see to do this -- 1) take sá étaśaḥ as a parenthetical
interjection within the relative clause, which otherwise occupies all of cd: “Who
measured out the earthly spaces -- he is Etaśa! -- with his greatness -- god Savitar …”
or 2) to keep the rel./corr. structure but fold étaśaḥ in as unmarked identification /
simile: “Who measured out the earthly (spaces), he, (like/as) Etaśa, measured out the
(heavenly) spaces with his greatness: god Savitar.” I prefer the latter, because it
allows us to supply ‘heavenly’ in the main clause, and surely the point of contact
between Savitar and Etaśa in this context is that Etaśa crosses the heaven daily,
“measuring it out,” as he pulls the sun’s chariot. Etaśa as a measurer of earthly
spaces makes little sense. I would therefore emend the publ. tr. to the 2nd alternative.
That Savitar is identified with Etaśa in one of his aspects may be supported by the
explicit identifications with other figures in the next two vss.: mitró bhavasi (4d),
pūṣā́bhavasi (5b).
V.81.4–5: 4b and 5d are entirely parallel in structure:
4b utá mitró bhavasi deva dhármabhiḥ
5d utá pūṣā́bhavasi deva yā́mabhiḥ
This strict parallelism should extend to the two final instr. pls. -- that is, Savitar
should become the god in question by virtue of a quality/entity held in common and
expressed in the instr. I therefore think it unlikely that dhármabhiḥ is the vague “nach
deinen Eigenschaften” of Ge or “par (tes) dispositions-naturelles” of Re; it needs to
refer to an actual thing, like Pūṣan’s journeys. In the publ. tr. I render it as ‘supports’
(sim. WG “durch deine Unterstützungen”), keeping in mind that Savitar often holds
up his arms, which may function as literal supports. But it may rather be something
like ‘institutes, ordinances’, referring to the regulation of time and activity that
Savitar performs.
## 82 Savitar
As noted in the publ. intro. as well as just above ad V.81, this hymn contains
numerous verbal and nominal forms of the root √sū ‘impel’, whose agent noun
‘Impeller’ Savitar is grammatically. Every vs. in the hymn contains a form of the
name savitár-, but play on the root doesn’t start till vs. 3. There are eight such forms,
147
with a concentration on the impv. in the middle: pres. subj. suvā́ti (3b), aor. injunc.
sāvīḥ (4b), pres. impv. suva (4c, 5b, 5c), them. loc. savé (6b), them. acc.
(satyá)savam (7c), with a return to the original pres. subj. suvā́ti (9c). Starting with
vs. 3, only vs. 8 lacks such a form -- but s
u
vā(dhīr) with distracted suvā fits
phonologically, though not etymologically. We might also note that the first two vss.,
which lack the punning root forms, do contain forms that might be considered
phonological precursors: 1c sarva(-dhā́tamam), 2a sváyaśastaram, 2c svarāj
i
yam.
With so much concentration on form in this hymn, we should not be surprised that
the content is not particularly stimulating.

### 82.1  
As Re points out, this vs. is reminiscent of the Gāyatrī mantra, III.62.10.
Putting them side-by-side, it is difficult not to assume that one of them (presumably
this one) is a deliberately fractured version of the other:
III.62.10 tát savitúr váreṇyam, bhárgo devásya dhīmahi
dhíyo yó naḥ pracodáyāt

### 82.1  
tát savitúr vṛṇīmahe, vayáṃ devásya bhójanam
śréṣṭham sarvadhā́tamam, túram bhágasya dhīmahi
Note esp. the first pādas, whose 1st 2 words are identical and whose last words both
belong to √vṝ ‘choose’. In the 2nd pāda devásya is identically positioned, and the
phrase bhárgaḥ … dhīmahi is echoed by our pāda d bhágasya dhīmahi, but with a
diff. noun (bhága-, not bhárgas-). The remainders of the vss. diverge, but the tone is
certainly set by pāda a and the similarities of b/d. It is difficult to know what to make
of this -- whether the Gāyatrī mantra had already achieved some sort of local fame
that lent itself to parodic imitation or whether the similarities are just the result of the
usual formulaic underlayer (though there are no other vss. that begin tát savitúr). It’s
also somewhat striking (and could be used as an argument either way) that the vs. in
our hymn is not a Gāyatrī but an Anuṣṭubh -- and it is the only Anuṣṭubh in a Gāyatrī
hymn. If III.62.10 was already known as the (or a) Gāyatrī mantra, our poet could be
slyly tweaking that reputation. Or this can all be my post-hoc invention.

### 82.8  
With regard to áprayuchan see disc. of áprāyu- ad V.80.3.
V.82.8–9: There are no overt main clauses in these last two vss., whose vs.-init. rel.
prns. yáḥ hang off the accs. in vs. 7, but it is possible that the vs.-final savitā́(or in 8
deváḥ savitā́) in both cases constitutes a de facto main cl.

### 82.9  
A further question concerns the last clause of 9c, prá ca suvā́ti savitā́. Ge (fld.
by Klein [DGRV I.248 n. 93, 251]) takes cá as subordinating, tr. ‘wenn’, thus
producing a dependent clause dependent on another dependent clause “who …, when
he …” (Re has a fussy interpr. involving an ellipse that I find puzzling.) I see no
reason for Ge’s interpr., but take the ca as conjoining the two clauses ab and c (or
their verbs). The accent on suvā́ti is already accounted for by its presence in a rel. cl.,
and I think it more likely that the poet would end the hymn with a ringing
148
announcement of what Savitar is going to do rather than a conditional uncertainty
about whether he’s going to do it.
The phrase āśrāváyati ślókena is technically an etymological figure,
somewhat obscured by the l-form of ślóka- and its highly lexicalized state.
## 83 Parjanya

### 83.1  
The verb dadhāti can be read with both rétaḥ and gárbham, the latter in the
idiom gárbham √dhā ‘impregnate’, found again in 7a.

### 83.2  
This vs. quickly modulates from the physical to the moral, with Parjanya the
scourge not only of the trees but of demons and evil-doers.

### 83.3  
We might expect *rathī́r iva here, to the vṛkī́-stem rathī́-, but the ending -ī́
must belong instead to the -ín-stem rathín-, which does have an independent
existence. See Old ad loc.
I take the whip in the simile to be lightning; both a whip and a lightning flash
are slender, fast, unpredictable, and have a non-straight trajectory. The flash of
lightning would also do the revealing in pāda b. Note also that thunder is covered in
pāda c and rain in b and d, so lightning is what’s otherwise absent.
“Rain-bearing cloud” (varṣyàṃ nábhaḥ) in d seems like a quick and a bit halfhearted poetic repair of “rain-bearing messengers” (dūtā́n … varṣyā̀n) in b. The two
pādas hold the verb kṛṇute constant.

### 83.5  
Note the unusual geminate in nánnamīti, dissimilated from *námnamīti.
In pāda b the question is whether the scene is set during the thunderstorm,
with frightened quivering livestock, or afterwards, as they gambol in new growth.
Pāda a speaks for the former, c for the latter. Ge (and, it seems, WG) opt for the
latter, while I favor the former, though without strong grounds.
The first three pādas of this vs. begin with yásya; the fourth does not, but ends
with a close phonological match, yacha.

### 83.6  
The default referent of ásuraḥ pitā́naḥ “the lord, our father” here is of
course Parjanya, since this is a Parjanya hymn and the subject is urged to pour out
water (cf., e.g., Hale, Asura, 46–47). However, I wonder if this is not rather a
reference to Dyaus Pitar, or at least an identification of Parjanya with Dyaus Pitar.
For Heaven as pitár- ásura-, see X.124.3 as well as disc. and other related passages
in my “The Divine Revolution of RV X.124” (Ged. Staal, 2016), 294, and of course
Zeus famously ‘rains’ in Greek.
V.83.7–8: These two vss. ring changes in the oppositional pair úd ‘up
and ní ‘down’: 7c ní
añcam, 7d udváto nipādā́ḥ, 8a úd acā ní ṣiñca. Note that 7b
udanvátā might seem to belong with this sequence, but udan- there is the ‘water’
word.
149

### 83.8  
Hoffmann’s positing (Aufs. I.164 = KZ 79 [1965]) of a separate root √añc
‘scoop, draw (water)’ seems unnec., at least for this passage.
## 84 Earth
For a discussion of this hymn as an implicit riddle, see my “A Sanskrit Riddle
in Three Movements: Rig Veda V.84,” in Beyond Hatti: A Tribute to Gary Beckman,
ed. Billie Jean Collins and Piotr Michalowski, 2013, pp. 155-58. Its placement
immediately after the Parjanya hymn, to which it is attached as a kind of pendant, is
important. Note also that all three standard words for ‘earth’ are found in the hymn:
pṛthivī́(1b), bhū́mi- (1c), and kṣám- (3b), though in different cases and usages. The
riddling middle vs. lacks such a word.

### 84.1  
The exclamation with which the hymn opens, báḍ, has a very un-Indo-Aryan
shape, with a plain b and an unmotivated retroflex ḍ. This ḍ becomes ḷ before words
beginning with a vowel, showing the standard Ṛgvedic intervocalic change -- which,
interestingly, operates across word boundary here and in the 7 other passages in
which báḍ is followed by a vowel; in VIII.101.11 it becomes ṇ before a nasal, in
VIII.101.12 a ṭ before s. In 4 of its occurrences, incl. this one, it is immediately
followed by itthā́; the combined sense of the two particles escapes me. The nonSanskritic phonology of báḍ suggests that there is a colloquial flavor to the word, but
it is hard to capture exactly what that is -- esp. as the rest of the vs. doesn’t show
markedly low register features.
Note the phonetic figures párvatānām# … pṛthivi# (ab), #prá … pravatvati#
(c), and #mahnā́… mahini# (d), all positioned at pāda boundaries and all involving a
fem. voc. as the 2nd word. The first two pairs of course also play off each other.
This first verse presents an unsurprising picture of the earth, weighed down
by mountains whose slopes define her and providing support for the life that
flourishes upon her. This vs. serves as scene-setter and contrast to vs. 2.

### 84.2  
vicāriṇi is generally taken as ‘far-wandering’ vel sim. (e.g., Ge ‘du
Wandelbare’), but cf. X.173.2, where the mountain to which the newly installed king
is compared is ávicācaliḥ ‘unwavering’; remember also that earth is said to ‘bob up
and down’ (nánnamīti) during the thunderstorm in the preceding hymn (V.83.5).
This is the riddle vs.: the puzzle involves positing a number of qualities of the
earth that don’t appear to be characteristic of her -- quite unlike the first vs. -- and
implicitly asking under what circumstances these unlikely attributes would be true of
the earth. who is not explicitly named. In this vs. she is addressed as a ‘wobbler’
(vicāriṇi), she is associated with nights (aktúbhiḥ), she is said to “fling moisure
forward” (perúm ásyasi), and she is silvery (arjuni). Neither the unsteady actions nor
the silver color and association with night are earth-like.
As Thieme already suggested (Gedichte, 58), the nights can represent the
darkness of monsoon clouds and her wobbling results from the thunderstorm. She is
150
also ‘silvery’ with rain, which she ‘flings’ in the forms of streams and rivulets down
her slopes, the slopes mentioned in verse 1.

### 84.3  
The first half of this verse restores to us the familiar steady, sturdy Earth
of vs. 1, while the second half identifies the special circumstances that held in vs. 2.
Because it is made up of two subordinate clauses, it must be attached to the previous
verse and the 2nd person referent must be the same. This verse, with its
straightforward diction and balanced construction, provides the answer to those
dullards in the audience who failed to solve the implicit challenge of vs. 2.
The standard tr. all supply a verb for vidyútaḥ -- e.g., WG “wenn … die Blitze
(blitzen) …” -- but I don’t see why the lightning bolts can’t ‘rain’ -- in particularly
violent thunderstorms lightning flashes can seem to come as thick and fast as
raindrops.
Note that ‘earth’ is reunited with her usual formulaic companion ‘heaven’ in
the final pāda of the hymn. It should be kept in mind that this is the only hymn
dedicated only to Earth in the RV, instead of to Heaven and Earth.
[V.85 JPB]
V.86 Indra and Agni
The hymn begins with the voc. dual dvandva índrāgnī, and a form of that
cmpd is found in 2d, 4b, 6a; vss. 3 and 5, which lack the cmpd., begin with dual
pronouns (táyoḥ and tā́respectively), while dual forms of both the demonst. and the
rel. pronoun are also common elsewhere in the hymn.

### 86.1  
The 2nd hemistich is a little tricky. As noted in the publ. intro. it seems to
concern the Vala myth, though with Trita as hero -- an odd substitution in a hymn at
least half dedicated to Indra. Moreover, there’s a functional slippage in the
accusatives with the verb prá √bhid ‘split (forth)’. The first acc., neut. pl. dṛḷḥā́, is of
course very common, used of fastnesses or strongholds (which usually get split or
otherwise breached). The standard interpr. (Gr, Old, Ge, Re) take it with dyumnā́
(e.g., Old “feste Herrlichkeiten”), but this is an uneasy collocation. The dyumnā́
should be the brilliant things desired to be obtained; they are more likely to be held
within strongholds than to be strongholds themselves, and the consistent use of
dṛḷhá- as ‘fastness, stronghold’ makes it unlikely that it can here refer to the thing
held rather than what holds it within. I assume that prá √bhid can take a double acc.:
‘split X (to release) forth Y’, with X the container and Y the contained. Old is quite
dismissive of a variant on this explanation, but I do not see the objection --
particularly as whatever vā́ṇīḥ refers to, it is more likely to be the contained than the
container. As for vā́ṇī-, this stem usually refers to music or voices. Ge’s tentative
suggestion, that these are the voices of the cows released from the Vala cave, makes
the most contextual sense -- even though, as Ge points out, the word is not otherwise
used of animal noises. On the other hand, as he also points out, it is used of rivers, so
that application to non-human sounds that are comparable to a choir of human voices
151
is possible. That vā́ṇī- is also sometimes used of the choir that encourages Indra in a
Vala context (e.g., III.30.10) might add an additional resonance to the usage here, but
I do not think it is the primary reading.

### 86.2  
The publ. tr. starts the vs. in the 2nd ps. (“you two who”) and ends in the 3rd
ps. (“these two”). This does not represent the text entirely fairly, because the
grammatical person is entirely unclear until the last pāda, which contains an acc. dual
dvandva and a 3rd ps. dual acc. prn. (tā́) and a 1st ps. pl. verb. Until pāda d Indra and
Agni are represented only by the insistent rel. du. yā́(a, b, c). The vs. could therefore
be couched entirely in the 3rd ps. (“the two who …”), as the standard tr. do. I stand by
my modulatory tr. because, based on vs. 1 with its voc. dual dvandva and 2nd du. verb
ávathaḥ, we start vs. 2 assuming the 2nd ps. context carries over, and nothing disturbs
that assumption until the very end of the vs.
V.86.2–4: Vs. 3 is the middle vs. of the hymn, since vs. 6 is in a different meter and
is an extra-hymnic summary vs. It has the marks of an omphalos, esp. semantic and
syntactic obscurity. The real difficulties lie in the central 3cd along with 4a, which is
verbally related to 3cd by the problematic eṣ-forms (see below). The omphalos is
framed, in classic omphalos fashion, by indrāgnī́(tā́) havāmahe in 2d and 4b.

### 86.3  
3cd has elicited much disc.; see esp. the lengthy treatment of it by Old, with
several different possible tr. supplied, Ge’s n. 3cd, and a fairly detailed disc. in WG’s
n. Among the problems are 1) what is the referent of the ‘wood(en)’ in instr. drúṇā;
2) who is the subj. of the verb and is it his hands (gábhastyoḥ) that are in question; 3)
what is gávām construed with; 4) what case is vṛtraghná, that is, what is its pausal
form?
I will begin with 3): flg. Ge (n. 3cd), I supply a loc. *éṣe to govern gávām “(in
the quest) for cattle.” This is supported by éṣate in this pāda, éṣe ráthānām “in the
quest for chariots” in the next pāda (4a) likewise with gen., and X.48.9 gávām éṣe.
As Ge suggests, *éṣe éṣate may have been simplified by a sort of word-haplology. As
for 4), the underlying form of vṛtraghná — contra the Pp and most interpr., who take
it as dat. vṛtraghné, I think it is a genitive (vṛtraghnáḥ), dependent on gábhastyoḥ -- a
possibility floated but ultimately rejected by Old. A parallel passage with a weapon
(in fact, a didyút; see our 3b) being wielded in the arms of a man is found in VII.25.1
pátāti didyún náryasya bāhóḥ. A dat. does not make much sense here because ā́√īṣ
doesn’t ordinarily take a dative, nor does práti, so we are left with no way to fit a dat.
*vṛtraghné into the existing syntax of the sentence, save as a free-floating dat. of
benefit. (Re, curiously, seems to take it as a loc. “chez Vṛtrahaṇ” [sic the retroflex ṇ].
This seems to go back to an idea of Hillebrandt’s that it belongs to an otherwise
unattested thematic stem; see Old. This has nothing to recommend it.) In answer to 2),
if I am thus correct that the hands are those of Indra, it seems likely that he is also the
subject of éṣate. Otherwise the subject is an unidentified other party or (so most
interpr.) is the missile (didyút) of pāda b. What then to do with drúṇā? This is the
most problematic of the problems. Most interpr. take it as the handle of the didyút
152
(which, acdg. to WG, might be a sort of Vedic boomerang). In VIII.96.11 and
IX.98.2, the same instr. seems to refer to a wooden paddle or the like. A similar
wooden implement, usable as a weapon, may be meant here -- though it seems a
come-down for vajra-wielding Indra. More likely it is equipment esp. suitable for
cattle herding -- a prod or goad, and this would account for Indra’s trading in his
usual weapon for something more appropriate to a quest for cows. Of course, since
soma is usually poured into wooden cups, this may also depict Indra with a wooden
soma cup in his hands, preparing to drink before he goes out on his quest. I might
emend the publ. tr. to “With the wooden (goad / soma-cup) in the hands …”
I am not at all certain of the correctness of any of these answers to the
questions posed above. Nor do I have any explanation for práti, beyond pointing out
that 4c begins with rhyming pátī. And, most especially, I don’t understand why this
cramped and obscure half-verse is found in this otherwise rather anodyne hymn.

### 86.4  
As noted above, the éṣe + GEN. here helps explain 3cd. It is also integrated
into the omphalos-framing (semi)repeated pāda indragnī́havāmahe. Most standard
tr., however, render éṣe here not as ‘in quest of, in pursuit of’, but as ‘rush, run,
course’ (e.g., Ge “im Rennen der Wagen,” Re “pour la course de chars”, WG
“anlässlich eines Wagenrennens”), implicitly accepting Gr’s separation of éṣa- into
two stems ‘das Hineilen, Eilen’ and ‘Aufsuchen, Begehren’. éṣe + GEN. is found
three times elsewhere in V -- V.41.5, 8 (both rāyá éṣe “in quest of wealth”) and this
very pāda in V.66.3 -- and it seems uneconomical to give these similar syntagms in
the same maṇḍala two entirely different meanings. Old (ZDMG 62: 477–78 [=KlSch
286–87]) makes similar points, arguments accepted by Bl (RReps ad V.66.3).

### 86.5  
The verb puró dadhe gives a more Agni-esque cast to the vs. than the more
Indraic vss. that have preceded.
The standard tr. separate c and d into two clauses, but I think the two
expressions are meant to be balanced against each other. The idea seems to be that
though (cid) the two gods deserve portions (árhantā), I have set them out as if they
theselves were portions (áṃśā-iva), prizes for a prize-winning steed. What it means
to “set them out” I don’t know. It’s worth noting that √arh regularly takes pītím
‘drink(ing), share of drink’ as object (e.g., V.51.6), so the reciprocal notion would be
familiar to the audience.

### 86.6  
havyá, so accented, is generally ‘oblation’, as opposed to hávya- ‘invocation’.
However, in this case it is difficult not to see a pun, with the hymn just completed
counting both as an oblation (“like ghee …,” pāda c) and an invocation,
accompanying the physical oblation. The pun is further enabled by the adj. śūṣyà-
‘forceful’, which in its other two occurrences (I.54.3, VII.66.1) modifies types of
speech (vácas- and stóma- respectively).
This pun may help explain the curious expression “like ghee purified by
stones” (ghṛtáṃ ná pūtám ádribhiḥ). The problem of course is that it is soma, not
ghee, that is purified by stones. It is very doubtful that stones could play a role in
153
preparing melted butter (pity the poor cow), and although the root √pū is
occasionally used of ghṛtá- (e.g., VI.10.2 and esp. the very similar VIII.12.4 ghṛtáṃ
ná pūtám adrivaḥ) -- and consider the English term for ghee, “clarified butter” -- it is
overwhelming characteristic of soma. The standard tr. deal with the disharmony in
this simile by separating it into two -- e.g., Ge “durch die Presssteine (gepresst), wie
Schmalz geklärt.” By contrast, I think the ill-assorted technology in the simile was
deliberately introduced, to match the same punning lack of fit in the frame, where the
forceful/noisy havyá- has been poured (áhāvi): the jarring “ghee pressed by stones”
calls attention to the more subtle mismatch in the frame. We might almost call this
ritual synaesthesia.
## 87 Maruts
Re nicely characterizes this hymn (in his comm. on vs. 5) “l'hymne est fait de
débris empruntés au cycle ancien des M.” Certainly there is a sense that the vss. are
constructed of loosely connected phrases, which may well be connected with the
unusual meter.
As disc. in the publ. intro., the final word of the 2nd pāda of each vs.,
evayā́marut, appears to be an exclamatory internal refrain without syntactic
connection to the rest of the vs. Ge by contrast takes it in each case as forming a
nominal sentence with unexpressed Viṣṇu (usually, but see below): “(Viṣṇu is der)
mit dem die Marut gern kommen.” But though Viṣṇu is surprisingly prominent in
this hymn, I don’t think he outranks the Maruts, and the formation of evayā́marut is
too peculiar to be folded into a conventional (if invisible) nominal clause. Though sg.,
I think it must refer to the Maruts, who, after all, appear in the collective sg. in the
rest of the vs. (pādas cde) as a troop (śárdha-). For the phrase on which this is built,
see V.41.16 evayā́marutaḥ.

### 87.1  
The grammatical identity of girijā́(in sandhi) ‘moutain-born’ is problematic
(see Old’s disc.). The Pp. takes it as girijā́ḥ, which could be nom. pl. fem. (so Gr and
Re) and modify ‘thoughts’, but this makes little sense: the thoughts in question are
surely home-grown, as it were, not outsourced from a mountain. (Though Old’s
offhand suggestion that the cmpd might mean “in der Rede geboren,” with otherwise
unattested loc. sg. of gír- ‘hymn’, is worth considering as a second punning reading,
suitable for ‘thoughts’. See girā́in 3a.) girijā́ḥ could likewise be nom. sg. masc. and
refer to Viṣṇu. This is the basis for Ge’s first Satzparenthese “-- er ist der
Berggeborene, mit dem die Marut gern kommen --” and he is followed by Scar (136).
But switching the ref. to Viṣṇu from dative (… mahé … víṣṇave, marútvate) to
nominative in the middle of a pāda right at the end of the dative phrase is highly
unlikely. Although the morphology doesn’t entirely work, I think it must be a dative.
The problem of course is that the dat. to this -ā́-root noun should be underlying
*girijé, which should appear in sandhi as girijá, not -jā́, as here. It should be noted,
however, that datives in -é to root nouns in -ā́- are exceedingly rare (see Macd.,
Vedic Gr. p. 252; AiG III.125), and beside them exist infinitives in -aí to roots in -ā
(Macd. loc cit.; AiG III.129) like pratikhyaí, vayo-dhaí. Esp. in this sandhi situation,
154
I see no reason why this extended dat. sg. would not have been available even to a
non-infinitive. In favor of a dat. referring to Viṣṇu is the very similar passage I.154.3
prá víṣṇave śūṣám etu mánma, girikṣíta urugāyā́ya vṛ́ṣṇe, with the semantically
corresponding dat. root-noun cmpd. girikṣíte ‘mountain-dwelling’ in a lengthy dat.
phrase referring to Viṣṇu and prá … etu mánma matching our matáyo yantu almost
exactly. (Curiously WG tr. girijā́as if a dat. parallel to marútvate “… zum grossen
Viṣṇu, der in Begleitung der Maruts ist, der in den Bergen geboren ist,” but Scar,
who was responsible for this vol. of WG, seems to hold onto the nom. sg. interpr. in
his n. -- though the n. is a bit incoherent.)
The hapax cmpd bhandád-iṣṭi- is variously rendered. Both Ge and WG (latter
flg. Gotō, 1st pres. cl., 224) interpr. -iṣṭi- as “sacrifice” (hence Ge’s ‘opferliebend’,
WG ‘deren Opferungen erfreuen’). But -iṣṭi- is far more often ‘desire, quest, seeking’
than ‘sacrifice’ in the RV, and notice the concentration of such forms of √iṣ in the
previous hymn (V.86.3, 4, at least by my interpr.). As Lowe points out (Participles,
270–71), bhandát- and its ilk result from reanalysis of governing cmpds, producing
pseudo-act. participles to roots without an active paradigm (like √bhand, which is
otherwise only middle). The cmpd is exactly parallel to rhyming krandád-iṣṭi-
(X.100.2), whose interpr. also varies. Although both cmpds have the look of
governing cmpds, neither √bhand nor √krand is transitive; I therefore think we have
more or less standard bahuvrīhi semantics ‘having a fortunate quest’ and ‘having a
roaring quest’ respectively, whose English I have adjusted to something more
palatable.
The adjectivally accented taváse beginning d points up the nominally
accented rhyming śávase at the end of e. With Re I think the Maruts are being
equated with śávas- itself, but it would be possible to take śávase as a separate
purpose dative ‘for strength’ (with or without távase).
On dhúni-vrata- see comm. ad V.58.2.

### 87.2  
This vs. is quite loosely constructed. To begin with, the rel. cl. of ab has no
obvious main clause, though the two yé’s do, of course, refer to the Maruts, who
show up in the voc. in c. The rel. cl. could also hang off vs. 1, with pl. yé picking up
the collective sg. śárdha- in 1cde.
The next question is what belongs with each yé. The easiest solution and the
one taken by the standard tr. (as well as Klein DGRV I.118) is to take the first as a
nominal cl. yé jātā́mahinā́and the 2nd as containing the accented verb prá … bruváte.
But there are several factors against this. For one thing the prá that begins the 2nd
pāda is actually a repeat of the one that begins the vs. (#prá yé jātā́ḥ … yé ca …, prá
… bruváte …); that is, the first prá seems to have been extracted from the second yé
clause and fronted around the first, which may well be a violation of RVic clause
structure and at best is highly unusual. If we take prá …, prá … bruváte … as the
verb for both yé clauses, as I do, it is considerably less problematic. Moreover, the yé
… yé ca construction is far more at home in expressing complementary pairs (see
Klein I.115–16) than in conjoining coreferential entities with semantically
unconnected predicates, as the standard tr. requires (e.g., Klein 118: “Who were born
155
with greatness and who now themselves proclaim (their might) with knowledge.”). In
my interpr. the yé … yé ca construction expresses two types of Marut birth,
“born/produced by might” and “self(-produced/born),” with the svayám signalling
the 2nd type. The Maruts are called svajā́ḥ in I.168.2; cf. also I.64.4 sākáṃ jajñire
svadháyā … “They [=Maruts] were born all at once by their own power.” I see only
two arguments against my interpr.: 1) the nú in the second yé clause, which might
mark a chronological progression (as in Klein’s tr. [also WG]; Ge and Re both ignore
the nú, and it’s certainly true that nú need not be temporal); 2) the apparently
required underlying assumption that there are two groups of Maruts. As to that, I
don’t think the complementary pairing needs to indicate that there are two distinct
groups of Maruts sorted by their means of birth, but rather that we can view their
births in different ways.
The next question is how to construe prá … bruváte. Ge and WG both take it
as reflexive “announce themselves,” but prá √brū is not elsewhere reflex./pass., even
in the middle. Re supplies as object “leur naissance,” which can be justified, but I
prefer Klein’s “their might.” The resonant word śávas- is found on either side of this
phrase, at the ends of 1e and 2c and is the focus of 2cde, and prá √brū elsewhere
takes such objects (indriyám I.55.4, bálāni X.54.2).
The rest of the vs. consists, in my opinion (flg. Re), of two parallel clauses,
each beginning with instr. of respect, followed by tád and a gen. referring to the
Maruts (2nd ps. in c, 3rd in d), and, as predicate, a negated form of √dhṛṣ ‘dare
(against), assail’. The tád is specified as śávas- in the first clause, which
identification carries over into the second:
krátvā tád vo (maruto) nā́dhṛ́ṣe śávaḥ
dānā́mahnā́ tád eṣām ádhṛṣṭāso (nā́drayaḥ)
This striking parallelism makes the interpr. of Ge and WG unlikely: they take krátvā
as the weapon that someone might try to use, unsuccessfully, against the Maruts’
śávas-, whereas dānā́mahnā́they take as instr. of respect. Actually, Ge’s treatment is
more complicated: his tr. reflects the interpr. I just paraphrased (“Diese eure Macht
ist nicht durch Einsicht zu erzwingen”), but in his n. 2c–e he describes the three instr.
as parallel: “Der Sinn ist jedenfalls, dass keiner wagt, es ihnen an Umsicht,
Freigebigkeit und Grösse gleichzutun.”
As Ge points out (n. 2e), masc. pl. ádhṛṣṭāsaḥ has been attracted to the
number and gender of the simile (ádrayaḥ); it is still specifying śávaḥ in the frame.
It’s also worth noting that pādas c and d both contain ná in sandhi with a
following vowel in quite similar phonological sequences: nā́dhṛ́ṣe … nā́drayaḥ. The
first ná is the negative (matched by a- in ádhṛṣṭāsaḥ in the next pāda); the 2nd is the
simile marker.

### 87.3  
Like vs. 2 this vs. begins with several relative clauses (yé pāda a, yéṣām c),
with no clear main clause.
The first pāda of this vs. is syntactically straightforward, but we might
wonder why the Maruts are heard “through a/their hymn.” In answer, there is the fact,
often referred to above, that the Maruts are singers as well as sung-to. Further, in this
156
context their “hymn” may be a metaphorical reference to thunder. It is also possible
that it is a pun, as indicated in the publ. tr. and also implicitly by Scar (537), with the
-ā variant form of the i-stem loc. sg. of girí-. (Interestingly Scar’s alternative “mit
einem Lied (/im Gebirge)” in the root noun book is not reflected in his tr. in WG,
which limits itself to “mit ihrem Lied.”) Of course, such a loc. sg. would be wrongly
positioned: it is the -au loc. sg. form that is overwhelmingly found at pāda end (see,
e.g., Lanman, Noun Infl., p. 385), but as a secondary punning reading the “wrong”
form could be acceptable, esp. as it precedes a consonant, as most forms of loc. sg. -ā
do. Thus the Maruts would be heard “on a mountain” -- as their storm often is.
The hapax nom. sg. írī is problematic formally and semantically. In this
sandhi sit. the long ī final can only belong to a devī-type -ī stem or an -in-stem. It is
usually cited as the latter (e.g., Gr, EWA), but this analysis seems excluded formally
because -ín-stems are always suffix-accented. An underlying -in-stem is
emphatically denied by AiG II.2.328 (“Die Barytona v. írī … gehören nicht hierher”;
see also Old’s serious doubts). Debrunner (AiG II.2.407–8) seems to favor (if
“favoring” means sticking it in that section but then calling it “ganz unklar”) a masc.
devī-type -ī-stem, but of course such stems are rare and problematic in all their
occurrences. Nothing in the passage actually excludes an analysis as a feminine -īstem, but who would such a feminine be? The other question of course is what is it
derived from and what does it mean. I follow the line of least resistance that has been
fld. by a number of others and connect it with írya-, which is better attested though
not much clearer, and is found in another Marut hymn in V, V.58.4; see comm. ad
loc. If the basic sense is something like ‘energetic’, the form of írya- in V.58.4 is
positive in sense, while írī is negative.
I do not understand the pāda-final ā́. Assuming that ī́ṣte belongs to √īś, that
root does not otherwise appear with ā́(or any other preverb). It’s worth noting that
ī́ṣṭe here is the only t-full 3rd sg.; the usual and very well-attested 3rd sg. is, of course,
ī́śe. We might try to connect the form with √īṣ or √iṣ, but neither is promising
formally or semantically.
The last pāda, prá syandrā́so dhúnīnām, confronts us with a lexical
conundrum: it contains two plurals, one nom., one gen., both of which are good
Marut words. For the Maruts as syandrá- see V.52.3, 8; for dhúni- see dhúni-vratain this hymn (1e) and V.58.2, as well as the simplex adj. in numerous passages (e.g.,
V.60.7). So which one modifies the (unexpressed) Maruts, and what should we do
with the other? The poet seems to be messing with our minds: we encounter the first,
syandrā́saḥ, and understandably assume it refers to the Maruts, then come to the
second, dhúni-, which is an even more characteristic Marut word, and have to
readjust. Ge supplies ‘chariots’ (Wagen, sim. WG Fahrzeuge) with the nominative,
and the publ. tr. tentatively follows that. Re manages to make both words refer to the
Maruts, “(dieux) bruyants qui rapides (vont) de l’avant,” breezily remarking “il n’est
pas indispensable de sous-entendre <<les chars>>.” But, though I’m sympathetic to
his intuition that both words should refer to the Maruts, the grammatical difference is
unambiguous. In Max Müller’s tr. of this hymn (SBE 32), he tr. “the rushing chariots
of these roaring Maruts come forth” and notes that “chariot” was Oldenberg’s
157
suggestion (presumably in their consultation on the SBE translations; the suggestion
is not registered in the Noten). One of the problems with supplying ‘chariots’ is the
preceding pāda (d), also in the nom. pl., which seems clearly to describe the Maruts.
If syandrā́saḥ does not refer to the Maruts but to their chariots, we must either
assume that the flashing entities in d are also chariots or put an unsignalled break
between the two pādas. The publ. tr. essentially does the latter, but it is unsatisfactory.
Ge does the former, which isn’t satisfactory either, and WG stir the pot even further
by supplying ‘weapons’ as the comparandum in d.

### 87.4  
The “common seat” (samānásmāt sádasaḥ) is presumably one shared by
Viṣṇu and the Maruts and is also presumably the same as the sadhástha- in the
previous vs. (3c) -- perhaps the midspace? The standard interpr. (incl. mine) also
assume the same seat (or a similar place) is the referent of svā́t ‘from his own’ in
pāda c. For other exx. of the idiom √yuj + ABL. ‘yoke from’ with ‘seat’ in the abl.,
see Old.
Similar to áyukta tmánā is V.52.8 prá ... yujata tmánā; in the latter passage
the verb is used absolutely, without expressed obj. That is possible here too, though it
is also possible, and indeed more likely, to take víṣpardhaso vímahasaḥ in d as the
obj. (so also Re and WG), referring to horses, an interpr. that saves supplying a verb
to govern that phrase, as Ge does (“lenkt”). (See Max Müuler’s solution below.) It
should be noted, however, that neither of these adjectives is otherwise used of horses:
víṣpardhas- is found twice elsewhere, once of human contenders (I.173.10), once of,
apparently, flames (VIII.23.2); vímahas- is only attested once elsewhere, in I.86.1 of
the Maruts. Max Müller in the SBE 32 tr. takes the two adj. as a voc. phrase
addressed to the Maruts. This seems unlikely in the middle of a sentence devoted to
Viṣṇu and only turning to the Maruts in its last word, nṛ́bhiḥ, and so a ‘horse’ interpr.
seems the best course.
The publ. tr. renders ádhi ṣṇúbhiḥ as “upon the (mountains’) backs,” but in
accord with the standard sense of this phrase (e.g., V.60.7) and in harmony with the
standard tr. I would now alter this to “along the (mountains’) backs.” This
complicates the rendering of the rest of the clause, because there is no verb of motion,
just ‘yoke’. Both Re and WG supply an expression to provide this motion: Re “(pour
courir) à travers les hauteurs” and WG “(zur Ausfahrt) über die (Berg-)Rücken.”
Reluctantly I would join them and supply something like “(to travel) along …”
The standard explanation of śévṛdha- as a haplology of *śéva-vṛdha- (already
Gr, endorsed by AiG I.279, tentatively also by EWA s.v. śéva-) seems correct, but
this does not settle its sense. Cmpds in -vṛdha- have a range of senses, both transitive
and intransitive, and of relationships to their 1st member, and none of the quite varied
contexts in which śévṛdha- appears is sufficiently diagnostic. Several of them apply
to Agni as the ritual fire just kindled (X.46.3, X.61.20 [the latter accented śevavṛdhá-
]); once (I.54.11) it is used of ‘brilliance’ (dyumná-) and once (III.16.2) of ‘riches’
(rā́yaḥ). The preponderance of the evidence, esp. the two “fire just born” passages,
seems to point to an intransitive/passive reading of -vṛdha- and an instr. reading of
śé(va)-, hence ‘growing strong through kindness/benevolence’. Although an intrans.
158
reading of the publ. tr.’s “strengthening with kindness’ is possible, this English
expression is more likely to be read as transitive, and I would therefore alter the tr. to
the clearer ‘growing strong …’ What this descriptor means in our passage is entirely
unclear to me -- that the Maruts are treating Viṣṇu well and he thrives?

### 87.5  
Note the chiastic phonetic figure that begins the vs.: svanó ná vo.
The caus. injunc. rejayat needs an obj. I supply ‘earth’ on the basis of intrans.
rejate passages with bhū́mi-, pṛthivī́, et sim. as subj., but any standard cosmic feature
will do (Re ‘l’univers’, WG ‘alles’).
Pace Gr, ṛñjáta is better analyzed as a 3rd pl. mid. athem. form than a 2nd pl.
act. them. All the standard tr. follow the 3rd pl. mid. interpr.
The source of sthā́raśman- is disputed. First note that this peculiar form can
be partially motivated contextually: 6c begins sthā́tāro, so there was some incentive
to begin our pāda with a word of similar shape. We can begin by dismissing the odd Pp
analysis of this cmpd, sthāḥ’raśman-. It is difficult to know what this is meant to
represent. AiG II.1.316 and II.2.9 take sthā́- simply as the cmpded root or root noun,
which would be a highly unusual cmpd. type. Bloomfield (RVReps ad loc.) suggests
that it’s “a kind of haplology” from sth(ir)ā́raśmānaḥ, with sthirá- ‘firm’ as 1st
member (note Sāy.’s gloss sthiraraśmayo), and this is accepted by Ge (n. 5d). It is not
clear where the long ā- of his posited sth(ir)ā́- would come from, however; is he
thinking of a nom. pl. syntagm *sthirā́raśmā́naḥ, with univerbation and loss of the
noun’s accent? Moreover, in the Nachtr. to AiG II.1.316 [=Nachtr. 87] Debrunner
points out that haplology of Bl’s posited form should produce *sthirā̆śman-
(undoubtedly why Bl calls it “a kind of haplology”). Re proposes a 1st member adj.
*sthāmán- ‘bien en place’ or ‘solide’, internally derived from the noun sthā́man-
‘station, standing place’, but this requires several more steps derivationally and
semantically, and the haplology (if that’s what he sees it as) would involve loss over
an intermediate syllable and loss of a heavy consonant-final syllable, both of which
are problematic: sthāmán-raśman-. Certainly sthirá- makes the most sense
semantically, but, as noted above, Bl’s haplology runs into formal difficulties.
However, if we begin with my observation that 6c #sthā́tāro makes a sthā opening
desirable, an irregular reduction of *sthirá-raśman- may be the best option. In fact if
we operate with a slightly different form of the 1st member, the development may be
easier to explain. I suggest positing a reduced form of sthirá-, namely *sthrá-,
showing the same -irV- ∼ -rV- alternation as índra- ∼ *índira- (metrically guaranteed,
but not transmitted in the Saṃhitā; cf. AiG I.55) and the 3rd pl. med. pf. endings -ire
and -re (AiG I.23). *sthrá- would thus show the loss of an apparent svarabhakti
vowel, rather than the insertion of one. The posited cmpd *sthrá-raśman- would then
undergo liquid dissimilation, not haplology. This still doesn’t explain the long ā́-, but
the parallel sthā́tāraḥ might help there.

### 87.6  
Note #sthā́tāraḥ … sthana#.
This vs. reprises some of what came before. The focus on śávas- earlier in the
hymn (1e, 2cde) is emphatically revived with ab … vṛddhaśavasaḥ … śávaḥ; the
159
hapax epithet suśukvan- in the nom. pl.. suśúkvānaḥ in 3b is cleverly echoed by the
pf. part. śuśukvā́ṃsaḥ, where the redupl. śu- matches the prefix su-; and the simile in
3d agnáyo ná svávidyutaḥ appears in reverse order (and a different shared quality) in
śuśukvā́ṃso ná-agnáyaḥ. There is also a local repetition of tveṣá- in 6b, echoing the
same stem in the same position in 5b.

### 87.7  
This vs., too, reprises earlier material: there is a 3rd “fires” simile, this time
marked with yathā, not ná, and extended over the pāda boundary (agnáyo yathā,
tuvidyumnā́ḥ); avantu in b echoes avatu in 6b in the same metrical position; the ‘seat’
returns for the third time (pāda c), with yet a different word: sádman- versus 3c
sadhástha- and 4b sádas-.
The last two pādas present several problems. One is how to reconcile yéṣām
and śárdhāṃsi, which are presumably coreferential and refer to the Maruts. Simplest
is to accept Ge’s “der reflexive Gebrauch des Relativs” (n. 7d); cf., e.g., V.61.12 and
comm. thereon. The publ. tr. does not render yéṣām literally, but as “when … of
them,” for the sake of English, since “at whose drives” is awkward in context.
The causal connection between the journey of the Maruts (d) and the
spreading out of the earth (c) is clear in V.58.7, also adduced by Ge: prátiṣṭha yā́man
prthiv ̥ ī́cid eṣām “Even the Earth has spread herself at their journey,” but pāda c
cannot be brought into the domain of the relative in d (though Old tries) because of
the lack of accent on the verb paprathe in c. Instead d and e must together make a
circumstantial clause dependent on c. With Ge and Re I supply a verb of motion
‘ap(proach)’; this can be partly generated from the ā́in c, though that ā́is primarily a
postposition with the loc. and is not in the right place for a preverb in tmesis. The
étana in the next vs. (8a) may support the supplying of a verb of motion here.
The next question in de is the grammatical analysis and reference of maháḥ,
which presents us with entirely too many possibilities: abl./gen. sg or nom./acc. pl. of
máh-, nom. sg. of mahá-, adv. mahás. On the basis of the gen. phrase in the next vs.,
8c víṣṇor maháḥ (cf. also 1a mahé … víṣṇave), I take it as gen. sg. and supply Viṣṇu:
the Marut troops are here said to be Viṣṇu’s. This more or less follows Ge; Re takes
maháḥ as adv., WG as nom. sg. See also Old’s disc.
The final problem is the bahuvrīhi ádbhuta-enas-, which is found once
elsewhere (VIII.67.7). The problem is to find some plausible overlap between the
senses of the two members and a plausible reason why whatever is so constructed
should apply to the Maruts. The standard sense of énas- is ‘offense, transgression,
outrage’; ádbhuta- is famously problematic, but probably the most widely accepted
analysis currently is as a negated form of √dabh ‘deceive, trick, harm’ (see EWA
s.v.), hence ‘infallible, unerring’, shading (probably because of loss of transparency)
into ‘wonderful, astonishing’. Put these together and you get the highly unconvincing
‘having infallible offenses’ or the like -- not a good epithet for a favored group of
gods. Clearly something has to give, and in most interpr. it’s the semantic integrity of
the parts; e.g., Re decides that énas- here preserves an earlier sense, derived from its
relationship to inóti and means ‘élan’, yielding a cmpd “à l'élan extraordinaire,”
which fits smoothly into the context by virtue of suppressing the semantics of both
160
cmpd members. In the other occurrence of the cmpd in VIII.67.7 I take it as applying
to the Ādityas (most others see it as a gen. sg.) and meaning ‘whom (others’)
offenses cannot mislead’. That is, the stripped-down sense is ‘possessing
unmisleading/misleadable offenses’, but the offenses are committed by others and
the Ādityas are not tricked by them. This may provide more tricky structure than a
bahuvrīhi can quite manage, but it does preserve the lexical senses of both members.
It may mean this here as well -- the Maruts are not more trickable than the Ādityas --
and I propose that as an alternate tr. But the publ. tr. takes a different route, with the
sense ‘harm’ for √dabh, hence ‘whose offenses are beyond harm’ -- meaning,
perhaps, that the violence and turmoil attendant on the Maruts’ stormy passage on
the one hand leave no lasting damage and on the other cannot be held against the
Maruts. They are not moral lapses.
Note the figure in c: pṛthú paprathe … pā́rthivam, which is both phonological
and etymological

### 87.8  
The first word in the vs. adveṣáḥ must be adverbial; it of course resonates
with the 2nd to last word in the vs., dvéṣāṃsi.
The construction of the gen. (or possibly, in principle, abl.) phrase víṣṇor
maháḥ isn’t entirely clear. Old is insistent that it belongs with the voc. samanyavaḥ,
hence “of equal fervor with Viṣṇu,” but this adj. is not otherwise construed with a
third party but indicates that those so described are equally fervent with each other.
Moreover, the genitive is not the most likely case for the proposed meaning, and we
might also expect the gen. phrase to lose its accent or take vocative accent if it were
part of the vocative phrase. The standard tr. take the gen. as simply identifying the
Maruts as “Viṣṇu’s,” and this may well be the best way to do it. The publ. tr.
construes it with smát ‘together with’ at the beginning of d, as Gr also indicates. The
genitive case is problematic, however: smát takes the instr. Further, as Ge points out,
rather than smát we should expect *asmát, the 1st pl. abl. prn. to be construed with
yuyotana … ápa dvéṣāṃsi “keep hatreds away from us”; see parallels cited by Ge in
n. 8d. Unfortunately asmát does not work metrically. WG cleverly suggest that the
end of c and the beg. of d, underlyingly *yuyotanā̆ *asmát, were combined in sandhi
as *yuyotanāsmát and then decoupled first into *yuyotanā, smát and then, with
shortening of the variable final vowel of the impv., to the transmitted yuyotana, smát.
The instr. daṃsánā must belong with the simile: cf. VIII.101.2 tā́bāhútā ná
daṃsánā ratharyataḥ “With their wondrous skill as if with their arms they drive their
chariot,” also adduced by Ge.

### 87.9  
The first two pādas of this vs. are essentially variants on the first two pādas
of the previous vs., with 8a gātum étana corresponding to 9a gántā and śrótā hávam
identically opening both b pādas. The adverbial adveṣáḥ ‘without hatred’ in 8a is
matched by arakṣáḥ ‘undemonically’ in 9b, though the adv. has been moved to the
second cl. (With Re I take it as an adv.; Gr takes it as an adj. with hávam, which
requires him to identify only this occurrences of háva- as a neut.; WG see it as a
161
nominative in a stand-alone nominal sentence. The patterning of vss. 8–9 just laid out
makes the adverbial interpr. the strongest one.)
The final word of pāda, suśámi, makes both metrical and morphological
trouble. The pāda is short a syllable (11, not 12) and the cadence is bad even for a
Triṣṭubh, with a light penultimate syllable. Gr proposes to fix the first of these
problems by reading suśámiyā, but though this gets us 12 syllables, it makes the
cadence worse -- not to mention that there’s no reason why the textual change would
have occurred. Old proposes to read suśámī, matching the other two instr.
occurrences of this stem; the same phenomenon is found with the simplex, where an
instr. śámi with short final occurs at the end of the pāda, while śámī is found pādainternal. Since in our passage the next pāda begins with a cons. cluster, the original
length of the final vowel would be obscured anyway. However, this suggestion does
nothing to fix the cadence or the deficient syllable. See also the disc. in WG; in the
WG tr. they take it as a neut. acc., but the disc. in the n. is more equivocal. I have no
solution. Of course, those who wish to see laryngeals effects would argue that the
problematic short penultimate could be explained by the fact that √śam is a seṭ root
and the root syllable would originally have been heavy (*śamH in a bastardized
notation).
The rest of the vs. is more opaque, or rather it is difficult to reconcile the
simile in c with the directive to the Maruts in de. The problem is similar to the one
posed by ádbhuta-enas- -- that the two parts of the expression are semantically
disharmonious. The wish expressed to the Maruts is that they should be durdhártu-,
which should mean ‘difficult to maintain or uphold’ or, extending the sense of √dhṛ
a bit, ‘difficult to restrain’. This works pretty well in the directive: the Maruts should
not hold back from punishing someone who insults one of us. The gen./abl. nidáḥ is
not the ideal case, but it may well refer back to the same form in 6d té na uruṣyatā
nidáḥ “deliver us from insult,” with a highly condensed expression. In the publ. tr. I
have tr. the form in 9e as “at an insult” rather than “from an insult,” because
“difficult to restrain from an insult” sounds as if the Maruts are itching to insult us.
The question is -- why are they like ancient mountains (jyéṣṭhāso ná párvatāsaḥ)
when they are acting thus? As a class of objects, mountains are among the least likely
to need restraining: they are fixed and stable. Ge gets out of this problem by
supplying, out of whole cloth, a different quality that the Maruts and the mountains
have in common, the parenthetical “(ragend),” but there is no basis for this. WG take
jyéṣṭḥa- itself as the point of comparison (despite the fact that it should really be part
of the simile proper) and push its sense: “sehr mächtig wie die Berge.” I think the
clue to the solution is the location of these mountains, vyòman ‘in distant heaven’.
There are of course no mountains in heaven, at least in the usual Vedic cosmological
picture -- but there used to be: the winged mountains that flew around until Indra
clipped their wings. The splv. jyéṣṭhāsaḥ ‘most ancient’ may refer to this primal,
unclipped state. Although this interpr. may seem farfetched, I think it best accounts
for the odd expression -- and this may be Re’s view too, based on his tr. “comme de
très puissantes montagnes (qui circuleraient) dans l'espace” (he has no disc.). Note in
any case that the mountains here recall the mountain(s) in vs. 1 (girijā́-) and possibly
162
vs. 3; the agreement in sense with vs. 1 provides another example of non-lexical ring
composition.

Couples desirous of thine aid are storming thee, pouring their presents forth to win a stall of kine, pouring gifts, Indra, seeking thee.  
     When two men seeking spoil or heaven thou bringest face to face in war,  
     Thou showest, Indra, then the bolt thy constant friend, the Bull that ever waits on thee.

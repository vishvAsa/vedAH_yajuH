The first maṇḍala of the R̥gveda is also, in part, one of its later additions, as was  discussed in detail in the general introduction. Like Maṇḍala X, it consists of 191  hymns, which belong to two different strata of the text. The first fifty hymns, attrib uted to six different groups of poets, constitute the later stratum. They are primarily  in dimeter meter, sometimes arranged in tr̥cas, and the Kaṇva affiliation of a number of the poets connects this section with Maṇḍala VIII.

- 1–11 Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra (etc.)
- 12–23 Medhātithi Kāṇva
- 24–30 Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
- 31–35 Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
- 36–43 Kaṇva Ghaura
- 44–50 Praskaṇva Kāṇva

For the most part the poetry is not particularly inspired and has a narrow liturgical  focus, especially in the first few collections. The major exception is the brief series  attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, all in trimeter meter. This sequence contains  one of the most famous hymns in the R̥gveda, I.32, the clearest treatment of the  Indra-Vr̥tra myth and a poetic masterwork, as well as I.33, less celebrated but displaying equal poetic skill.

The second and far longer part of Maṇḍala I (51–191) consists of hymns attributed to nine groups of poets:

- 51–57 Savya Āṅgirasa
- 58–64 Nodhas Gautama
- 65–73 Parāśara Śāktya
- 74–93 Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
- 94–115 Kutsa Āṅgirasa (etc.)
- 116–126 Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
- 127–139 Paruchepa Daivodāsi
- 140–164 Dīrghatamas Aucathya
- 165–191 Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi

A number of these poets have quite distinctive stylistic personalities and thematic  preoccupations, and their collections contain some of the most glorious poetry in  the R̥gveda. Some of the hymns are quite famous (e.g., I.164, the “riddle hymn”; I.179, the dialogue between the seer Agastya and his impatiently amorous wife  Lopāmudrā), but there are many treasures to be unearthed among the lesser known  hymns. We refer the reader to the introductions to the various hymn collections and  their individual hymns.

The first ten hymns of the R̥gveda are attributed to Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra, with  I.11 ascribed to his son or descendant Jetar Mādhuchandasa. After the opening hymn  to Agni and two hymns (2–3) to the deities of the Praügaśastra litany, the remainder  of the hymns are addressed to Indra, most of them relatively simple and without  notable features.

It is of course appropriate that the whole R̥gveda collection should begin with a  hymn to the deified ritual fire as the focal point of the sacrificial system. This hymn  in its relative simplicity and its clear exposition of Agni’s ritual role seems almost to  have been chosen for this prominent position for pedagogical purposes. It certainly  continues to serve such purposes in the modern West, where it is generally the first  hymn a student of the R̥gveda encounters and from which the mysteries of Vedic  Sanskrit grammar—accents, subjunctives, unexpected long vowels, variant nominal  forms, and so on—and of Vedic ritual are absorbed. It is therefore not surprising  that it is often assumed to be typical of R̥gvedic Agni hymns, but this is emphatically not the case: elsewhere in the R̥gveda Agni hymns often display especially contorted syntax and complex imagery and glory in enigma and paradox. The choice  of this particular Agni hymn to open the R̥gveda thus seems even more purposeful  against the background of more standard treatments of Agni.

## 1 Agni
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
9 verses: gāyatrī
As Oldenberg (1897) has noted, the first verse of this hymn was apparently the first  verse of the R̥gveda already at the time of the composition of X.20–26, a collection  that also begins agním īḷe. The two hymns that follow, I.2 and I.3, together invoke  the principal deities of the three soma-pressings in a day-long soma rite. This hymn  forms an appropriate opening for them, since the sacrifice is instituted first by the  placement of fire, although the sacrificial fire here is not just the fire of the soma  rite, since in verse 7 the poet speaks of revering the fire every day.
Here, as in other hymns to Agni, the poets praise him as the deified Fire of  the sacrifice, who moves between the divine and human realms. Agni is a god,  and yet he is also the visible fire, accessible to humans. As both god and element,  Agni is “placed to the fore” (vs. 1) because the principal fire of the sacrifice is  placed in the east of the sacrificial area and because the god Agni leads the  appearances of the other gods of the rite. He is a divine priest, who carries the  offerings and praises of the human priests to the gods and who brings the gifts of the gods to mortals. Saussure describes this hymn as a “versified paradigm of  Agni,” since it begins by mentioning the god’s name in various cases as the first  word in the first pāda of the first five verses: accusative, nominative, instrumen tal, dative, and again nominative (Elizarenkova 1995: 153). Displaying one of the  verbal tricks R̥gvedic poets delight in, this pattern is broken by modification at  the beginning of verse 6, which opens yád aṅgá, the latter word being a particle  that is also a scrambling of the god’s name. The same verse ends with an epithet  of Agni in the vocative, aṅgiraḥ, likewise a phonological scrambling of his name.  The vocative agne is also found in three of the last four verses (vs. 8 is the exception). This structure not only displays the artfulness of the poet, but perhaps also  suggests the various forms of the sacrificial Fire that are analogous to the many  grammatical forms of the word “fire.”
1. Agni do I invoke—the one placed to the fore, god and priest of the  sacrifice,
the Hotar, most richly conferring treasure.
2. Agni, to be invoked by ancient sages and by the present ones—
he will carry the gods here to this place.
3. By Agni one will obtain wealth and prosperity every day,
glorious and richest in heroes.
4. O Agni, the sacrifice and rite that you surround on every side—
it alone goes among the gods.
5. Agni, the Hotar with a poet’s purpose, the real one possessing the  brightest fame,
will come as a god with the gods.
6. When truly you will do good for the pious man, o Agni,
just that of yours is real, o Aṅgiras.
7. We approach you, o Agni, illuminator in the evening, every day with our  insight,
bringing homage—
8. (You), ruling over the rites, the shining herdsman of the truth,
growing strong in your own home.
9. Like a father for a son, be of easy approach for us, o Agni.
Accompany us for our well-being.
## 2 Vāyu (1–3), Indra and Vāyu (4–6), Mitra and Varuṇa (7–9)
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
This and the following hymn constitute what is later called the Praügaśastra, the  “yoke-pole-tip recitation,” which is the second recited litany in the morning soma pressing. In classical śrauta ritual the śastra consists of seven sets of three verses or
90 I.2
tr̥cas. In the recitation each triplet of verses is preceded by an introductory nivid, a  brief declaration of the deities invoked in the recitation. Recitations typically combine  verses from different hymns, or they may require that the form of the R̥gvedic verses be  recast, but in this case the nivids need only be added to produce the recitation. These  two hymns, therefore, are already fit for the classical performance of the soma ritual.
As Insler (2002) has shown, the sequence of gods in I.2–3 represents the sequence  of gods who receive cups of soma during the soma-pressing day. The rite reflected  in the hymns was neither a version of the soma ritual represented in the Family  Books of the R̥gveda nor that of the classical ritual, although it comes fairly close  to the latter. Rather, these two hymns represent a transitional period in the develop
ment of the soma rite as it moved toward its classical form.
In the R̥gvedic rite, Vāyu was the first of the gods to receive the soma and there fore the first tr̥ca of I.2 is dedicated to him. In the classical rite, the recipients of  soma at the Morning Pressing are, for the most part, dual divinities. The first pair  is Indra and Vāyu, to whom our second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is dedicated, and the second  pair is Mitra and Varuṇa, addressed in our third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9).
In I.3 the first tr̥ca is dedicated to the two Aśvins, who are the third set of dual  divinities at the classical Morning Pressing. In the classical rite there are also morn ing offerings to Indra and to the All Gods. Those gods are mentioned in the next  two tr̥cas (Indra, vss. 4–6; the All Gods, vss. 7–9), but at the time of the composition  of these hymns, these verses probably refer to the midday and evening rites rather  than to the morning offering.
In most of the Family Books of the R̥gveda, Indra alone is the principal at the  Midday Pressing, though especially in Maṇḍala III there is evidence that the Maruts  have joined Indra as dedicands, as in the classical rite. The Maruts are not mentioned  in our hymn, however, and were probably not a part of the soma rite for which these  hymns were composed. Although the R̥bhus and Indra were the principal recipients  of soma at the Third Pressing for most of the R̥gvedic period, the R̥bhus are absent  from this hymn, indicating that, as also in the classical rite, they had already all  but disappeared from the soma rite. Rather, in this hymn and in the classical rite,  there is a soma offering to the All Gods in the evening. This association of the All  Gods with the Third Pressing must be fairly old, since the Brāhmaṇa texts refer to  the Third Pressing as vaiśvadevyam “belonging to the All Gods.” The last tr̥ca (vss.  10–12) of I.3 is to Sarasvatī, who does not receive an offering in the Third Pressing  at the classical rite and has only a limited presence in the R̥gveda. However, she  likely did receive soma at the Third Pressing in the period of this transitional rite.
For further on this śastra and the order of divinities addressed, see the other  hymns with this structure, I.23 and II.41, as well as I.139 in part. It is not clear why  the śastra has been split into two hymns just in this case.
The actual content of the two hymns is quite simple. In I.2 the first two tr̥cas to  Vāyu and Indra and Vāyu respectively announce that the soma has been pressed  and urge the gods to come to our sacrifice. The tr̥ca to Mitra and Varuṇa is slightly  more interesting, in that it mentions the frequently conjoined notions of “insight” (dhī́), “skill” (dákṣa), and “resolve” or “purpose” (krátu), the three elements neces sary to conceive and carry out an action.
1. O Vāyu, lovely to see, drive here! Here are the properly prepared soma  juices.
Drink of them! Hear our summons!
2. O Vāyu, with their hymns the singers sing you here—
they who have pressed soma, who understand the (ritual) days.
3. O Vāyu, your nourishing stream infusing (the soma) is going along for  the pious man—
the broadly spreading (stream) for soma-drinking.
4. O Indra and Vāyu, here are the soma-pressings: come near with  delight,
for the soma drops are eager for you.
5. O Vāyu and Indra, you take note of the pressings, you two rich in  prizewinning mares.
Drive right here at speed.
6. O Vāyu and Indra, drive right here to the appointed place of the  soma-presser,
swiftly and according to our insight right to the point, you superior men.
7. I call upon Mitra of refined skill and Varuṇa, who cares for the stranger, the two who send our ghee-covered insight to its goal.
8. By truth— o Mitra and Varuṇa, strong through truth, touching truth— you have attained your lofty purpose.
9. The two sage poets, Mitra and Varuṇa, powerfully born, having a wide  dwelling place,
furnish us effective skill.
## 3 Aśvins (1–3), Indra (4–6), All Gods (7–9), Sarasvatī (10–12)
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
See the introduction to the preceding hymn. This hymn is the continuation and  conclusion of the Praügaśastra and follows the order of divinities discussed in the  introduction to I.2. As in I.2, the contents are fairly banal—urging each god or  divine group to come and enjoy our sacrificial offerings.
In both I.2 and I.3 the tr̥cas contain internal repetitions that unify them, though  these unifying devices are of an elementary type. There are also less apparent link ages between tr̥cas created by verbal repetitions in the last verse of one tr̥ca and the  first of the next. So, for example, I.2.6c and 7c mention our “insight” (dhī́). The last
92 I.4
pāda (c) of I.3 begins ā́ yātam and 4a has ā́ yāhi “drive here,” both imperatives to  the same root. And 6c and 7c refer to sutá “pressed soma,” though there is no obvi ous link between the third tr̥ca of I.3 and the last one to Sarasvatī.
1. O Aśvins, quick-handed lords of beauty, in the sacrificial refreshments find your delight, you two providing many enjoyments.
2. O Aśvins of many wondrous powers, you superior men with powerful  insight,
you holy ones, cherish our songs.
3. O wondrous Nāsatyas, the soma-pressings of the man who has twisted  the ritual grass are seeking you.
Drive here, o you who follow the course of the Rudras [=Maruts].
4. O Indra, drive here!—you of bright radiance. These soma-pressings  here are seeking you,
the ones purifed in full measure by delicate (fingers).
5. O Indra, drive here!—roused by our insight, sped by our inspired poets, to the sacred formulations of the cantor who has the pressed soma.
6. O Indra, drive here!—thrusting yourself onward to the sacred
formulations, o possessor of fallow bays.
Take delight in our pressed soma.
7. O helpers, supporters of the peoples, you All Gods—come here as pious ones to the pressed soma of the pious man.
8. The All Gods crossing the waters—come here to the pressed soma!— like ruddy (cows) to good pastures.
9. The All Gods—unfailing, undeceiving, (with the byword) “come,  don’t go!”—
enjoy the ritual offering as its conveyors.
10. Let pure Sarasvatī, providing prize mares along with prizes,
be eager for our sacrifice, bringing goods through her insight.
11. The impeller of liberal gifts, taking note of good thoughts,
Sarasvatī has received our sacrifice.
12. Her great flood does Sarasvatī reveal with her beacon.
She rules over all insights.
## 4 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
As Bergaigne (1889: 182) points out, the hymns I.4–9, all dedicated to Indra, all in  gāyatrī, and all attributed to the same Vaiśvāmitra poet, form the texts on which the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest, an assistant of the Hotar, draws for supplementary  verses at the Morning Pressing.
This particular hymn consists of three tr̥cas and a final summary verse (10);  the first and last tr̥cas are fairly conventional. In the first (vss. 1–3) the poet calls  on Indra to come to our sacrifice and consume our soma. In the last (vss. 7–9)  the poet again offers Indra soma and recounts Indra’s past deeds inspired by his  soma-drinking, with hopes for similar future exploits.
The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is a different matter and displays some anxiety about  the poet’s exclusive focus on Indra—“putting all his eggs in one basket,” in the  English idiom. In verse 4, immediately after the peremptory command to Indra,  “come here!” the poet orders himself (or another person?) to “go away!”—to seek  out Indra and inquire who he [=Indra, in our view] favors as a comrade, in an  indirect question with a curious mixture of direct and indirect syntax. The ques
tion is also rhetorical: the poet expects Indra to favor him, and in verses 5 and 6  he defends the exclusive partnership against unnamed cavilers, by asserting that  having Indra alone on his side is a good bargain. The defensive tone of this tr̥ca  may seem an odd feature of the first full hymn to Indra in the R̥gveda, but it does  strike a note that we will meet again and again in the collection—the worried hope  that Indra will indeed choose to attend our sacrifice and that he will extend his help  to us alone.
1. The one who assumes a good form for help—like a good milk-cow for a  cow-milker—
do we call upon every day.
2. Come here to our pressings. Drink of the soma, soma-drinker.
It’s a rich man’s exhilaration that gives cows.
3. Then might we know your favors up close.
Do not look past us—come here!
4. Go away! Ask Indra, spirited and indestructible, attentive to poetic  inspiration,
who is your choice from among your comrades.
5. And let scorners say to us, “You have missed out on the rest
in placing your friendship in Indra alone.”
6. But (even) a stranger—(indeed all) the separate peoples—would say we  have a good portion, o wondrous one.
(For) we would be in the protection of Indra alone.
7. Bring the swift to the swift—(bring soma), the glory of the sacrifice,  causing exhilaration to men,
exhilarating our comrade [=Indra] in its flight.
8. Having drunk of this, o you of a hundred resolves, you became the bane  of obstacles.
You helped the prizewinner to the prizes.94 I.5
9. We incite you, the prizewinner, to the prizes, o you of a hundred  resolves,
to win the stakes, Indra.
10. He who is a great stream-bed of wealth but easy to cross, the comrade  of the soma-presser—
to him, to Indra, sing!
## 5 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
A generally unremarkable hymn, with the usual offering of soma and praise to  Indra in return, we hope, for help and favor. The favors especially desired are help  and support in battles and raids and the victory prizes won in them (see vss. 3–4,  9–10), and the hymn ends (vs. 10) on a slightly worried note, with a reference to our  enemies among men.
Structurally, the hymn divides into two halves. In the first (vss. 1–5), the poet  addresses his fellow priests, commanding them to sing the songs, pointing to the  prepared soma, and declaring what Indra can do. In the second half (vss. 6–10) he  turns to Indra himself, reminding the god what the offerings will do for him. The  birth of Indra (vs. 6) refers not only to his ancient birth but also to his appearance  at this sacrifice. The single day in which he achieves his full strength is the sacrificial  day, so that by the end of the day, he has the power to help the sacrificers.
1. Here—come here—sit down: sing forth to Indra,
o comrades, whose vehicles are praise songs—
2. To the first among many, having control of desirable things,
to Indra when the soma is pressed.
3. Will he be here for us at our hitching up (for war), he for wealth, he in plenty? Will he come to us with prizes of victory?
4. He whose two fallow bays his rivals do not obstruct in the competition or  in combats—
to him, to Indra, sing!
5. These pure [=unmixed] pressed soma drinks go in pursuit of the  soma-drinker,
and those mixed with curds.
6. You were born and were grown strong in a single day to drink the  pressed soma,
for preeminence, o Indra of good resolve.
7. Let the swift soma drinks enter you, o Indra, who long for song.
Let them be weal for you, the discerning one. 8. The praises have strengthened you, you the recitations, o you of a  hundred resolves.
Let our songs strengthen you.
9. Providing his imperishable help, Indra should win this prize of a  thousand—
he in whom are all manly powers.
10. Let mortals not plot deception against our bodies, o Indra, who long  for song.
Having control of it, keep away the deadly weapon.
## 6 Indra (1–3, 10), Maruts (4, 6, 8–9), Indra and Maruts (5, 7)
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
A disjointed and episodic hymn. The Anukramaṇī ascription of the verses to a  combination of Indra and the Maruts is reproduced in the above heading, but it  is almost certainly wrong—though the confusion generated by the hymn makes  the error pardonable. The Maruts do not appear to figure in the hymn at all, and,  though Indra does, there are other divine figures in some of the verses assigned to  him. As often, the hymn jumps back and forth from 2nd- to 3rd-person reference  and from past to present time, but in this case the jumps are particularly disorient
ing and the overall structure hard to discern.
Modern attempts at interpretation generally begin with the Vala myth and the  main divine personages therein, Indra and the Aṅgirases, his singer-assistants in  this myth. The myth is most clearly alluded to in verse 5, the central verse (espe cially if vs. 10 is considered to be a mere variant of parallel vs. 9), and we may see  here an interesting structural contrast to the omphalos hymn: instead of embedding  the mystery in the middle verse and leading up to and away from it with clearer  material, the poet here may have designed the middle verse as the key to the many  questions posed by the diffuse fragments surrounding it and a motif in which to  integrate them.
In any case verse 5 presents us with Indra finding the hidden cows within a  stronghold with the help of an unnamed group, who must be the Aṅgirases. In  our view this myth does provide the thematic backdrop for the whole hymn and is  alluded to directly (or as directly as it gets) also in verses 6 and 8. But most of the  rest of the hymn treats the ritual re-creation of Indra’s releasing the dawns from the  Vala cave—namely the rising of the sun, the kindling of the ritual fire, and Indra’s  journey to the early-morning sacrifice, and the most enigmatic verses refer, in our  view, to Agni—not, as in other interpretations, to the sun or to Indra.
A brief and tentative synopsis: the first two verses, parallel in structure, depict  the simultaneous hitching up of the sun (vs. 1) and Indra’s chariot (vs. 2) for their
96 I.6
respectively daily journeys. These verses are set in the present moment. Verse 3 is  structurally paired with verse 7 in the architecture of the hymn; both are addressed  to an unidentified 2nd sg. referent—in our view Agni, who is kindled at dawn (vs.  3) at the same time as Indra arrives at the sacrifice (vs. 7). Verse 3 is set in the mythic  past, perhaps at Agni’s first kindling by the Aṅgirases, an event also presented in  verse 4, while verse 7 returns us to the present. (Verse 3 also contains an absolutely  baffling 2nd plural vocative, “o young men,” embedded within a verse with entirely  2nd singular reference. Short of emendation, there is little to be done with it, though  it may refer to the plural subjects of verse 4, the fire-priests, who kindled the embry onic Agni.) Verse 5 provides the Vala-myth clue, and the remainder of the verses  meld a mythic account of the rituals of dawn with reference to the ritual of the  present moment.
1. They hitch up the coppery, ruddy (sun) that circles around the ones  [=stars?] standing still.
The lights are alight in heaven.
2. They hitch his beloved fallow bays to his chariot on opposite sides, the bold pair of sorrels, conveyors of the superior man [=Indra].
3. You young men—making a beacon for that without beacon and an  ornament for that without ornament,
you [=Agni] were born together with the dawns.
4. Certainly, just after that they once again roused his embryonic state  [=kindled the fire] according to his nature,
acquiring for themselves a name worthy of the sacrifice.
5. Along with the (ritual-)conveyors [=Aṅgirases] who break even the  stronghold, o Indra,
you discovered the ruddy (cattle) even though in hiding.
6. As those seeking the gods (bellow) their thought, the songs have  bellowed to the finder of goods,
great and famous.
7. Since you [=Agni] will come to sight along with Indra, having joined  together with the fearless one,
(you two are) the delighting pair who share the same luster.
8. Together with the irreproachable, heaven-bound (Aṅgirases), the battler  chants mightily,
together with Indra’s beloved troops.
9. From there or from the luminous realm of heaven come here, o  earth-circling one.
The songs converge on him.
10. We beseech Indra for gain from here, the earthly realm, or from heaven, or from the great airy space.
## 7 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
A relatively simple praise of Indra, focused especially on his possession of the mace  (vss. 2c, 3c, 7b) and his help in battles and contests (vss. 4–6). Indra’s mythologi cal exploits receive cursory treatment in verse 3. A more insistent theme emerges  toward the end, with an accumulation of loaded terms for potentially rival groups  of people: kr̥ṣṭī́ḥ “communities” (8b), carṣanīnā́m “domains” (9a), páñca kṣitīnā́m “the five peoples” (9c), jánebhyaḥ “men” (10b), culminating in the hope that Indra  will leave those rivals behind and become exclusively ours.
But one can say that the real focus of the hymn is Indra’s name. The poem,  especially its first half, is characterized by the insistent repetition of the name, with  “Indra” as the first word in verses 1–5 and also in verse-internal lines 1b, 1c, 2c, and  5b. After verse 5, the poet noticeably pauses in verses 6–8, using the name only once.  Even so, that one occurrence, which is in 7b, is in a marked position as the middle  word of the middle line of the middle verse of this three-verse section. This pause or  break accents the reappearance of the name twice in rapid succession at the begin
ning of 9c and 10a. Thematically, the emphasis on the name of Indra underscores  the poet’s desire that the person of Indra, independent of all else, be present at his  sacrifice.
Verse 6 contains a somewhat obscure request that Indra “uncover yonder pot.”  “Yonder pot” probably refers to anything distant that contains what the poet and  his people want or need. A reasonable parallel is VIII 23.29bc, tváṃ no gómatīr íśaḥ,  mahó rāyáḥ sātím agne ápā vr̥dhi “Uncover for us refreshments consisting of cows  and the winning of great weath, o Agni,” with the same 2nd-sg. imperative ápā vr̥dhi “uncover” and a desirable object.
1. Just to Indra have the singers bellowed aloft, to Indra the chanters with  their chants,
to Indra their voices.
2. Indra, close-linked with his two fallow bays, (is mounted) on the two  yoked by speech;
Indra is the golden wielder of the mace.
3. Indra made the sun mount in heaven for the long view.
He propelled apart the rock with the cows (inside).
4. O Indra, help us when prizes and stakes of thousands (are set),
as the mighty one with mighty forms of help.
5. Indra do we call upon when the stake is great and Indra when  it’s small,
our mace-wielding yokemate amid obstacles.
98 I.8
6. You bull who give in every way, uncover yonder pot
for us, since you are one who cannot be repulsed.
7. The praises of mace-wielding Indra that go higher at every thrust— I cannot get enough of good praise for him.
8. Like a bull his herds, the buffalo rouses the communities with his might, since he is the master who cannot be repulsed.
9. Indra, who alone has control over the settled domains and their goods, and over the five people,
10. Indra do we summon for you from the men all around.
Let him be exclusively ours.
## 8 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
The first part of the hymn (vss. 1–4) asks Indra for help in battle and for the wealth  (both material and in manpower) to make success in combat possible. With Indra’s  help, the sacrificer and his men become almost aspects of Indra himself. As he is  the “smasher of obstacles,” so they will “keep obstacles hemmed in.” They take up  Indra’s mace (vs. 3) and become his “hammers,” which smash their enemies. They  acquire Indra as their yokemate (vs. 4).
The second part (vss. 5–10) celebrates the extent of Indra’s power and the ben efits it brings to the men who attain him and it. This theme is first expressed rela tively straightforwardly (though with suppressed syntactic connection) in verses  5–6. But in verse 7 Indra’s vastness is conveyed by a striking image, syntactically  untethered, where his cheek and his gullet are compared to the wide, swollen sea.  This image introduces the final three verses (8–10), each of which begins evā́ hí “in just this way, in the same way.” In our view the underlying “same” is Indra’s  vast extent—both physically, in the images of verse 7, and metaphorically, in the  immense liberality (vs. 8) and help (vs. 9) he bestows on us. The final verse (10),  though introduced with the same expression, turns to our obligations to Indra,  and, again by implication, it is suggested that our praises of Indra are as vast as  his gifts to us.
The hymn is characterized throughout by chaining between verses, often not  overtly marked.
1. O Indra, bring wealth here—winning, conquering, ever overpowering, highest—for our help—
2. (Wealth) by which we will keep obstacles hemmed in, hemmed in by  bare-knuckled fighting,
hemmed in (by fighting) on horseback, when we are helped by you. 3. O Indra, helped by you, might we, as your hammers, take up your mace; might we conquer our opponents completely in the fight.
4. With champion archers, with you as our yokemate, Indra,
might we overcome those doing battle.
5. Great is Indra, and now let the greatness for the mace-wielder be (even)  beyond (that).
Like heaven in its extent is his capacious power
6. (For those) who have attained (him)—either superior men in the clash  or at the winning of offspring
or inspired poets seeking (him) through insight.
7. His cheek, the best soma-drinker, which swells like the sea—
his gullet (which is) like the wide waters...
8. Just the same is his liberality—copious, great, conferring cattle, like a ripe branch for the pious man.
9. Just the same is your help, o Indra—extensive for one like me,
present in an instant for the pious man.
10. In the same way those things beloved of him, praise song and
recitation, are to be proclaimed,
for Indra to drink the soma.
## 9 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
The “message” of this hymn is the standard one: Indra is urged to drink of our  soma and enjoy our praise songs and in return to provide us with the usual good  things. This relation of reciprocity is nicely conveyed stylistically by complementary  paired repetitions. For example, in verse 2 Indra is to be “sent surging” to the soma  (2a), while the same verb is to be supplied for the soma’s movement to Indra (2b).  Though this verb √sr̥j is an unusual choice to describe Indra’s locomotion, it is a  standard idiom applied to soma’s progress, especially in the Soma Maṇḍala (IX).  (See here also the songs sent surging in verse 4.) Similarly “spur on” in verses 5–6  with “us” once as goal (vs. 5) and once as direct object (vs. 6), and verse 10 where  both Indra and the chant directed to him are characterized as “lofty,” after two  occurrences of “lofty” applied to fame (vss. 7–8).
For readers interested in comparative Indo-European poetics, the most nota ble feature of the hymn is an instance of the famous, but relatively rare, formula  “imperishable fame” (śrávaḥ... ákṣitam) in verse 7, where the two words are found  in separate pādas (b and c). The resonance of this formula and the concept behind  it may account for the near-exact repetition of the “place fame in us” expression in  verses 7–8.
100 I.10
1. Indra, come! Reach exhilaration from the stalk with all its soma-joints. (You are) the great one, superiority (itself) by reason of your power.
2. Send him [=Indra] surging to the pressed soma, and (send) the
exhilarator [=soma] (surging) to Indra, who seeks exhilaration,
the doer to him who does all things.
3. O you of the lovely lips who govern all domains, reach exhilaration  through the exhilarating praise songs
here at these soma-pressings.
4. Our songs have been sent surging to you, Indra. They have reared up  toward you—
not (yet) pleasured, they (have reared up) toward the bull, their
husband.
5. Spur on your bright benefit entirely in our direction, o Indra—the  benefit worth wishing for:
just yours will be the farmost and foremost.
6. Spur us on then for wealth, so that we acquire vehemence
and glory, o powerfully brilliant one.
7. Place in us, o Indra, broad and lofty fame, accompanied by cattle and  victory prizes,
lifelong and imperishable.
8. Place in us lofty fame and brilliance that best wins a thousand,
and refreshments by the cartload.
9. (We are) singing with songs to Indra, the goods-master of goods, the  one worthy of verses,
who will come to the call for help.
10. To him who is at home at every soma-pressing, to the lofty one, the  stranger himself chants a lofty,
lusty (chant) to Indra.
## 10 Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
12 verses: anuṣṭubh
Oldenberg (1888:  226)  remarks on the idiosyncratic arrangement of the  Madhuchandas hymns (1–11) and on the location of this and the following  hymn in particular. Contrary to the usual arrangement, the gāyatrī hymns of this  collection (1–9) are placed as a group together before these final two hymns in  anuṣṭubh.
Though the hymn displays the usual reciprocal balance between what we offer  to Indra and what we ask him for, the poet focuses more on the verbal offerings  we make than on the soma. Songs, praise hymns, and recitations are mentioned in verses 1, 3–5, 9, 12—with a bit of thematic ring composition linking the first verse  and the first half of the last one (12ab).
As in the last hymn (I.9) reciprocal actions are posited of Indra and his wor shipers. For example in verse 4ab Indra is ordered to respond to our verbal praises  by verbal actions of his own. In 4cd/5ab we first command Indra to strengthen  us and our ritual, and then we produce a recitation meant to strengthen Indra  in turn. We both urge him to enjoy our companionship (5d) and beg him to give  us his (6a). The most ingenious example of reciprocal action is found in verse 7,  in the ambiguous form tvā́dātam. The topic is the Vala myth and the glory that  accrues from opening the Vala cave and driving out the cows. Indra of course is  the major actor in this myth, and tvā́dātam íd yáśaḥ can be interpreted as “(that)  glory is acquired only by you” (based on the idiom ā́ √dā “take, acquire”). But  Indra also shared the action with the Aṅgirases, and the myth is also often rein
terpreted as engaging human priests in its ritual re-enactment, so that the same  phrase can also mean “(that) glory is given only by you” (with the simplex √dā “give”). Either interpretation is morphologically, grammatically, and contextually  possible.
There is otherwise little remarkable about the hymn, though in several verses  the poet echoes passages found elsewhere, which he twists to a different, sometimes  opposite meaning (cf. 7b with III.40.6, 8b with I.176.1, and 9ab with VII.32.5).
1. The singers sing to you; the chanters chant their chant.
The formulators (of sacred speech) hold you up like a roof-pole, o you  of a hundred resolves.
2. When he has mounted from peak to peak and has seen much to be done, then Indra perceives his purpose, and the ram stirs with his flock.
3. Hitch up your long-maned fallow bays, the two bullish ones filling their  girthbands;
then proceed to the hearing of our songs, o soma-drinking Indra.
4. Come to our praise songs. Cry out to them, applaud them, and bellow  to them.
Together with us, good Indra, make our formulation and our sacrifice  strong.
5. A strengthening recitation is to be proclaimed to Indra who provides  many fulfillments,
so that the able one will take pleasure in our soma-pressings and in our  companionship.
6. Just him do we beg for companionship, him for wealth, him for an  abundance of good heroes.
He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes  the goods.
7. Easily opening (the pen), easily driving out (the cows)—(that) glory is  acquired [/given] only by you, Indra.
102 I.11
Open the pen of the cows; show your generosity, o possessor of
the stone.
8. Since both world-halves together cannot budge you when you show  your mettle,
you will conquer the waters along with the sun. Shake loose the cows  for us.
9. You of listening ear, listen to our call: now accept my songs.
Indra, make this praise song of mine closer even than your yokemate. 10. Since we know you as the best of bulls, who listen to calls when prizes  (are at stake),
we call for the help of the best of bulls, the help that best wins a thousand. 11. O Indra, (god) of Kuśika, finding exhilaration, drink our pressed soma. Lengthen our lifetime anew; make the seer the winner of a thousand. 12. Let these songs surround you on every side, o you who long for songs. Let strengths accompany the one whose lifetime has been strengthened;  let enjoyments be enjoyed (by him).
## 11 Indra
Jetar Mādhuchandasa
8 verses: anuṣṭubh
Attributed to a descendant of Madhuchandas, the poet of I.1–10, this relatively  simple hymn has little distinctive about it. Several famous deeds of Indra are men tioned (Vala verse 5, Śuṣṇa verse 7), and our praises and Indra’s countergifts are  celebrated. These general themes are similar to those found in the Indra hymns of  the ancestral Madhuchandas.
The poet is fond of etymological figures: “best charioteer of charioteers” (1c),  “the conqueror who is not to be conquered” (2d), “with your tricks...the tricky...”  (7a), and the probably etymologically unrelated but phonologically similar máṃhate  maghám “grants the bounty” (3d).
1. All the songs have strengthened Indra, expansive as the sea,
the best charioteer of charioteers, the lord of prizes and the lord of
settlements.
2. In comradeship with you who control the prizes, o Indra, let us not fear,  o lord of power.
We keep crying out to you, the conqueror who is not to be conquered. 3. Many are the gifts of Indra; his forms of help do not become exhausted when he grants to his praisers the bounty of a prize consisting of cattle. 4. He was born as a splitter of strongholds, a youthful poet, possessed of  immeasurable power.
Indra is the sustainer of every deed, the much-praised wielder of the mace. 5. You uncovered the opening of Vala filled with cattle, o possessor of  the stone.
Before the fearless one [=Vala?], the gods, though being pushed back,  came to your aid.
6. I came back with your gifts, o champion, announcing (them) to our  boundary river.
O you who long for songs, the bards have approached me: they know of  this (act) of yours.
7. With your tricks, Indra, you brought down tricky Śuṣṇa.
The wise know of that (act) of yours. Raise up their fame!
8. The praise-songs have cried out to Indra, who holds sway by his might, whose gifts are a thousand or even greater.
I.12–23 are attributed to Medhātithi Kāṇva, also supposedly the poet of some  verses in the early hymns of Maṇḍala VIII, a predominately Kāṇva book, as well  as the second hymn of the Soma Maṇḍala (IX.2). The Medhātithi First Maṇḍala  hymns here are all in gāyatrī meter, save for some stray verses in I.17 and 23. They  are dedicated to a variety of deities; in fact, each hymn has a different divinity or  set of divinities. The poet has a particular penchant for dedicands in pairs (Indra  and Varuṇa I.17, Agni and the Maruts I.19, Indra and Agni I.21) or groups (Viśve  Devāḥ I.14, R̥bhus I.20, variety of divinities I.13, 15, 22–23), and in the group  hymns a high proportion follow particular ritual litanies: Āprī (I.13), R̥tugrahas  (I.15), Praügaśastra (I.23).
The style and contents of these hymns are for the most part elementary, even  banal, and there is generally a strong focus on purely ritual matters, to the virtual  exclusion of description, mythological references, praise, and even requests for aid  and gifts. In short, a poetically uninspiring collection, but the information it gives  about the early shape of later ritual litanies is valuable.
## 12 Agni
Medhātithi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn has a high proportion of pādas repeated from other hymns, and  in some ways seems to have been assembled rather than composed. It touches on  the standard characteristics and roles of Agni: messenger, priest, and poet, con veyor of the gods to the sacrifice, and protector and benefactor of men. There is  essentially no description of fire; the focus is entirely on the ritual.
1. Agni we choose as messenger, the Hotar affording all possessions, very effective for this sacrifice.104 I.13
2. Agni after Agni they always invoke with invocations as the clanlord, conveyor of the oblations, dear to many.
3. Agni, convey the gods here, as soon as you are born, for the man who  has twisted the ritual grass.
You are the Hotar, to be reverently invoked by us.
4. Awaken the eager ones, when you travel on your mission, o Agni. With the gods sit here on the ritual grass.
5. O shining one whose oblation is ghee, burn against those who do harm, o Agni, against demonic beings.
6. By Agni is Agni kindled—poet, houselord, youth,
conveying the oblation, with the sacrificial ladle in his mouth.
7. Praise Agni, the poet whose ordinances hold true at the ceremony, the god who banishes afflictions.
8. The lord of the oblation who honors you as his messenger, o god Agni, for him become a helper.
9. The possessor of the oblation who seeks to win Agni to pursue the gods, to him be merciful, o pure one.
10. O pure, shining Agni, convey the gods here to us,
right up to our sacrifice and oblation.
11. Being praised with our newer song, bring us
wealth, a refreshment made of heroes.
12. Agni, with your blazing flame, along with all the invocations to the gods, enjoy this praise of ours right now!
## 13 Āprī
Medhātithi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī
This is the first Āprī hymn to be encountered in the R̥gveda of the ten in the text.  In these hymns, associated with a litany during the Animal Sacrifice, a set series  of subjects or key words (here italicized) is treated verse by verse, in fixed order  but with variable wording. This particular Āprī hymn is a much less elaborated  version than some exemplars of this form; in this hymn the default model verse is  a bare mention of the topic as object of the phrase “I invite” (vss. 3, 7, 8, 10, 12).  Description is minimal and for the most part predictable.
1. Well-kindled, o Agni, convey the gods here to us, to the man offering  the oblation,
and perform sacrifice, o pure Hotar.
2. O Tanūnapāt, make our sacrifice full of honey and make it be among  the gods
today, to be pursued, o poet. 3. Narāśaṃsa, the dear one, I invite here to this sacrifice,
the honey-tongued preparer of the oblation.
4. O Agni, on the best-naved chariot convey the gods here when you are  solemnly invoked.
You are the Hotar, installed by Manu.
5. Strew in due order the ritual grass with ghee on its back, o
inspirited ones,
where the sighting of the immortal (host) (will be).
6. Let them gape open—the Divine Doors, increasing through truth,  inexhaustible—
today and now for sacrifice.
7. Night and Dawn, well-ornamented, I invite to this sacrifice,
to sit here on this ritual grass of ours.
8. The two well-tongued poets, the Divine Hotars, I invite.
Let them perform this sacrifice for us right here.
9. Iḍā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, the three goddesses who are joy itself—
let them sit, unfailing, on the ritual grass.
10. Here I invite foremost Tvaṣṭar who provides all forms.
Let him be ours alone.
11. Release, o Lord of the Forest, the oblation to the gods, o god.
Let the display of the giver be outstanding.
12. With the svāhā-cry perform the sacrifice for Indra in the house of the  sacrificer.
There do I invite the gods.
## 14 All Gods
Medhātithi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī
Though this hymn is dedicated to the All Gods, its focus is on Agni’s role in  conveying the gods to the sacrifice and serving as the mouth and tongue through  which they drink the oblations (see esp. vss. 7–8). The All God theme is cleverly  introduced in the first verse by parceling out the phrase “with all these gods,” a  word at the beginning of each pāda (an effect clumsily reproduced in transla
tion), and an enumeration of some of the most important of the gods is given  in verse 3, But otherwise (save for mention of Indra and Vāyu, the recipients  of the first soma offering, in vs. 10) the gods are an undifferentiated group and  backgrounded to Agni.
The poet does not forget his own, however. He mentions his kin-group, the  Kaṇvas, twice (vss. 2, 5) as the ritualists preparing the sacrifice.
106 I.15
1. With these, o Agni, hither to friendly service, to hymns—with all (of  them), for soma-drinking—
with the gods, come and perform sacrifice.
2. The Kaṇvas have called to you; they hymn your insightful thoughts, o  inspired poet.
With the gods, o Agni, come hither.
3. Indra and Vāyu, Br̥haspati, Mitra (and Varuṇa), Agni, Pūṣan, Bhaga, the Ādityas, the Marutian flock (have the Kaṇvas called).
4. The drops are brought forward for you (all)—the invigorating,
exhilarating
droplets of honey sitting in the cups.
5. Seeking aid they solemnly invoke you, (o Agni)—the Kaṇvas with their  twisted ritual grass
and their oblations, as they make fit preparations.
6. Ghee-backed, yoked with mind are the draft-horses that draw you and the gods here to drink the soma.
7. Those (gods) deserving the sacrifice, strong through truth—bring them  here along with their wives, Agni.
Make them drink of the honey, you of good tongue.
8. Those who deserve the sacrifice, who are to be invoked, let them drink  with your tongue
of the honey, when the vaṣaṭ-call is made, o Agni.
9. The inspired poet, the Hotar, will convey all the gods awakening at dawn hither from the luminous realm of the sun.
10. With all (the gods), o Agni, with Indra and with Vāyu, drink the  somian honey
according to the ordinances of alliance.
11. As the Hotar installed by Manu, Agni, you sit at the sacrifices.
So perform this rite for us now.
12. O god, yoke the ruddy (mares) to your chariot, the fallow bays, the  chestnuts.
Then with them convey the gods hither.
## 15 R̥tudevatāḥ (Sequential Deities)
Medhātithi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn has a precise ritual application: it accompanies a series of ritual offer ings (R̥tugrahas “sequential cups”) made in a fixed order to a fixed sequence of  gods by a similarly fixed sequence of priests, roughly matched in function to  the gods they serve. (See, e.g., Eggeling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2: 319 n. 1.) The same sequence is found in the two hymns II.36–37, which together are entirely  parallel to this hymn. (See further remarks in the introductions to those hymns.)  The divine order and the priestly counterparts are the following. (The priests  are not all mentioned by title in this hymn, but those not bracketed are found in  II.36–37.)
1. Indra Hotar
2. Maruts Potar
3. Tvaṣṭar Neṣṭar
4. Agni Agnīdh
5. Indra/Br̥haspati Brahman
6. Mitra and Varuṇa Praśāstar
7. Wealth-Giver Hotar
8. Wealth-Giver Potar
9. Wealth-Giver Neṣṭar
10. Wealth-Giver [Achāvāka, in later ritual]
11. Aśvins [2 Adhvaryus, in later ritual]
12. Agni Gr̥hapati [Yajamāna, in later ritual]
It will be noted that cups 7–10 are dedicated to the same divinity, “Wealth-Giver,”  Draviṇodā(s), a vague figure defined only by his name who is not on the same level  as the other gods, and the associated priests simply repeat the initial order. It has  been convincingly argued by Renou (1950 [1978]) that as the word r̥tú was reinter
preted from merely “sequence, turn” to “season,” the number of divinities in this  litany was increased to twelve to match the months of the year by the insertion of  a simple placeholder. For further on the ritual and its transformation see, inter alia,  Minkowski (1991: 81–89).
1. O Indra, drink the soma in your turn. Let the drops enter you,
the invigorating ones finding their home there.
2. O Maruts, drink in your turn from the cup of the Potar. Purify the  sacrifice,
for you are the ones of good drops.
3. Welcome our sacrifice; o Neṣṭar [=Tvaṣṭar], along with the Wives (of the  Gods), drink in your turn,
for you are the conferrer of treasure.
4. O Agni, convey the gods here; make them sit in the three wombs. Attend on them; drink in your turn.
5. O Indra, from the Brahman’s largesse drink the soma according to  your turns,
for only your comradeship cannot be brought to ruin.
6. You two, o Mitra and Varuṇa of steadfast commandments, have attained  skill difficult to trick
and the sacrifice in your turn.
108 I.16
7. As for the Wealth-Giver of wealth—those with the pressing stones in  their hands in the ceremony
solemnly invoke the god at the sacrifices.
8. Let the Wealth-Giver give us goods that are famed.
We shall win these for ourselves among the gods.
9. The Wealth-Giver desires to drink: pour and set it forth;
send it from the Neṣṭar’s cup by turns.
10. When we sacrifice to you, o Wealth-Giver, the fourth time by turns, then become a giver to us.
11. O Aśvins, you who have luminous fire and blazing commandments,  drink the honey in your turn, you whose vehicle is the sacrifice.
12. Through your lordship in the house, o companion, you are leader of the  sacrifice in your turn.
Sacrifice to the gods for the one who seeks the gods.
## 16 Indra
Medhātithi Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī
This is nothing more than an extended invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice,  with a tempting menu of offerings and praises. One might say about this hymn that  it makes reading the R̥gveda seem easy; it also makes it seem not worth the trouble.
1. Let the fallow bays convey you here, the bull to drink the soma— those with the eye of the sun (convey) you, Indra.
2. Here are the roasted grains, bathing in ghee; the fallow bay pair will  convey Indra here right to them
in the best-naved chariot.
3. Indra we invoke early in the morning, Indra as the ceremony advances, Indra to drink of the soma.
4. Come up here to our pressed soma, Indra, with your shaggy fallow bays, for when it is pressed we invoke you.
5. Come here to this praise of ours, up to this pressing here when it is  pressed.
Drink like a thirsty buffalo.
6. Here are the pressed soma drops on the ritual grass.
Drink them, Indra, for might.
7. Here is the foremost praise for you; let it be most availing, touching  your heart.
So drink the pressed soma.
8. To every pressing when it is pressed Indra goes for exhilaration,
the Vr̥tra-smasher, to drink the soma. 9. Fulfill this desire of ours with cows and horses, o you of a hundred  resolves.
Very attentive, we will praise you.
## 17 Indra and Varuṇa
Medhātithi Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī
Like Medhātithi’s other hymns, this address to Indra and Varuṇa is elementary in con tents: the poet calls upon those gods to aid him and give him lavish gifts in exchange  for hymns. The two gods are addressed together, and there is no mention of the dis tinctive qualities of either god. Only in verse 5, the middle verse, are the gods sepa rated, and even there the structures in which they appear are parallel and colorless. In  contrast to the predictable and banal contents, the syntax of the hymn is surprisingly  problematic. There are a number of ellipses that cannot be reliably filled (see, e.g., the  parenthetic additions in verses 3–6) and syntactic clashes that are difficult to rational ize (e.g., in verse 4, whose translation skates over some of the problems). The poet  may have been trying to inject some surprise into a tired poetic assignment.
1. I choose the aid of Indra and Varuṇa, the sovereign kings.
They will be gracious to such as us.
2. For you two are the ones who come for aid to the call of an inspired poet  like me,
and are the upholders of the settled domains.
3. Satisfy (us) according to our desire from your wealth, o Indra and  Varuṇa.
We beseech you two for closest (friendship).
4. For we would like to be (part) of the powers of you two,
of your favors that grant victory prizes.
5. Indra is (master?) of (favors) that grant thousands, Varuṇa of (riches)  worth proclaiming.
Their resolve becomes worthy of hymns.
6. With the aid of just those two might we win and secure (the winnings). And might there be a surplus.
7. Indra and Varuṇa, I invoke you two for brilliant bounty.
Make us victors.
8. Indra and Varuṇa, just now, while our poetic insights are striving to win  you two,
extend shelter to us.
9. Let that lovely praise reach you two, Indra and Varuṇa, which I invoke, which you bring to fulfillment as your joint praise.
110 I.18
## 18 Brahmaṇaspati [Lord of the Sacred Formulation] (1–3),  Brahmaṇaspati, Indra, and Soma (4), the Same with Daksiṇ ̣ā (5);  Sadasaspati [Lord of the Seat] (6–8), Sadasaspati or Narāsaḿ ̣sa (9)
Medhātithi Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn falls into two parts: verses 1–5 concern Brahmaṇaspati (in part in con junction with other gods), 6–9 Sadasaspati. Though Brahmaṇaspati is a well-estab lished divinity and an allo-form of the even better established Br̥haspati, Sadasaspati  “Lord of the Seat” occurs only here (and once elsewhere, in Medhātithi’s oeuvre,  in the variant epithet sádaspáti used of the dual divinities Indra and Agni, I.21.5).  Thus “lord of the seat” is not a separate divinity, but the functional descriptor of  another god. In our view the god in question is Agni, and the hymn balances the  two major constituents of the sacrifice: the verbal portion overseen by the Lord of  the Sacred Formulation and the physical portion embodied by Agni, the Lord of  the (Ritual) Seat and the conduit for oblations to the gods.
The first part actually says little about the mastery of verbal powers—except by  repeating the name Brahmaṇaspati and, strikingly, by calling on that god to make  the unnamed poet “a Kakṣīvant,” one of the most skilled of R̥gvedic poets, to whom  I.116–126 are ascribed. (Unfortunately, Brahmaṇaspati did not succeed in effecting  this transformation, at least judging from the banality of Medhātithi’s preserved  poems.) Otherwise these first five verses call on the god to help and protect us, espe
cially from hostile speech (vs. 3). Perhaps because the epithet “Lord of the Seat” is  a sort of riddle, the second part of the hymn is more explicit about the activities of  the divinity who has this title, and the descriptions in verses 7 and, especially, 8 make  Agni the clear referent. The final verse (9) begins with another epithet, Narāśaṃsa,  also used of Agni elsewhere, as is the adjective “most extensive” (because of the  spreading of his smoke), and the final phrase “like one besieging the seat of heaven”  can refer to the rising of this smoke toward the sky, taking the oblations with it.
Though, as is generally the case with Medhātithi’s work, the phraseology of the  hymn is not particularly impressive, and it contains a number of phrases borrowed  from other hymns, the complementarity of the two parts and the handling of the  riddling second half make this a more pleasing composition than some of the oth
ers in this group.
1. O Lord of the Sacred Formulation, make him a possessor of soma, a  sounding [/sun-like] one,
(make him) a Kakṣīvant, who is (also) descended from fire-priests.
2. He who is rich, who smashes afflictions, while finding goods and  increasing prosperity,
let him accompany us, he who is powerful.
3. Let not the (male)diction, the malice of the grudging mortal reach us. Guard us, Lord of the Sacred Formulation. 4. That hero is certainly not harmed whom Indra, whom the Lord of the  Sacred Formulation,
whom Soma urges on—(though he is) mortal.
5. O Lord of the Sacred Formulation, (protect) him; let Soma and Indra  (protect) the mortal:
Let the Priestly Gift protect (him) from difficult straits.
6. The Lord of the Seat, infallible, dear and desirable to Indra,
I have besought for wisdom as our gain.
7. Without whom the sacrifice even of one attentive to poetic inspiration  does not succeed,
he drives the team of insightful thoughts.
8. Then he brings to success the preparation of the oblation; he advances  the ceremony;
he goes with the libation to the gods.
9. “Praise of men” [/Narāśaṃsa], the boldest, most extensive one did I see— like one besieging the seat of heaven.
## 19 Agni and the Maruts
Medhātithi Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī
The divinity pairing in this hymn—the fire-god Agni and the stormy troop of  Maruts—is an uncommon one and makes little mythological sense and little sense in  R̥gvedic ritual (though in later śrauta ritual there is an Āgnimāruta śastra recited in  the Third Pressing). In fact the pairing exists in this hymn only in its refrain; the first  two pādas of each verse are directed at one or the other: Agni in verses 1, 2, and 9,  the Maruts in vss. 4–8. All of the Marut verses are structured as definitional relative  clauses beginning with yé “which ones, those who,” following the model of hymns  like II.12, and the contents are typical Marut themes. Verse 3 is a curious exception,  for pāda b names the All Gods (or “all the gods”) though in a context and with  a predicate (pāda a) appropriate to the Maruts—and beginning with the same yé.  Medhātithi also identifies the Maruts with the All Gods elsewhere (I.23.10).
1. Toward this pleasing ceremony you are called, for its protection.
– With the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
2. For no god nor mortal is beyond the will of you who are great.
– With the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
3. Those who know the great airy realm, the All Gods without deceit— with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
4. Those who chanted the chant, the strong ones, unassailable through their  strength—
with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
112 I.20
5. Those who are resplendent, of terrible form, of good dominion, caring  for the stranger—
with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
6. Those who as gods sit in the luminous realm of the firmament, in  heaven—
with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
7. Those who make the mountains swing, across the undulating sea— with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
8. Those who stretch with their reins across the sea with their strength— with the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
9. Toward you I dispatch the somian honey, for you to drink first.
– With the Maruts, o Agni, come hither.
## 20 R̥bhus
Medhātithi Kāṇva
8 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn works briskly and efficiently through the marvelous feats accomplished  by the R̥bhus, a trio of craftsmen, originally mortal, who attained immortality  and a share in the sacrifice by their skilled work. This last achievement is stated  clearly in the final verse (8; see also 2c, 5), while verses 2–6 enumerate the separate  actions that led to it. Several features give shape to the basic list structure of the  hymn. The name of the divine dedicands appears only once, in the exact middle  of the hymn (vs. 4c), and the adjective “best conferring treasures” of 1c is opened  out into its phrasal syntactic equivalent “confer treasures” in verse 7, providing  a loose ring.
1. This praise here has been made for the godly breed by the inspired poets  by mouth—
a praise that best confers treasures.
2. Those who fashioned for Indra with mind the two fallow bays yoked by  speech,
they attained the sacrifice through their labors.
3. They fashioned for the Nāsatyas an earth-circling, well-naved chariot; they fashioned a juice-yielding milk-cow.
4. They whose mantras come true, who aim straight—the R̥bhus—
made their parents young again through their toil.
5. Your exhilarating drinks have united with Indra accompanied by  the Maruts
and with the kingly Ādityas.
6. And this beaker of the god Tvaṣṭar new produced
you made again into four. 7. On us, on the soma-presser confer treasures, three times seven,
one after the other, for good lauds.
8. The conveyors secured and by their good work shared in
the sacrificial share among the gods.
## 21 Indra and Agni
Medhātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
Though Indra and Agni are joint recipients of a certain number of R̥gvedic hymns,  they do not form a natural pair (though they do receive a joint offering of soma  in the later śrauta ritual, the Aindrāgnagraha), and the hymns to them rarely rise  above the commonplace—as is true also for this one.
The first four verses are invocation, calling the two gods to the sacrifice and promis ing them praise and soma. The two interior verses (2–3) use the lexeme prá √śaṃs “pro claim, eulogize,” which is later specialized for royal panegyric (the praśastis of classical  inscriptions, etc.), and it may have some of that tone here as well. (For royal associations  of the lexeme in the R̥gveda, see Jamison 2007: 146–48.) In verse 3 the object of the  praśasti is the word mitrá; unlike most commentators, we do not believe that this refers  to the god Mitra, but rather to the abstract “alliance” that Mitra embodies, a sense that  would be appropriate to an official and royal context. The alliance we wish to proclaim  may be (as we have translated it here) the alliance between the two gods, joining two  distinct aspects of Vedic religion, though it could also be their alliance with us.
Verses 5–6 then suggest what these allies can do for us; the final verse is intro duced by the pregnant phrase “by this truth,” characteristic of the later satya-kriyā or “truth-formulation.” Here it presumably refers to the whole preceding hymn as  an expression of truth.
1. I call Indra and Agni here. For those two alone we desire a praise hymn. They are the best soma-drinkers of soma.
2. Proclaim them at the sacrifices; embellish Indra and Agni, o men. Sing to them in songs.
3. We call these two to proclaim their alliance; we call them, Indra and Agni, the two soma-drinkers, to drink soma.
4. Those two, though formidable, we will call near to this pressing
pressed here.
Let Indra and Agni come right here.
5. As great lords of the seat, Indra and Agni, crush the demonic force. Let the voracious ones be without offspring.
6. By this truth be watchful over the footprint of discernment [=ritual  ground].
Indra and Agni, extend (us) shelter.114 I.22
## 22 Various Gods (Aśvins 1–4, Savitar 5–8, Agni 9–10, Gods 11, Indrāṇī, Varuṇānī, Agnāyī 12, Heaven and Earth 13–14, Earth 15, Viṣṇu or Gods 16, Viṣṇu 17–21)
Medhātithi Kāṇva
21 verses: gāyatrī
The Medhātithi group ends with two lengthy hymns to a variety of divini ties:  the ascriptions of the Anukramaṇī are reproduced above. As Oldenberg  points out (1888: 224–25; Noten ad loc.), both hymns can easily be broken down  into smaller hymns, which then conform to the principles of arrangement in the  Saṃhitā. The clear changes of divinity support the division of this hymn into  smaller units, although Oldenberg’s divisions do not altogether match those  of the Anukramaṇī; Oldenberg’s are clearly superior:  1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–15,  16–18, 19–21.
Like the immediately preceding hymn, the first sections of this one are pri marily devoted to invocation of the various gods:  the Aśvins in verses 1–4,  Savitar in 5–8. In a slight variation on this theme, in verses 9–12 Agni is called  upon to bring Tvaṣṭar and the Wives of the Gods to the sacrifice; this divine  group figures in a number of minor rites in the Soma Sacrifice (especially  the Third Pressing) and elsewhere. The next three verses (13–15) concern  Heaven and Earth; the middle verse (14) is the only truly enigmatic one in  the hymn. The final six verses (16–21) consist of two tr̥cas to Viṣṇu, which,  both by the principles of arrangement and by their phraseology, should be  considered two separate hymns. There is no obvious reason, either ritual or  mythological, for collecting these particular short compositions in a single  super-hymn. As Oldenberg argues, the grouping and order seem to be entirely  mechanical.
1. Awaken the two who hitch up early in the morning. Let the Aśvins  come here,
to drink of this soma.
2. Those two possessing a good chariot who are the best charioteers, both  gods who touch heaven,
the Aśvins we invoke.
3. The honeyed whip that is yours, Aśvins, that has a liberal spirit— with that mix the sacrifice.
4. For it is not even a little distance from you, when you come in your  chariot
to the house of a man with soma, Aśvins.
5. I call upon golden-palmed Savitar for help.
He, through his divinity, is attentive to the track. 6. Praise the Child of the Waters, Savitar, for help.
We desire his commandments.
7. We call upon the apportioner of goods, of brilliant bounty,
on Savitar, whose eye is on men.
8. Comrades, sit down here: Savitar is now to be praised by us.
The giver beautifies his bounties.
9. Agni, convey the eager Wives of the Gods here,
and Tvaṣṭar, for soma-drinking.
10. Agni, youngest one, convey the Wives here for help, and
Hotrā Bhāratī,
Varūtrī, Dhiṣaṇā.
11. Let the goddesses, Wives of superior men [=gods], attend upon  us greatly with help, with shelter—those with unclipped
wings.
12. Here I call upon Indrāṇī, Varuṇānī for well-being,
upon Agnāyī for soma-drinking.
13. Let the great ones, Heaven and Earth, mix this sacrifice for us.
Let them carry us through with their support.
14. The inspired poets lick the ghee-filled milk of this very pair [=Heaven  and Earth] with their poetic insights,
in the firm footstep of the Gandharva.
15. Earth, become comfortable, a place to settle down, not sweeping  men away.
Extend to us widespread shelter.
16. Let the gods help us from there whence Viṣṇu strode out
from the earth through the seven domains.
17. Viṣṇu strode out this (world); three times he laid down a step:
(this world) is concentrated in his dusty (step).
18. He strode three steps, Viṣṇu the undeceivable cowherd,
founding the foundations from there—
19. Behold the deeds of Viṣṇu: from (the place) where he watches over the  commandments,
the partner in yoke with Indra,
20. That is the highest footstep of Viṣṇu. The patrons always
behold it
stretched out like the eye [=sun] in heaven.
21. That do the inspired poets, admiring and wakeful, kindle—
the highest footstep of Viṣṇu.

## 23 Various Gods (Vāyu 1, Indra and Vāyu 2–3, Mitra and Varuṇa  4–6, Indra Marutvant 7–9, All Gods 10–12, Pūsan 13–15, Waters ̣ 16–23ab, Agni 23cd–24)
Medhātithi Kāṇva
24 verses: gāyatrī, except puraüṣṇih 19, anuṣṭubh 20, 22–24, pratiṣṭhā 21, arranged  in tr̥cas
Although the principles of hymn arrangement strongly suggest that this twenty four-verse hymn is a composite, consisting of eight individual tr̥cas, the situation  is quite different from the previous hymn, I.22, where the collection was dictated  merely and mechanically by the number of verses in each segment, without a par ticular ritual application. Here the separate tr̥cas follow the order of a structured  recitation in the Morning Pressing, later called the Praügaśastra. Other instances  of this litany are found in R̥gveda I.2–3 and II.41, and to some extent I.139; for a  detailed discussion of the Praügaśastra see the introduction to I.2.
This hymn varies somewhat from the standard Praügaśastra, which has the fol lowing divinities in the following order: Vāyu (1), Indra-Vāyu (2), Mitra-Varuṇa  (3), Aśvins (4), Indra (5), the All Gods (6), Sarasvatī (7). This hymn lacks the Aśvins  in position 4, but in position 5 Indra, instead of being alone, is accompanied by the  Maruts, and though the following tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) is ascribed by the Anukramaṇī to  the All Gods, it is dominated by the Maruts. Since offering to Indra with the Maruts  is made only in the Midday Pressing, and to the Aśvins in the Morning Pressing,  perhaps this version of the litany is shifting its focus to the Midday Pressing and to  the ritual innovation that extended offering to the Maruts, rather than just Indra,  at that pressing. (See further discussion in the introduction to I.165.) Pūṣan is also  added after the All Gods (position 6), and instead of the divine river Sarasvatī in  position 7 we find the functionally similar Waters.
The first three verses to the waters (16–18) bring the Praügaśastra proper to an  end. The last six verses (19–24) are a supplement, in a somewhat Atharvan style,  treating the waters as healers and removers of transgressions. These functions of  the waters bring to mind the “Final Bath” or avabhr̥tha in classical śrauta ritual,  in which the sacrificer and his wife wash each other at the conclusion of the sacri
fice, and these verses may have been included in this hymn in order to encompass  the entire soma-pressing day, from the first offering to Vāyu to the final cleansing.  The middle four verses of this sequence (20–23) are also found in a hymn to the  waters, X.9.6–9, and the introductory and final verses here (19 and 24) may have  been added to create two triplets for this tr̥ca hymn.
As in other of Medhātithi’s hymns, the actual contents are fairly simplistic,  consisting primarily of invocations to the various gods and invitations to the  soma-drinking. Perhaps the most interesting sequence is the tr̥ca to Pūṣan (vss.  13–15), who finds the hidden king and is urged to drive him here “like lost live
stock.” Most commentators identify this king as Soma, but the thematics and  phraseology—particularly the notion of finding and returning a hidden deity—are much more characteristic of Agni, and we have interpreted these verses in that way.  Whether the king is Agni or Soma, however, it is not clear what this snatch of myth  is doing here in this hymn, though Pūṣan’s ability to locate lost cows is proverbial.
1. Sharp are the soma drinks—come here. Here are the pressings mixed  with milk.
Vāyu, drink those set forth.
2. Both gods who touch the heaven, Indra and Vāyu, do we call,
to drink of this soma.
3. Indra and Vāyu, mind-swift, do the inspired poets call for help— the thousand-eyed lords of insight.
4. Mitra do we call and Varuṇa, for soma-drinking—
the two born with refined skill.
5. Those who through truth increase by truth, the lords of truth, of light, these two, Mitra and Varuṇa, do I call.
6. Varuṇa will become a helper, as will Mitra with all forms of help. They will make us well rewarded.
7. We call Indra accompanied by the Maruts here for soma-drinking. Along with the troop let him reach satiety.
8. Having Indra as chief, the Maruts as troop, and the gifts of Pūṣan,  o gods,
all of you, hear my call.
9. Smash Vr̥tra, you of good drops [=Maruts/All Gods], with Indra and  his might as yokemates.
Let no defamer hold sway over us.
10. The All Gods we call, the Maruts, for soma-drinking,
for they are strong, with Pr̥śni as their mother.
11. The thundering of (you) Maruts, like that of victors, goes boldly, when, o men, you drive in beauty.
12. Born out of the laughing lightening, from there let them help us; let the Maruts be merciful to us.
13. O Pūṣan, glowing one—the buttress of heaven [=Agni?] with his  glittering ritual grass—
drive him here like lost livestock.
14. Pūṣan the glowing has found the king [=Agni], hidden, laid in hiding, with his glittering ritual grass.
15. And with drops (of ghee) he will keep driving along to me the six yoked  (flames),
as if plowing a grain(field) with oxen.
16. The motherly ones [=waters], siblings, go along the ritual roads of those  who perform the rites,
mixing the milk with honey.
118 I.23
17. Those (waters) yonder that are close to the sun, or with whom the sun is— let them propel our rite.
18. The goddess Waters do I call upon. Wherever our cows drink,
to the rivers an oblation is to be made.
19. Within the waters is deathlessness, in the waters healing, and (it is right)  to glorify the waters.
O gods, become prizewinners.
20. “Within the waters,” Soma said to me, “are all healing remedies, and Agni who is weal to all.” And the waters are healing for all.
21. O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my body
and (for me) to see the sun for a long time.
22. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me—
whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth. 23. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap. Full of milk, come here, o Agni. Merge me with luster.
24. Merge me with luster, Agni, with offspring, with long life.
The gods should know this (hymn?) of mine; Indra should know it
along with the seers.
As Oldenberg (1888: 225) observes, I.24–30, the Śunaḥśepa hymns, like the preced ing Medhātithi hymns (I 12–23), generally follow the organization of the hymns of  Maṇḍala VIII. He argues that irregularities in the placement of I.25, 27, and 30 can  be explained if these hymns are composites of several hymns.
The story of Śunaḥśepa, the putative poet of these hymns, appears in Aitareya  Brāhmaṇa VII 13–18 and Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra XV 17–27. According to the  story, King Hariścandra had begged Varuṇa for a son and promised that if Varuṇa  gave him one, he would sacrifice his son to the god. A boy, Rohita, was born to  Hariścandra, but the king managed to delay the sacrifice of his son until Rohita  reached adulthood. When the king could no longer avoid the inevitable sacrifice,  he told Rohita that he was to be sacrificed to Varuṇa. But Rohita refused to be the  sacrificial victim and departed the kingdom. As a result Hariścandra was struck by  dropsy in punishment for not performing the sacrifice.
In his travels Rohita eventually came upon a poor brahmin named Ajīgarta, who  sold his son Śunaḥśepa to Rohita to be a substitute sacrificial victim. Rohita returned  with Śunaḥśepa and Varuṇa accepted the substitution of Śunaḥśepa for Rohita. But  when Śunaḥśepa was bound to the stake and was about to be killed, he appealed to  the gods by reciting I.24.1 to Prajāpati, the god Ka (cf. 1a kásya “of which (god)?”  and 1c káḥ “who?”), 24.2 to Agni, 24.3–5 to Savitar, 24.6–15 and I.25 to Varuṇa,  I.26 and 27.1–12 to Agni, 27.13 to the All Gods, I.29 and 30.1–16 to Indra, 30.17–19  to the Aśvins, and 30.20–22 to Dawn. Each time Śunaḥśepa recited a verse, one of  his bonds was loosened and Hariścandra’s belly became smaller. With the last verse  Śunaḥśepa was free of his bonds and Hariścandra was free of disease. Although I.24 refers directly to Śunaḥśepa and to his rescue by Varuṇa, the story  of Śunaḥśepa in the form in which it told in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa does not fully  correspond to that at the basis of any of the hymns in this collection. Probably  closer to the R̥gvedic version is that alluded to in the Yajurveda. Taittirīya Saṃhitā
V 2.1.3 and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā XIX 11 say simply that Śunaḥśepa had been seized by  Varuṇa but then rescued himself from Varuṇa’s bonds.
## 24 Agni, Savitar, and Varuṇa
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
15 verses: triṣṭubh 1–2, 6–15; gāyatrī 3–5
This hymn consists of three sections in alternating meters, with each section  devoted to a different god. The first two verses in triṣṭubh invoke Agni, then verses  3–5 in gāyatrī address Savitar, and finally the remainder of the hymn, once more  in triṣṭubh, is dedicated to Varuṇa. Despite this variation the hymn is a coherent  composition and not a composite of three hymns wielded together (cf. Oldenberg  1888: 226 n.). Formal evidence for its unity is that Aditi, the goddess who represents  Innocence or Guiltlessness, appears in verses 1 and 2 and then again in the last  verse, verse 15, creating a ring.
Apparently the poet and his people have been afflicted in some way. In the later  Veda dropsy is associated with Varuṇa, and so it could be this or another disease  that troubles the sacrificers. The poet believes that the cause of their affliction is that  Varuṇa is angry with them for some offense they have committed (cf. vs. 11) and  therefore has “bound” them in the bonds of misery.
The first god invoked is Agni, whose presence introduces the ritual that  addresses the plight of the sacrificers. The poet already signals the purpose of  his hymn and rite by asking which god will return his people to Aditi, to the  “Guiltlessness” that the goddess embodies. Aditi is the mother of the Ādityas, and  therefore reference to her leads to mention of the poet’s own mother and father.  The poet implies that because of some offense he might die before his father and  mother. That would be tragic and unnatural, since children should not predecease  their parents.
There follow the three verses to Savitar, which also mention the god Bhaga  “Fortune.” Both Savitar and Bhaga are Ādityas, so the poet is still moving toward  Varuṇa, the greatest of the Ādityas. In verse 3 the poet asks Savitar for a “por tion” (bhāgá) of the wealth that Savitar can bring, and this leads in verse 4 to  mention of the god Bhaga. In verse 4 the priest performing the rite appears to  embody Bhaga because he attains adveṣáḥ “freedom from hostility.” This “hostil ity” represents everything that stands in the way of the life and prosperity of the  poet, but it also prefigures the anger of Varuṇa, from which the poet hopes for  release. The presence of Savitar, who is associated with night, might also suggest
120 I.24
that the rite for which the hymn was composed took place in the evening. In verse  10 also the poet refers to the constellation of Ursa Major and to the moon. But  Varuṇa’s rule is not restricted to the night, since the poet also says that Varuṇa  creates the path for the sun (vs. 8). In verse 7 too the crest of the nyāgrodha or  banyan tree, which sends down aerial roots, may refer to the sun. This would  explain the description of these aerial roots as “beacons” that take root within  humans as the light of inspiration (7c). In verse 12a the rule of Varuṇa over both  night and day is reflected in the truth spoken to the poet at night and by day. It is  a truth toward which the poet’s own intuition—perhaps that light received from  Varuṇa—has struggled (12b).
However, the poet’s concern is not as much with the cosmic roles of Varuṇa as  it is with the bondage Varuṇa has inflicted on the poet and his people. The poet  looks back to Śunaḥśepa as an example of someone who was bound and then  released by Varuṇa. He even merges his own bonds and the bonds of Śunaḥśepa: in  13d the poet’s plea to Varuṇa to “release the fetters” refers to Śunaḥśepa’s bonds  and to the present bonds that afflict him. Once free of those bonds, the poet will  be restored to guiltlessness, under the protection of the commandment of Varuṇa  (vs. 15).
1. The dear name of which god, of which of the immortals, shall we recall? Who will return us to great Aditi [/Guiltlessness]? I would see my father  and mother.
2. We will recall the dear name of the god Agni, of the first of the
immortals.
He will return us to great Aditi. I would see my father and mother.
3. O god Savitar, master of desirable things,
we implore you for a portion, o you who ever give.
4. For also the one who is Fortune [/Bhaga], laboring correctly for you  ahead of reproach,
has received freedom from hatred in his hands.
5. We would reach upward to (a portion) of that apportioned by Bhaga  through your help,
in order to take hold of the head of wealth.
6. Yet not even birds flying yonder have attained your rule, power, or fervor, nor have these waters moving without blinking, nor those [=the gods]  who confound the wind’s formless mass.
7. In (the airy realm) without a base, King Varuṇa of purified skill firmly  holds the crest of the (nyāgrodha) tree on high.
They [=its trunks] reach downward, their base above. They should be set  down as beacons within us.
8. Since King Varuṇa made a broad path for the sun to follow,
he has created two feet for the footless (sun) to give it support, and he  exorcises even what pierces the heart. 9. A hundred healers are yours, o king, a thousand. Let your favor be  broad and deep.
Drive dissolution far away into the distance. Release from us even the  guilt we have created.
10. Yonder Bears [=stars of Ursa Major], set on high, are visible at night;  they have gone somewhere else by day.
The commandments of Varuṇa cannot be cheated: the moon goes at  night, earnestly looking around.
11. Extolling you with my formulation, I implore this of you; with his  offerings the sacrificer hopes for this:
Become no longer angry now, Varuṇa! O you of wide fame, do not steal  away our lifetime!
12. They say to me just this at night, this by day; my intuition looks out  here from my heart toward this:
The one whom Śunaḥśepa called upon when he was seized, let him,  King Varuṇa, release us!
13. Since Śunaḥśepa, seized and bound in three stocks, called upon the  Āditya,
King Varuṇa should set him loose. Let him—the knowing one, never  cheated—release the fetters.
14. We beg to appease your anger by our acts of reverence, Varuṇa, appease  it by our sacrifices and offerings.
Holding sway, o attentive lord and king, you will loosen for us the guilt  we have created.
15. Loosen above the uppermost fetter from us, o Varuṇa, below the lowest,  away the midmost.
Then under your commandment, o Āditya, we would be without
offense for Aditi [/Guiltlessness].
## 25 Varuṇa
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
21 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
Oldenberg suggests that the first four tr̥cas of this hymn (vss. 1–12) originally  formed one hymn, and the last three (vss. 13–21), a second one. One indication of  this division is that verse 12 reads like a concluding verse. Thematically, however,  the two parts of the hymn both emphasize the sovereignty of Varuṇa, and the hymn  as a whole begins (3a) and ends (19b) with an appeal for his mercy. So if this is a  composite hymn, it is nonetheless a coherent one.
One repeated pattern in this hymn is the movement from Varuṇa’s distance,  which can mark his displeasure, to his closeness. The first tr̥ca, for example, fears
122 I.25
the offense that the poet might have given Varuṇa and the anger of the god. In the  second the poet speaks of his songs, which will dispel the god’s fury, and his hopes  that he will bring Varuṇa near (5). He concludes that Mitra and Varuṇa are never  far from one who serves them (6c). The closeness of Varuṇa is again the theme of  the fifth tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), which opens the second part of the hymn. Varuṇa first  appears in majesty, wearing the mantle of a king (13a), but at the same time, like a  king, he is also very near. His spies are everywhere (13c) and no deceit or evildoing  escapes his attention (14). The last verse of the tr̥ca combines his majesty and his  presence. In verse 15 the poet repeats ā́ “here” three times at the end of each of its  three pādas, culminating in the unexpected and dramatic assertion that Varuṇa’s  glory is “right here within our bellies.” We understand the presence of Varuṇa’s  glory in the belly as signifying the radical closeness of Varuṇa, but there are other  ways of interpreting it. The reference to “bellies” has led Geldner, for example, to  understand this as a healing hymn for dropsy, a disease associated with Varuṇa.  The final plea for release from fetters, which occurs also as the last verse of I.24,  offers support for this interpretation. Nevertheless, we regard it as unlikely. It does  not suit the context of verse 15, and the fact that verse 21 is the final verse of  the preceding hymn implies that it is a formal conclusion, not a critical thematic  statement.
The same movement from distance to proximity also occurs in the sixth tr̥ca.  In its first verse (16) the poet says his insights go far away, looking for Varuṇa;  in its last (18) the poet sees Varuṇa and his chariot here on earth. The middle  verse is obscure, although in one way or another it describes the movement of  the god and the poet toward one another, since the poet asks the god to come  to an agreement with him. The “honey” the poet serves is probably not soma,  even though soma is often called “honey” or “honeyed.” Since the poet begins  the tr̥ca with a reference to his “insights,” the honey in verse 17 is more likely his  song, for speech also can be “honeyed” (cf. I.78.5). More difficult is the honey  that is brought to the poet by the god. Perhaps it is the rain, which can also  be “honey” (III.62.16, V.69.2ab), and perhaps too the waters and the rain are  the visible signs of Varuṇa’s presence that the poet sees according to verse 18.  Varuṇa’s control over the rain is an aspect of his kingship: compare VII.49.3,  “In the middle of which king Varuṇa travels, looking down upon the truth and  falsehood of the peoples, / those, clear and pure, that drip honey—let those  waters, goddesses, help me here.”
1. Even if every day we confound your commandment, o god Varuṇa, as clans (do their king’s commandment),
2. Do not subject us to your deadly weapon when you are enraged,
nor to your fury when you are angry.
3. For your mercy we would unbind your thought (from such anger), like a  charioteer a horse that has been tied,
by our songs, Varuṇa. 4. For my fury-dispelling (songs) fly afar to seek a better thing,
like birds toward their nests.
5. When will we attract broad-gazing Varuṇa—the superior man, glorious  in his rule—
to gain his mercy?
6. The two [=Mitra and Varuṇa] have attained just that (rule) in common.  Keeping watch, they do not keep to a distance
for the pious man who upholds their commandments.
7. He who knows the track of birds flying through the midspace,
knows the (courses of the) boats, since he belongs to the sea.
8. He whose commandments are upheld knows the twelve months and  their offspring [=the half-months];
he knows the one that is born afterward [=the thirteenth month].
9. He knows the trail of the wind—of the broad, towering, and lofty  (wind);
he knows those [=the Maruts] who sit upon it.
10. He whose commandments are upheld, Varuṇa sat down among the  dwelling places,
for the sake of his universal kingship—he whose resolve is strong.
11. From there, watchful, he looks upon all (deeds), unmistakable
(to him)—
both those done and those that must be done.
12. Of strong resolve, the Āditya will make for us easy paths throughout  the days.
He will extend our lifetimes.
13. Wearing a golden mantle, Varuṇa dons his cloak.
His spies have seated themselves all around.
14. The god whom those inclined to deceit do not try to deceive, nor do the  deceitful ones among men,
nor do the hostile plotters,
15. And who has created glory here for himself—and not by halves!— among the sons of Manu,
right here within our bellies.
16. My insights go afar, like cows going after pasture-lands,
seeking him of broad gaze.
17. Let us two now again come to an agreement as soon as (your) honey  has been brought here to me,
(for me) to serve up my own dear (honey) like a Hotar.
18. Now I see him, lovely for all to see; I see his chariot upon the earth. He enjoys these songs of mine.124 I.26
19. Now hear my call, Varuṇa, and today have mercy.
It is you whom I desire, seeking help.
20. You, wise one, rule over all, both heaven and earth.
Listen in response to my entreaty.
21. Release above the uppermost fetter from us, unbind away the midmost, (loosen) below those lowest, in order for us to live.
## 26 Agni
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
10 verses: gāyatrī
On the surface this is a simple and straightforward Agni hymn, in part assem bled from pre-made phrases, but in its development it traces an argument below  the surface that leads to some surprising conclusions. The argument begins in  verse 3 by drawing attention to the mutuality of relationships (friend–friend,  comrade–comrade), even of those between hierarchically arranged pairs (father/ son). The poet then points out the comradeship between us and Agni (vs. 5),  which leads to the balanced construction of verse 7, again emphasizing the  mutual relationship between us and Agni: he is dear to us and we to him. That  this relationship is also hierarchical is gently implied by identifying him as our  clanlord. By picking up the final term in verse 7, the multivalent word svagní,  which can mean both “having good fires” and “having good Agni,” and deploy ing it, again in a balanced construction, in verse 8, the poet subtly shifts to  making the gods our partners, not merely Agni, who has become merely the  token of this relationship between us and the gods. The hierarchical distance  has been increased, but only step-by-step. The climax (however underplayed)  comes in verse 9, which calls for mutual encomia (práśasti) between mortals and  immortals—in other words, it demands that immortals produce praise for us,  as we do for them. The word práśasti is a charged one, referring to the formal  praise of kings as well as gods (see Jamison 2007: 146–48; see also I.21 above).  Though the conceptual development of the hymn is quite uninsistent, and the  simple rhythms of the gāyatrī meter can lull the audience into inattention, the  end result, when examined, is quite radical.
1. Put on your garments, you partaker of the sacrificial meal and lord of  nourishments,
and so perform this rite for us.
2. Take your seat as our Hotar, worthy to be chosen by our thoughts and heaven-bound speech, o youngest Agni.
3. For a father always sacrifices on behalf of his son, a friend on behalf of  his friend,
a comrade worth choosing on behalf of his comrade. 4. Let Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, who care for the stranger, take their seats here on our ritual grass, as if (on that) of Manu.
5. O ancient Hotar, rejoice in this (ritual grass) and in our comradeship; listen well to these songs here.
6. For even when we sacrifice to god after god in unbroken succession, it is just in you that the oblation is poured.
7. Let him be our dear clanlord—the delighting Hotar worthy to be  chosen;
let us be dear (to him) and (so) possess good fires.
8. Since the gods have good Agni (among them) and established him as a  choice thing for us,
we consider ourselves to possess good fires [/Agni].
9. So then, of us both, mortals (and immortals), o immortal one,
let there be encomia each for the other.
10. O Agni, along with all the fires, take delight in this sacrifice and in this  speech,
o young (son) of strength.
## 27 Agni (1–12), Gods (13)
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
13 verses: gāyatrī, except triṣṭubh 13
This second Agni hymn in the Śunaḥśepa collection is longer than the first (I.26),  and is therefore likely to be a composite. This conjecture is supported by the metri cal evidence, in that verses 1–6 and 10–12 are in trochaic gāyatrī, while the interven ing verses 7–9 have no trochaic pādas. These three verses (7–9) are also thematically  unified by a focus on a mortal, aided by Agni, who seeks a prize.
The rest of the hymn is more diffuse in content and surprisingly awkward in  phraseology. The final verse (13), in triṣṭubh, makes no mention of Agni and may  have been tacked onto this already loosely structured assemblage because its signa ture word námas “reverence” matches the last word of the first hemistich of verse 1,  námobhiḥ “with reverences.”
1. (This is) to extol you, Agni, with reverences—you bringing choice things  [/long-tailed] like a horse,
ruling over the rites completely.
2. Might the son (of strength) by his strength, very kindly, of broad advance, become our benefactor.
3. Both from afar and from nearby, from the mortal who wishes ill
protect us always, you who last a whole lifetime.
4. This, our winnings, our newer song,
you shall proclaim among the gods, o Agni.
126 I.28
5. Give us a share in the furthest prizes, in the midmost ones;
seek mastery over the closest good thing (for us).
6. You are the apportioner, o bright-beamed one. (As if) on the wave of a  river, in the nearness
and all at once you stream for the pious man.
7. The mortal whom you will help in battles, o Agni, whom you will spur  on to the prizes,
he will hold fast to unfailing refreshments.
8. No one will circumscribe anything of his, o overpowering one:
there is a prize worthy of fame (for him).
9. Let him, belonging to all domains, be the one who overtakes the prize  with his steeds.
Together with the inspired poets let him be the winner.
10. Awake and sing! Bring this about: for the one worthy of sacrifice for  every clan,
for Rudra [=Agni], a praise song that is beauty to be seen.
11. Let him who is great without measure, much glittering but possessing a  beacon of smoke,
urge us on to insight and to the prize.
12. Like a rich clanlord, let the divine beacon listen to us
along with our hymns—Agni of lofty radiance.
13. Reverence to the great ones and reverence to the small; reverence to the  young and reverence to those advanced (in years).
Let us offer sacrifice to the gods if we will be able. Let me not twist
away the laud for one more powerful in my direction, o gods.
## 28 Indra (1–4), the Mortar (5–6), the Mortar and Pestle (7–8),  Prajāpati Hariścandra or the Soma-Pressing Hide (9)
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
9 verses: triṣṭubh 1–6, gāyatrī 7–9
This brief and somewhat racy hymn has attracted a great deal of scholarly atten tion. Most scholarly treatments are more or less in agreement with Geldner’s  interpretation, signaled already in his title “Die vereinfachte Somapressung” (The  Simplified Soma-Pressing). In this interpretation the hymn depicts an abbreviated  soma-pressing done at home, on the spur of the moment and without formality, by  a sacrificer and his wife, using normal household implements, the mortar (ulū́khala)  and pestle, to pound the soma stalks. The participation of the wife occasioned  the slightly salacious comparisons between the pounding and sexual intercourse.  A woman, presumably the wife, is mentioned explicitly once, in a word play that  implicitly compares her regular movements in wielding the mortar with rhythmic  sexual movement (vs. 3). Despite the weight of scholarly opinion, we consider this literal interpretation  quite unlikely, because the precious and prized substance soma, the focus of the  most elaborate non-royal rites, can hardly have been used for a slapdash, playful  domestic entertainment. Instead, this hymn should be considered together with a  number of others in the late R̥gveda in which women figure in controversial or con
tested roles (e.g., I.179, X.10, X.102, X.109). In our view (see Jamison 2011, forth coming a, forthcoming b, in addition to background in 1996a), the late R̥gveda saw  the introduction of a new ritual model, in which the Wife of the Sacrificer partici pated in the ritual along with her husband and the other male functionaries. This  innovation was, we believe, being bitterly debated by theologians in this period, and  the debate can be discerned beneath the surface of such hymns.
This particular hymn alludes to the new ritual model incorporating the Sacrificer’s  Wife by presenting the solemn soma-pressing as if it were a domestic procedure, utiliz ing tools to be found in every kitchen, the proper domain of the Wife. An implicit iden tification between domestic paraphernalia and that of solemn ritual is found already  in the first verse, where the standard high-ritual word for the pressing stone (grā́van) is  juxtaposed with that for the domestic mortar (ulū́khala). (See also Atharvaveda IX.6.15  with the same identification: yā́ny ulūkhalamusalā́ni grā́vāṇa evá té “the mortar and  pestle—they are the pressing stones,” in a hymn that systematically presents a series of  such statements.) The final verse (9) returns to technical terms for soma equipment in  solemn ritual (camū “cup”; ́ pavítra “filter”; gór ádhi tvací “upon the hide of the cow”),  thus affirming that a real soma sacrifice has indeed been performed. Perhaps the most  important technical term in that verse is śiṣṭá (in the sandhi sequence úc chiṣṭám < úd +  śiṣṭám; cf. later úcchiṣṭa “leftover”): in later śrauta ritual the Wife is particularly active in  the Third Pressing and the soma offered there is “left-over” soma. We thus see the ritual  notion of the “leftover” already associated with the Wife here.
Since one of the aims of introducing the Sacrificer’s Wife into ritual was to  inject sexuality and fertility into the previously sterile realm of sacrifice, the  double-entendres throughout the hymn have a (semi-)serious purpose. As often with  sexual phraseology, the exact intent is sometimes difficult to figure out (e.g., vs. 6).
And what does our poet think about the new model? Although treating the  soma-pressing as if it were a cooking demonstration might seem to debase and  desolemnize it, the cheerful tone and the reassuring presence of Indra, the consum mate soma-drinker (who also seems to favor the introduction of the Wife in other  hymns), appears to indicate approval of the ritual innovation.
1. When the pressing stone with its broad bottom becomes erect in order  to press,
you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops). 2. When the pair of pressing boards are formed like two buttocks,
you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops). 3. When the woman puts her best into thrusting back and forth,
you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops).
128 I.29
4. When they bind the churning stick on both sides like reins to
control it,
you, Indra, will keep gulping down the mortar-pressed (soma drops). 5. For even though you are hitched up in house after house, little mortar, here speak most brilliantly, like the drum of victors.
6. And, o lord of the wood [=pestle?], the wind blows through your top. So then, press the soma for Indra to drink, o mortar.
7. These two [=mortar and pestle? / jaws of the soma press?] gain by  sacrifice and are the best prizewinners, since they keep pulling
apart above,
chewing the stalks like a pair of fallow bays.
8. Today, you two lords of the wood, towering, with the towering pressers press our honeyed (drink) for Indra.
9. Bring what is leftover up into the two wooden cups. Send the soma  surging into the filter.
Put it down upon the hide of the cow.
## 29 Indra
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
7 verses: paṅkti
The last three pādas of each five-pāda verse in this hymn constitute a refrain beg ging Indra to give us hope of acquiring abundant livestock. The refrain fits well  in the first two verses, but then the hymn takes an odd turn, expressing increasing  hostility toward a variety of unidentified or unidentifiable (see the near hapaxes in  vss. 6–7) beings, while continuing to hope blandly for cows and horses in the refrain.  The hymn is reminiscent of the “sleep charm” (VII.55), though the latter is more  benign in intent, and I.29 also has an Atharvan cast.
1. Even when we are devoid of hope, as it were, o you true drinker  of soma,
give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o
powerfully generous Indra.
2. O you of the (lovely) lips, you potent lord of prizes—with your
wondrous skill
give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o
powerfully generous Indra.
3. Put to sleep the two of opposite appearance [=birds of ill-omen?]; let  those two females sleep unawakening.
– Give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o
powerfully generous Indra. 4. Let them sleep who offer no gifts, but let your gifts be awake, o
champion.
– Give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o  powerfully generous Indra.
5. Pulverize the donkey braying in that evil way, o Indra.
– Give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o  powerfully generous Indra.
6. Along with the female kuṇḍr̥ṇācī [=bird of ill-omen?] the wind will fly far  away from the woods.
– Give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o  powerfully generous Indra.
7. Smash every howler; crush the female kr̥kadāśū [=another bird of ill-omen?]. – Give us hope for resplendent cows and horses in the thousands, o  powerfully generous Indra.
## 30 Indra (1–16), Aśvins (17–19), Dawn (20–22)
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
22 verses: gāyatrī, except triṣṭubh 16, arranged in tr̥cas
The first five tr̥cas (vss. 1–15) are dedicated to Indra, with the following verse (16),  in a different meter, serving as a summary verse for this, the major part of the hymn.  There follow one tr̥ca (vss. 17–19) dedicated to the Aśvins and one (vss. 20–22) to  Dawn. All of these gods are, of course, associated with the rituals of early morning.
Although the contents of the hymn are fairly standard—praise and invitation to  the gods and requests for their help and gifts—the syntax can be fussy and tricky.  See especially the final tr̥ca to Indra (vss. 13–15), whose structure and import are  not entirely clear. The portion of the hymn devoted to Indra focuses especially on  the mutuality of our relationship as his comrades (see esp. vss. 6–12), and the theme  of prizes and prize contests is prominent as well.
1. As (we) seek the victory prize for you, with (soma) drops I sprinkle Indra  like a blood-red (horse)—
most bounteous (Indra) of a hundred resolves.
2. The (soma), which is a hundred pure (draughts) or a thousand mixed  with milk,
flows here as if into the deep.
3. When they come together for the exhilaration of the tempestuous one,  just by that in his belly
he acquires an expanse like the sea.
4. This (soma) here is yours: you rush to it like a dove to its nest.
I shall also solemnly proclaim this speech of ours.
130 I.30
5. You whose praise song it is—o lord of bounties, o hero whose vehicle  is songs—
let your liberality be extensive.
6. Stand erect to help us at this prize-contest, o you of a hundred resolves. Let us make pledge to each other at the other (contests).
7. At every hitching up (for battle), at every prize-contest we call to the  more powerful one—
as his comrades (we call) to Indra for help.
8. Surely he will come—when he will hear it—with his thousandfold forms  of help,
with the victory prizes, to our call.
9. Following the (custom) of your ancient house, I call upon the excellent  man, powerful in opposition,
upon whom your father before called.
10. We hope for you, o much-called-upon granter of all requests, o good comrade for the singers—
11. O soma-drinker among us (well-)lipped soma-drinkers,
o mace-wielding comrade among (us, your) comrades.
12. Just so let it be, o soma-drinker; o mace-wielding comrade, make it just so as we wish for you to want it.
13. Let there be rich (refreshments?) bringing powerful prizes for us for our  joint exhilaration in company with Indra—
(refreshments) with which we, rich in livestock, might reach
exhilaration.
14. As one like you, o bold one, obtained in person for the praisers, being  implored (by them),
you fit out (the refreshments) (as you) fit an axle between two wheels, 15. When you fit out your friendship and fit out the desire of the singers, o  you of a hundred resolves,
with your abilities, (as you fit) the axle.
16. With his (horses) constantly snorting, bellowing, and panting, again  and again Indra has conquered the stakes.
He of wondrous skill (has given) us a golden chariot—he the winner for  us to win (it)—he has given it to us.
17. O Aśvins, drive here with your drink providing powerful refreshment  and accompanied by horses
(along your circuit) that brings cows and gold, o wondrous ones. 18. For your immortal chariot, (always) taking the same route,
speeds upon the sea, o wondrous Aśvins. 19. You two anchored (one) wheel of your chariot on the head of the  inviolable (bull);
the other speeds around heaven.
20. Which mortal is to enjoy you, o immortal Dawn, you fair-weather friend? To whom will you come near, far-radiant one?
21. For we have brought you to mind from both near and far,
o you, dappled bright and ruddy like a mare.
22. Come here with these prizes, o daughter of heaven.
Lay wealth as a foundation for us.
The next five hymns (31–35) are attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, and include  one of the most famous hymns in the R̥gveda, I.32, the great Indra-Vr̥tra hymn,  and several that deserve more fame than they have, especially I.33, a mirror-image  companion piece to I.32.
## 31 Agni
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
18 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8, 16, 18
A rigid verse-initial sequence provides an obvious skeletal structure for this  hymn: each of the first fifteen verses opens with tvám agne “you, o Agni” (or minor  variants thereupon). The remaining three verses (16–18) maintain the second-posi tion vocative agne, but place other items in first position—a typical loosening of  structure toward the end of a hymn.
Superimposed on this strict repetition is a less insistent structure of thematic  ring composition. The opening of the hymn (vss. 1–4) treats the primal installa tion of Agni in the sacrifice, a theme reinforced by the word prathamáḥ “first” sta tioned after the first two words in verses 1–3. Demigods and legendary ancestral  mortals are named in these verses, and some of them return in verse 17, the last  verse before the summary verse (18), in which Agni is explicitly urged to perform  the same actions for us as he did for them in earlier times. In between is the ritual  here-and-now. Verses 5–8 detail the aid that Agni gives to a devoted priest in the  ritual. In verses 9–11 Agni’s relationship to his worshiper is depicted more expan sively: he is a father to us with all of a father’s care, but, in a paradox much loved  by Vedic bards, Agni is also a son, both of the kindling sticks (vs. 9) and of the  priests who wield those sticks (vs. 11). Verse 11 connects the primal creation of Agni  treated at the beginning of the hymn with the current ritual, in which Agni is the son  of “a father as trifling as me.”
The remainder of the hymn (esp. vss. 12–15) begs for Agni’s protection for the  sacrificer and his group, and continues the themes both of Agni’s paternal care (vss.
132 I.31
14, 16) and the weakness and unworthiness of those he cares for (vss. 13–14). The  poet cleverly uses this acknowledged weakness to his advantage by asking Agni to  forgive and forget what we have done wrong in the ritual (vs. 16). There follows the  ring-compositional reminiscence of Agni’s primal installation (vs. 17). As often, the  final verse (18) is somewhat extra-hymnic, in that it sums up the hymn that precedes  with an introductory formula, eténa...bráhmaṇā “through this sacred formula
tion,” designed to simulate Agni’s favor.
1. You, Agni, the first Aṅgiras, the seer, the god, became a kindly comrade  of the gods.
Under your commandment were born the sage poets working with their  know-how—the Maruts with glinting spears.
2. You, Agni, first and best of the Aṅgirases, as sage poet you tend to the  commandment of the gods,
extending to all creation, wise, (and though) having (just) two mothers,  lying down in so many places for Āyu.
3. You, Agni—first become manifest to Mātariśvan; with a display of your  good resolve (become manifest) to Vivasvant.
The two world-halves trembled at the choice of (you as) Hotar. You  tolerated the burden; you sacrificed to the great ones, o good one.
4. You, Agni, made heaven bellow for Manu, for Purūravas; for him of  good action [=sacrificer? priest?] you act (even) better,
when through your swelling in your two parents [=the kindling sticks]  you are set free. They [=priests] have led you here to the east, then
again to the west.
5. You, Agni, a bull increasing prosperity, should be celebrated by the  (priest) who holds up the offering spoon,
who knows his way around the poured offering and the vaṣaṭ-cry—you  who, throughout your single lifetime, seek to attract the (divine) clans  at the beginning (of the sacrifice).
6. You, Agni, in fellowship at the ceremony safely bring the man
on the twisting turns (of the ritual “racecourse”) to the end, o
unbounded one,
you who—at the contest of champions, at the crucial turn, when the  stake (is set)—even with just a few you smash the greater in the clash. 7. You, Agni, establish that mortal in highest immortality for fame day  after day,
you who, yourself thirsting, create refreshment for both breeds [=men  and gods] and a pleasurable meal here for the patron.
8. You, Agni—for us to win the stakes, make our bard glorious while you  are being praised.
Might we bring to fulfillment the (ritual) act through a new (poetic)  worker. O Heaven and Earth, along with the gods—help us. 9. You, Agni, in the lap of your two parents, the god wakeful among the  gods, o faultless one—
become body-creator [=father] and (fatherly) solicitude for our bard.  You, lovely one, have strewn every good thing here.
10. You, Agni, are (fatherly) solicitude, you a father to us. You are creator  of vitality; we are your kin.
Riches in hundreds, in thousands converge on you, the well-heroed
protector of the commandment, o undeceivable one.
11. You, Agni, did the gods create as the first Āyu for Āyu, as the clanlord  of Nahuṣa.
Iḍā they created as instructress of mankind: that the son [=Agni] is
born of a father as trifling as me [=sacrificer].
12. You, god Agni—along with your protectors, watch over our benefactors  and ourselves, o you to be extolled.
You are the guardian over the lineage of offspring and cattle,
unblinkingly watchful in accord with your commandment.
13. You, Agni, are kindled as intimate protector, four-eyed, for the
worshipful one who lacks even a quiver,
you who, with the bestowed oblation, for nourishment safe from wolves  even for the weak, win this mental spell (for him) with your mind.
14. You, Agni, (are kindled as protector) for the cantor chanting far  and wide. What is the highest legacy worth seeking—that you win
(for him).
Even of the feeble you are called (fatherly) solicitude and father. You
instruct the simple, (instruct) the quarters, as the one who knows better. 15. You, Agni, like (well-)stitched armor, protect all around the man whose  priestly gift has been proffered.
Whoever (as host), serving sweet food, providing a comfortable place  in his dwelling, performs the sacrifice of a living thing, he is the very  measure of heaven.
16. This (ritual) breach of ours, Agni—make it forgotten; make us forget  this way which we have come on from afar.
You are friend, father, solicitude for those offering soma, a whirling  creator of seers for mortals.
17. As (you did) for Manu, o Agni, as for Aṅgiras, o Aṅgiras, as for Yayāti,  as (you did) earlier, o flame,
drive here to your seat; convey hither the heavenly folk; make them sit  on the ritual grass and, you, perform sacrifice to the beloved.
18. Through this sacred formulation, o Agni, keep growing strong—the one  that we have made for you by skill or by knowledge.
And lead us forth toward a better state; join us with your benevolence  conferring prizes.134 I.32
## 32 Indra
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This justly famous hymn tells of Indra’s most significant victory, his triumph over  Vr̥tra and the release of the waters, in perhaps the clearest treatment of this primal  myth in the R̥gveda. Vr̥tra was a gigantic cobra who lay coiled around a mountain  within which all the waters were entrapped. In his battle with Indra, Vr̥tra spread  his “shoulders,” his cobra’s hood, and struck at Indra with his fangs, but Indra  finally killed Vr̥tra with his mace, broke open the mountain, and let the waters  pour out. They then flowed to Manu (vs. 8), who was the first sacrificer, and by  implication to his descendants. Vr̥tra’s name means “obstacle,” and this victory over  “Obstacle” is therefore paradigmatic for Indra’s victory over all obstacles.
Despite the relative clarity of the treatment of the Vr̥tra battle, the hymn has  a curious structure, obsessively circling around and alternately focusing in on and  drawing back from the moment of dramatic confrontation between the adversar ies. After the initial verses of summary and the preliminaries to the battle (vss.  1–4), the next three verses (5–7) depict the battle, and it is portrayed as extremely  one-sided, with the overconfident Vr̥tra overmatched from the beginning and deci sively smashed by Indra. (The signature verb of the first section of the hymn is  √han “smash, smite.”) Defeated and dismembered, Vr̥tra lies there (the signature  verb of this section is √śī “lie”) with his mother, and the released waters flow over  them (8–11). After this interlude the hymn returns to a new description of the  battle (12–13), which in this reprise is depicted as far more of an even match. Vr̥tra  strikes at Indra with his fangs and deploys various natural forces against his adver sary. This more equal battle is encapsulated in the perfectly balanced construction  índraś ca yád yuyudhā́te áhiś ca “when Indra and the serpent fought each other... ”  (13c). It is unclear why the first triumphalist account has been revised to the more  ambiguous, less glorious version—though both, of course, end with Vr̥tra’s defeat.
The most mysterious part of this hymn is the conclusion. Vr̥tra is dead, and  even his mother Dānu has been killed, so there is no possibility of a new Vr̥tra. And  yet Indra apparently becomes terrified and flies across the rivers “like a frightened  falcon.” Perhaps this puzzling ending is related to the second version of the battle,  in which Indra does not have quite the unchallenged heroic role that he plays in  the first version. The poet does not explain but in the last verse simply returns to a  praise of Indra as victor and king.
1. Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra, those foremost deeds  that the mace-wielder performed:
He smashed the serpent. He bored out the waters. He split the bellies of  the mountains.
2. He smashed the serpent resting on the mountain—for him Tvaṣṭar had  fashioned the resounding [/sunlike] mace. Like bellowing milk-cows, streaming out, the waters went straight down  to the sea.
3. Acting the bull, he chose for his own the soma. He drank of the pressed  soma among the Trikadrukas [=the Maruts?].
The generous one took up his missile, the mace. He smashed him, the  first-born of serpents.
4. When you, Indra, smashed the first-born of serpents and then beguiled  the wiles of the wily ones,
then, giving birth to the sun, the heaven, and the dawn, since that time  you have surely never found a rival.
5. Indra smashed Vr̥tra [/Obstacle] the very great obstacle, whose
shoulders were spread apart, with his mace, his great weapon.
Like logs hewn apart by an axe, the serpent would lie, embracing the  earth [/soaking the earth (with his blood)].
6. For, like a drunken non-warrior, he challenged the hard-pressing great  hero whose is the silvery drink [=soma].
(Vr̥tra) did not withstand the attack of his weapons. His mouth
destroyed by the shattering blow, he whose rival was Indra was
completely crushed.
7. Handless and footless, he gave battle to Indra. (Indra) smashed his  mace upon his back.
A steer who tried to be the measure of a bull, Vr̥tra lay there, flung
apart in many places.
8. *Delivering themselves to Manu, the waters go over him like a split  reed—lying in that way.
Those very ones whom Vr̥tra in his greatness once surrounded—at their feet lay the serpent.
9. The strength of Vr̥tra’s mother ebbed; Indra bore his weapon down  upon her.
The mother was above; the son below: Dānu lies like a milk-cow with  her calf.
10. In the middle of the turning posts of the never-standing, never-resting  (waters), his body sank down.
The waters move widely over the private parts of Vr̥tra. He whose rival  was Indra lay there in the long darkness (of death).
11. The waters stood still—their husband was the Dāsa; their herdsman,  the serpent—hemmed in like the cows by the Paṇi.
What was the hidden opening for the waters—that Indra uncovered  after he smashed Vr̥tra.
12. You, Indra, then became the tail of a horse when he struck his fangs at  you—you, the god alone.
You conquered the cows, and, o champion, you conquered the soma.  You set loose the seven rivers to flow.
136 I.33
13. Neither the lightning nor the thunder, neither the mist nor the hail that  he scattered repelled (Indra) for him.
When Indra and the serpent fought each other, the generous one
achieved victory also for (all) later times.
14. Whom did you see, Indra, as the avenger of the serpent when fear came  into your heart after you smashed him,
and when you crossed over the ninety-nine flowing rivers, like a
frightened falcon through the airy realms?
15. Bearing the mace in his arms, Indra is the king of him who travels and  of him who is settled, of the horned and the hornless.
And just he alone as king rules over the different peoples: like a rim the  spokes of a wheel, he encompasses those.
## 33 Indra
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn to Indra follows directly upon what is probably the most famous R̥gvedic  hymn to Indra, I.32, which is entirely focused on the Vr̥tra battle, and it is attributed  to the same poet. The second of the pair, I.33, has attracted far less attention than  its famous sibling, which is a pity, for its poetry is often stirring, and it also provides  a complementary companion piece to I.32. While I.32 pits Indra against a demonic  adversary in single combat, in a world in which humans and their concerns are  entirely absent (save for the poet’s introduction “I proclaim” in vs. 1 and the celebra
tion of Indra’s kingship in the final vs. 15), the human world and human strife are  the core of I.33. This focus on the human is clear from the beginning of the hymn.  The poet exhorts himself and his fellows to go right up to Indra and demand goods  from him (vss. 1–3). The interaction between god and mortals lacking in I.32 is thus  immediately established in I.33.
The center of the hymn (vss. 4–10ab, in our view) describes a pitched and desperate  conflict between human moieties, in which Indra intervenes on the side of the good.  Thus, unlike the battle in I.32, where the contestants are unequally matched from the  start (though a more equal match-up is depicted in the second version of the conflict),  in I.33 the clashing sides begin in balance, having separated from each other (vs. 4cd)  in order to fight each other. At issue is fundamental social organization: sacrificers  versus non-sacrificers (4d, 5b), who lack the vratás (“commandments,” 5d) that bind  the sacrificers. The non-sacrificers are several times identified as dásyu (4a, 7c, 9d, curi ously always in the singular), and so this hymn may depict the conflict between indig
enous peoples and the infiltrating Ārya. However, the non-sacrificers may instead be  Ārya following different customs, with Dasyu simply a nasty insult hurled at a larger  kin-group that deviates from the social behavior of the R̥gvedins. Their mutual depar ture in opposite directions from a single place (4c) may argue for the latter view: these are not foes who encountered each other as one group expanded into the territory  of the other, but apparently a once unified group that split. (Verse 18 of the difficult  hymn X.27 is phraseologically close to this verse, and suggests even more strongly that  the groups have split over doctrinal matters.) Also in favor of this view is the fact that  the poet tends to treat the hostile sides in balanced constructions, sometimes allotting  alternating pādas to each (e.g., vs. 6, where in our view 6a describes the enemies, 6b the  Navagvas who are ordinarily clients of Indra, with 6cd returning to the enemies) or  in bipartite phrases (e.g., 7a “those wailing and those laughing”). Indra quickly takes  the side of the sacrificers, “the presser and the praiser” (7d), and his aid proves deci sive—though not before the poet produces some striking images, for instance, of the  enemies girdling themselves in earth, perhaps a reference to their wounding or death,  while Indra’s own side is clothed with the sun (vs. 9).
After this substantial and sustained treatment of this dramatic human conflict and  Indra’s part in it, the rest of the hymn turns into a sort of catalogue of allusions to  other triumphs of Indra, not all of which are clear. Verse 10d must surely depict the  Vala myth, but the vájra (“mace”) of 10c does not fit that myth well and may be a  glancing reference to the Vr̥tra battle, which seems to be treated, though without nam
ing Vr̥tra, in verse 11, and by name in verse 13. Other enemies are defeated in verse 12,  including one, with the curious name Ilībiśa, known only from here, and other clients  are aided in verses 14–15. The final half-verse of 15 may return to the massed enemies  of the central part of the hymn, though that view cannot be strongly supported.
1. Come on! Let us go up close to Indra, seeking cattle. Will he increase his  solicitude for us?
With no one to hinder him, will he perhaps then turn his distant
intention toward us for this wealth, for cattle?
2. I fly close to the unopposable giver of wealth, like a falcon to its  delightful dwelling,
doing homage to Indra with my best chants, the one who is to be
invoked by praisers on his journey.
3. Fully armed, he has laden himself down with quivers; he herds together  the cows of the stranger, of whomever he wishes to.
Keep poking out valuable things in abundance, Indra—don’t be a
niggard, (at a distance) from us, you strengthened one.
4. For you smashed the wealthy Dasyu with your deadly weapon, going it  alone, (though accompanied) by your assistants [=Maruts?], Indra.
From the high plain they went apart in opposite directions; the
non-sacrificing old codgers made their departure.
5. They just twisted their heads off, Indra—the non-sacrificers contending  with the sacrificers.
O strong horse-possessing (chariot-)mounter, when (you came) forth  from heaven, you blasted those who follow no commandment in the  two world-halves.
138 I.33
6. They wished to battle the army of the faultless one; the Navagva  peoples marshaled themselves.
Like castrated bullocks battling with a bull, they seemed to go away  from Indra along slippery slopes.
7. You set them to fighting, those wailing and those laughing, on the far  edge of the dusky realm, Indra.
From heaven on high you sent fire burning down on the Dasyu; you  favored the recitation of the presser and the praiser.
8. Having made for themselves a girdle from the earth, adorning  themselves with a golden amulet,
(though) urging themselves on, they did not overtake Indra. He clothed  his spies with the sun.
9. When, Indra, you coiled around both worlds on all sides with your  greatness,
(you blasted) at the heedless ones with (the aid of) those who pay heed;  you blasted forth the Dasyu with (the aid of) those who create sacred  formulations, o Indra—
10. (The Dasyu) who did not reach the end of heaven, of earth, who did  not hem in the wealth-giving (Indra) with their magical wiles.
The bull Indra made his mace his yokemate. He milked the cows out of  the darkness with light.
11. In accord with his autonomous power the waters flowed; he grew strong  in the middle of the navigable ones.
With a single-minded thought, with a most powerful blow Indra  smashed him [=Vr̥tra?] to high heavens.
12. He pierced down through the fastnesses of Ilībiśa; he split apart horned  Śuṣṇa—Indra.
As much endurance, as much strength (as remained to you), bounteous  one, (using that,) with your mace you smashed the rival who sought  battle.
13. Goal-directed, he set out against his rivals; with the sharp bull he split  apart the strongholds.
He made Vr̥tra collide with his mace—Indra. He advanced his own  thinking, exulting all the while.
14. You aided Kutsa, Indra, in whom you took pleasure; you furthered the  bull Daśadyu as he did battle.
Stirred up by hooves, the dust reached heaven. Śvaitreya stood up to  conquer the superior men.
15. You aided the hornless bull in the Tugriyan (battles), the Śvitriyan cow  at the conquering of dwelling places, bounteous one.
They have made a long delay, just staying here. You have laid low the  possessions of those who behave as rivals.
## 34 Aśvins
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9, 12
This hymn has a simple and very insistent organizing principle: the number three.  The Aśvins, of whom there are, of course, two, are urged to perform various actions  three times a day, using equipment, especially their chariot, that has numerous tri ple features. The particular ritual reason for the glorification of three must be the  three soma-pressings, but this ritual application is not made clear until verse 8. If,  as we have argued, the Third Pressing is a ritual innovation in the R̥gveda, a hymn  devoted to extolling it is not surprising.
The hymn falls into two unequal parts, each ending with a triṣṭubh verse (vss.  1–9, 10–12). In the first part the number three is especially celebrated, though the  number is not absent in the second part (see vss. 11 and 12). The last three verses  invite the Aśvins to drink the soma and to offer us rewards in return. Despite the  metrical punctuation and the change in emphasis in the brief second part, there is  no reason not to consider this hymn a unity.
From the grammatical point of view, the hymn contains what many scholars  (including us) take as a precious archaism, the single occurrence of the phrase sū́re  duhitā́ “daughter of the Sun” (vs. 5d), preserving in sū́re the sandhi of final -as of  the genitive *sū́ras as -e before a dental in close phrasal sandhi. (For general discus
sion of this phenomenon, see Jamison 2010.) It perhaps escaped modernization  because the focus of the hymn was not on the mythological marriage of Sūryā,  daughter of the Sun, and she is only mentioned because of the incidental fact that  the chariot she mounted had three standing places.
1. Three times today take cognizance of us. Extensive is your journey and  your giving, o Aśvins.
Because clasping you is like clasping on a garment in winter, become  ones who can be clasped by men of inspired thought.
2. Three wheel-rims are on your honey-bringing chariot; all know the spoor  of the soma through and through.
Three props have been propped up to take hold of; three times by night  you drive, Aśvins, and three times by day.
3. Three times on the same day, you concealers of fault, three times today  equip the sacrifice with honey.
Three times, Aśvins, make prize-giving refreshments swell for us, through  the evenings and the dawns.
4. Three times drive your circuit, three times to the folk who follow your  commandment; three times do your best as if threefold for the one
who pursues (his ritual duties) well.
Three times bring delight, Aśvins; three times make nourishment swell  for us, like (a cow) that never runs dry.
140 I.35
5. Three times bring wealth to us, Aśvins, three times to the divine  conclave; and three times aid our insights.
Three times (bring) good fortune and three times acclamations for
us. The daughter of the Sun mounted your chariot with its three
standing places.
6. Three times, Aśvins, give us heavenly remedies, three times earthly ones,  and three times those from the waters.
Succor and luck and lifetime bring to my little son, and threefold
shelter, you lords of beauty.
7. Three times, day after day, Aśvins, deserving the sacrifice, reach around  the earth in its three parts.
You Nāsatyas as charioteers travel over the three distant realms, like  breath blowing over the pastures.
8. Three times, Aśvins, along with the rivers with their seven mothers  the three (soma) troughs are prepared and the oblation is made
threefold.
Floating above the three earths, you guard the fixed vault of heaven,  through the days, through the nights.
9. Where are the three wheels of your triply turning chariot, where the  three seats which are in the same nest [=chariot box]?
When is the yoking of the prizewinning donkey, with which, Nāsatyas,  you drive up to the sacrifice.
10. Come here, Nāsatyas: the oblation is being poured. Drink of the honey  with your honey-drinking mouths.
For Savitar impels your chariot, earlier than dawn, glittering, full of  ghee, for truth.
11. Drive hither, Nāsatyas, with the three times eleven gods, here to honey  drinking, Aśvins.
Extend our lifetime; sweep away our maladies; repel hatred; come into  partnership (with us).
12. Aśvins, with your triply turning chariot, bring wealth in good heroes  our way.
You two who listen I keep calling to for help. Be there to strengthen us  at the winning of prizes.
## 35 Savitar (except Agni, Mitra and Varuṇa, Rātrī, and Savitar 1)
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1, 9
After an initial verse invoking several gods, Savitar becomes the sole focus of the  hymn—Savitar primarily in his role as god of the evening, as was already suggested by the invocation of Night in verse 1c. The first part of the Savitar portion (vss.  2–5) describes the beauty of Savitar’s chariot and his journey through the night sky.  During this journey he (and his horses, vss. 2 and 5; see also 7–8) survey the crea tures and the larger cosmos in which they live, and in the second part of the hymn  (vss. 6–9) we learn what was seen. These verses enumerate the parts of the cosmos  and sketch its dimensions. This section is presented as mystical instruction (see esp.  vs. 6d), which raises cosmic questions (vs. 7cd), especially about what happens to  the sun during the night that Savitar is presiding over. The anxieties raised by the  absence of the sun are put to rest by Savitar’s ability to pervade the whole realm (vs.  9), and the hymn ends with an invitation to the god to come to us along his well
maintained route through the midspace (vss. 10–11).
1. I invoke Agni first, for well-being; I invoke Mitra and Varuṇa here, for help. I invoke Night, who brings to rest the moving; I invoke god Savitar,  for aid.
2. Turning hither through the black realm, bringing to rest the immortal  and the mortal,
with his golden chariot Savitar the god drives here, gazing upon the  creatures.
3. The god drives on a downward slope; he drives on an upward one; he  drives with two resplendent fallow bays, he who is worthy of the
sacrifice.
God Savitar drives hither from afar, thrusting away all obstacles.
4. (It is) covered over with pearls, having every beauty, with golden  yoke-pins, lofty—
his chariot has bright-beamed Savitar mounted, (he) worthy of the  sacrifice, having assumed his own power throughout the black
realms.
5. The dusky (horses) with white feet have looked out across the peoples,  while drawing his chariot with its golden forepole.
The clans, all the creatures ever abide in the lap of divine Savitar.
6. There are three heavens: two are the laps of Savitar, one is the
hero-vanquishing one in the world of Yama.
Like a chariot (wheel) on the axle-pin, the (creatures) have taken their  place on his immortal (foundations?).—Whoever will perceive this, let  him declare it here.
7. The eagle has surveyed the midspaces—the lord possessing profound  inspiration, who gives good guidance.
Where now is the sun? Who perceives it? To which one of the heavens  does his rein extend?
8. The eight humps of the earth he has surveyed, the three wastelands three  wagon-treks (wide), the seven rivers.
Golden-eyed god Savitar has come hither, establishing desirable treasures  for the pious man.
142 I.36
9. Golden-palmed Savitar, whose boundaries are distant, shuttles between  both, both heaven and earth.
He thrusts away affliction; he pursues the sun; he reaches to heaven
through the black realm.
10. The golden-handed lord of good guidance, of good grace, of good  help—let him drive in our direction.
Repelling demons and sorcerers, the god has taken his place facing
evening, while being hymned.
11. Your age-old paths, Savitar, dustless, well-made in the midspace, along these easily passable paths (come) to us today. Both guard us and  speak on our behalf, o god.
The next eight hymns (I.36–43) are attributed to Kaṇva Ghaura, and the Kaṇva  family is named a number of times in this sequence. It is noteworthy that this collec tion does not contain a hymn to Indra. However, there are three hymns (I.37–39) to  the Maruts, Indra’s regular companions, and the following hymn, I.40, is dedicated  to Brahmaṇaspati. Indra figures prominently in that hymn and is in fact identified  with Brahmaṇaspati in it.
For the most part the style of these hymns is uncomplex but nicely balanced.
## 36 Agni
Kaṇva Ghaura
20 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Long but relatively straightforward, this hymn first celebrates the communal fire  belonging to a number of clans, as Proferes argues (2007: 31), uniting them in com mon action (vss. 1–3). The poet then cites a divine precedent for joint kindling of  the fire (vs. 4) and assigns Agni various social roles: priest, householder, and mes senger (vs. 5), an almost trifunctional structure. Verses 7–8 conflate mortals and  gods in their expansion of territory and defeat of opposing forces, and the next  series of verses also mingle legendary and current mortals in their relation to Agni.
The mood of the hymn changes with verse 13. There follow a number of peremp tory commands to Agni, for help and, especially, protection from and destruction  of enemies, interspersed with mentions of help that Agni offered to previous mor tal clients. The more militant verses are reminiscent of X.87, dedicated to Agni  Rakṣohan (“Demon-Smiter”), although the latter hymn is more inventive than  this one.
1. We appeal for you with well-spoken speeches to the youthfully exuberant  (fire) of the many (peoples), of the clans that serve the gods,
to Agni—just the one whom the others (also) reverently invoke. 2. The peoples have installed Agni, the increaser of might. Bringing  oblations, we would do honor to you.
Become today our benevolent helper here when prizes (are at stake), o  comrade.
3. We choose you as messenger, as the Hotar who affords all possessions. Since you are great, your flames range widely; your radiant beams
touch heaven.
4. The gods Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman kindle you, their primordial  messenger.
With you, o Agni, that one wins every stake—the mortal who ritually  serves you.
5. You are the delighting Hotar, the lord of the household, and the  messenger of the clans.
In you are gathered together all the enduring commandments that the  gods made.
6. Just in you who bring good fortune is every oblation poured, o
youngest Agni.
Benevolent toward us today and in the future, sacrifice to the gods for  masses of good heroes.
7. Bringing homage, they reverently approach him, their sovereign king,  just so.
With their oblations the sons of Manu kindle Agni, after they have
crossed beyond failures.
8. Smashing their Vr̥tra [/obstacle], they crossed over the two world-halves and  the waters and made for themselves a wide place for peaceful dwelling.
The bull [=Agni], brilliant when bepoured, came to be at Kaṇva’s side;  the horse [=Agni] whinnied at the cattle-raids.
9. Sit together (with us): you are great. Blaze as the best at pursuing the gods. Let loose your beautiful red smoke in every direction, o lauded Agni,  partaker of the ritual meal—
10. Whom the gods installed here for Manu as the best sacrificer, o  conveyor of the oblation,
whom Kaṇva (and?) Medhyātithi (installed) as the winner of stakes,  whom Vr̥ṣan [/the bull], whom Upastuta [/the praised] (installed).
11. Agni whom Medhyātithi (and?) Kaṇva kindled from truth,
his are the refreshments that shine forth; him do these verses (make  strong) and him, Agni, do we make strong.
12. Give fullness of wealth, o autonomous one, for you have friendship  among the gods, o Agni.
You rule over a prize worthy of fame. Have mercy on us: you are great.144 I.37
13. Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar,
upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with  their ornaments in invoking (you).
14. Upright, protect us from narrow straits with your beacon. Burn up  every devourer.
Make us upright to move and to live. Find favor for us among the gods.
15. Protect us from the demon, o Agni. Protect us from the malice of  the enemy.
Protect from the man who does harm or who seeks to smash us, o
youngest one with lofty beams.
16. As if with a deadly weapon, smash asunder our enemies and whoever  deceives us, o you of scorching fangs.
The mortal who sharpens himself throughout the nights, let that cheat  not be master of us.
17. Agni gained good heroes en masse, and Agni good fortune for Kaṇva. Agni helped Medhyātithi—as did Mitra (and Varuṇa) [/the two allies]— and Agni (helped) Upastuta in winning.
18. With Agni we call Turvaśa and Yadu from afar, also Ugrādeva.
Agni, our force against the Dasyu, led Navavāstva of the lofty chariots  and Turvīti.
19. Manu installed you, Agni, to be a light for the people, each and  every one.
Born of truth, you shine when grown strong [/sprinkled] in the company  of Kaṇva—(you) to whom the communities bring reverence.
20. The dazzling, hard-charging flames of Agni, terrifying like (wild  beasts), are not to be confronted.
(Burn) the demonic forces, the sorcerers forever—burn up every
devourer.
## 37 Maruts
Kaṇva Ghaura
15 verses: gāyatrī, probably organized in tr̥cas
Typical Marut themes fill this hymn: their glittering beauty (lightning), their noise  (thunder), and their boisterous character, which strikes fear in both animate and  inanimate nature. The mystery of their birth, also a common feature of Marut  hymns, is mentioned glancingly in verse 9. The language is uncomplex, but as in  many Marut hymns it is energetic and visual, and it often has a conversational tone,  as in the depiction of thunder in verse 13 as the Maruts talking among themselves  as they travel. 1. To the playful Marut troop, unassailable beauty on a chariot,
sing forth, o Kaṇvas—
2. Who, together with their dappled (mares) and their spears, their axes  and unguents,
were born having a radiance of their own.
3. As if (it were) right here, the whip in their hands is heard, when they  wish to speak.
On their journey they direct the glittering (lightning) downward.
4. To the spirited tempestuous troop of flaring brilliance
sing your sacred formulation given by the gods.
5. Proclaim the prized bull among the cattle—the playful Marut troop. It has grown strong on the juice in the jaw (of the soma press).
6. Which of you is the highest, o superior men—you shakers of heaven  and earth,
since you shake them like the end (of a garment)?
7. The tribe of Manu crouches down before your journey, your formidable  battle fury;
the mountain, the peak bends down—
8. At whose drives, at whose journeys the earth, like a clanlord
grown old,
trembles in fear.
9. Because their birth was secure, (they had) the energy to come out from  their mother,
the power that now as before follows them.
10. And these sons (of Rudra) have erected their songs (like) race-course  posts on their drives,
bellowing and bending their knees for their journey.
11. Also this child of mist [=cloud]—long, wide, not negligible (in size)— do they stir forth with their journeys.
12. O Maruts, since you have the strength, you have stirred up the peoples and stirred up the mountain-peaks.
13. When the Maruts go driving, they keep talking with each other on  the road:
anyone can hear them.
14. Drive forth quickly with your swift ones: there are friendships for you  among the Kaṇvas.
There you will bring yourselves to exhilaration.
15. For (our friendship) is always there for your exhilaration; we are always  there for them [=Maruts],
in order (for us) to live a full lifetime.
146 I.38
## 38 Maruts
Kaṇva Ghaura
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
The conversational tone that was occasionally discernible in the previous hymn  (I.37) is fully in evidence here, especially in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), in which the  poet peppers the Maruts with castigating questions about their whereabouts: the  gods are clearly absent from his sacrifice and presumed to be enjoying the sacrificial  offerings of rivals. The poet continues in this intimate tone in the next tr̥ca—first  (vs. 4) slyly suggesting that if their positions were reversed, the Maruts, as poets,  would praise him, the current poet, like a god, and then begging them to keep him  safe (vss. 5–6) and to end the current dry spell (vs. 6c). The compressed and abrupt  quality of gāyatrī meter is ideally suited for this conversational style.
The next six verses (7–12) present a more conventional description of the Maruts  as the thunderstorm, with familiar images. In the last three verses (13–15), the poet  exhorts himself to sing not only to the Maruts but like the Maruts, especially in  verse 14. The first verse of this tr̥ca (13) introduces two other divinities, the Lord  of the Sacred Formulation (to whom the same poet will dedicate nearby I.40) and  Agni; it is not clear why they share this last tr̥ca with the Maruts.
1. What is this now, you fair-weather friends?! What have you taken in  your hands,
as a father does his son, o you for whom the ritual grass has been twisted? 2. Where now—what your goal?—have you gone on earth, as if in heaven? Where are they taking pleasure in you, like cows (in a pasture)?
3. Where are your newer favors, Maruts, where the easy passages?
Where all the good portions?
4. O you whose mother is Pr̥śni, if you were mortals,
your praiser would be immortal.
5. Let your singer not be displeasing to you, like a wild animal in a pasture, and let him not go along the path of Yama.
6. And let not dissolution, evil rage—(going) ever further away—smite us. It should collapse, along with thirst.
7. This is real: the dazzling, hard-charging sons of Rudra even in the desert create unquenchable mist.
8. Like a bawling (cow) the lightning bellows. Like a mother her calf, it  accompanies (the rain),
when their rain has been sent gushing.
9. Even by day they create darkness, together with Parjanya the
water-carrier,
when they inundate the earth. 10. Then because of the roar of the Maruts throughout the whole earthly seat the sons of Manu trembled.
11. O Maruts, along the shimmering (waters) with their riverbanks, drive  with your hard-hooved (horses)
whose journey is never broken.
12. Let your wheel-rims be steady, and your chariots and horses,
and your reins be well fashioned.
13. Speak here with a song at length to the Lord of the Sacred
Formulation, to awaken him,
and to Agni, lovely to see like an ally.
14. Bellow [/measure] the call that is in your mouth. Like Parjanya, you will  thunder [/stretch it out].
Sing the song-verse belonging to the hymn.
15. Extol the Marut throng—glittering, inviting admiration, receiving  the chant—
(so that) they will be grown fully strong here with us.
## 39 Maruts
Kaṇva Ghaura
10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
The weighty register and solemn syntax of this hymn contrast with the light texture  and somewhat colloquial register of the last two hymns (I.37–38), also dedicated to  the Maruts but in a different meter, even though the rapid-fire questions of verse  1cd remind us of the abrupt questions of I.38.1–3.
Here the poet hopes to harness the overwhelming power of the Maruts in order  to protect himself and his people from some looming, but not entirely defined,  threat. This hope is expressed especially nakedly in the last part of the hymn, verses  7–10. In the earlier parts of the hymn the poet praises the power of the Maruts in  a formal style, but by stating that this might cannot be challenged (vss. 2cd, 4), he  hints that it could in fact encounter a challenge.
The usual buoyant descriptions of the Maruts’ appearance and behavior as the  thunderstorm are muted in this hymn. They serve only to illustrate what power  might be available to the poet and his people (vss. 3, 5–6).
1. When from the far distance you cast your measure [/your bellowing], like  a flame, just so,
by whose will, o Maruts, in whose form, and to whom do you drive? To  whom, o you shakers?
2. Let your weapons be steadfast for thrusting far away, and let them be  staunch for blocking.
Yours be the might more to be admired, not that of the tricky mortal.
148 I.40
3. As you smite the steadfast to the far distance and you set the heavy to  rolling, o men,
you drive across the forests of the earth and across the regions of the  mountains.
4. For a rival to you has not been found in heaven nor on earth, o you who  care for the stranger.
Yours be the might, with your full lineage as yokemate; o Rudras, let it  never be open to challenge.
5. They make the mountains tremble; they shake the trees asunder. O Maruts, you gods, you have set out, like those badly drunk (on battle  frenzy), o gods, with your whole clan.
6. You have harnessed the dappled mares to your chariots; the
chestnut-red pulls as your side horse.
Even the earth has listened for your journey and the sons of Manu have  become afraid.
7. We wish (to bring) your help quickly here for our lineage, o Rudras. Come now to us with help in just the same way as (you went) before to  fearful Kaṇva.
8. Whether sent by you, Maruts, or sent by a mortal, the formless being  that sets upon us—
keep him away by your strength, by your power, away by the help that  stems from you.
9. O you who receive the first of the sacrifice, you discerning ones, because  you gave (to us?) Kaṇva—not a half gift!—
with unhalved help come to us, like lightning bolts to the rain, o
Maruts.
10. You bring unhalved power, unhalved strength, you of good gifts, you  shakers.
O Maruts, launch your enmity like an arrow at him who is inimical to  seers, who is enveloped in fury.
## 40 Brahmaṇaspati
Kaṇva Ghaura
8 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Brahmaṇaspati, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” is addressed in this hymn, but  this divine figure with his transparent name is only a means to accomplish other  ends. As the patron deity of ritual speech, Brahmaṇaspati will make the poet’s  speech effective enough to bring the other gods, especially Indra, to our sacrifice  (vss. 1–2). In the second pragātha (vss. 3–4) the poet seeks Brahmaṇaspati’s indirect help. If the poet’s efforts on behalf of the sacrifice are successful, his patron stands  to gain (see esp. vs. 4cd), and the patron then should give liberal rewards to the  singer (vs. 4a). It is striking that the patron is here called a “hero” and promised,  in the famous inherited phrase, “imperishable fame”—not for his exploits on the  battlefield, but for his generosity to his poet.
The test comes in the following pragātha (vss. 5–6):  the new mantra under  the patronage of Brahmaṇaspati is pronounced both by Brahmaṇaspati and by  the human actors at the ritual. If it is a properly formulated mantra, it will bring  the desired success. Judging from the final pragātha (vss. 7–8), ritual success was  achieved, and this success is expressed in strikingly sexual terms: both the patron’s  dwelling place and his power to rule are infused with productive sexuality (vss. 7d,  8a). He also gains the gods as his allies (8a), and, most surprising of all, becomes  identified as the god Indra himself (8cd), via the very last word in the hymn, vajrín “wielder of the mace,” a qualifier otherwise only of Indra.
1. Rise up, o Lord of the Sacred Formulation. Seeking the gods, we  beseech you:
let the Maruts of good drops come forth; o Indra, swelling with strength,  keep (them) company.
2. For it is just you, o son of strength [=Indra], that the mortal implores  when the stake is set.
O Maruts, whoever loves you, he would acquire the possession of good  heroes and good horses.
3. Let the Lord of the Sacred Formulation go forth, let the goddess  Liberality go forth
to the hero belonging to men, whose gifts come in fives. Let the gods lead  our sacrifice.
4. Who gives to the cantor liberal goods, he acquires imperishable fame; for him we win through sacrifice faultless refreshment bringing good  heroes and advancing well.
5. Now the Lord of the Sacred Formulation proclaims the mantra worthy  to be spoken,
in which Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, and the gods have made
their home.
6. Just that would we speak at the rites—the faultless mantra that brings  good fortune, o gods.
And if you gladly receive this speech, o noble men [=gods], it will attain  all things of yours worth winning.
7. Who can attain to the man who seeks the gods, and who to the man  whose ritual grass has been twisted?
The pious man has advanced ever further through his abodes; he has  made his own dwelling place pregnant.
150 I.41
8. He should inseminate his dominion. Together with the kings [=Ādityas],  he smites: even in peril he has established a good dwelling for himself. There exists no one to obstruct, no one to overcome the one who wields  the mace, be the stake great or small.
## 41 Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman (1–3, 7–9), Ādityas (4–6)
Kaṇva Ghaura
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
For most of its short compass, this hymn is a simple celebration of the rewards  and protection the Ādityas grant to their devotee. The only notable aspect of these  verses is the pervasive imagery of journeys and their potential risks.
It is only the last two verses (8–9) that introduce interesting complications. This  last tr̥ca begins (vs. 7) with a deliberative question—how shall we make our praise  of the gods succeed? The advice in the next two verses seems to be (translated into  modern American political parlance) “Don’t go negative!” In verse 8 the poet for
swears responding directly to a rival behaving with hostility and affirms his inten tion to use only positive means to win the gods. The first two pādas of verse 9 depict  the rivalry in terms of the ever-popular ancient Indian dice game (see esp. X.34),  counseling the poet that you can never tell what your opponent has up his sleeve  until all the cards are on the table. (We have recast this vignette into the language  of modern card-playing, which works remarkably well—even to the holding of the  four winning tokens, aces in our recasting, which in the Indian dice game would be  a handful of vibhītaka nuts divisible by four.) The lesson seems to be that, given the  possibility that your opponent might have some successful tricks of his own, you  should engage him as little as possible and concentrate on your positive praises of  the gods.
1. Whom they guard—the attentive Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman— that person is never deceived.
2. The mortal whom they carry across as if in their arms and protect  from harm,
he thrives, unharmed and whole.
3. The kings [=Ādityas] smash apart the hard places, apart the hostilities in  front of them;
they lead across difficult ways.
4. The path is easy to go on and harmless to men for the one going to truth. There is no fissure there for you.
5. The sacrifice that you lead along the straight path, o superior men,  Ādityas,
that will reach you for insight. 6. That mortal attains to treasure and to goods, to a whole lineage along  with his life,
as one who cannot be laid low.
7. O comrades, how shall we bring to success our praise song for Mitra and  Aryaman,
a great delight for Varuṇa?
8. Let me not respond to the man who smites or curses you, (as if) to one  devoted to the gods;
by benevolent thoughts alone will I seek to win you.
9. (A gambler) should be afraid, right up till (the cards) are laid on (the  table), that (his opponent) may be holding four (aces).
One should not go eagerly after evil speech.
## 42 Pūsaṇ
Kaṇva Ghaura
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas, with a final verse
Like other Pūṣan hymns, this one has an informal tone and imaginative depictions of  the circumstances in which Pūṣan can render us aid. In the first part of the hymn the  god is asked to rid our paths of potential enemies (esp. vss. 2–4), while in the latter part  he is to lead us along these roads, now rendered safe, to prosperity (esp. vss. 7–8). The  nine verses of tr̥cas are consistently addressed to Pūṣan in the 2nd person, and all those  verses but 5 contain imperatives; note especially the final explosion of five abrupt,  object-less imperatives in 9ab, the final verse of the hymn proper. In the final summary  verse (10) Pūṣan is in the 3rd person, the object of our attentions and our requests.
1. Traverse the roads with (us), Pūṣan, and (release) constraint from (us), o  child of release.
Go forth before us to victory, o god.
2. The evil, malevolent wolf that will set his sights on us, o Pūṣan,
smite him away, as always, from the path.
3. Drive away this highwayman, the robber who knows the crooked ways, to a distance far from our route.
4. The double-dealing utterer of evil, whoever he is—
with your foot stamp on his scorching (weapon).
5. We choose that help of yours, o wondrous counselor Pūṣan,
with which you spurred on our forefathers.
6. Now then, o you who bring every good fortune, who are the foremost  wielder of the golden axe,
make the stakes easy for us to win.
152 I.43
7. Lead us across the parched places. Make easy passages, easy pathways  for us.
– Pūṣan, here you will find the resolve.
8. Lead us to good pasture, with no new suffering on the road.
– Pūṣan, here you will find the resolve.
9. Strive! Give and proffer! Sharpen up! Fill the belly!
– Pūṣan, here you will find the resolve.
10. We do not oppose Pūṣan; we greet him with hymns.
We beg the wondrous one for goods.
## 43 Rudra (1–2, 4–6), Rudra, Mitra and Varuṇa (3), Soma (7–9)
Kaṇva Ghaura
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9, arranged in tr̥cas
There is only one other R̥gvedic hymn dedicated jointly to Rudra and Soma, gods  who have little apparent in common. In VI.74 the two are invoked together, in a dual  dvandva, but aside from generic divine descriptions only Rudra’s characteristics are  mentioned. Here the two gods are confined to separate tr̥cas; in fact, as Oldenberg  suggests, it may have originally been two hymns: verses 1–6 Rudra, 7–9 Soma.
In contrast to other Rudra contexts the depiction of Rudra here is resolutely posi tive; there is no trace of the dangerous or vengeful Rudra. One might in fact consider  the pile-up of flattering adjectives in the opening question in verse 1 a poetic insur ance policy, making it clear to the god that there will be no caviling from us. The rest  of the two Rudra tr̥cas focuses on the god’s power to provide for the welfare of both  humans and livestock, along with Aditi (vs. 2) and the principal Ādityas (vs. 3).
The first two verses (7–8) of the tr̥ca to Soma are straightforward and generic,  with no particularly somian features. The final verse (9), in a different meter, is syn tactically complex and lexically formal, and has given rise to a number of compet ing interpretations. In our view it depicts Soma, as often, as extending from earth to  heaven, and he finds the gods in both places, in heaven, which is their abode, and on  the ritual ground, because they have come to drink soma at the sacrifice. Both the  relevance of this verse to the rest of the tr̥ca and the connection of the Rudra and  Soma portions of the hymn escape us.
1. What might we say to Rudra, the provident, the most generous, the very  powerful;
what might we say that is most wealful to his heart?
2. So that for our livestock and men Aditi will create Rudrian power,  likewise for our kine,
likewise for our offspring.
3. So that Mitra and Varuṇa will be attentive to us, likewise Rudra,
likewise all (the gods) in concert. 4. To the lord of songs, the lord of ritual offerings, to Rudra whose  remedies are healing [?]
we plead for the favor of luck and lifetime.
5. He who shines like the blazing sun, like gold,
as the best of the gods, as the good one
6. Will make weal for our steed and easy passage for our ram and ewe, for our men and women, for our cow.
7. Upon us, Soma, set down the glory of a hundred men,
great, powerfully manly fame.
8. Let neither obstructions nor hostilities deflect us, Soma.
O drop, give us a share in the prize.
9. The creatures [=gods] that belong to you, the immortal one—as their  head you seek them in the highest domain of truth [=heaven]
and in the navel (of the earth?) [=ritual ground], Soma. You will know  them as the ones who attend upon (you), Soma.
The next group of hymns (I.44–50), attributed to Praskaṇva Kāṇva, the poet also of  VIII.49 (the first Vālakhilya hymn) and IX.95, has the defining feature that all the  hymns are related to a particular ritual litany, the Prātaranuvāka or “Early-Morning  Recitation” (on which see Eggeling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2: 229 n. 2; Hillebrandt  1897: 128; Keith 1925 I: 328). The gods to whom these Praskaṇva hymns are dedi
cated are those mentioned in the litany: Agni, particularly in his capacity as illumi nator of the early morning and conveyor of the dawn divinities, the Aśvins, Dawn,  and the rising Sun.
## 44 Agni, Aśvins, Dawn (1–2), Agni (3–14)
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
14 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
As indicated in the introduction to the Praskaṇva collection, this hymn to Agni  praises him in his connection to the rituals of the early morning, especially in his  role as conveyor of the other gods who attend this sacrifice. In its fourteen verses  this hymn seldom departs from this simple message. The language is measured and  dignified, but not difficult or poetically contorted.
1. Agni, immortal one—the bright benefit radiating from Dawn:
convey it here to the pious man, o Jātavedas; convey here today the gods  who wake at dawn.
2. For you are the delightful messenger, conveyor of oblations, o Agni,  charioteer of the ceremonies.
Jointly with the Aśvins and with Dawn establish in us good heroism and  lofty fame.154 I.44
3. Today we choose as messenger Agni the good one, dear to many, whose beacon is smoke, but who is foamy with radiance when the  dawns break, the glory of the ceremonies, of the sacrifices.
4. The fairest, the youngest guest, well-libated, delightful to the  pious folk—
I reverently invoke Agni Jātavedas when the dawns break, to journey to  the gods.
5. I will praise you—o immortal nurturer of all—
as immortal guardian—o Agni, partaker of the ritual meal—as best  sacrificer—o conveyor of the oblation.
6. Be one who is good for the singer to laud, o youngest one, one whose  tongue is honey when well-libated.
Lengthening the lifetime of Praskaṇva to live, do homage to the  divine folk.
7. Because the clans together kindle you as Hotar who provides all  possessions [/possesses all knowledge],
o much-invoked Agni, bring the discerning gods here at a run— 8. Savitar, Dawn, the Aśvins, Bhaga. Through the nights, when the  dawns break,
the Kaṇvas, their soma pressed, kindle you, Agni, as conveyor of the  oblation, o you of good ceremony.
9. For you are the master of the ceremonies, Agni, the messenger of  the clans.
Convey here today the gods who wake at dawn, who look like the sun,  for soma-drinking.
10. O Agni rich in radiance, through the earlier dawns you have shone  visible to all.
You are the helper set in front among the settlements; you are the  descendant of Manu (set in front) at the sacrifices.
11. O Agni, as the furtherer of the sacrifice, as the Hotar seasonably  sacrificing
would we install you, just as Manu did, o god—and as the discerning,  quick, immortal messenger.
12. When as the one set in front for the gods, their intimate, you undertake  their mission, o you of Mitra’s might,
the beams of your fire flash like the clamorous waves of a river.
13. Listen, you with listening ears, along with your passengers, the gods  who travel with you, o Agni.
Let them sit on the ritual grass—Mitra, Aryaman, and those who travel  early to the ceremony. 14. Let them listen to the praise—the Maruts of good drops, whose tongue  is Agni, strong through truth.
Let him drink the soma—Varuṇa of steadfast commandment, jointly  with the Aśvins and with Dawn.
## 45 Agni (except Gods 10cd)
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
10 verses: anuṣṭubh
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one celebrates Agni as the conveyor of  the gods appropriate to the early-morning sacrifice. Unlike the last hymn, however,  these gods are not individually enumerated; instead generic names for groups of  gods are given in the first half of the first verse, and in the last two verses (9–10)  they are summed up in the phrase “the divine folk.” The emphasis is rather on the  world of men. In verse 3 the poet mentions a number of prior singers as models  for his own interaction with Agni, and he groups himself with his kinsmen the  Priyamedhas (vs. 4) and Kaṇvas (vs. 5), as well as unnamed poets and invokers in  verses 6–8. Thus, while the two pairs of outer verses (1–2, 9–10) concern Agni’s  delivery of the gods to the sacrifice, the middle verses (3–8) are occupied with the  sacrificers’ desire for Agni to listen to their hymns and pleas.
1. You, Agni, (bring) the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Ādityas here.
I will sacrifice to the being who assures good rites, born of Manu,
sprinkling ghee [=Agni].
2. Because, o Agni, the discriminating gods give attentive hearing to the  pious man,
bring them here, the three and thirty, you with the ruddy horses, you who  long for song.
3. As in the case of Priyamedha, of Atri, of Virūpa, o Jātavedas,
as of Aṅgiras, o you of great commandment, hear the call of Praskaṇva. 4. The greatly observant Priyamedhas have called for help
on Agni, ruling over the rites with his blazing flame.
5. O comrade whose oblation is ghee, listen well to these songs here, with which the sons of Kaṇva call upon you for aid.
6. O you of brightest fame, the kinsmen within their clans call upon you, o much beloved Agni, the flame-haired, to convey the oblation.
7. The inspired poets have installed you as their Hotar, seasonably
sacrificing, best finder of goods,
with listening ears, of greatest extent, o Agni, at the rituals of daybreak. 8. The inspired poets whose soma is pressed have roused you to delight— they bearing the lofty light, the oblation for the pious mortal, o Agni.
156 I.46
9. O might-made comrade, those who travel early for soma-drinking, the divine folk—here today make them sit on the ritual grass, o
good one.
10. The divine folk, o Agni, attract toward us through sacrifice, with  invocations common (to all):
“Here is the soma, you of good drops. Drink it, aged overnight.”
## 46 Aśvins
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
15 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn is an invitation to the Aśvins to come in the early morning to a soma  offering, either the early morning of the pressing day or the early morning of  the following day in an Atirātra or “overnight” soma ritual. It is a difficult hymn  because of its obscure references (cf. vss. 4 and 5) and its penchant for hapaxes (e.g.,  kúṭa in vs. 4, ā́dāra in 5, avidriyá in 15).
A unifying image running through much of the hymn is the journey of the  Aśvins over the waters to the sacrificial area (vss. 3, 7, 8, 11), introduced by the  poet’s statement that the Sindhu River is the mother of the Aśvins (vs. 2). In  accord with this image, the soma itself is a river, flowing upward to the Aśvins  to bring them to the sacrificial area (vs. 9ab). In this verse “what is good” or “the  good thing” that is “in the track of the rivers” may refer to the soma, as Geldner  suggests. Echoing this image is the poet’s repeated use of derivatives of √pR̥“carry  across” (vss. 4, 6, 12).
In verse 1 Dawn is the first to arrive, before other deities, although with the  arrival of dawn the Aśvins should also appear, and indeed in verse 14 the poet  returns to the arrival of Dawn and says that she has followed the Aśvins. In verse 2  the insight through which the Aśvins find goods may be both their insight and also  the poet’s, for the hymns inspire the Aśvins to bring goods. Verse 4 is very obscure  for several reasons. First, the identity of the “lover of the waters, the carrier” is  uncertain. Among the suggestions are Indra (Pirart 1995: 81) or Soma (Geldner,  Renou, Thieme [1967: 236]), but it might also be Agni, who is also connected with  the waters—he is famously “the Child of the Waters”—and who carries oblations  to the gods and carries sacrificers across difficulties. Unfortunately 4c is not much  help in identifying “the carrier” since kúṭa is a hapax of uncertain meaning. We  have translated it as “house” following Thieme, but it may have another meaning  and could even be a proper name, as Pirart suggests. This “lover of the waters”  is probably also the ā́dāra, again a hapax and again of unsure meaning. We have  translated it as “the one paying heed,” but according to another etymological  analysis it could mean “breaker, splitter.” All we can say with certainty is that  the verse ends with a clear invitation to the Aśvins to drink the soma (5c). As the soma flows to the Aśvins, so the poet hopes that the morning light, correspond ing to the soma, will flow toward the sacrificers (6). In verse 9 the poet turns to  address his fellow Kaṇvas in the first half-verse and the Aśvins in pāda c. In that  last line, the poet asks where the Aśvins are hidden, where they are “cloaked,” for  it is presumably still dark and neither the dawn nor the Aśvins have yet appeared.  The cloaking of the Aśvins in 9 contrasts with verse 13, in which the poet asks the  Aśvins to “clothe” themselves in the soma in the company of Vivasvant, who is  here likely associated with the sun. Then they and the morning will be present to  the sacrificers.
1. With none before her, this Dawn breaks, the beloved of heaven.
I shall sing aloft praise to you, Aśvins,
2. Who are wondrous, whose mother is the River Sindhu, who are mindful  of riches—
the gods finding goods through insight.
3. Your lead (animals) twist and turn upon the (sea’s) broken surface, when your chariot will fly with its birds.
4. By the oblation the lover of the waters, the carrier, carries
across, o men—
he, the father and boundary of the house [?],
5. The one paying heed [?] to (our) conceptions for the sake of you two, o  Nāsatyas, you for whom (these) words are conceived:
“Drink boldly of the soma.”
6. The light-bringing refreshment that will carry us across the darkness,  Aśvins—
give that to us.
7. Travel here by the boat of our conceptions to go to the far shore! Hitch up your chariot, Aśvins!
8. Your oar is broader than heaven; your chariot is at the ford of the rivers; through our insight the soma drops have been hitched up.
9. O Kaṇvas, (in the track) of heaven are the soma drops; in the track of  the rivers is what is good.
Where do you two desire to place that cloak of yours?
10. Radiance has come into being for the soma plant: the sun, counterpart  to gold!
The black one [=the fire in the coals] has peered out with his tongue. 11. And the path of truth has come into being to lead right to the far shore. The course of heaven has appeared.
12. The singer awaits each and every help of the Aśvins
at the exhilarating drink of soma for the two who carry across.
13. Having clothed yourselves with the drink of soma and with song in the  company of Vivasvant,
come here, o you who are good luck, as at the time of Manu!
158 I.47
14. Dawn has followed your glory as you circle the earth.
You will win the truths in the nights.
15. Aśvins, both of you—drink! Both of you—offer protection to us through your unbreakable help!
## 47 Aśvins
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
10 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
The hymn is dominated by imperatives, which appear in every verse except the  last. These imperatives command the Aśvins to attend to the poet (e.g., 2d), to  come to the sacrifice (e.g., 2b, 3d, 7c, 8b, 8d, 9a), to drink the soma (e.g., 1c, 3b),  and especially to bestow prosperity on the sacrificer (e.g., 1d, 5c, 6b, 6d). The  last verse summarizes the desire of the poet to bring the Aśvins, together with  many goods, by means of the “recitations and chants” of those performing the  sacrifice.
Like I.34 the hymn also associates a number of triplets with the Aśvins: their  “triply turning chariot with its three standing places” (vs. 2) and the ritual grass  “on which are three seats” (vs. 4). These triplets likely have ritual reference,  although it is not clear what the reference might be. The “three turns” of the  Aśvins’ chariot may describe the three pressings of a soma sacrifice. Compare  X.52.4d  =  124.1b, which speaks of the sacrifice with its páñcayāmaṃ trivŕ̥taṃ
saptátantum “five courses, three turns, seven threads.” The term trivandhurá “with  three standing places” is only used to describe the chariot of the Aśvins, but never  with much indication about its referent. Geldner suggests that “the three seats” of  triṣadhasthá might be for the two Aśvins and Sūryā or that they are simply three  because the Aśvins are regularly associated with triplets. But there are other pos
sibilities. Although triṣadhasthá characterizes various gods, in X.61.14 and V.11.2  it describes the three seats of Agni, the three fires, and perhaps it refers to these in  this context as well. In that case, the three seats are not actually on the ritual grass  but rather at or near it.
In the first verse the reference to the “day-old” soma places this hymn in the  morning of the day following the pressing day in an Atirātra or “overnight” soma  ritual. The soma offerings in the morning are a continuation of the offerings of  the Third Pressing. If recited at the end of the rite, it is no wonder that the poet  emphasizes the goods that he hopes that the Aśvins will bring on their chariot (3c,  6a, 9bc)—the chariot that is both the vehicle on which the Aśvins ride and the  sacrifice itself. These are the goods that should come to the sacrificers as a result of  their completed sacrifice.
In verse 7 the poet calls on the Aśvins to come whether they are far away or with  Turvaśa. The Kaṇva poets of the VIIIth maṇḍala suggest their alliance with the Turvaśa and Yadu tribes (e.g., VIII.4.1 and 4.7; 7.18; 9.14; 10.5; 45.27). Since our  poet is a Kaṇva as well, Turvaśa represents an ally, perhaps the people of the sacrifi cer for whom the hymn was composed. The point is therefore that the Aśvins should  come to this sacrifice whether are far away or close by, among this very people.
1. O you growing strong through truth, this most honey-filled soma has  been pressed for you two.
Drink that (soma) aged overnight, Aśvins. Grant riches to the
pious man.
2. Journey here, Aśvins, by your triply turning chariot with its three  standing places, with its beautiful adornment.
The Kaṇvas are creating a formulation for you at the rite. Listen well to  their call!
3. O Aśvins, growing strong through truth, drink the most
honey-filled soma.
Then today, wondrous ones, come to the pious man, bringing goods on  your chariot.
4. O you providing all possessions, mix the sacrifice with honey on the  ritual grass, on which are three seats.
The heaven-bound Kaṇvas, having pressed soma for you, call upon you  two, Aśvins.
5. With what superior powers you helped Kaṇva, Aśvins,
with these help us, o lords of beauty! Drink the soma, o you growing  strong through truth!
6. Wondrous Aśvins, convey nourishments to the very generous one,  bringing goods on your chariot.
Whether from the sea or from heaven, grant much-desired wealth to us.
7. Nāsatyas, if you are in the far distance, or if you are with the Turvaśa, from there come to us by your smoothly rolling chariot, together with  the rays of the sun.
8. Turning this way, let your team, the glory of the rite, convey you to our  soma-pressings.
Replenishing refreshment for the good (ritual) performer, and
possessing good drops, sit here on the ritual grass, o men.
9. Nāsatyas, come by your sun-skinned chariot,
by which you have ever conveyed goods to the pious man, in order to  drink of the honeyed soma.
10. With our recitations and chants we call the two bringing many goods  down this way for their help,
for surely you have always drunk soma at the dear seat of the Kaṇvas,  Aśvins.
160 I.48
## 48 Dawn
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
16 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Another in Praskaṇva Kāṇva’s series devoted to the deities of the early-morning  sacrifice, this hymn to Dawn is especially concerned with the acquisition of goods— a common association because the dakṣiṇā or “priestly gift” is distributed to the  poets and priests at the Morning Pressing. The radiant beauty of Dawn and her  mandate to rouse and animate all living beings are not neglected in the hymn, how ever, especially in the middle verses (5–10). In verses 11–12 she is also, unusually,  charged with a task more appropriate for Agni (see, e.g., I.44), namely conveying  the gods to the sacrifice.
1. Along with a thing of value, dawn forth to us, Daughter of Heaven, along with lofty brilliance, radiant goddess, along with wealth, (you who  are) rich in gifts.
2. Possessing horses and cows, finding all goods in abundance, (the dawns)  bestir themselves to shine.
Arouse liberalities toward me, o Dawn; stimulate the generosity of the  benefactors.
3. Dawn has dawned (before) and will dawn now—the lively goddess of the  chariots.
Those who hold themselves (ready [for giving]) at her approaches, as  those who seek fame on the sea hold themselves (firm),
4. And, o Dawn, those who at your journeys yoke their mind for giving— the patrons—
here (the poet) Kaṇva, the latest of Kaṇvas, sings their names, the names  of those superior men.
5. Liberal-spirited Dawn drives here, giving delight like a maiden.
Wakening the footed community, she speeds along. She makes the
winged ones fly up.
6. She who disperses the assembly, disperses the busy ones, she follows  (them) like a track—she moist (with dew) [/lubricious].
The birds, having flown at your dawning, do not settle, o you who are  rich in prize mares.
7. This one has hitched herself up from out of the distance, from (the place  of) the rising of the sun.
With a hundred chariots, this well-portioned Dawn drives out
toward men.
8. Every moving creature bows before her gaze. The spirited one
creates light. Dawn, the bounteous Daughter of Heaven, dawns away hatred, away  failures.
9. O Dawn, be radiant here with your glittering radiance, o Daughter of  Heaven,
conveying hither abundant good fortune for us, dawning forth at the  rituals of daybreak.
10. For the breathing and living of all is in you, when you dawn forth,  spirited one.
With your lofty chariot, radiant one, heed our call, you of bright
bounty.
11. Dawn, do win the prize, which is bright for the human race.
With it convey those of good action [=gods] here to the ceremonies, to  those of good action [=sacrificers] who (as oblation-)conveyors sing  to you.
12. Convey all the gods here for soma-drinking from the midspace, o Dawn. Establish in us a mass of cows and of horses, worthy of praise, o Dawn,  also victory’s prize and good heroes en masse.
13. She whose gleaming, auspicious rays have appeared opposite,
let her—Dawn—give us all-desirable wealth, well ornamented, easy to  come by.
14. Because even those previous seers who called upon you for aid, for help,  o great one—
do you (now) greet our praises (as you did theirs) with generosity, o  Dawn, with your bright brilliance.
15. Dawn, when today with your radiance you will push apart the two  doors of heaven,
then hold out to us broad shelter that keeps the wolf away, o goddess,  hold out refreshments consisting of cows.
16. Mingle us with lofty wealth provided with all ornaments, with
refreshments,
with brilliance surpassing all, great Dawn, with prizes, o you who are  rich in prize mares.
## 49 Dawn
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
4 verses: anuṣṭubh
A short and simple hymn, treating Dawn’s journey from heaven to the earthly  realm (vss. 1–2), to rouse the living world (vs. 3). The poets’ response to her
162 I.50
coming and their hope that her advent will bring them gifts end the hymn  (vs. 4cd).
1. Dawn, with your auspicious (rays) come here, even from the luminous  realm of heaven.
Let the (horses) whose breath is reddish convey you right to the house of  the one who has soma.
2. The well-ornamented, well-naved chariot that you have
mounted, Dawn—
with it further the people of good fame today, Daughter of Heaven.
3. Even the winged birds and the two-footed and four-footed, o silvery Dawn, have set forth following your regulations of time, from the ends  of heaven—
4. For, dawning forth with your rays, you illuminate the whole
luminous realm.
Just you, Dawn, have the Kaṇvas, longing for goods, called upon
with songs.
## 50 Sūrya (1-9), and a Spell against Disease (10–13)
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
13 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, anuṣṭubh 10–13
This final hymn of the Praskaṇva sequence falls into two parts. The last three  verses (11–13) have a clear Atharvan cast, as a spell against disease, specifically  jaundice. By sympathetic magic, the golden sun removes the jaundice from the  afflicted man and displaces it onto other, presumably yellowish creatures—parrots  and other birds.
The first nine verses, in a different meter, are a charmingly simple descrip tion of the rising of the Sun and the beginning of his journey across the sky.  The affinity of the intermediate verse (10) is not clear. Though it matches the  meter of the final three verses, in tone it seems more like a final verse summariz ing the happy result of the sunrise in verses 1–9. (It is not unusual for the final  verse of a hymn to be in a different meter from the rest.) If this is the case, then  the spell in verses 11–13 could have been tacked onto this hymn because of the  phrase “higher heaven” (11b), which echoes “higher light” and “highest light” in  verse 10.
1. Up do the beacons convey this god Jātavedas,
the Sun, for all to see.
2. Away like thieves go these heavenly bodies with the night,
before the Sun, who has his gaze on all. 3. His beacons have appeared; his rays (extend) widely throughout the  peoples,
flashing like fires.
4. Transiting, visible to all, a light-maker are you, o Sun.
You illuminate the whole luminous realm.
5. Facing the clans of the gods, facing the descendants of Manu do  you go up,
facing all, (for them) to see the sun—
6. With which as your eye, o purifying Varuṇa, you look upon
the one bustling throughout the peoples.
7. Across heaven you go, the broad realm, measuring the days with the nights, looking upon the races, o Sun.
8. Seven fallow bay mares convey you, the flame-haired, in your chariot— o wide-gazing god Sun.
9. He has yoked the seven sleek daughters of the Sun’s chariot.
With these of his own yoking he drives.
10. Looking up from the darkness to the higher light, we
have come up to the Sun, god among the gods, the highest light.
11. As you go up today, o you of Mitra’s might, and mount the higher  heaven,
banish my heart-affliction and jaundice, o Sun.
12. In the parrots, in the ropanā-birds we place my jaundice.
And in the hāridrava-birds we deposit my jaundice.
13. Up has gone this Āditya here, along with all his strength,
making the hater subject to me. May I not become subject to the hater.
Here begins the second large division of Maṇḍala I (51–191).
The next seven hymns (I.51–57) are ascribed to Savya Āṅgirasa and consist only  of Indra hymns. For the most part the hymns are a glorification of Indra’s deeds— both the standard and well-known triumphs like the smashing of Vr̥tra (see esp.  I.52) and numerous lesser-known feats, which are presented in catalogue fashion  (see esp. I.51, 53). The style is often syntactically and rhetorically contorted, with  rare words and obscure expressions.
## 51 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14–15
This hymn consists primarily of an elaborated list of Indra’s great deeds, some  well known (like the Vala myth in 3a, the Vr̥tra myth in 4, Indra’s involvement164 I.51
with Uśanā Kāvya and Kutsa in the slaying of Śuṣṇa in verses 6a, 10–11) and  others quite obscure. For example, Vimada, mentioned in 3ab, is usually a client  of the Aśvins, who supply him with a wife (often using the same verb [√vah “con vey”] as here: I.112.9, 116.1, 117.20; X.39.7, 65.12). Is the same deed attributed to  Indra here and is the “good thing” that Indra brings him a reference to the wife?  Similarly puzzling are the enemies who make oblation “on the shoulder” in verse 5  (perhaps indicating people following different ritual practices and not part of the  Ārya community; see vss. 8–9), Indra’s role as an ant destroying walls in verse 9,  and his transformation into the female consort of an otherwise unknown figure in  verse 13c.
The catalogue of deeds is interrupted by demands that Indra use his same mar tial powers for our benefit (vss. 7–9ab), and it is framed by an exhortation to the  poets to give praise to the god (vs. 1) and the announcement of the end of the praise  hymn and the boons we seek from it (vss. 14–15).
1. With your hymns exhilarate this ram, much-summoned Indra worthy of  verses, the flood of good,
for whom the human (generations) pass by like the days. Chant to the  most liberal inspired one for our benefit.
2. His forms of help [=helpers] attained to the very superior one, who fills  the midspace but is enclosed by his powers—
the skillful R̥bhus (attained to) Indra, who was aroused to
exhilaration. Liberality, impelling (him), mounted to him of a
hundred resolves.
3. You opened up the cowpen for the Aṅgirases, and you were the
way-finder for Atri in the (house) of a hundred doors.
You also conveyed the good thing [=wife?] to Vimada along with grain  (for the oblation?), when in the contest you set to dancing the stone of  the one clad in it.
4. You opened up the covers of the waters; you held fast to the drop-laden  goods in the mountain.
When, o Indra, with your vast power you smashed the serpent Vr̥tra, just  after that you made the sun rise in heaven to be seen.
5. With your wiles you blew away the wily ones, who, according to their  own customs, poured (their offering) “on the shoulder.”
You broke through the strongholds of Pipru, o you of manly mind; you  helped R̥jiśvan through in the smashing of Dasyus.
6. You helped Kutsa in the smashing of Śuṣṇa, and you made Śambara  subject to Atithigva.
With your foot you trampled down Arbuda, though he was great.
Indeed, from long ago you were born to smash Dasyus.
7. In you every power has been placed toward the same end. Your
generosity excites itself to drink the soma. Your mace has become visible, placed in your arms: hew down the
bullish strengths of your rival.
8. Distinguish between the Āryas and those who are Dasyus. Chastising  those who follow no commandment, make them subject to the man  who provides ritual grass.
Become the potent inciter of the sacrificer. I take pleasure in all these  (deeds) of yours at our joint revelries.
9. Indra—making those who reject his commandments subject to those  who follow his commandments, piercing those who don’t stand by
him with (the aid of) those who do—
being praised, as an ant he smashed apart the mud walls of the one  trying to reach heaven, who, though already full grown, kept
growing.
10. When Uśanā fashions might with might for you, then your vast power  thrusts apart the two worlds with its greatness.
The mind-yoked (horses) of the Wind conveyed you, being filled (with  soma?), here to fame, o manly minded one.
11. When he has found exhilaration together with Uśanā Kāvya, Indra  mounts the two (horses) that are surging and surging further.
The strong one let loose the waters in a stream for coursing and
propelled apart the fortified strongholds of Śuṣṇa.
12. You mount the chariot to the bullish drinks on which you become  exhilarated at Śāryata’s (ritual) presentation,
so that you will take pleasure in (the ceremonies) with their pressed  soma, o Indra. (Then) you ascend to the unassailing signal call in
heaven.
13. You gave little Vr̥cayā to great, eloquent Kakṣīvant, the soma-presser,  o Indra.
You became the wife of Vr̥ṣaṇaśva, o you of good resolve. All these  (deeds) of yours are to be proclaimed at the pressings.
14. Indra has become fixed in the exclusive possession of the man of good  insight; the praise song (has been fixed) like a doorpost among the
Pajras,
as it seeks horses, cows, chariots, and goods. Indra alone is master of  wealth and will provide it.
15. This homage has been pronounced for the bull, the independent king,  the mighty one of real unbridled force.
In this community might we, together with our patrons, be possessors  of hale heroes under your protection, o Indra.
166 I.52
## 52 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13, 15
This hymn begins in the same way as the previous one, by praising Indra in the  form of a ram, but, unlike I.51 with its listing of Indra’s great deeds, I.52 focuses  almost entirely on the Vr̥tra myth and its aftermath—save for a brief reference to  the Vala myth in verse 5 (and possibly verse 3). The account of the Vr̥tra battle  begins in verse 2 and continues through verse 10, with a reiteration in the final verse  15, and thus constitutes one of the longer sustained R̥gvedic passages devoted to  this myth. This account of the myth has not achieved the fame of a hymn like I.32,  however—in part because of the obscurity of its diction and syntax.
This version also allots a large role to the helpers that encouraged and aided  Indra at the battle, not only Tvaṣṭar (vs. 7) as often, but also the Maruts, iden tified as such in verses 9 and 15 (see also vs. 3), but also referred to as per sonified abstractions—“forms of help” (see vss. 2, 4–5, 9), “powers,” et cetera.  Almost paradoxically the hymn also depicts the fear of the divine beings and  of heaven itself during the Vr̥tra battle (vss. 9–10). Moreover, the final verses  (11–14, excluding the summarizing verse 15) concern the extent of Indra’s unri valed power, comparing its reach to the furthest expanses of heaven, earth, and  the midspace.
1. I shall exalt this ram, who finds the sun, whose hundred (superior  powers) of good essence arise together.
(Might I turn) his chariot, rushing to the summons, like a steed (rushing to)  the prize; with my well-twisted (hymns) might I turn Indra here for help. 2. Like a mountain, immovable on its foundations, Indra, with his thousand  forms of help, grew strong amid his powers,
when subduing the floods, highly excited by the soma stalk, he smashed  Vr̥tra, who obstructed the rivers.
3. For he (was) a skulker among skulkers at the maw (of Vr̥tra?), but he,  having a golden foundation, was strengthened to exhilaration at the  (soma-)udder by the inspired thinkers [=Maruts?]—
Indra—with my skillful work and insight I have summoned him whose  gifts are most generous, for he is a provider because of the soma stalk. 4. Him whom they fill like the sea—his own superior powers of good  essence which have the ritual grass as their seat in heaven—
Indra—his forms of help [=helpers] stood by him at the Vr̥tra-smashing,  as did his unextinguishable gusts whose breath is unobstructed.
5. In his exhilaration, while he was fighting, his forms of help rushed to  him, who has his own proper work, like rapids in a torrent,
when the mace-wielding Indra, emboldened by the soma stalk, split the  barricades of the Vala cave, as Trita had. 6. Glowing heat encircles him [=Indra], and his vast power flared. He  [=Vr̥tra], having obstructed the waters, was lying on the foundation  of the dusky realm,
when you, Indra, struck your thunder down upon the jaws of Vr̥tra,  Hard-to-Grasp, in the (waters’) torrent.
7. For like waves to a lake, the sacred formulations that make you strong  rush down to you, o Indra.
Tvaṣṭar also strengthened his own power, to be employed by you: he  fashioned the mace of overwhelming might.
8. And when you, o Indra of concentrated resolve, together with your  fallow bays, smashed Vr̥tra, making a way for the waters for Manu,
you held the metal mace in your arms. You fixed the sun fast in heaven  to be seen.
9. What is lofty, self-luminous, formidable, and praiseworthy [=Indra in form  of sun]—in fear they made that their own means of ascent to heaven,
when the forms of help appropriate to human prize-contests, (that is,)  the Maruts, accompanying that superior man [=Indra], cheered on
Indra, their sun.
10. Even formidable heaven kept retreating from the sound of this serpent  and in fear at your mace, Indra,
when, in the exhilaration of the pressed soma, with your vast power  you split the head of Vr̥tra, who was pressing harder and harder
upon the two world-halves.
11. Now, o Indra, just as far as the earth with its ten coils (extends) and the  separate peoples will extend throughout all the days,
just to there, o bounteous one, your widely famed strength will pervade  heaven with vast power and mightiness.
12. O you of bold mind, at the far edge of this dusky realm and of distant  heaven with the might natural to you
you have made the earth the counterpart of your might for our help.  Encompassing the waters and the sun, you go all the way to heaven. 13. You have become the counterpart of earth and you became the lord of  high (heaven) containing lofty heroes.
You filled the whole midspace with your greatness. This is certainly  true: there is no other like you.
14. Whose expanse neither heaven nor earth reaches across—any more than  the rivers reach the end of the dusky realm—
nor (do they reach him) who performs his own proper work in his
exhilaration while he is fighting. You alone have done everything else  in due order.
15. There at this same contest the Maruts chanted and all the gods cheered  you on,
when with your deadly weapon covered with spikes, o Indra, you struck  down against the mouth of Vr̥tra.
168 I.53
## 53 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11
This hymn is divided into two roughly equal halves. After an initial verse exhorting  the singers to present their work to Indra at the sacrifice, lest a lazy performance  or bad composition deprive them of his gifts, Indra is praised in verses 2–5 for his  quick response in fulfilling the desires of his singers. The mood changes in the next  five verses (6–10), which constitute a brisk catalogue of Indra’s martial deeds in  aid of his named human clients. This survey is somewhat reminiscent of the list of  Indra’s deeds in the first Savya hymn, I.51. The hymn ends with a summary verse  (11), which returns to the hortatory style of verse 1.
1. Let us bring forward our speech for the great one, our songs for Indra, at  the seat of Vivasvant,
for never has anyone found a treasure among those who are, as it were,  asleep. A poor praise hymn is not acclaimed among the givers of wealth. 2. O Indra, you are the one who breaks out the horse, breaks out the  cow, breaks out the grain, since you are the forceful lord of (every)
good thing.
He who from of old does his best for men, who does not short their  desires, a comrade to his comrades—to him we now sing.
3. O able Indra, most brilliant doer of many (deeds)—just yours is the good  that keeps appearing all around.
Therefore, o overpowering one, having grasped it entirely, bring it here.  Don’t leave lacking the desire of the singer who seeks you.
4. He is well disposed through these days by reason of these soma drops,  checking neglect by means of cows and (wealth) in horses.
Might we, breaking up the Dasyu with Indra and the soma drops,
keeping hostility away, be embraced by refreshment.
5. O Indra, might we be embraced by wealth, by nourishment, and by  much-glittering prizes bound for heaven.
Might we be embraced by your divine solicitude, having the unbridled  force of heroes, with cows at the front, accompanied by horses.
6. These exhilarating drinks exhilarated you and your bullish powers—these  soma juices at the smashing of obstacles, o lord of settlements,
when you laid low ten unopposable obstacles for the bard, a thousand  for the man who spreads the ritual grass.
7. Battle after battle you join boldly; fortress after fortress do you now  smash together with your power,
since, with Namī as your comrade, o Indra, in the far distance you laid  low the wily one, Namuci by name.
8. You struck Karañja and Parṇaya with the sharpest wheel-edge of Atithigva. You, unyielding, split the hundred fortresses of Vaṅgr̥da that were
besieged by R̥jiśvan.
9. You, together with Suśravas with no (other) adherents, (wrenched  down) those twice ten kings of the peoples, who had come too close; you, the famous, wrenched down the sixty thousand ninety-nine with a  chariot wheel and a lame (horse).
10. You helped Suśravas with your means of help and Tūrvayāṇa with your  means of rescue, o Indra.
You made Kutsa, Atithigva, and Āyu subject to him, to the great
young king.
11. We who, when the chant is raised, will be your most friendly comrades,  Indra, having the gods as our herdsmen—
let us praise you—we having good heroes because of you and receiving  a longer, more extensive lifetime.
## 54 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6, 8, 9, 11
Etymological figures and lexical repetitions abound in this hymn, and through  this repetition Indra comes to “own” certain words—particularly “daring” and  “sovereignty.” Much of the hymn (esp. vss. 1–6) consists of praise of Indra’s vari ous violent deeds, interspersed with exhortations to sing these praises to the god.  In verse 7 the earthly king is invested with some of Indra’s prestige—as long as he  emulates Indra’s habit of command and also shows the Indraic quality of generos ity to the poets. This generosity is also urged on Indra himself in verses 8–9 and  11, with a curious and obscurely phrased treatment of the Vr̥tra myth interspersed  in verse 10.
1. Do not (leave) us in this distress in our battles, o bounteous one, for the  end of your vast power cannot be reached.
You made the rivers roar, yourself constantly bellowing through the  woods. How have the war cries [/Heaven and Earth] not clashed
together in fear?
2. Chant to the able one, the capable one with his abilities. Exalting him,  praise Indra as he listens—
he who, a bullish bull by his bullish nature, with his daring power bears  down on the two world-halves.
3. Chant a thunderous speech to lofty heaven. Of which daring one his  daring mind has its own sovereignty—
the lord possessing lofty fame through his lofty might, the bull [=Indra]  has been put in front for his two fallow bays, for he is the chariot.
170 I.55
4. You shook the back of the lofty heaven; by yourself, in your daring, you  cut down Śambara,
as, daringly, by reason of the exhilarating (soma), you battle the
sharpened stone, the fist, of the wily one grown weak,
5. As you yank down on the head of the snorting Śuṣṇa also grown weak,  yourself constantly bellowing through the woods,
with your mind facing forward and possessed of lofty might. If you will  also do (such) today, who (will evade) you?
6. You helped the manly Turvaśa and Yadu; you (helped) Turvīti and  Vayya, o you of a hundred resolves;
you (helped) Etaśa and his chariot when the stake was to be decided,  and you subjugated the ninety-nine fortifications.
7. As king and lord of the settlements, that man will grow in strength  who, having bestowed his oblation, advances (Indra’s) command
in turn,
or who greets the (poets’) hymns with generosity. For him the gift
[/drop] of heaven swells here below.
8. Unequalled is his sovereignty, unequalled his inspired thinking.  Let the soma-drinkers of our group be preeminent through
their labor—
they who strengthen the great sovereignty, steadfast and bull-strong, of  you who give, o Indra.
9. For you alone are these ample beakers, milked by stones and resting in  cups—the draughts of Indra.
Attain (them), satisfy your desire for them, and then put your mind to  giving goods.
10. There stood darkness, whose tangles were the foundation for the waters,  a mountain within the belly of Vr̥tra.
Indra smashes all the rows (of palings) set up in succession among the  torrents by the encloser of the rivers.
11. Establish in us brilliance increasing in benevolence and your great and  mighty sovereignty, o Indra, as vanquisher of the peoples.
Guard those generous to us and protect our patrons. Destine us for
wealth and for nourishment bringing good descendants.
## 55 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
8 verses: jagatī
The hymn has a weak omphalos shape, with the paired middle verses 4 and 5  contrasting Indra’s central role in peace (4)  and war (5), in parallel syntactic constructions. The hymn begins by describing Indra’s vast size and fierce power  (vss. 1–3) and ends with an appeal to him to come to our sacrifice bearing gifts (vss.  7–8). Despite the emphasis in the hymn on Indra’s martial powers and contrary to  Savya’s usual practice, no particular heroic deeds are recounted or even mentioned  directly; there is simply one indirect allusion to the Vr̥tra myth in the final pāda of  verse 6, which serves as the transition between the omphalos verses and the final  requests.
1. His expansion spreads out even beyond heaven; not even the earth is the  counterpart to Indra in greatness.
Fearsome and mighty, a scorching firebrand for the settled domains, he  hones his mace, like a buffalo (its horn), to be piercingly sharp.
2. As the sea’s flood receives the rivers, he receives the sprawling
(soma-streams?) with his expanses.
Indra acts the bull to drink the soma. From of old he seeks admiration  as a battler by his power.
3. In order to enjoy it [=soma] like a mountain, you are in control of the  principles of great manliness.
Among the gods he shows ever more brightly by his heroism—the
powerful one placed in front for every deed.
4. It’s just he who displays his eloquence in the woods along with those  offering homage, when he proclaims his own dear Indrian (name)
among the peoples.
The bull becomes pleasing, the bull delightful, when, as bounteous one,  he impels the nourishing stream (of speech) in peace.
5. It’s just he who by his greatness makes great clashes for the peoples, a  battler by his power.
Then indeed they place their trust in turbulent Indra, as he smashes  down his mace, his deadly weapon, again and again—
6. For it’s he, seeking fame, who’s destroying the artfully made seats (of the  enemy) across the earth, as he grows strong in power,
and is making lights free of wolves [=safe] for the worshipful man. The  very resolute one released the waters to flow.
7. Let your mind be on giving, o soma-drinker. Hearing our tributes, make  your fallow bays turn this way.
These fervent intentions, which are your coachmen, best at guiding, do  not deceive you, o Indra.
8. You bear inexhaustible goods in your hands. The famed one takes  undominatable dominance into his body.
Like wells covered over by their makers are the many resolves within  your body, o Indra.
172 I.56
## 56 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: jagatī
Though characterized by rare words and tortuous expressions, both defying easy  interpretation, the hymn follows a fairly straightforward trajectory. The ability of  soma to strengthen Indra for his great feats is described in the first two verses, which  also depict Indra’s journey to our sacrifice. His power in general is the subject of  the next two verses (3–4), while the last two (5–6) focus on the slaying of Vr̥tra and  its cosmogonic effects.
1. This one has raised forth for himself the many dippers of this *well (of  soma), as a stallion, all aquiver, raises himself up to [=mounts] a
young mare.
For the great (deed?) he gives himself golden skill [=soma] to
drink, having turned his ingenious chariot here, hitched with his
fallow bays.
2. Our greetings in profusion, seeking his leadership, (go) seeking to win  him, like (rivers) in their converging on the sea.
With your sharpness, (o Soma,) ascend to the lord of skill,
(who is) now the power of ritual distribution, as trackers ascend
a mountain.
3. He is surpassing and great in masculine strength, (even) without  raising dust. Like the peak of a mountain his power glints with its  thrusting,
(the power) with which his headstrong metal (weapon), in his
exhilaration and among those standing by him, brought wily Śuṣṇa
down to rest in fetters.
4. If his divine might, strong through you [=poet], accompanies Indra to  help (him), as the sun accompanies the dawn,
(then) he, who by his daring power repels the darkness, raises the dust  aloft with a cry of hurrah!
5. When you spread out the immovable foundation [=earth], you
set the airy realm on the doorposts of heaven with your lofty
power.
When, o Indra, in (the contest) with the sun as its prize, ecstatic in your  exhilaration with the excitement (of soma), you smashed Vr̥tra, (then)  you forced out the flood of waters.
6. You set the foundation of heaven and of earth upon their seats with your  power as the great one, o Indra.
You made the waters flow in the exhilaration of the pressed soma; you  broke apart all at once the two jaws of Vr̥tra.
## 57 Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: jagatī
This final hymn of the Savya group turns its attention from the recounting of  Indra’s great (and lesser) deeds to focus on the ritual performance being offered  to honor the god (vss. 1–3) and on the participants in that performance: “we” who  are “yours,” that is, Indra’s (vss. 4–5). Only in the final verse (6) is there mention of  any of Indra’s exploits, with an oblique reference to the Vr̥tra myth that is featured  heavily in other Savya hymns.
One of the puzzles of the hymn is the identity of the female addressee in verse 3,  “(you,) lovely like Dawn.” Oldenberg (tentatively), Geldner, and Renou all suggest  that she is the Sacrificer’s Wife, but this is quite unlikely. As I have argued elsewhere  (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a, forthcoming b), this ritual participant is only being  introduced in the late R̥gveda and she is a controversial and polarizing figure there,  so it is improbable that she would be addressed without fanfare here. Moreover, the  addressee is called upon to bring or assemble material for the sacrifice, a role that  the Sacrificer’s Wife never has in classical śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a passim).
1. For the most bounteous one, the lofty one bringing lofty wealth, for the  mighty one of real unbridled force I bring forth my thought—
for him whose generosity is difficult to restrain as if in a torrent of
waters, lifelong generosity opened up to his power.
2. Then will everything be at hand for you to seek it: the soma-pressings of  the man who offers oblation (flow) like waters to the depths,
when the gladdening golden mace of Indra has been whetted, as if on a  mountain, to be the piercer.
3. For him the fearsome, much to be admired, assemble with homage  (everything) here at the rite, o (you,) lovely like Dawn—
(for him) whose Indrian name has been made a light, a foundation for  fame, like tawny mares for coursing.
4. Here we are—those of yours, o much-praised Indra, who carry on,  having seized hold of you, o you providing outstanding goods,
for none other than you bears up to our songs, o you who long for songs.  Gladly receive this speech of ours like war-cries.
5. Abundant is your heroism, o Indra. We are yours: fulfill the desire of this  singer, o bounteous one.
Lofty heaven measures itself against your heroism, and this earth bends  to your power.
6. You, Indra, cut that great, wide mountain apart joint by joint with your  mace, o mace-wielder.
You released the confined waters to flow. You acquired all strength
exclusively and entirely.174 I.58
The next seven hymns (I.58–64) are attributed to Nodhas Gautama. His Indra  hymns (I.61–63) are especially notable for their verbal agility.
## 58 Agni
Nodhas Gautama
9 verses: jagatī 1–5, triṣṭubh 6–9
Although Nodhas Gautama’s poetic intricacy is not as much on display in his Agni  hymns as in his Indra hymns, he excels here in his vivid and dense depiction of  physical fire, especially the forest fire. In the jagatī portion of the hymn, verses con cerning ritual fire (1, 3) alternate with evocations of the unchecked passage of fire  in the woods (2, 4–5), while the final four verses (6–9), in triṣṭubh, are only about  the ritual fire. The ritual verses focus on the choosing and installation of Agni as  Hotar (vss. 1, 3, 6–7), especially in its first enactment by the gods and the human  ancestors (see esp. vss. 3, 6).
The counterpoint between wild uncontrollable fire and ritual fire may subtly  emphasize what a feat of civilizing was accomplished by taming fire for sacrificial  (and domestic) purposes in the legendary past, and how this feat is repeated in the  present day. The last two verses (8–9) beg Agni for shelter and protection for us,  the singers. Again, the image of a guardian fire may acquire special intensity by  contrast with the potentially destructive fire in the wild.
1. Never is the immortal one, born of strength, forced down. When he  became Hotar, messenger of Vivasvant,
he measured across the airy realm along the paths that lead straightest  to the goal. In service to the gods he entices them here with the
oblation.
2. The unaging one, drawing his own food toward him, thirstily eager to  eat, keeps to the thickets.
His back when he is sprinkled shines like a steed; thundering like the  spine of heaven, he has roared.
3. He was placed in front successfully by the Rudras and the Vasus, set  down as Hotar, the immortal who conquers wealth,
like a chariot steering straight among the clans descended from Āyu. The  god discloses valuables in due order.
4. Sped by the wind, he spreads himself out among the thickets at will, with  his tongues as sickle, powerfully noisy.
When, Agni, thirstily you rush like a bull upon the woods, black is your  course, o unaging one with gleaming waves.
5. With scorching fangs, spurred by the wind he gusts down upon the wood,  like a victorious buffalo upon the herd, advancing upon the imperishable airy realm in his full dimension. The  still and the moving fear, and also the winged ones.
6. The Bhr̥gus installed you among the sons of Manu, dear like wealth, easy  to invoke for the peoples,
as Hotar, o Agni, a guest worthy to be chosen, favorable like an ally to  the divine race.
7. Whom the seven tongues, whom the cantors choose as Hotar, best  sacrificing at the ceremonies,
to Agni, the nave of all goods, I render service with a pleasurable
offering. I beg for a treasure.
8. O son of strength with the might of Mitra, today hold out unbroken  shelters to us, your praisers.
O Agni, child of nourishment, deliver the singer from narrow straits,  with your metal strongholds.
9. Become a defense for the singer, o radiant one. Become shelter for  bounteous ones, o bounteous one.
Deliver the singer from narrow straits, Agni. – Early in the
morning—soon—he should come, bringing goods through (his)
insight.
## 59 (Agni) Vaiśvānara
Nodhas Gautama
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Agni in his aspect as Vaiśvānara (“belonging to all men”) is the dedicand of this  hymn, and the epithet Vaiśvānara occurs once in every verse. The universality of  Agni is emphasized throughout. The first and last verses have contrastive víśva (“all”) expressions:  “all the immortals” in 1b contrasting with “belonging to all  (human) communities” in 7a. The first two verses situate him as cosmically central,  between gods and men and heaven and earth, while in verse 3 he is the center that  attracts everything else within him. A different kind of universality is asserted in  verses 5–6, where the signature deeds of Indra are attributed to Agni and he is  called by Indra’s standard epithet, “Vr̥tra-smasher.” This rhetorical ploy makes him  the equivalent of the most powerful of the gods, hence in some sense the embodi
ment of divinity itself.
The hymn also shows an omphalos structure. The outer ring (vss. 1 and  7) noted above, as well as an inner ring defined by the identification of Agni as  king (vss. 3 and 5), point to the middle verse 4 as omphalos. And in a hymn of  reasonably straightforward syntax and imagery, verse 4 does stand out for its rel
ative obscurity. Why this verse should be freighted with the message of the hymn
176 I.59
is not entirely clear, but it brings together the cosmic (the two world-halves) with  the human, in the form of the sacrifice, where the Hotar offers hymns to Agni,  who himself regularly serves as Hotar (see, e.g., the preceding hymn I.58). Thus  the centrality of Agni for both the cosmos and the mundane world is affirmed in  this, the central verse of the hymn, as is the interpenetration of Agni’s twofold  nature as an element of the cosmos (the son of Heaven and Earth, possessed of  the sun) and as a participating member of human society (the Hotar, recipient  of hymns).
It is worthy of note that, in contrast to the last hymn (I.58) with its graphic  depiction of actual fire, this hymn contains almost no mention of Agni’s physical  qualities.
1. The other fires are just twigs of you, Agni. In you do all the immortals  bring themselves to euphoria.
Vaiśvānara, you are the navel of the settlements. Like a pillar, as prop  you hold the peoples fast.
2. The head of heaven, the navel of the earth is Agni. And he became the  spoked wheel of the two world-halves.
You did the gods beget as god, Vaiśvānara, as light just for the Ārya  (people).
3. Like the rays (placed) firm in the sun, in Vaiśvānara, in Agni have goods  been placed—
those that are in the mountains, in the plants, in the waters, that are  among men—of (all) this you are king.
4. Like the two lofty world-halves for their son [=Agni], like Manu’s skill,  the human Hotar (brings) hymns—
many (hymns), (like) exuberant maidens—for him possessed of
the sun, him whose bluster is real, for the most manly
Vaiśvānara.
5. Even beyond lofty heaven does your greatness project, o Jātavedas  Vaiśvānara.
You are king of the communities belonging to the sons of Manu.
Through combat you made a wide realm for the gods.
6. I now proclaim the greatness of the bull, whom the Pūrus attend upon as  Vr̥tra-smasher.
Vaiśvānara, Agni, having smashed the Dasyu, shook the wooden
barriers, cut down Śambara.
7. Vaiśvānara, belonging to all communities by his greatness, worthy of the  sacrifice among the Bharadvājas, far-radiant,
Agni, displaying liberality, at the (place of) Śātavaneya of many
stratagems, is awakened with hundredfold (riches).
## 60 Agni
Nodhas Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Two double aspects of Agni, touched on in the two previous Agni hymns by Nodhas  Gautama, are united in this brief hymn. On the one hand, Agni’s primal installation  in the sacrifice by the ancestors of humankind is contrasted with his regular re-instal lation by the current sacrificers (see esp. vs. 2ab, but also throughout). In fact, the orig inal theft of fire from heaven by Mātariśvan, who bestowed it on the legendary Bhr̥gu,  ends the first verse. In several places (2c, 3d, 4b, 4d) it is not possible to determine  from the verb form whether the poet is referring to the distant and legendary past or  the recent past of the current ritual, though unfortunately English imposes the choice.  The aorist forms in question often refer to the immediate past, and so we have trans lated them (“has been set down,” etc.), but an unmarked past (“was set down,” etc.)  is far from excluded. It is quite likely that the poet wished to leave the question open.
The other double aspect treated is Agni’s dual role in the sacrifice: he both acts  as priest and is the object of ritual activity by human priests. See especially verse  2b, where the Uśij (“fire-priests”) present oblations to him, and 4a, where Agni is  identified as an Uśij (as well as a Hotar, in 4b).
1. Glorious conveyor and beacon of the rite, pursuing (his ritual duties)  well, the messenger who immediately (reaches) his goal,
of double birth, celebrated like wealth—Mātariśvan brought him as a  gift to Bhr̥gu.
2. His command do both sides follow in presenting their oblations: his  (ancient) fire-priests and mortals (now).
He has been set down as Hotar even in front of heaven, as clan-lord  worthy of the asking, the ritual adept among the clans.
3. Ever newer acclaim from us, from our heart, should reach him as he is  being born, the honey-tongued one,
whom the sons of Manu who sacrifice regularly in ritual community,  who dispense ritual delight, the Āyus, have begotten.
4. Himself a fire-priest, pure and good, he has been installed among the  clans of the sons of Manu as the Hotar worthy to be chosen.
As domestic ally, house-lord in the home, Agni has became wealth-lord  of wealth.
5. It is you, Agni, that we Gotamas celebrate with our thoughts as lord of  wealth,
grooming you like a swift, prize-bearing (horse). – Early in the
morning—soon—he should come, bringing goods through (his)
insight.
178 I.61
## 61 Indra
Nodhas Gautama
16 verses: triṣṭubh
The three Indra hymns by Nodhas share a ritual context: judging from their last  verses (I.61.16, 62.13, 63.9) they were all composed to accompany the Hāriyojana  (“Fallow-bay-yoking”) oblation, when Indra’s pair of horses is yoked up for the  god’s return journey to heaven after the sacrifice is complete. The parts of these  hymns before the final verse do not seem to reflect this ritual moment, and the three  hymns are quite different, though they all display Nodhas’s remarkable poetic skill.
This first hymn, I.61, is a masterpiece of intricate structure and verbal trickery.  We will summarize the main points here, but for more detailed treatment see the  lengthy discussion in Jamison (2007: 60–68). The most obvious structural device is  the fronted repetition of a deictic pronoun: each of the sixteen verses except the last  (which is an extra-hymnic summary verse) begins with either the dative asmaí “for  him” or the genitive asyá “of him,” followed by two emphasizing particles, always  referring to Indra (except in vs. 12—see below). The dative sequence is the more  common and frames the hymn (vss. 1–6, 8, 12, 15); the genitive sequence is found  primarily in the center of the hymn (vss. 7, 9–11, 13–14).
This rigid structural device both parallels and counterpoints the semantic  structure of the hymn. In general in this hymn the dative verses express the ritual  here-and-now, with the production and presentation of hymns and ritual offer ings “to/for just this one,” while the genitive verses concern Indra’s great deeds.  Especially in the dative verses numerous co-referential adjectival datives reinforce  the fronted pronoun, as well as strategically placed dative tokens of the god’s name.  Curiously, in the genitive verses the genitive several times (vss. 7, 10, 11) seems to  have quite a loose syntactic connection to the rest of the sentence, and Indra may  appear in another case in the same verse, as in
I.61.10ab asyéd evá śávasā śuṣántaṃ, ví vr̥ścad vájreṇa vr̥trám índraḥ
Of just this one [gen.]—in (his) expansion Indra [nom.] hewed apart  snorting Vr̥tra with his mace.
But what may appear superficially to be clumsy composition serves a larger  structural purpose:  it seems that the logical structure of the hymn requires a  two-way opposition, between dative asmaí and something else: the something else  is genitive asyá even when a different case form might have been more appropriate,  for a variety of other cases would have obscured the bipartite contrastive structure  of the hymn. Here we see an example of clausal morphosyntax subordinated to and  indeed distorted by the imposition of a larger literary and rhetorical pattern.
The poet Nodhas also lays a few traps for us by playing on the expectations he  has created. Most notable of them is verse 12, which begins with the dative asmaí and therefore appears to return us from the mythological past to the realm of the  current-day poet of verses 1–5, an expectation reinforced by the verb prá bharā, a standard lexeme for presenting a hymn to a divinity. But the phrase in verse 12  quickly goes awry. At the opening of the next pāda, where Indra’s name has been  prominently placed in previous verses (índrāya 1d, 4d, 5b, 8b), we find, most shock ingly, the name of his arch-enemy, vr̥trā́ya, immediately followed by the accusative  object vájram, Indra’s weapon, not the word for hymn we were expecting. The poet  has simply tricked us, having laid a trap with conventional phraseology and syntax  and with the stylistic patterns established earlier in the hymn. He also skillfully  exploits the morphological ambiguity of the verb form bharā: given the pattern set  in verses 1–5 we are primed to interpret bharā as a 1st sg. subjunctive (“I shall pres
ent”), but as the half verse unfolds, it becomes clear that bharā must rather be taken  as a metrically lengthened 2nd singular imperative (“bear down!”).
The meter of this hymn is often irregular, with a number of ten-syllable lines,  but again this irregularity should not be taken as a sign of poor poetic technique.  Rather the hymn seems to be phrase-driven rather than meter-driven, and the metri cal rests that result from “missing syllables” serve to isolate and emphasize crucial  nominal phrases—an effect also heightened by the copious examples of alliteration.
With all the poetic fireworks on display the actual contents of the hymn may  seem almost beside the point, but we will provide a brief sketch. The first five verses  (“dative verses”) are variations on a theme: the poet’s verbal offerings to Indra. The  sixth verse, also a dative verse, modulates to the distant past and the god Tvaṣṭar’s gift  of the newly fashioned mace to Indra. Verse 7 combines two rare Indra myths: his  appropriation of his father’s soma right after his birth and the Emuṣa myth, in which  the god Viṣṇu steals a mess of rice porridge while Indra shoots the boar Emuṣa.  (For further on this myth, see Introduction, p. 40.) Verses 8–12 treat the Vr̥tra myth  for the most part, though with some detours. Verses 13–15 generalize the praise of  Indra’s deeds and bring it back to the present time and to the present poet, Nodhas,  who names himself in verse 14, while the final verse, 16, summarizes the hymn that  precedes and names the ritual application, the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.
It is difficult to do justice to this tour de force of poetic craft, and many of its  finest effects have not been discussed here. It is, unfortunately, even more difficult to  do justice to it in English translation.
1. Just for this one, powerful, precipitous, mighty, do I bring forward praise  like a pleasurable offering—
for the one equal to song, not poor, (do I bring) a laud—for Indra (I  bring) sacred formulations best bestowed.
2. Just to this one I have held it out like a pleasurable offering. I bring out a  song; I thrust it out with a good twist
to Indra, with heart, with mind, with inspired thought. For the
primordial lord the insights groom themselves.
3. Just to this one this utmost sun-winning song do I bring with
my mouth,
to strengthen the most munificent patron with the invitations of my  thoughts, with their good twists.
180 I.61
4. Just for this one I put together praise—like a carpenter a chariot for the  one whose gear it is—
and hymns with a good twist for the one whose vehicle is hymns—for  wise Indra (praise) that sets everything in motion.
5. Just for this one, for Indra, do I anoint the chant with my tongue [/the  offering ladle], as one anoints a team when seeking fame—
to extol the hero accustomed to giving [/gifts], the splitter of
strongholds whose fame is sung.
6. Just for this one Tvaṣṭar fashioned the mace of best workmanship, the  reverberating one, for battle [/for joy],
with which he found the mortal spot of that very Vr̥tra, as, gaining  mastery, he thrust with the thrusting (mace), while conferring (who  knows) how much.
7. Just this one—he, having already drunk in an instant the nourishment  of his great (father), the pleasing foods at his mother’s
soma-pressings—
while Viṣṇu the stronger stole the cooked (rice-porridge), he pierced the  boar through the stone, (Indra) the archer.
8. Just for this one, for Indra, even the ladies, the Wives of the Gods, wove  a chant at the Vr̥tra-smashing.
He held encircled broad heaven and earth; they did not encompass his  greatness.
9. Just this one—his greatness projected beyond heaven and earth, beyond  the midspace.
Sovereign king, Indra, sung by all in the house, a reverberant tankard,  waxed strong for battle [/for joy].
10. Just this one—with his swelling strength Indra hewed apart snorting  Vr̥tra with his mace.
The streams, pent up like cows, he released toward fame, of one mind  (with them), for giving.
11. Just this one—the rivers with their glittering came to rest when he held  them encircled with his mace.
Performing the master’s part, showing favor to the pious man, the  victorious one made a ford for Turvīti.
12. Toward just this one, toward Vr̥tra, bear down the mace, thrusting,  gaining mastery, conferring (who knows) how much.
Scrape through him crosswise as if through the joints of a cow,  dispatching the floods of waters to wander.
13. Of just this one, the precipitous—proclaim his former deeds anew with  solemn words,
when, propelling his own weapons to battle, showing his mettle, he  dissolves his rivals. 14. Just this one—in fear of his birth both the firmly fixed mountains and  heaven and earth thrust against each.
Constantly calling upon him [=Indra], who is a (protective) arm for  the seeker, in an instant Nodhas [=the poet] will be (there) for his
[=Indra’s] (next?) manly deed.
15. Just to this one has this (soma-drinking?) been conceded by them  [=gods], since he alone won (it?), becoming master of much.
Indra aided Etaśa, who was contending for the sun; he will aid the
soma-presser contending for good horses.
16. Thus have the Gotamas made you sacred formulations for the
“Fallow-bay-yoking” (oblation), with a good twist, o Indra.
Do you confer on them an insight with all its ornaments. – Early in  the morning—soon—he should come bringing goods through his
insight.
## 62 Indra
Nodhas Gautama
13 verses: triṣṭubh
The poetic ingenuity of Nodhas is also on display in this hymn, though in some what different ways from his tricks in I.61. The hymn is full of phonetic play and  alliteration, with numerous somewhat aberrant morphological forms generated  for this play. Repetition and variation on this repetition are also conspicuous—for  example, the word sanā́t (“from of old”) opening 8a, 10a, 12a, with teasingly close  forms (sánemi 9a, sánīḍā 10a) alternating with it.
The hymn falls into two main sections. The first five verses are the more conven tional—if poetically rich—part, treating the Vala myth and especially the role of  the Aṅgirases in it. (Interestingly, the Vala myth is absent from I.61.) The first half  of verse 6 seems to summarize this deed of Indra’s extravagantly: “This is his most  conspicuous deed, the dearest wonder of the wondrous one.” But Nodhas tricks us  here, for the second half of the verse concerns an entirely different and much more  obscure deed of Indra’s, the swelling of the four, probably celestial, rivers. From 6cd  through verse 10 we meet fleetingly recounted fragments of other myths, but these  myths seem connected at a structural level, since they involve female figures in pairs  or groups working reciprocally or jointly: the rivers of 6cd, the two world-halves of 7  (compared to twin consorts), Night and Dawn (compared to young girls) in 8, black  and red cows in 9, and streams again in 10, apparently returning to the rivers of 6cd.  In the second half of 10 we encounter a surfeit of females: two words for wives (jáni and pátnī) as well as sisters, all offering friendship to Indra. These females may refer  to the streams of the first half of the verse, or to the thoughts converging on Indra  in the next verse (11), which are also compared to wives. Most likely the reference in
182 I.62
10cd is double, providing a transition from the cosmic mythological realm in verses  6–10 to the ritual here-and-now of verses 11–13. The hymn ends, like I.61, with a  verse (13) specifically applicable to the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, and like I.61  (vss. 14 and 16) mentions both the poet Nodhas and his clan, the Gotamas.
1. We think up a fortifying song for the forceful one who longs for hymns,  just as the Aṅgirases did.
A chant with the good twists of a praiser we chant to the one worthy of  chant, to the widely famed superior man.
2. Present your great reverence to the great one, a songful melody to the  forceful one,
with which our forefathers, the Aṅgirases, knowing the track [/word],  chanting, found the cows.
3. At the desire of Indra and the Aṅgirases, Saramā found the wellspring  for posterity.
Br̥haspati: he split the rock; he found the cows. The superior men
bellowed together with the ruddy (cows).
4. He with (his flock) of good rhythm, he with rhythm, with the seven  inspired poets, with the Navagvas, he, the resounding one, with sound  (split) the rock.
With the hastening ones, o able Indra, you cleft the bolt, with a roar you  cleft Vala with the Daśagvas.
5. Being hymned by the Aṅgirases, o wondrous one, you uncovered the  blinding darkness [/soma stalk] along with the dawn, with the sun,
with the cows.
You spread out the back of the earth, Indra; you propped up the nearer  realm of heaven.
6. This is his most conspicuous deed, the dearest wonder of the
wondrous one,
that he made the four nearer (celestial?) rivers with their honeyed floods  swell in their eddying.
7. Another time, with his chants that were being sung, the irrepressible  one uncovered the age-old pair belonging to the same nest [=the two  worlds].
As Bhaga [/a (good) portion] (supports) his two consorts, he of very  wondrous power supported the two world-halves in farthest heaven.
8. From of old the two young girls of distinct forms, (ever) regenerating,  (go) around heaven and earth along their own courses—
Night with her black, Dawn with her gleaming white shapes progress one  after the other.
9. Possessing very wondrous power, doing good work, the son with his  strength supported the partnership to its full extent.
You placed the “cooked” (milk) even within the “raw” (cows), the
gleaming white milk in the black and in the red (cows). 10. From of old the streams coming from the same nest, unquenchable and  immortal, guard their commandments with their powers.
For many thousands (of aeons?), like lady wives, the sisters [=streams?  thoughts?] offer friendship to the unabashed one.
11. The age-old thoughts, with reverence, with chants, seeking goods, have  run anew (to you), wondrous one.
Like eager wives their eager husband, the inspired thoughts caress you,  you strong one.
12. Though (originating) from of old, the riches in your hand do not  become exhausted, nor do they give out, wondrous one.
You are brilliant, Indra, you are resolute and insightful. Do your best  for us with your abilities, able one.
13. For the age-old “Fallow-bay-yoking” (oblation) Gotama has fashioned  a newer sacred formulation, Indra—
Nodhas (has fashioned it) for us for good guidance, o forceful one. –  Early in the morning—soon—he should come, bringing goods
through his insight.
## 63 Indra
Nodhas Gautama
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The fondness of Nodhas for initial repetition is on display in this hymn, where  almost every verse begins with t(u)vám “you,” with a distracted vocative ind(a)ra positioned after an early caesura. The hymn lacks the verbal intricacy of the last  two (I.61–62), though it is full of philological problems.
The tone of the hymn also differs from the two previous ones: it is far more  martial and concerned with Indra’s fearsome power. His aggressive power, even just  after birth, is highlighted in verse 1, and the following verses quickly allude to the  destruction of various foes, usually for the benefit of one of his clients (e.g., Kutsa,  vs. 3) or for mortals in general. Like the last two hymns, this one ends with a sum
mary verse applicable to the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.
1. You are great, Indra, you who, on just being born, with your tempests  put heaven and earth in (the path of your) onslaught,
so that all the vast masses, even the mountains, though firmly fixed,  stirred like dust-motes in fear of you.
2. When, Indra, you pursued hither your two fallow bays who follow  separate commandments, the singer placed the mace in your two arms, with which, o you whose resolve is not to be deflected, you dispatch the  foes and their many strongholds, o much invoked one.184 I.64
3. You are trusty, Indra, and bold against them. You are master of the  R̥bhus, favorable to men; you are victorious.
You smashed Śuṣṇa in his (war-)band, when strengthening nourishment  and the axle-pin (were at stake), for the young, heaven-bright Kutsa,  in partnership.
4. You then, Indra, as partner provided the spur, when you knotted up  Vr̥tra, you mace-bearer of bullish deeds,
when, you champion of bullish mind, you cut apart the Dasyus in their  womb far away, as one who is victorious at will.
5. You then, Indra, intending no harm to mortals, in your displeasure (you  opened up the doors) even of the stronghold,
opened the barriers for the steed (that comes) from us. As if with a
deadly weapon, mace-bearer, pierce the foes.
6. On you then, Indra, the superior men call, at the winning of the flood, in  the contest whose prize is the sun.
This help of yours here in the clash when prizes (are at stake), o
autonomous one, has become something unshakeable.
7. You then, mace-bearing Indra, attacking, split seven fortifications for  Purukutsa, one after the other.
When at will you twisted them like ritual grass for Sudās, o king, from  narrowness you made wide space for Pūru.
8. You, god Indra, will make this bright refreshment swell for us as waters  do in their circling,
the refreshment with which, o champion, you will extend yourself
toward us like nourishment to flow everywhere.
9. (This hymn) has been made for you, Indra, by the Gotamas; sacred  formulations have been spoken with reverence to your two fallow bay  horses.
Bring a well-ornamented prize here to us. – Early in the morning—
soon—he should come, bringing goods through his insight.
## 64 Maruts
Nodhas Gautama
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15
Exuberant in language and crammed with vivid description, this hymn treats the  usual Marut themes. The poet begins by exhorting himself to produce a worthy  and well-crafted hymn for these gods (vs. 1), and proceeds to do just that. Verses  2–4 describe the Maruts’ birth and beauty, while verses 5–8 turn to their role in  the thunderstorm, with comparisons to various wild animals found in verses 7–8.  Verse 9 is a pun on the word ródasī, which in the first half of the verse is in the dual number and refers to the two world-halves, while in the second half it must refer to  the goddess Rodasī (usually differently accented rodasī́), the regular consort of the  Maruts. (For the same pun, see I.167.4, also in a Marut hymn.) Further description  of their boisterous behavior occupies verses 10–11.
In verse 12 the poet returns to the beginning, by referring to the hymn “we” are  offering to the Maruts. Reestablishing the relationship between the mortal worship ers and the Maruts allows him to make the transition to the boons we ask of them.  After providing a model of the fortunate man who receives the Maruts’ aid in verse  13, the poet calls on the gods to grant good things to the patrons and the worshipers  in general (vss. 14–15).
1. To the bullish troop, good battlers and ritual adepts, present a
well-turned (hymn), o Nodhas—to the Maruts.
As one clever in mind and with dexterous hands ornaments his work,  I ornament the hymns standing ready at the rites.
2. They were born as the lofty bulls of heaven, the young bloods of Rudra,  lordly, unblemished,
pure white, blazing like suns, like consummate warriors with their drops  as banners, of frightful form.
3. The young unaging Rudras, who smite the miser though themselves not  poor, have grown strong like mountains.
All earthly creations, even the firm ones, do they stir up, and the
heavenly ones as well, by their might.
4. With bright unguents they anoint themselves for wonder; on their breasts  they arrange brilliants for beauty.
On their shoulders spears have rubbed. They were born all at once by  their own power, the men of heaven.
5. Performing the master’s part, the boisterous ones who care for the  stranger have produced winds and lightning flashes with their powers. The shakers milk the udder for heavenly (goods [=rain]). Swirling they  swell the earth with milk.
6. The Maruts of good drops swell the waters, the ghee-rich milk, as they  stand ready at the rites.
They lead (their horse) out to piss like a prize-seeking steed. They milk  the thundering, imperishable well-spring.
7. Buffalos, masters of artifice, of bright radiance, self-powerful like  mountains yet quick streaming,
like wild elephants you chew up the woods, when you have yoked your  own powers to those of your ruddy (horses).
8. Like lions the discerning ones keep roaring, beautifully marked like  mottled (deer), granting all possessions.
Animating the nights, urgently they (join) together with their dappled  (mares), with their spears—those who have a snake’s fury in their
strength.
186 I.64
9. Salute the two world-halves [=ródasī], you who are splendor in a flock,  who accompany the superior man [=Indra], champions with a
snake’s fury in your strength.
She [=Rodasī], like lightning lovely to look at, has mounted your
chariot like the ensign on chariot boxes, o Maruts.
10. Granting all possessions, at home with riches, linked with powers,  copious,
the archers have taken their arrows in their fists, the superior men of  endless tempests and bullish bangles.
11. With their golden wheel-rims the milk-strong ones keep pounding the  mountains like wayfarers (pounding the road with their feet)—
unruly battlers, self-propelling, stirring (even) the fixed, acting
headstrong, the Maruts with their glinting spears.
12. The ardent, pure, winning, unbounded offspring of Rudra do we hymn  with an invocation.
The space-traversing, powerful Marut flock, possessing the silvery
drink, bullish—follow it for splendor.
13. That mortal has now stood out beyond the people in strength by your  aid—the one whom you helped, Maruts.
He bears away the prize for himself with his steeds, bears away the
stakes with his men, bears resolve worthy of the asking. He dwells
peacefully; he thrives.
14. O Maruts, confer on the bounteous (patrons) brilliant bluster ever to be  celebrated, difficult to overcome in battles,
gaining the stakes, worthy of hymns, governing all domains. May we  thrive in life and lineage for a hundred winters.
15. Now, Maruts, confer on us durable wealth consisting of heroes,  victorious in the clash,
swelling in hundreds and thousands. – Early in the morning—soon—he  should come, rich through (his) insight.
The next nine hymns (I.65–73) are ascribed to Parāśara Śāktya and are dedicated  only to Agni. The first six (65–70) are in the relatively rare dvipadā virāj meter, while  the last three are in triṣṭubh. Despite the difference in meter, there is a strong sense  of unity in this group of hymns, in phraseology, in style, and in theme. Moreover,  somewhat in Vālakhilya fashion there are several paired hymns, especially I.65–66  and I.68–69 (with I.70 acting as a climatic third to that pairing).
The most important theme running through the series is Agni’s function as  the locus and target of joint action undertaken by men and by gods, and as  the representative of the unity thus produced. In this capacity for mortals he is  named the Vaiśvānara fire (“fire belonging to all men”—for another, nearby Agni  Vaiśvānara hymn see I.59), and the series I.68–70 contains an extended pun on the constituents of this epithet. In the divine realm the joint action of the gods is  represented by the Tānūnaptra rite and its foundation myth, treated in I.72 (see  Proferes 2007: 51–61). These complementary aspects of Agni are not restricted  to the hymns just named, but surface throughout this series, which thus shows a  rare thematic unity.
## 65 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: dvipadā virāj
As is generally the case with dvipadā virāj meter, the hymn falls into two-verse units,  essentially equivalent to a single trimeter verse (forty syllables, versus forty-four  [triṣṭubh] or forty-eight [jagatī]). The five-syllable units in which the verses are orga nized lend themselves to brief, discrete semantic and syntactic units, producing a  mosaic-like effect. In this hymn, as in the following one, the mosaic fragments are  often similes—especially pronounced here in the middle verses 5–6, though found  throughout. Each simile highlights a particular aspect of Agni.
The hymn also follows a ritual and mythological trajectory. It begins with the  hidden Agni (vs. 1), alluding in mythological terms to the well-known story of  Agni’s flight and rediscovery by the gods, which is treated in verses 2–3, but also, in  ritual terms, to the fire hidden in the wood before kindling. This kindling is accom
plished by the end of the hymn, where Agni spreads through the firewood and  awakens at dawn, conspicuous and visible from afar (vss. 7–10). The relationship of  Agni to waters, in his identity as Apām Napāt, is another theme in the hymn (vss.  4–7, 9), though the epithet Apām Napāt is not mentioned.
1. Hiding in secret like a thief with livestock,
yoking homage, conveying homage:
2. (You) did the clever, of one accord, follow along your tracks;
all those worthy of the sacrifice reverently approached you.
3. The gods followed the commandments of truth.
Like heaven (enclosing) the earth was his enclosing.
4. With wonder the waters strengthen the lovely child,
well-begotten in the lap of truth, in its womb.
5. Like thriving that brings delight, like a broad (place of) peaceful dwelling, like a mountain a source of benefit, like a gush (of water) that brings  blessings;
6. Like a steed on its course, launched in a surge,
like a river (sending) its gush: who can obstruct him?
7. Akin to the rivers, like a brother to his sisters,
(yet,) like a king his vassals, he devours the wood.
188 I.66
8. When, sped by the wind, he has spread out through the wood,
Agni cuts the hair of the earth.
9. He hisses like a wild goose sitting in the waters;
awakening at dawn, he is the most conspicuous to the clans by his
intention.
10. Like soma, a ritual expert, begotten of truth;
ranging widely like livestock with their young, far-radiant.

Like the previous hymn, this one is constructed of short phrases often consisting  of similes. The similes here alternate between images of peace and prosperity and  those of turbulent combat, sometimes strikingly juxtaposed, as in the second half  of verse 3 or the contrasting halves of verse 4.
Toward the end of the hymn we find several puzzles, which have elicited widely  differing interpretations—especially verse 8 with its double mention of twins  (yamá). In our view the end of the hymn builds toward a ritual climax, found in  the final two verses of the hymn (9–10), and verse 8 sets the stage for this, the  early-morning sacrifice, by mentioning the risen sun as the twin already born and  the soma, not yet pressed, as the twin awaiting birth—both also identified with  Agni. Although these identifications would break the pattern of constant refer
ence to Agni set in the earlier parts of the hymn (and our interpretation therefore  gives us pause), the final pair of verses also move beyond the stasis of repeated  Agni-similes and depict a ritual moment, prefigured, in our view, by the mention of  other ritual entities in verse 8.
Note the ring-compositional element, the “sight of the sun,” in the first half of  verse 1 and the last words of verse 10. This double mention may support our inter pretation of verse 8 as mentioning the risen sun.
1. Glittering like wealth, like the sight of the sun,
like life-breath, like one’s own son;
2. Like a swooping (bird), ever restless, he clings to the wood;
like a milk-cow (yielding) milk, (he is) blazing and widely radiant.
3. Delightful like a home, he maintains peace;
ripe like grain, a conqueror of peoples.
4. Having rhythm like a seer, lauded among the clans;
well treated like a winning horse, he confers vitality.
5. Whose blaze is beyond domestication like one’s own will;
like a wife in the lap, enough for anyone. 6. When, glittering, he has flashed like a white (horse) among the clans, like a brilliant chariot (he is) dazzling in combats.
7. Set loose like an army, he initiates an onslaught,
like the arrow of an archer with its dazzling point.
8. (The one) twin [=Sun?] has been born, (the other) twin [=Soma?] is  what is to be born:
(the one [=Sun]) is the lover of girls [=Dawns?]; (the other [=Soma]) the  husband of women [=cows’ (milk)?].
9. With our movable (goods [=livestock]) and with our settled
household, we,
like cows (going) home, approach him, on your behalf, when he has  been kindled.
10. Like a river its gush, he has sent forth those [=butter offerings?] heading  downward.
The cows cry out upon seeing the sun.

10 verses: dvipadā virāj
Although this hymn contains several similes (see vss. 1, 2, 5, 10), the simile is not the  organizing principle of the hymn, unlike I.65–66, and metaphors and personifica tions share the stage with formally marked similes.
Agni’s disappearance and hiding (vss. 3, 6–7) and his discovery by the gods  (vss. 3–4), and by implication by pious mortals (vss. 7–8), provide the mythologi cal theme of the hymn. The physical counterpart to this mythic concealment is the  immanence of fire in wood, in plants, and in water, mentioned at the beginning (vs.  1) and end (vss. 9–10) of the hymn. For similar themes, see I.65.
1. A conqueror amid the wood, an ally among mortals;
like a king he demands obedience without fail.
2. Like peace that brings prosperity, like good resolve;
he has become the very attentive Hotar who carries the oblations.
3. Taking in his hand all manly powers,
sitting down in secret, he sets the gods in (the path of) his onslaught. 4. The superior men, producing insights, find him here,
when they have recited mantras fashioned by the heart.
5. Like Aja (Ekapad) he supports the broad earth;
he props up heaven with mantras that come true.
6. Protect the dear tracks of the livestock.
During your whole lifetime, Agni, you go from hiding place to
hiding place.
190 I.68
7. He who perceives him gone into hiding,
and who has taken his seat at the stream of truth—
8. Those who unbind (the fetters of deceit?), serving truths —
for him, because of this, he [=Agni] has proclaimed good things.
9. He who [=Agni]—along with his offspring—sprouts greatly
in the sprouts and within the fruitful (plants),
10. (He is) the bright apparition in the house of the waters through his  whole lifetime.
Like clever men an abode, the wise have made a seat (for him), having  measured it out completely.
## 68 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: dvipadā virāj
Breaking the pattern of Parāśara’s previous dvipadā virāj hymns (I.65–67), this one  contains only a single, conventional simile (vs. 9). Its focus is instead on ritual, and  especially on the joint activity performed by “all” in their separate ways and the  rewards they share because of it (see esp. vss. 3, 4, 5, 8, 9). Although the identity of  the “all” is never made explicit, we believe that the poet is depicting the communal  fire shared and jointly tended by the united clans, and that the “all” (víśve) are the  members of the separate clans serving their shared fire (the Vaiśvānara fire [see  Proferes 2007: 46–49 and passim]). In fact, in reading this hymn with its twin, I.69,  the motif of the Vaiśvānara fire emerges strongly. In this hymn the focus is on víśva “all,” in the next hymn on náraḥ “(superior) men,” while at the end of I.70 the two  words are found sequentially (vss. 9–10). These are exactly the two elements found  in the vr̥ddhi bahuvrīhi compound vaiśvānará “belonging to all men,” the very name  of the shared clan fire, a word that never appears in this hymn sequence. Thus, I.68– 70 contain a buried but persistent pun, with one half of the compound allotted to  each of the first two hymns until they are reunited in the third. The phonological  resemblance between víśva “all” and víś “clan” is also in play, though the two words  are etymologically unrelated.
1. Bringing (the sacrifice) to readiness, bustling about, he approaches heaven. He discloses the still and the moving through the nights,
2. When, alone of all these gods,
the god encompasses (them) by his greatness.
3. All take pleasure in your resolve because of this:
that you are born alive from the desiccated (wood), o god.
4. All have a share in divinity and in its name,
as they serve immortal truth in their own ways. 5. The promptings of truth, the vision of truth—
all have performed their tasks lifelong.
6. Whoever will do ritual service to you or who will do his best for you, to him distribute wealth as the attentive one.
7. As the Hotar, he has taken his seat among the progeny of Manu. Just he is now the lord of these (offspring/clans? and) of riches.
8. They seek the seed mutually among themselves;
no fools—they act in unison, each according to his own skill.
9. They take pleasure in his resolve like sons in their father’s—
the powerful ones who obey his command.
10. Bringing much livestock, he has opened wide the doors of wealth. He, the master of the house, has emblazoned heaven’s vault with stars.
## 69 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: dvipadā virāj
Twinned with the preceding hymn (I.68), this hymn also treats the common clan-fire,  which serves as a symbol of unity during joint action undertaken by ordinarily sepa rate groups, although this theme is subtly conveyed. In the first few verses there are  only indirect hints: Agni “encompasses” an unspecified set of objects (vs. 2); in verse  4 he takes his place “in the middle” and is compared to a “friendly __ among the  people”—parallel passages suggest that “ally” should be supplied in this last phrase.
The clans are mentioned explicitly in verse 5, which describes Agni’s extension  through the clans, who are brought together, along with their superior men, in the  next verse (6). As already noted in the introduction to I.68, these men, the náraḥ,  supply the second part of the name of the clan-fire, Vaiśvānara. Agni’s reciprocal  relationship and joint action with these men are described in verses 7–8, and, in  our view, verse 9 describes the brilliance of the newly kindled clan-fire, which is  the focus of the shared sacrificial activity of the united clans. This interpretation is  supported by an adjective qualifying Agni in that verse: sáṃjñāta-rūpa. Although  most translators take this word as meaning “having a well-known form” on the  basis of the verbal root √jñā “recognize,” the idiom sáṃ-jñā has a different and very  specific meaning “come to an agreement, act in unison.” This very idiom is found in  the previous, twinned hymn, in verse 8, where it describes the mutual action of all  the clans, each contributing its own set of skills. Therefore in verse 9 of this hymn  Agni is described as the very form or representation of the agreement reached by  the clans, as well as the focus of the ritual activity that results from that agreement.  (It is worth noting that the final hymn of the R̥gveda, self-consciously advocating  unity, contains two occurrences of this lexeme [X.191.2b, d].)
192 I.70
The final verse (10) describes the successful dawn sacrifice and the rising of the  sun that accompanies it. The rejoicing of “all” at the sight of the sun introduces  into this hymn the “all” that dominated the paired hymn I.68.
1. The blazing one, blazing bright like the lover of Dawn,
has filled the two conjoined (world-halves), like the light of heaven.
2. (Though just) born, you encompass (them) in accordance with your will. You will become the father of the gods, although you are their son.
3. Discerning Agni is the undistracted ritual expert;
like the udder of cows he is the sweetness of foods.
4. Like a friendly (ally) among the people, though quick to anger,
(he has) taken his seat in the middle, bringing joy to the house.
5. Like a son just born, bringing joy to the house;
well treated like a winning horse, he has traversed the clans.
6. When I have summoned the clans of the same nest along with their men, by his divinity Agni should attain all things.
7. None transgress these commandments of yours,
since you have given attentive hearing to these men.
8. This is your wondrous power: that on (the same) day,
yoked with the same men, you carry out your tasks.
9. Ruddy and far-radiant like the lover of Dawn,
he will be conspicuous to him [=the sacrificer?] as the one whose very  form has been produced in unison.
10. Carrying him themselves, they [=priests] open wide the doors.
All cry out upon seeing the sun.
## 70 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
11 verses: dvipadā virāj
As was noted in the introduction to I.68, this last of the Parāśara’s dvipadā virāj hymns  to Agni is the climax of a sequence of three whose disguised subject is Agni Vaiśvānara,  the clan-fire “belonging to all men.” The Vaiśvānara aspects of I.70 were already dis cussed by Proferes (2007: 48). In particular he points to the movement toward the  unity of a single focal fire (vs. 9) contrasted with the separation of this fire into many,  separately served fires (vs. 10), though he fails to mention the verbal encoding of the  underlying compound members in these climactic verses 9–10, where all (víśve) bear
tribute to the fire (vs. 9) and men (náraḥ) serve him in many places (vs. 10). This hymn also widens the view somewhat, for not only does the fire belong to all  men, but simultaneously to the gods (see the paired divine and human in vss. 2, 4,  and 6), and it is also related to all natural objects (see vss. 3–4, 7), expressed in series  of oppositional merisms, such as “the moving and the still” (vss. 3, 7). This final hymn of the dvipadā virāj series has eleven verses, rather than the ten  found in the other hymns. This eleventh, unpaired verse describes the power, skill,  and eagerness of the martial Agni, and thus expresses one of the roles for which the  Vaiśvānara fire is especially designed: to unite the clans into a force able to oppose  its enemies. (See Proferes 2007 passim.) It may be taken as a summary verse for the  entire sequence of Vaiśvānara hymns.
1. Might we vanquish the many inspired thoughts of the stranger by our  inspired thought;
might bright-blazing Agni attain all things (for us),
2. Watching over all the divine commandments
and the races of the people descended from Manu.
3. He who is the embryo of the waters, the embryo of the woods,
and the embryo of the still, the embryo of the moving,
4. Even in the rock (as well as) within the house,
every immortal, like every (member) of the clans, is very attentive
to him.
5. For Agni, the protector of riches on earth, does ritual service (for him  [=the mortal])
who does ritual service for him [=Agni] fittingly with good hymns.
6. O watchful (Agni), protect these worlds,
since you know the races of gods and of mortals.
7. Whom they will make grow through the many nights (and dawns) of  differing forms—
the one conceived by truth (whom) the moving and the still (will
make grow),
8. He has been brought to success, installed as Hotar, as the sun,
performing all the tasks to be realized.
9. You acquire a laud among the cows and the (fire)wood.
All bear tribute to (you), our sun.
10. Men serve you separately in many places;
they bear (you) away separately as (sons bear away) the property of  their aging father.
11. Avid like (a horse) heading to the goal, like a champion archer,
fearsome like a (chariot-)driver, dazzling in combats.
## 71 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The first of the Parāśara hymns in triṣṭubh, this is a curiously structured and very  difficult hymn. It begins with a sexually suggestive verse describing the kindling of194 I.71
the ritual fire by the fingers of the officiant manipulating the kindling sticks. Verse 2  switches to the mythic past and a fairly standard and straightforward summary of  the role of the Aṅgirases in the opening of the Vala cave, but nothing in the hymn  is straightforward after this. Verses treating the here-and-now of the ritual alternate  with snippets of mythology.
The most dramatic mythological material is found discontinuously in verses 5  and 8, which treat the well-known if ill-understood story of the incest between  Heaven and his daughter (see also X.61.5–7, as well as Jamison 1991:  288–301)  and especially the punishment meted out to the offender by his avenger, who is  clearly Agni. Since the birth of the Aṅgirases resulted from this incest, this myth fits  both the dedicand of the hymn and the Aṅgiras verse (2) that follows the opening,  and even the sexual innuendo of verse 1 may have evoked, or been evoked by, the  incest theme.
The other mythological allusion is to Mātariśvan’s stealing of fire (vs. 4); it  is not clear whether this reference is meant to have any points of contact with  the other mythological portions of the hymn. It does, however, connect with  the theme of the interaction between gods and men, especially with Agni as  go-between, found in verses 3, 4, and 7. Another puzzle is why Mitra and Varuṇa  intrude into this Agni hymn in verse 9, though the appearance of the Sun in  that same verse takes us back to verse 2. Ritual concerns are the focus of vss. 3,  6, and 7.
In short, in terms of structure this hymn neither follows a point-to-point tra jectory nor displays an omphalos/ring-compositional shape. Instead it seems  to show, at least in its central sections, sets of interlocking, overlapping paired  verses—3 + 6, 4 + 7, 5 + 8—loosely nestled within a ring consisting of 2 + 9, and  perhaps, more loosely still, 1 + 10.
1. The desirous females belonging to the same nest [=fingers] stimulate  the desirous male [=Agni] close by—as wives of the same nest
[=household] stimulate their own husband.
The sisters [=fingers] have delighted in the dusky one and in the
ruddy one [=two fire-kindling sticks], like cows in the brilliantly
dawning dawn.
2. Even the firm fastnesses did our fathers, the Aṅgirases, break with their  hymns, and the rock with their shout.
They made the way of lofty heaven for us; they found the day and the  sun, the beacon of the ruddy dawn.
3. They set the truth in place and they set the vision of it in motion; just  after that the voracious (visions) of the stranger are dispersed.
Never thirsting, (the [Aṅgirases’/poets’] visions), performing their tasks,  go to the gods, strengthening their race with a pleasing offering.
4. When Mātariśvan, borne away, stole him, and he of worthy birth came to  be gleaming in every house, after that (the fire) of the Bhr̥gus undertook the role of messenger, as if  for a more powerful king, being associated with him.
5. When he made the sap [=semen] for great Father Heaven, noting the  caresses he stealthily crept up (on him).
The archer boldly loosed a missile at him (when) the god placed his  “spark” in his own daughter.
6. Who will radiate widely for you here in his own house, or through the  days will piously offer reverence belonging to (you) who are eager
for it—
as the doubly lofty one, o Agni, you increase his vitality. He whom you  speed will drive in the same chariot with Wealth.
7. All nourishments converge on Agni, like the seven youthful streams on  the sea.
Our vitality is not widely perceptible in the form of our kin. Perceiving  (it [=vitality]), find solicitude (for us) among the gods.
8. When the (missile’s) sharp point reached the lord of men [=Agni] (for  him) to release it, Heaven, at the moment of contact, (released) the
blazing semen poured out.
Agni engendered the faultless young troop of good intention
[=Aṅgirases] and sweetened it.
9. Who, like thought, travels his roads in a single day, the Sun alone is  entirely master of goods,
(as are) the kings Mitra and Varuṇa, they of good hands, who guard  their own dear immortal thing [=milk?] within the cows.
10. Agni, do not neglect our ancestral partnerships, being preeminent as a  wise poet.
Old age alters our form like a cloud. Be attentive (to us) in the face of  this curse.
## 72 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
Another hymn in which the overall structure and the relationships among the  parts are unclear. The dominant myth here is the gods’ search for and recov ery of Agni, who had gone missing, and his (re)establishment as the ritual fire.  This myth is treated in verses 2, 4, and 6 at least, and verses 3 and 5 are prob ably related as well. However, sorting out the narrative(s) is made difficult by the  lack of overt subjects (as Geldner already pointed out) and by the number of  injunctive verb forms, as well as some perfects that can have either presential or  preterital value. These grammatical ambiguities allow much of the hymn to be
196 I.72
applicable simultaneously to the mythic past of the gods and the ritual present of  men. Other mythic references include the dog Saramā’s discovery and release of  the penned-in cattle (vs. 8), thematically parallel to the discovery and recovery of  Agni, and a puzzling reference to Aditi and her sons the Ādityas and the suckling  of a bird (vs. 9).
What provides some unity to the hymn is less these unfinished scraps of mythical  narrative than a focus on the vocabulary of knowledge and discovery: forms of the  root vid “find, acquire, possess” and the homonymous root vid “know, discern,” as  well as the semantically related roots jñā “know, recognize” and cit “discern,” are  found, often multiply, in almost every verse. The hymn can thus be read as a sort of  meta-reflection on the process of learning.
Another important feature of the hymn is the preoccupation with names and  bodies, rather like the later category of “name-and-form” (nāma-rūpa). Proferes  argues that verse 5 contains an early reflection of the Tānūnaptra rite, in which  the sacrificer and the officiating priests at a soma sacrifice enter into a pact to be  loyal to each other. The charter myth for this vow involves the gods all depositing  their bodies in a common place (the sun, or Indra standing for the sun) to produce  a common defense against external enemies. (See Proferes 2007: 59 for I.72.5 and  51–61 for the rite in general and its mythological background.) We agree with  his analysis, but in fact think that the theme is more prominent in the hymn than  in just that one verse. The central verses seem to suggest that the gods’ quest for  Agni and their discovery of him and his name (not overtly present, but formulai cally suggested) in verse 2 and their ritual service to him in verse 3 allow them  to acquire their own ritually worthy names and to make their own bodies also  worthy of ritual service in verse 4. This leads to the mutual exchange and mutual  possession of bodies in the Tānūnaptra verse proper (5). Thus rendered ritually  worthy, they find within Agni the intricate and secret “tracks” of the ritual itself  (vs. 6ab), a discovery that allows them to protect their own (6c), and that also  leads to the beneficial actions of Agni in the world of men (6d, 7). More benefits  follow in verses 8–9, though the connection of these to what precedes is admit tedly hazy. The “deposit” in a central entity, here Agni, that is the heart of the  Tānūnaptra pact seems to reappear in verse 10, in a context both cosmogonic  (10b) and apparently ritual (10cd).
The depiction of Agni in this hymn as the locus for the joint deposit of the bod ies of the gods in the Tānūnaptra myth is the mirror and complementary image of  Agni Vaiśvānara, the fire “belonging to all men,” around which all the allied human  clans rally, in the earlier hymns of Parāśara Śāktya’s Agni cycle (esp. I.68–70).
1. He outdoes the poetic skills of each and every ritual expert, taking in his  hand many manly powers.
Agni has become the wealth-lord of wealth, making wholly his own all  immortal things. 2. Among us they did not find what was enclosing the calf [=Agni],  though all the immortals—no fools—were seeking it.
Taking pains, following the track, producing insight, they took their  stand at the dear (name) of Agni, on the highest track.
3. Since, o Agni, for three autumns they [=gods?] served just you, the  glowing one, with ghee—themselves glowing—
they also acquired names worthy of worship and, well-born, they
sweetened their own bodies.
4. Ever possessing the two lofty world-halves [/Rodasī], the sons of Rudra  [=Maruts], worthy of worship, pressed forward.
In the opposite position a mortal, perceiving him, found Agni standing  on the highest track.
5. Coming to an agreement, they reverently approached him on bended  knee; along with their wives, they did reverence to the one worthy of  reverence.
Having given up their bodies, they made (each other’s bodies) their
own, guarding them (as) a comrade does (that of) his comrade when  he closes his eyes.
6. Since those worthy of worship found deposited just in you the three  times seven secret tracks,
with these do they, of one accord, guard their own immortal one.
Protect the livestock, both the still and the moving.
7. Knowing the patterns of the settled peoples, o Agni, distribute
proliferating riches in proper order (for them) to live.
Inwardly knowing the roads leading to the gods, you have become the  tireless messenger carrying the oblations.
8. Very attentive, (they discerned) the seven young maidens of  heaven [=rivers]; knowing the truth, they discerned the doors of  wealth.
Saramā found the firmly fixed cattle-pen, by which, even now, the clan  stemming from Manu benefits.
9. Those who mounted upon (those actions [=sacrifice]) that bring good  descendants, making themselves a way toward immortality,
by means of (those) sons, great in their greatness, the earth,
their mother Aditi, spread out, in order to suckle the bird
[=Agni? sun?].
10. They deposited (their?) own dear splendor within him, when the  immortals made the two eyes of heaven [=sun and moon].
Then like rivers sent surging they stream: heading downwards, the
ruddy ones have recognized the way, o Agni.

## 73 Agni
Parāśara Śāktya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This last hymn of the Parāśara Agni cycle recapitulates some of the poetic devices  and themes found in the earlier hymns and thus in some sense provides the close of  a ring to the whole sequence. It begins with three verses dense with similes, recalling  the first two hymns, I.65–66, which were similarly simile rich. The three verses are  entirely descriptive of Agni, particularly of the sacrificial fire in its position on the  ritual ground, but the god’s name is not mentioned until verse 4, where he is kindled  by men.
The rest of the hymn concerns Agni as the central focus of humans, of gods, and  of ritual substances (for this last, see vs. 6), Agni as a distributor and redistributor  of goods and services among gods, patrons, and poets, a role summed up in the  word “portion” found in verses 5, 6, 7, and 10. This theme was announced in the  first pāda of the hymn, and the “wealth acquired from one’s father” of 1a recurs in  verse 9.
Although this hymn lacks overt reference to the motifs of the Vaiśvānara  fire and the Tānūnaptra rite, in which men and gods respectively become united  by joint action involving the fire, the interrelations among men, among gods,  and among men and gods depicted in this hymn recall the more explicit treat
ment of those motifs in earlier parts of the cycle. That both gods and men  and, among men, both poets and patrons serve the fire in similar ways and  seek similar rewards depicts these groups of beings as having a certain equality  before Agni.
1. Who confers vitality like wealth acquired from one’s father, providing  good guidance like the instruction of a perceptive man,
resting in a comfortable place like a guest whose pleasure is served, like a  Hotar he has traversed the (sacrificial) seat of him who does honor.
2. Whose thoughts become reality like god Savitar’s, who protects all  communities according to his will,
lauded by many like a (royal) emblem, really present and agreeable like  one’s own self, he has become desirable to install.
3. Who, suckling all, dwells peacefully upon the earth, like a god, like a  king with established alliances,
stationed in front like heroes stationed for protection, irreproachable like  a wife pleasing to her husband—
4. You, o Agni, kindled here in the house as their own, do men attend on in  their fixed abodes.
They deposited abundant heavenly brilliance within him. Become the  foundation of riches for your whole lifetime! 5. Might the bounteous ones reach nourishments, o Agni, and (might) the  patrons who give (reach) through a whole lifetime.
Might we gain the victory-prize in our clashes with the stranger,
acquiring a portion among the gods for our fame.
6. For the bellowing cows of truth, apportioned by heaven, swell with  their udders;
from afar, seeking a portion of (your?) favor, the rivers have flowed
forth all at once over the rock.
7. Seeking a portion of favor in you, those worthy of worship [=gods] set  their fame in heaven.
They made night and dawn of different forms, and they put together  the black color and the red.
8. Might we—we and our patrons—be those mortals whom you will  sweeten for wealth, o Agni.
Like a shadow you accompany all creation, having filled the two
world-halves and the space between.
9. Might we vanquish steeds with steeds, men with men, and heroes with  heroes, o Agni, when aided by you.
As lords of wealth acquired from their fathers, might our patrons,
having a hundred winters, reach through (a whole lifetime).
10. Let these solemn speeches be pleasing to you, o Agni, ritual expert—to  your mind and heart.
Might we be able to control (the prizewinning horses) of your wealth,  (so they are) amenable to the chariot-pole, while we acquire the fame  apportioned by the gods.
The next, rather sizable group of twenty hymns is attributed to Gotama Rāhūgaṇa,  who could be the father or other ancestor of the poet of I.58–64, Nodhas Gautama.  If so, the dazzling skill of the son is not on view in the work of his father in the  opening Agni hymns (74–79) or in the All God hymns (89–90), which seem more  dutiful than engaged, but when he treats other gods, especially the Maruts (85–88)  and Dawn (92), his poetry can be inspired.
## 74 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
9 verses: gāyatrī
The favor shown to the pious man by Agni is the theme of this short hymn. The  beneficiary of Agni’s patronage is identified as dāśvā́ṃs “pious” in verses 2, 8, and  9, and Agni’s activities on his behalf are the subject of the middle verses 4–5. These
200 I.75
activities are mostly the familiar ones, of serving as messenger between the mortal  and divine realms and going after the gods in order to bring them to the sacrifice  (see esp. vss. 4, 6–7), but Agni is also credited with aiding the pious man under  attack (vs. 2), leading to the god’s covert identification with Indra, via the epithet  “Vr̥tra-smasher” (vs. 3). Another unusual feature of this hymn is the appeal to what  “the people say” about Agni and his devotee (vss. 3, 5).
1. Reverently approaching the ceremony, might we speak a solemn formula  to Agni,
to him who listens, (when he is) in the distance and with us (here),
2. Who, at the forefront in the “blizzards” (of attacks) when the separate  peoples were clashing together,
guarded for the pious man his patrimony.
3. And let the people say: “Agni, the Vr̥tra-smasher, has arisen,
who wins the stakes in every battle!”
4. The man whose messenger you are in the dwelling place, for whom you  pursue (the gods) to pursue the oblations,
whose ceremony you perform wondrously—
5. Just he has good oblations, has the gods with him, o Aṅgiras, young  (son) of strength,
has a good ritual grass-strew—so the people say.
6. And you will convey the gods here for their glorification,
(for them) to pursue the oblations, o much gleaming one.
7. No trampling of horses is heard at all from your chariot as it drives, when, o Agni, you travel on your mission.
8. Aided by you, the competitor, unabashed (even though he was) behind  the one in front,
the pious man, has taken first place, o Agni.
9. And a brilliant, lofty abundance of heroes, Agni, do you strive to win from the gods, o god, for the pious man.
## 75 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
5 verses: gāyatrī
This short hymn begins (vs. 1) by urging Agni to enjoy our praise of him, which the  poet hopes will be “a winning sacred formulation” (vs. 2). But, contravening our  expectations, in place of this promised bráhman the poet instead asks a series of  abrupt questions in verse 3. Then once again our expectations are disappointed, for  although verse 4 at first appears to contain the answers to the questions posed in  verse 3, only the first question is actually answered, while the rest of verse 4, though maintaining the clausal structure of verse 3, is only vaguely related in meaning to  the corresponding clauses in verse 3. The hymn ends (vs. 5) with a conventional  directive to Agni to perform sacrifice, with its imperative matching the imperative  beginning the hymn (“take delight,” 1a).
Although the hymn is too brief to develop the theme of thwarted expectations  sketched above, it does uninsistently suggest that verbal form may trump content in  the construction of praise poetry and that the audience should be wary of being led  astray by a poet’s expressed intentions.
1. Take delight in the most extensive speech, which affords most delight to  the gods,
while pouring the oblations into your own mouth.
2. Then, o Agni, best of Aṅgirases, best of ritual adepts, something  dear to you
might we speak—a winning sacred formulation.
3. Who is the kinsman of your peoples? O Agni, who holds the pious  ceremony?
Who are you and fixed in what?
4. You are the kinsman of the peoples. O Agni, you are the dear envoy, a comrade for your comrades, to be reverently invoked.
5. Sacrifice for us to Mitra and Varuṇa; sacrifice to the gods, to lofty truth. Agni, you will sacrifice to your own home.
## 76 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with anxious questions about how best to worship Agni  in order to harness his powers. The structure of this question verse is reminiscent  of verse 3 of the previous hymn (I.75), with each pāda containing a separate  query; however, the questions here are more focused on how best to please Agni,  and the longer line of triṣṭubh meter makes the questions seem less abrupt than  in the gāyatrī of I.75.3. As in I.75 the questions here do not receive explicit  answers. Instead the poet devotes most of the rest of the hymn to detailing Agni’s  duties and seeking Agni’s aid as ritual performer and priest (see esp. vss. 2, 4), to  bring the gods, especially Indra (see vs. 3c), to the ritual ground and to sacrifice  to them.
1. What reverent approach is to your heart’s desire? What inspired thought  will be the most beneficial, Agni?
Or, who attains your skill through his sacrifices? Or, with what mind  should we piously serve you?
202 I.77
2. Come hither, Agni; sit down here as Hotar. Become an undeceivable  leader for us.
Let the two world-halves, which set everything in motion, aid you.
Sacrifice to the gods for great benevolence.
3. Burn away all demonic beings, Agni. Become for the sacrifices the  protector from curses.
Then convey here the lord of soma with his two fallow bays. We have  made a guest reception for him who gives well.
4. With a speech bringing offspring you are to be invoked as the conveyor  (of oblations) with your mouth, and you will sit down here with
the gods.
You pursue the Hotarship and the Potarship, you instrument of sacrifice.  Become (all this), o provider and engenderer of goods.
5. Just as you sacrificed to the gods with the oblations of the inspired poet  Manu, along with the poets, yourself a poet,
even so, o Hotar most truly present, o Agni, today perform sacrifice with  your gladdening tongue.
## 77 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is in some ways a twin to the last one: both have five triṣṭubh verses,  and both open with a verse of questions about the proper way to serve Agni, using  some of the same vocabulary (e.g., dāśema “we should piously serve” I.77.1a and  I.76.1d). Lexical similarities continue through the hymn: śáṃtama “most beneficial”  (77.2a, 76.1b), various forms of the verb √vī “pursue” (77.2c, 4b; 76.4c), et cetera.  Like I.76, this hymn also focuses on Agni’s role as priest and sacrificer, although the  rhetoric in this hymn is somewhat more expansive than in I.76.
1. How should we do pious service to Agni? Which hymn enjoyable to the  gods is spoken to him, the radiant—
the one who, the immortal among mortals, the truthful Hotar, as the  best sacrificer just does so [=sacrifices] to the gods?
2. The one who is the most beneficial at the ceremonies, the truthful  Hotar—attract him here with reverence.
When Agni, for the sake of the mortal, has pursued the gods all
together, he will be attentive to them and will perform sacrifice with  his mind.
3. For he is resolve; he is a young buck; he is on target. Like an envoy he  has become charioteer of the unerring. Him, the wondrous one, do the god-seeking Ārya clans entreat first at  the ritual offerings.
4. He, most manly of men, who has care for the stranger—let Agni with his  help pursue our hymns, our visionary thought—for us
and for our benefactors, the strongest ones, motivated by prizes, who  propel our prayers at length.
5. Thus has Agni, the truthful one, the Jātavedas, been praised by the  Gotamas, inspired poets.
He will swell brilliance among them; he will swell the prize. He drives to  prosperity at his pleasure—the observant one.
## 78 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
5 verses: gāyatrī
A hymn of uninspired content, which is rigidly structured and dominated by its  refrain. Its most noteworthy feature is that the first two pādas of the last verse  (5) break the pattern of the preceding ones, and it is here that the name Agni  appears for the first and only time in the hymn, with the reference switched from  the 2nd person of the rest of the hymn to 3rd person in its final verse. It is also  striking that in verses 1 and 4 the refrain is syntactically integral to the verse,  with the initial “to you” the object of the verb in the third-pāda refrain, whereas  in the middle verses 2–3 the refrain is syntactically separate, and the initial “to  you” is construed with the verb in the first hemistich. Thus, its formal properties  are the whole point of the hymn, with meaning essentially backgrounded. For  discussion of other ways in which Gotama privileges form over content, see the  introduction to I.75.
1. To you, o boundless Jātavedas, with a hymn do we Gotamas
keep bellowing, with éclat.
2. And to you with a hymn does Gotama, desirous of wealth, show  friendship.
– We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat.
3. And to you, best winner of prizes, do we call, as Aṅgiras did.
– We keep bellowing to (you), with éclat.
4. And to you, best smasher of obstacles, who send the Dasyus
tumbling down,
we keep bellowing, with éclat.
5. We Rahūgaṇas have spoken a honeyed speech to Agni.
– We keep bellowing to (him), with éclat.204 I.79
## 79 Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
12 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, uṣṇih 4–6, gāyatrī 7–12
As its position in the sequence and its metrical disunity suggest, this hymn actually  consists of four separate hymns of three verses each (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12). The last  three are relatively simple in their construction and their contents, but the first is  rich and vividly descriptive and poses some problems of interpretation.
This first hymn segment begins (vs. 1) with quick sketches of different forms  of fire:  fire as sun (pāda a); fire as lightning (pāda b); ritual fire, especially as it  is kindled at dawn (pādas cd). This verse manages to convey dynamism without  the use of a single finite verb or participle. The next two verses (2–3) take up the  second image, fire as lightning, and develop it in unexpected ways. In our reading,  the ritual fire (that is, the god Agni) is compared with and ultimately identified  with the thunderstorm, and therefore its product, the fructifying rain, can be pre
sented, paradoxically, as the product of fire itself, a substance that in nature cannot  produce water. In verse 2 the zigzagging lightning flashes are the fire’s flames; the  bellowing bull is the roaring fire itself, and the flying mists and thundering clouds  are the billowing smoke. Verse 3 takes this naturalistic comparison to its logical but  unnatural conclusion: if fire is the embodiment of the thunderstorm, then it is full  of rain, a most desirable product, here called “the milk of truth.” In the last half of  this verse the principal Ādityas as well as Wind become involved by engorging the  clouds with water.
After this complex and allusive vignette, the other three hymn segments are  a serious anticlimax. In verses 4–6 Agni is asked to give wealth and fame and to  protect against demons. Wealth is also the preoccupation of verses 7–9. In the  final three verses the poet, Gotama, exhorts himself to give hymns to Agni, and  then implores Agni to keep demons away. There is nothing in these nine verses to  arrest the attention, but Gotama’s first three verses are indeed a worthy gift for  the god.
1. A golden-haired one in his spread through the dusky realm—a snake,  tumultuous, swooping like the wind—
blazing bright (when he becomes) cognizant of Dawn, like the glorious  busy (Dawns themselves) actually present.
2. Your fine-feathered (lightning flashes) zigzagged along their ways. The  black bull keeps bellowing. If he is really here,
he has come here with his (lightning flashes) like kindly, smiling (girls).  The mists fly; the clouds thunder.
3. When he, swollen with the milk of truth, (has come) leading them [=the  lightning flashes] along the straightest paths of truth—
Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, and the Earth-circling (Wind) engorge the skin  in the womb of the nearer (realm). 4. O Agni, being the lord of the prize consisting of cows, o youthful (son)  of strength,
on us confer great fame, o Jātavedas.
5. On being kindled, Agni the good poet is to be reverently invoked with  a hymn.
Shine richly for us, you of many faces.
6. Through the nights in your own person, King Agni, and at the dawning  of dawn,
o sharp-fanged one, burn against the demons.
7. Help us, Agni, with your help at the presentation of the gāyatrī song, o you to be extolled in all hymnic visions.
8. Bring here to us wealth, o Agni, which is victorious in every way,  worthy to be chosen,
and difficult to surpass in all battles.
9. (Bring) here to us wealth affording lifelong prosperity with your kind  attention, o Agni.
Confer grace, (for us) to live.
10. Present your own purified speeches to sharp-flamed Agni, o Gotama; present your own hymns, as you seek his favor.
11. Whoever will assail us, close by or in the distance, let him fall, o Agni. Be (ready) to strengthen only us.
12. Thousand-eyed, boundless Agni repels the demonic forces.
As Hotar, worthy of praise, he is hymned.
## 80 Indra
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
16 verses: paṅkti
Like the justly famous I.32, this hymn is entirely concerned with the Indra–Vr̥tra  battle. It portrays Indra’s defeat of Vr̥tra and his release of the pent-up waters  with admirable clarity, though it lacks the richness of detail of I.32 and the  intimacy of the portrait of the overmatched and then defeated Vr̥tra found in  that other hymn. Instead this hymn simply keeps repeating the climactic moment  when Indra smote Vr̥tra with his mace (vájra). In fact, the mace seems almost  as much the hero of the hymn as Indra is: in the first thirteen verses, those con
cerned most directly with the Vr̥tra battle, only three (4, 9, 10) lack a mention  of the mace. Verse 8 is especially noteworthy in containing the only occurrence  of plural vájra in the R̥gveda, in a puzzling context: “Your maces have been dis persed across the ninety navigable (rivers).” This passage superficially reminds us  of I.32.14, in which Indra, having slain Vr̥tra, flees in fear across “the ninety-nine
206 I.80
flowing rivers,” but the implications of our passage seem more positive. Perhaps  the point is that, once the rivers were released to flow in all directions, Indra’s  power, embodied in the mace, was subdivided and spread across the whole fertile,  water-fed landscape.
The fifth-pāda refrain in every verse is an especially salient feature of the  hymn and concerns the verbal encouragement given to Indra. The subject of  the plural verb árcann ánu is never specified, and since the verb is in the injunc tive, it is ambiguous between present and indefinite mythic past. These uncer tainties are no doubt deliberate: the subject can be the current poet-sacrificers,  their legendary counterparts (Atharvan, Manu, and Dadhyañc mentioned in  vs. 16), or the Maruts, the gods who in mythic time provided encouragement  to Indra before and during the Vr̥tra combat. A direct-speech example of such  encouragement is given in verse 3, and verse 9 encourages the encouragers in  this action. The relationship between the current poets and their predecessors is  built into the structure of the hymn, in a telling ring between the first and last  verses. Verse 1 mentions the formulation created “in the current style” (itthā́),  while in verse 16 formulations made “in the older style” (pūrváthā), imitating  illustrious named past poets and sacrificers, are offered to Indra. Thus the hymn  implicitly suggests that not only was Indra’s great victory impossible without  his cheering comrades, but that poets today, like those in the past, fulfill the  same role.
1. Because right at the time of the soma exhilaration the formulator created  a strengthening (formulation) in the current style,
o strongest mace-bearer, with your might you ordered the serpent forth  from the earth.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
2. The bullish exhilaration exhilarated you—the soma, brought here by a  falcon, then pressed,
with which you smashed Vr̥tra forth from the waters, o mace-bearer, with  your might.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
3. “Go forth! Go to it! Dare! Your mace will not be restrained,
for, Indra, manly power and strength are yours. You will smash Vr̥tra;  you will conquer the waters.”
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
4. Forth from the earth you smashed Vr̥tra, o Indra, forth from heaven. Release downward these waters, which are accompanied by the Maruts,  affording riches to the living.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
5. Indra, angered, having attacked the back of raging Vr̥tra with his mace, keeps smashing him downward, spurring the waters to flow.
– They cheer on your sovereign power. 6. He keeps smashing down on his back with the hundred-jointed mace. Indra, exhilarated from the stalk, seeks a way for his comrades.
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
7. O Indra, possessor of the stone, of the mace, to you alone virile power  was conceded.
When (you kept smashing) this wild beast of magic power, you slew  him with your own magic power.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
8. Your maces have been dispersed across the ninety navigable (rivers). Great is your virile power, Indra; force has been placed in your
two arms.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
9. Thousand(-strong), do you chant as one. Twenty(-strong), encircle him  with rhythm.
In the hundreds they have bellowed after him. To Indra has the sacred  formulation been raised.
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
10. Indra has smashed forth the power of Vr̥tra, has smashed forth the  might of Vr̥tra with his might.
Great was this manly deed of his: having smashed Vr̥tra, he released  (the waters).
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
11. Even these two great (world-halves) here tremble with fear before your  battle-fury,
since, mace-bearing Indra, you have slain Vr̥tra with might, with the  Maruts alongside.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
12. Not by his trembling excitation, not by his thundering did Vr̥tra make  Indra fear.
His mace of metal with a thousand spikes confronted him.
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
13. When with your mace you set Vr̥tra and your missile to fighting, o Indra, your strength, as you sought to smash the serpent, kept
pressing toward heaven.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
14. At your thundering, o possessor of the stone, both the still and the  moving shake.
Even Tvaṣṭar quivers with fear before your battle-fury, Indra.
– They cheer on your sovereign power.
15. For, from what we can learn, no one is beyond Indra in virile power. In him have the gods assembled manliness and resolve and mighty
powers.
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
208 I.81
16. The poetic vision which Atharvan, Manu the father, and Dadhyañc  extended—
our sacred formulations and hymns in this older style have come
together in him, in Indra.
– They cheer on his sovereign power.
## 81 Indra
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
9 verses: paṅkti
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one is in paṅkti meter, but here the fifth  pāda, rather than being a refrain, is variable and in one instance (vs. 4) syntactically  connected to what precedes it in the verse. (Otherwise the fifth pāda is syntactically  independent but linked thematically.)
The strength and power of Indra are the main theme, but it is clear that for the  poet the purpose of Indra’s might is simply to enable him to provide his worshipers  with goods (vss. 2–3, 6–9)—particularly those goods belonging to “the stranger”  (vss. 6, 9), in this case probably a non-sacrificing member of the Ārya community,  which Indra should redistribute to more deserving men. The demands for largesse  become increasingly peremptory, and the quantity of praise given to Indra is rather  limited. One wonders how much success this bid for riches would have met with.
1. Indra has been strengthened for exhilaration, the Vr̥tra-smasher for  strength, by superior men.
Just him do we invoke in great contests, and him in a petty one;
when prizes (are set) he will help us.
2. For you are the martial one, hero; you are the one who hands over much. You are the increaser even of the paltry. You exert yourself for the
sacrificer;
for the soma-presser your goods are many.
3. When contests loom, rich stakes are set for the daring one.
Hitch up your two fallow bays, aroused to exuberance. Whom will you  smash? Whom will you set in goods?
It’s us you will set in goods, Indra.
4. Through his resolve the great, fearsome one has increased his strength in  accord with his own nature.
For splendor the lofty belipped possessor of fallow bays has taken
the metal mace into his own clasped hands.
5. He filled the earthly space; he kept thrusting the luminous realms toward  heaven.
There is no one like you, Indra, who has been born or will be born.
You have grown beyond everything. 6. He who hands over to the pious man the sustenance for mortals that  belongs to the stranger—
let Indra do his best for us. Share out your many goods:
might I have a share of your generosity.
7. For at every revel (you) of straight resolve give us herds of cattle. Gather together many hundreds of goods with both hands.
Look sharp!—bring riches here.
8. Become exhilarated on the pressed soma, for strength, o champion, for  generosity.
Because we know you as possessing many goods, we have dispatched our  desires to you—
so become our helper.
9. These (people who are) kin to you [=us] foster everything of value. Because you detect the possessions of the stranger, of the impious
peoples,
bring their possessions here to us.
## 82 Indra
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
6 verses: paṅkti, except jagatī 6
Like the three Indra hymns (I.61–63) of our poet’s descendant, Nodhas  Gautama, this hymn was composed to accompany the “Fallow-bay-yoking”  oblation at the end of the soma sacrifice, at which the two horses of Indra are  hitched up for the return journey to heaven. The first five verses are in paṅkti  meter, with the fifth pāda a refrain announcing the sacrificer’s intention to per
form this yoking. In the body of those verses the poet announces that the goal  of the sacrifice has been achieved (vss. 1–2): both Indra and his companions the  Maruts have received praise and oblations, and they have provided presents in  return. He offers Indra a last bit of praise and a last oblation to send him on his  way (vss. 3–4), and then turns to the actual yoking of the pair of horses (vs. 5).
The final verse is in a different meter and expresses the act of yoking in a  different tense and mood. The subtle distinction in wording between the refrain  of verses 1–5 and its variant in the first pāda of the final verse (6a) is signifi cant: the refrain contains the 1st sg. root aorist subjunctive yójā in the prospec tive/volitional sense “I will yoke,” while the version in the final verse transposes  the formula into the present indicative with yunájmi, and adds the instrumen tal bráhmaṇā “with a sacred formulation.” These changes make the statement  into a “performative” in the technical linguistic sense; that is, the utterance by  itself performs the action it expresses: “I (hereby) yoke your two shaggy fallow  bays with a solemn formulation.” The bráhman refers to the entire hymn that
210 I.83
precedes, and it is the very recitation of the hymn, identified as a bráhman, that  performs the ritual act of yoking.
A particularly appealing part of the hymn is the mention of Indra’s wife in verses  5–6: the poet is concerned to send the god directly back home to his “dear wife” and  further exhilaration. See also III.53.4–6.
1. Listen well to our hymns, bounteous one, not like a nay-sayer.
When you will make us the beneficiaries of your liberality, it’s just then  that you will achieve your goal.
– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.
2. They have eaten; for they have brought themselves to exhilaration; they  have shaken down dear things.
They have been praised—the self-radiant (Maruts)—with the newest  inspired thought.
– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.
3. We would extol you of wholly lovely appearance, o bounteous one. Praised, drive forth now following your will, once your chariot box
is full.
– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.
4. The only one who will mount on the bullish, cow-finding chariot
is the one who will take care that the cup is full for your
“Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, Indra.
– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.
5. Let your right (horse) be yoked, and your left one, you of a hundred  resolves.
With this (chariot) drive up to your dear wife, while (you are still)
exhilarated from the stalk.
– Now, Indra, I will hitch up your two fallow bays.
6. With (this) sacred formulation I (hereby) hitch up your two shaggy  fallow bays. Drive forth; you have taken (the reins? the mace?) in
your fists.
The wild pressed soma-drinks have stirred you up. Accompanied
by Pūṣan, o mace-bearer, you will become exhilarated along with
your wife.

In this hymn the poet uses two different senses of the word “first” to imbue the  good sacrificer with the qualities and prestige of the legendary institutors of the sacrifice. At the beginning of verse 1 the good sacrificer is “the first” to attain to  wealth provided by Indra. The next two verses continue the characterization of the  good sacrificer and the good life bestowed on him by the gods. The next two verses  (4–5) pick up the word “first” (prathamá) that opened the hymn, but here not in the  sense of “foremost, first in line” as in verse 1, but rather “primal, original”: these  verses concern the first establishment of the sacrifice and the actions of the famous  primordial sacrificers. In the final verse (6) we return to the current sacrifice, but  by putting the model of the original sacrificers before us, the poet implies that the  present-day sacrificer is replicating their actions and is identified with them. This is  one of the common themes of R̥gvedic sacrifice: that each new sacrifice is an enact ment of the first one.
1. The first to come to (wealth) consisting of horses, to cows with
your help, o Indra, is the mortal who pursues (his ritual duties)
well.
Just him do you engorge with more abundant goods, as waters,
conspicuous from everywhere, engorge a river.
2. Like the goddesses, the Waters, they [=gods] approach (the
place) associated with oblation; they look downward onto
the extended (soma-filter? sacrifice?) as if onto an extensive
airy realm.
The gods lead forward the one who seeks the gods. Like suitors,
they delight in the man who pleases (them) with the sacred
formulation.
3. You have placed a speech worthy to be spoken in the two (priests), the  pair who ritually serve with their offering spoons extended.
Not mustered (to battle), he dwells in peace under your commandment,  he thrives. Propitious is your potency for the sacrificer who
presses soma.
4. The Aṅgirases, who had (previously) kindled the fires with ritual  labor and good ritual performance, after that first acquired their
life-force.
They collected together all the sustenance of the niggard, livestock
consisting of horses and cows—the superior men.
5. With sacrifices the Atharvan first stretched the paths. Thereupon was the  Sun, the protector of commandments, the tracker, born.
Uśanā Kāvya drove the cows together. We sacrifice to the immortal birth  of Yama.
6. When the ritual grass is twisted for the sake of good descendants, or the  chant sounds its signal-call toward heaven,
when the pressing stone, the praiseworthy bard speaks, just at his
(sacrifice) does Indra take pleasure at suppertime.

Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
20 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–6, uṣṇih 7–9, paṅkti 10–12, gāyatrī 13–15, triṣṭubh 16–18, br̥hatī 19, satobr̥hatī 20; arranged in tr̥cas 1–18, pragātha 19–20
Coming at the end of Gotama’s Indra collection, this long and metrically com plex hymn must actually be composed of smaller hymn segments. The first eighteen  verses are arranged in tr̥cas, and it ends with a single pragātha. The contents range  from the most banal invitation to the sacrifice to elusive and allusive treatments of  little-known myths. There are a number of reminiscences of the Indra hymns pre ceding it in the Gotama collection.
The first six verses, in anuṣṭubh meter, appear to form a unity, urging Indra to come  to the soma sacrifice in clichéd and predictable phraseology. The next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is in  uṣṇih meter (8 8 12); the last four syllables of the third pāda are a semidetached refrain  (“Indra indeed!”), so that the verses present themselves like gāyatrī (i.e., 8 8 8). The  contrast between the good sacrificer and his unsatisfactory counterpart is the theme.
The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in paṅkti meter, is highly reminiscent of I.80, also  in paṅkti. As in that hymn the fifth pāda of each verse is a refrain syntactically  unconnected to the rest of the verse. In fact, the last six syllables of the refrain  match those of I.80, and in order to make sense of the refrain here, we must supply  the verb (“they cheer on”) from the refrain of I.80. This tr̥ca concerns the mix
ing of milk with the pressed soma, in metaphorical terms—with the milk streams  depicted as buffalo-cows. Beneath this first metaphor there may be a second: it is  possible that the Maruts lurk behind the buffalo-cow facade. (Remember that the  Maruts were one of the possible subjects of the refrain in I.80.) An association of  the Maruts with “the ritual midpoint” here might allude to their recent incorpora
tion as recipients of the oblation at the Midday Pressing.
Another reminiscence of I.80 is found in the next tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), in gāyatrī,  which treats in most condensed and puzzling fashion the myth of Dadhyañc  and the horse’s head. (For this myth in general, see Macdonell 1897:  141–42.)  Dadhyañc and his father Atharvan were mentioned in passing in the last verse of  I.80 (vs. 16). In other versions of the myth Dadhyañc substitutes a horse’s head  for his own in order to declare the secret location of Tvaṣṭar’s soma. In these three  short verses we find Dadhyañc, the horse’s head, and Tvaṣṭar, but the narrative  in which they are involved is entirely unclear and we confess ourselves mystified.
The last tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) consists entirely of anxious questions, mostly in con nection with the sacrifice, reminiscent of the cascade of questions in other Gotama  hymns (I.75.3, 76.1, 77.1). The first verse (16) wonders who will be able to yoke  particularly ill-behaved cattle and bring them here. “Here” seems to refer to the  sacrifice, and the best guess as to the identity of the cattle is the Maruts, who are  the dedicands of Gotama’s next four hymns (I.85–88). The next verse (17) is more  confused, but the location of Indra and indeed his very existence are in question,  and a formal spokesman on behalf of mortals is sought. The questions are more clearly ritual in verse 18, ending with the sacrificer’s self-doubt about his status with  the gods he sacrifices to. The final two verses (19–20), an independent pragātha,  seem designed to quell this doubt, asserting that Indra himself, in a turn-about, will  praise the sacrificer and show him mercy, as well as offering him help and goods.
Although no strong unity among the various pieces of this hymn is perceptible, it  does mimic in certain ways the progress of a soma sacrifice. It opens with the invita tion (vss. 1–6), made more pointed by the contrast between our well-made and deserv ing sacrifice and the behavior of ungenerous mortals (vss. 7–9). Verses 10–12 concern  the actual preparation of the soma (and also refer, in vs. 7, to the ritual midpoint).  Verses 13–15 can be seen as a mythic interlude, praising the great deeds of Indra while  he is present on the ritual ground. Verses 16–18 raise doubts about the efficacy of the  sacrifice that has been, or is being, performed—doubts somewhat allayed by the final  two verses (19–20), which end with the usual requests for benefits from the god.
1. The soma has been pressed for you, Indra. O strongest bold one,  come here.
Let Indrian strength permeate you, as the sun permeates the airy realm  with its rays.
2. The two fallow bays convey Indra of irresistible strength
up to the praises of the seers and to the sacrifice of the sons of Manu. 3. Mount the chariot, Vr̥tra-smasher: your two fallow bays have been  yoked with a sacred formulation.
Let the pressing stone with its call make your mind inclined hither.
4. Drink this soma here, Indra, the preeminent immortal exhilaration. The streams of the clear (soma) have flowed to you in the seat of truth. 5. Chant now to Indra and speak solemn words.
The pressed drops have exhilarated him. Do homage to (his)
preeminent might.
6. No one is a better charioteer than you, Indra, when you control your  two fallow bays.
No one has reached you in greatness, not (even) one with good horses.
7. He who alone apportions the goods to the pious mortal,
the unrepulsable master – (that’s) Indra indeed!
8. When will he kick the ungenerous mortal with his foot like a mushroom? When will he listen to our hymns? – Indra indeed!
9. For someone who has pressed soma seeks to entice you here, away from  the many.
He has control of powerful strength – Indra indeed!
10. The buffalo-cows drink just so of the sweet honey belonging to the  (ritual) midpoint,
they who, fellow travelers with bullish Indra, become exhilarated for  beauty—
– The good ones (cheer) on his sovereignty.214 I.85
11. These dappled ones, eager for caresses, prepare the soma for him. The milk-cows dear to Indra propel his mace, his missile.
– The good ones (cheer) on his sovereignty.
12. They, forethoughtful, serve his might with reverence.
They follow his many commandments, to be first in his thought.
– The good ones (cheer) on his sovereignty.
13. With the bones of Dadhyañc unrepulsable Indra
smashed the nine and ninety obstacles.
14. The head of the horse that he was seeking set away in the mountains, that he found in the reed-filled (lake?).
15. Right there they thought of the secret name of the cow of Tvaṣṭar— likewise in the house of the moon.
16. Who today yokes the cattle to the chariot-pole of truth—the vehement,  wrathful, very angry ones,
with arrows in their mouths, shooting at the heart, but embodying joy?  Whoever will succeed in bringing them, he will live.
17. Who retreats and who is thrust back? Who is fearful? Who might think  Indra exists? Who (might think he is) nearby?
Who will speak for offspring, who for a retinue and for wealth? Who  will speak on behalf of himself, on behalf of his people?
18. Who reverently invokes Agni with oblation and ghee? (Who)
will perform sacrifice with a ladle according to the fixed ritual
sequences?
For whom will the gods swiftly convey the offering here? Who might  think himself a man whose oblations are worth pursuing, who has
gods well on his side?
19. Surely you, (though) a god, will solemnly praise the mortal, o
strongest one.
There is no other dispenser of mercy than you, bounteous one. Indra,  I say this speech to you:
20. Let not your benefits, nor your help, good one, ever cheat us.
And mete out to us all goods coming from the settled domains, you  who belong to the descendants of Manu.
## 85 Maruts
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5, 12
A typical Marut hymn: their beauty and their adornments, their unruly journey to  the sacrifice and the thunderstorm it represents, their parentage (Rudra as father, Pr̥śni the cow as mother), their fearsome power. One stylistic peculiarity is the ten dency to repeat with minimal variation parts of one verse in the next, an example  of concatenative repetition; see 2c/3ab; 4cd/5a; 6c/7b, d; 10a/11a.
Although the focus throughout is firmly on the Maruts, there is one seemingly  intrusive verse (9), where the Maruts are unmentioned and mythologically irrel evant, in which Tvaṣṭar fashions the mace for Indra to slay Vr̥tra. Indra’s release of  the waters after the slaying must be the point of contact, since the next two verses  (10–11) concern the Maruts’ tipping the heavenly well to pour out its water.
1. Those who go forth in beauty like wives, spanned together on their  journey, the sons of Rudra, possessing wondrous power—
for the Maruts made the two world-halves grow strong—the heroes  reach exhilaration, eager at the rites.
2. Once grown, they attained greatness: the Rudras made their seat in heaven. Chanting their chant, generating Indra’s strength, they whose mother is  Pr̥śni put on their splendors.
3. When those whose mother is a cow beautify themselves with unguents,  the beautiful ones put radiant (ornaments) on their bodies.
They thrust away every antagonist. Ghee flows along their tracks.
4. Those good battlers who flash out with their spears, stirring forth even  the unstirrable by their power—
When, o Maruts, in a bullish troop you have yoked the mind-swift
dappled mares to your chariots,
5. When you have yoked the dappled mares to your chariots, speeding the  stone at the prize-contest, o Maruts—
they unloose the streams of the ruddy one and inundate the earth with  waters like a skin.
6. Let the quick-streaming spans convey you hither; quickly flying with  your arms, go forth.
Sit on the ritual grass: a broad seat has been made for you. Make
yourselves exhilarated, Maruts, on the honeyed stalk.
7. Those self-powerful ones strengthened themselves in their greatness.  They mounted the vault; they made themselves a broad seat.
When Viṣṇu rinsed the bull [=soma] arousing exhilaration,
[and/or] When Viṣṇu aided the bull [=Indra], stirred by the
exhilarating drink,
they settled like birds on the dear ritual grass.
8. Like champions, like oncoming fighters, like those seeking fame in  battles, they have marshaled themselves.
All creatures fear the Maruts—the superior men glittering in appearance  like kings.
9. When Tvaṣṭar the good craftsman had turned the well-made golden  mace with its thousand spikes,
216 I.86
Indra took it to do the manly works: he smashed Vr̥tra, he forced out  the flood of waters.
10. They pushed the well upward with their power; they split apart the  mountain, though it was firmly fixed.
Blowing their music, the Maruts of good drops performed these joyous  (deeds) in the exhilaration of soma.
11. They pushed the well aslant in this way. They poured out the wellspring  for the thirsting Gotama.
They come hither to him with help—they of bright radiance. They
satisfy the desire of the inspired poet through their own essential
qualities.
12. The shelters you have for the one who performs ritual labor—hold these  out threefold to the pious man.
Extend these to us, Maruts; establish for us wealth in good heroes,
o bulls.
## 86 Maruts
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
10 verses: gāyatrī
The first half of this hymn has a remarkably intricate syntactic structure, especially  for a gāyatrī hymn. Verse 1 makes the outlines of this structure clear: a genitive rela tive pronoun (yásya “whose, of whom”) introducing a clause in which the Maruts  perform some service for the man so identified, with a main clause expressing the  rewards this man receives. (Roughly paraphrased, in vs. 1  “whose dwelling you  protect, he has the best protector.”) With this structure set, the poet feels free to  attenuate and manipulate it. In our view, verses 2 and 3 are examples of this same  structure, but the yásya has been gapped in verse 2 and must be supplied from verse  1, along with a verb for 2a. Moreover, the main clause expressing the reward is  postponed until verse 3c, and there are three different relative clauses that it com
pletes (2a, 2bc, 3ab). The repeated vā’s (“or”) allow this submerged structure to be  discerned, despite the gapping. The three clauses define three different beneficiaries  of the Maruts’ favor: the sacrificer (2a), the poet himself (2bc), or the poet’s patron  (“prize-seeker” 3ab).
Verses 4–5 continue the fronted genitive pattern, but now with a demonstra tive pronoun, not a relative. The referent is still the Maruts’ client, and his success  becomes magnified in these verses; not only is his sacrifice a success (vs. 4), but he  subjugates the surrounding peoples, and his sacrificial offerings go all the way to  heaven (vs. 5).
Verse 6 abruptly switches to the 1st plural from the 3rd singular: it’s we who  have been performing all this sacrificial labor, and the poet implicitly identifies us with the anonymous hard-working and well-rewarded man of the first five  verses. The 3rd sg. sacrificer returns in verses 7–8, with the syntactic structure  switched: the main clause and happy reward precede the relative yásya clause (see  esp. vs. 7). The last two verses call on the Maruts for their help, especially against  aggressors.
Gotama’s penchant for elaborate and varied syntactic patterning has been noted  previously in the introductions to several of his hymns.
1. O Maruts of extensive might, certainly the man over whose dwelling  place you keep protective watch from heaven,
he has the best protector.
2. Or he by whose sacrifices (you were attracted), o you whose vehicle is  the sacrifice, or of the thoughts of which inspired poet
you heard the call, o Maruts—
3. Or for which prize-seeker you fashioned an inspired poet to follow, he will go to a pen full of cattle.
4. Of that hero here the soma has been pressed at the rituals of day(break)  on his ritual grass;
his solemn speech and exhilarating drink are being announced.
5. To him let the beings listen attentively, to him who dominates all the  separate peoples.
His are the refreshing drinks that have run even to the sun.
6. For through many autumns we have done pious work, o Maruts, with the help of the separate peoples.
7. O Maruts who receive the first of the sacrifice, let that mortal be  well-portioned
whose pleasurable offerings you will guide.
8. You superior men whose strength is real, you know the sweat of the one  laboring to exhaustion,
or the desire of the one who seeks the (ritual) track.
9. You whose strength is real—make it [=strength] manifest by your  greatness.
Smite the demon with your lightning.
10. Conceal the concealable darkness. Run over every rapacious one. Make the light that we desire.
## 87 Maruts
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
6 verses: jagatī
The gleeful density of descriptive adjectives in verse 1 opens this hymn with a bang.  It is only in the final pāda of this first verse that we encounter a verb—and its
218 I.87
subject is explicitly left unspecified (“whoever they are”). On the one hand, they  need not be named, as the descriptions are enough to identify them as Maruts; on  the other hand, it is frequently stated that individual Maruts can’t be told apart.  The next two verses (2–3) are more dynamic, depicting the Maruts’ usual wild jour
ney, with its thunder, lightning, and rain.
The first half of verse 4 returns to the style of verse 1, with a torrent of adjectives,  this time applied not to the plural Maruts, but to the singular “flock” (gaṇá). The  second half of this verse opens with the 2nd sg. verb “you are.” Although most inter preters take this as an address to the Marut flock, with a shift of person—and this  would be the default reading—we believe something more tricky is going on. The  patronymic of our poet Gotama is Rāhūgaṇa, whose second element is this word  “flock.” On the basis of this shared verbal designation, Gotama seems to be address ing himself and identifying himself with the Maruts, particularly as the “furtherer  of this insight,” that is, as a producer of sacral poetry arising from inner insight. (He  may call himself a requiter of debts because he pays with his verbal labor for the  benefits given by both gods and patrons.) He clarifies this identification in the fol lowing verse (5). We are poets because of our kinship with our ancestral father, that  is, the Marut flock (pāda a). As with them, our speech (“tongue”) is inspired by the  vision (“eye”) produced by soma (pāda b), and we aspire to emulate the Maruts, who  chanted to Indra to encourage him in the Vr̥tra battle and acquired a share in the  sacrifice (pādas cd). (The relationship between Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, the Maruts, and  verbal inspiration is explored even more elaborately in the following hymn, I.88.) The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a more conventional depiction of the Maruts.
1. Projecting power and strength, copious, unbowable, unfaltering,
possessing the silvery drink,
most delightful, most manly, with their unguents they have anointed  themselves—whoever they are—like the ruddy (dawns) with stars.
2. When you have set your mind on journeying on the byways like birds, o  Maruts, along who knows what path,
the casks on your chariots drip. Sprinkle ghee the color of honey for the  one who chants.
3. At their drives, at their journeys the earth trembles like one with faltering  step, when they hitch up, for beauty.
Playful, boisterous, with glinting spears, the shakers admire their own  greatness.
4. For such is the flock: youthful, self-propelling, possessing dappled horses,  irrepressible, showing mastery, swathed in powers.
And you are a real, irreproachable requiter of debts, a furtherer of
this insight here. Therefore you [=Gotama Rāhūgaṇa] are (also) a
bullish flock.
5. We speak by virtue of our kinship with our primordial father; the tongue  advances with the eye of soma. When, equipped with chant, they [=Maruts] reached Indra by their  labor, just after that they acquired names worthy of the sacrifice.
6. For splendor they join themselves with radiant beams, with rays, with  those equipped with chant—the well-spangled ones,
possessing axes and arrows, fearless. They know their own dear Marut  nature.
## 88 Maruts
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
6 verses: prastārapaṅkti 1, 6; triṣṭubh 2–4; virāḍrūpā 5
Metrically, thematically, and poetically complex, this hymn brings Gotama’s Marut  collection to a worthy end. It is structured as a “journey” hymn—the Maruts’ jour ney to and arrival at the sacrifice—but unlike the general run of such hymns, with  stereotyped and simple expressions, this is a superbly crafted example of the genre,  which develops in unpredictable directions.
The hymn is organized by pairs of verses. The first two describe the glittering  flight of the Maruts, in fairly typical terms, with special emphasis on their chariots.  The focus shifts to the waiting poets in the next verse pair (3–4). At the beginning  of verse 3 the Maruts are said to “have axes on their bodies.” This detail seems at  first just to continue the inventory of the Maruts’ equipment found in the previous  verses, but the poet turns it into a telling image: the poets will raise up their poems  “like trees,” thus inviting the Maruts to chop them down with their axes—that is,  to take possession of the poems. The next verse (4) picks up another superficially  straightforward characterization of the Maruts and complicates it with reference to  the poets. In verse 1 the Maruts were urged to “fly like birds” to the sacrifice; in verse  4 unspecified plural subjects “wheel like vultures” (pāda 1). In our view these vul tures are the poets (the Gotamas named later in the verse), mentally circling around  the dhī́ “insight, poetic vision” (pāda b) that they are seeking in order to produce a  bráhman, a “sacred formulation,” fit for the Maruts. In the second half of the verse  they succeed in making this bráhman (pāda c) and, in a different image, push the  fountainhead of poetic inspiration upward in order to drink from it (pāda d). They  had also been wheeling around the goddess vārkāryā́ (pāda 4b). This hapax has  been much discussed, and is generally considered to be the name of the Gotamas’  muse, their “Sangeskunst.” We will propose our own interpretation below.
The last two verses (5–6) depict the simultaneous arrival of the Maruts and of  the inspired thought for the poem in their honor, again in complex and obscure  imagery. The literary epiphany of a god is often marked linguistically by deictic  pronouns and/or the aorist of immediacy (“just now”). The last two verses of I.88  begin with paired double deictics: (vs. 5) etát tyád and (vs. 6) eṣā́ syā́ both mean
ing “this very,” and verse 5 contains also the aorist aceti “has just appeared/been
220 I.88
perceived,” marking the arrival of both the poem and the gods. Verse 6 is the most  enigmatic of the hymn, though the general situation is clear: the Maruts have just  arrived, and they are greeted—by something that both “sounds” and is “caused  to sound.” This something is identified as anubhartrī́, another feminine-gender  hapax; it seems a good interpretive strategy to attempt to connect the two mysteri
ous feminines, vārkāryā́ in verse 4 and anubhartrī́ here. Both of them are fairly easy  to understand on a literal level: the former means literally “water-maker,” while the  latter is made up of the preverb ánu and an agent noun of the root bhr̥. The lexeme  ánu-bhR̥has a quite specific value in the R̥gveda and Atharvaveda: it means “pen
etrate sexually, stick (one’s penis) in.” It is, of course, a piquant paradox that the  “penis wielder” should be feminine. With this meaning in mind, vārkāryā́ in verse 4  becomes somewhat clearer: the “water-maker” can also refer to the penis. But what  would be the figurative or metaphorical sense of these two words, and how, in par
ticular, can the literal sense be made to conform with the statements in verse 6 that  the object is question both sounds and is made to sound? The riddle is solved if we  assume that it is a musical instrument, and in fact that it is the first reference to the  “Indian lute,” the vīṇā (the first occurrence of that word is in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,  an early Vedic prose text), a noun of feminine gender. At least some of the forms  of this musical instrument bear a remarkable resemblance to male genitalia. The  poet brings his hymn to a climax with this clever sexual pun, which surely would  have been appreciated by the lusty Maruts. (This verse and its role in the hymn are  discussed in more detail in Jamison 1981.)
1. With your chariots fitted with lightning bolts and with spears, whose  wings are horses, accompanied by lovely chants, drive here, o Maruts. Fly here like birds, with highest refreshment for us, you masters of
artifice.
2. With the ruddy, tawny horses they drive at will for beauty, with their  horses that outstrip chariots—
provided with hatchets (the Marut flock) is sparkling like a brilliant.  They keep pounding the earth with the wheel-rim of their chariot.
3. For splendor you have axes on your bodies; (the poets) will make their  wise thoughts erect like trees
for you, well-born Maruts. The powerfully brilliant ones [=Maruts] are  running to the (pressing) stone.
4. For days, (like) vultures they have been wheeling around this insight for  you, and around the goddess “Water-Maker” [=penis =vīṇā].
Making a sacred formulation, with their chants the Gotamas have
pushed the fountainhead erect, for drinking.
5. Just now it has appeared, not (even) a wagon-trek away—the
(formulation) that Gotama (has made) in private for you, Maruts,
upon seeing your golden-wheeled (chariots) and (you) copper-tusked  boars streaking across (the sky). 6. Just now this “lady hornsman” [=penis-wielder =vīṇā] sounds in response  to you, Maruts, like the voice of a cantor.
(The player) has made (her) sound by the power of his hands, the way  women like it.
## 89 All Gods
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
10 verses: jagatī 1–5, virāṭsthānā 6, triṣṭubh 8–10
Unlike Gotama’s often clever and verbally inventive hymns to particular gods, this  hymn to all the gods has a dutiful air, and the gods chosen for inclusion (or exclu sion) don’t seem to conform to any pattern. Still, there is a pleasing symmetry,  especially at the beginning and end. This feature is clear in the first two verses of the  hymn, where the word bhadrá “auspicious” is applied both to the ideas that mortals  will acquire and turn into the praise hymns for the gods and to the favors that the  gods will bestow on the properly worshiping humans in return. These unspecified  benevolent gods return toward the end of the hymn (vss. 8–9), and the particular  favor we desire from them is to secure our proper length of life (see esp. vss. 8cd, 9),  the very request with which the first verse pair ended (vs. 2d)
In between are a series of verses invoking various gods and asking for their help.  The longest list is found in verse 3, but gods or cosmic forces are named in every  verse—from the very prominent, such as the various Ādityas (vs. 3) and Indra (vs.  6), to the obscure and marginal, notably Tārkṣya (vs. 6c), a deified racehorse, to  judge from its other appearance in the R̥gveda (X.178). The final verse (10) returns  to the Ādityan emphasis of verse 3 by identifying their mother Aditi with the most  important cosmic features, kinship relations, and beings.
1. Let auspicious ideas come here to us from all sides—undeceivable,  uncircumscribable, bursting out—
so that the gods will be (ready) to increase us always, will be our
unfaltering protectors every day.
2. The auspicious benevolence of the gods is for those who aim straight; let  the generosity of the gods roll down toward us.
We have reverently approached the fellowship of the gods: let the gods  lengthen our lifetime for us to live.
3. Them do we call upon with our age-old formal invocation
[=nivid]: Bhaga, Mitra, Aditi, Skill unfailing,
Aryaman, Varuṇa, Soma, the Aśvins. May well-portioned Sarasvatī
create joy for us.
4. At this let the Wind blow us a remedy that is joy itself. At this (let)  Mother Earth, at this (let) Father Heaven,
222 I.90
at this (let) the soma-pressing stones (be) joy itself. To this, o holy
Aśvins, give ear.
5. The one who holds sway, the lord of the moving and the still, who  quickens insight, do we call upon for help,
so that Pūṣan will be (ready) to increase our possessions, will be a
guardian, an undeceivable protector for our well-being.
6. Well-being for us (may) Indra of strengthened fame (establish);
well-being for us (may) Pūṣan of all possessions;
well-being for us (may) Tārkṣya of indestructible wheel-rims; well-being  for us may Br̥haspati establish.
7. The Maruts having dappled horses, having Pr̥śni as mother, charging to  beauty, coming regularly to the rites,
the men having Agni as tongue and the Sun as eye: may all the gods  come here to us with help.
8. Might we hear (only what is) auspicious with our ears, o gods; might we  see (only what is) auspicious with our eyes, o you who are worthy of  the sacrifice.
Having praised (you?), with sturdy limbs and bodies might we traverse  the lifetime that has been established by the gods.
9. A hundred autumns are now in front (of us), o gods, where you have  made old age for our bodies,
where sons become fathers. Do not harm our lifetime in the midst of  our progress.
10. Aditi is heaven. Aditi is the midspace. Aditi is the mother; she is the  father, she the son.
Aditi is the All Gods, the five peoples. Aditi is what has been born,
Aditi what is to be born.
## 90 All Gods
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9
In this hymn as in the last one it is clear that Gotama did not reserve his best efforts  for All God hymns. With its elementary phraseology and patterned repetitions this  hymn is blessedly easy to read but offers little of interest. It falls into three clear  parts, which may well have been originally separate (though the hymn does not dis
turb the pattern of hymn arrangement in the Saṃhitā): verses 1–5, 6–8 (these two  segments in the same meter), and 9.
The first segment begins with the principal Ādityas as our guides (vs. 1)  and  touches briefly on their general benefits to mortals in the next three verses. The  final verse (5) is more specifically focused on the ritual interchange: the hymns we offer to the gods should produce cows in return. The next segment (vss. 6–8) sim ply attributes metaphorical “honey” to all natural phenomena, while the last verse  (9) expresses the hope that a variety of gods will be luck or welfare for us. This final  verse is highly reminiscent of a much longer such litany in VII.35.
1. With straight guidance let Varuṇa, let Mitra the knowing guide us; let Aryaman jointly with the gods.
2. For they are goods-possessors of goods; unerring, they with their  mighty powers
guard the commandments everywhere.
3. They will extend shelter to us, the immortals to the mortals,
thrusting away hatreds.
4. Let them clear out paths for us for easy passage—Indra, the Maruts, Pūṣan, Bhaga, (all those) to be extolled.
5. And (make) our poetic insights tipped with cows, o Pūṣan and Viṣṇu  traveling your ways;
make us possessed of well-being.
6. Honey do the winds (blow) to the one who follows truth; honey do the  rivers stream.
Honeyed be the plants for us.
7. Honey by night and at dawn; honeyed is the earthly realm.
Honey be Father Heaven for us.
8. Honeyed be the tree for us, honeyed the sun.
Honeyed be the cows for us.
9. Luck for us Mitra, luck Varuṇa; luck be Aryaman for us—
Luck for us Indra and Br̥haspati; luck for us Viṣṇu of the wide strides.
## 91 Soma
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
23 verses: triṣṭubh 1–4, gāyatrī 5–16, uṣṇih 17, triṣṭubh 18–23
Long and metrically disunified, this hymn no doubt falls into distinct segments, but  there is no scholarly agreement about the exact divisions. Some verse groupings are  found together in later liturgical texts (e.g., vss. 16–18, which, though in three dif ferent meters, agree in contents), but in other cases there is no external evidence. It  is possible that the triṣṭubh verses at the beginning (vss. 1–4) and those at the end  (vss. 19–23) belong together, with the dimeter verses 5–16 (plus 17–18) having been  inserted between them. This is suggested by the fact that verse 19 starts with the  same sequence as the beginning of verse 4 (yā́ te dhā́māni), and also by the apparent  ring between 1a prá cikitaḥ and 23d prá cikitsā.
In any case this hymn shares both the rather simplified rhetoric and the totalizing  thematics of Gotama’s hymns to the All Gods. Soma is identified with numerous224 I.91
gods (see, e.g., vss. 3, 5) and is credited with multiple cosmogonic deeds (e.g., vs.  22) and martial powers (e.g., vs. 21). Especially in the gāyatrī verses he is begged for  all sorts of aid and comradeship.
Since this is not a Soma Pavamāna hymn and is not found in the IXth Maṇḍala,  the ritual details that dominate that maṇḍala are essentially absent here. The  exception is the aforementioned triad of verses 16–18, each of which contains a  form of ā́ √pyā “swell,” an idiom used of the soaking of the soma stalks in water  to make them swell up before their pressing. As this action occurs before the puri
fication process proper, it is hardly mentioned in the IXth Maṇḍala (twice in fact,  once [IX.31.4] in an exact repetition of the present vs. 16 in a hymn attributed  to our poet Gotama Rāhūgaṇa), while it is the most prominent ritual detail in  this hymn.
1. You, Soma, have become conspicuous through our inspired thought.  You—lead along the straightest path.
Through your guidance, o drop, our insightful forefathers had their
share in the treasure among the gods.
2. You, Soma, become very intent through your intentions; very skillful  with your skills, all-knowing.
You are a bull through your bullish powers, your greatness. You became  brilliant through your brilliancies, drawing the gaze of men.
3. The commandments of King Varuṇa are yours; lofty and deep is your  domain, o Soma.
You are blazing pure, like dear Mitra. You are besought for skill like  Aryaman, o Soma.
4. Your domains that are in heaven, that are on the earth, that are in the  mountains, in the plants, in the waters—
with all those, being well-disposed and not angry, King Soma, accept  our oblations.
5. You, Soma, are lord of the settlements; you are king and Vr̥tra-smasher. You are auspicious intention.
6. And if you will wish us to live, Soma, we will not die.
(You are) the lord of the forest to whom praise is dear.
7. You, Soma, (establish) good fortune for the great man, you, for the  youth who pursues the truth;
you establish skill for living.
8. You, King Soma—guard us on all sides from the one who bears malice. No comrade of one such as you could suffer harm.
9. Soma, your forms of help that are joy itself for the pious man,
with those become our helper.
10. This sacrifice here—having delighted in this speech, come near to it. Soma, be (ready) to strengthen us. 11. Soma, we who know speech strengthen you with our hymns.
Very compassionate to us, enter us.
12. Fattening the livestock, smiting afflictions, finding goods, increasing  prosperity,
Soma, be a good ally to us.
13. Soma, take pleasure in our heart, as cows do in pastures,
as a young man in his prime does in his own home.
14. O Soma, the mortal who will take pleasure in your comradeship, o god, him does skill accompany, him does the sage poet.
15. Make a broad space for us against imprecation; Soma, protect us from  narrow straits.
Be a comrade well disposed to us.
16. Swell up! Let your bullish power come together from all sides, Soma. Be there at the gathering for the prize.
17. Swell up, most exhilarating Soma, with all your shoots.
Become our comrade of best fame, to strengthen us.
18. Let your milk-drinks come together and together your prizes, together  the bullish powers of you who vanquish hostility.
Swelling up for the immortal, Soma, establish your own highest
measures of fame in heaven.
19. Those domains of yours that they sacrifice to with oblation, let all these  of yours be encompassing the sacrifice.
Fattening the livestock, furthering (us), bringing good heroes, not
smiting heroes, o Soma, advance to our doorways.
20. Soma gives a milk-cow, Soma a swift steed, Soma a hero fit for action— one fit for the residence, for the rite, for the assembly, one who brings  fame to the forefathers—(gives these to the man) who will do ritual  service to him.
21. Invincible in combats, in battles a deliverer, winning the sun, winning  the waters, herdsman of the community,
born at raids, granting good dwelling and good fame, conquering—you  would we celebrate, o Soma.
22. You, Soma, begot all these plants here; you the waters, you the cows. You have stretched across the wide midspace; you have uncovered the  darkness with your light.
23. With your god(like) mind, god Soma, battle for a share of wealth for us,  mighty one.
Don’t let it hold out on you. You are master of heroism. On behalf of  both (men and gods? / singers and patrons?) be on the lookout in the  quest for cattle.
226 I.92
## 92 Dawn (1–15), Aśvins (16–18)
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
18 verses: jagatī 1–4, triṣṭubh 5–12, uṣṇih 13–18
This metrically complex structure with two different dedicands must originally have  consisted of several independent hymns—probably, with Oldenberg, verses 1–4,  5–8, 9–12, 13–15, 16–18, all but the last dedicated to Dawn. Indeed, the first two  segments (vss. 1–4 in jagatī, 5–8 in triṣṭubh) appear to be partial variants of each  other, the first describing multiple Dawns (except vs. 4), the second a single Dawn.  There are precise agreements in lexicon, phraseology, and imagery, particularly  between verses 1–2 and 5–6, that go beyond standard shared Dawn vocabulary. The  seductive dancing girl of verse 4 also reminds of the smiling siren of verse 6. The  third segment (vss. 9–12) has fewer connections with the first two, but is themati cally unified, especially by the emphasis on “diminishing/belittling” (all expressed  by the root mī in different combinations) in verses 10–12.
All three of the segments in trimeter meter (that is, through vs. 12) contain arrest ing images, and the poet enjoys exploiting ambiguities to poetic effect. In verses 1  and 12, for example, he uses different syntactic constructions in the simile and the  frame because the verb held in common by both can be either reflexive or transitive;  in verse 3 the pun inherent in the root arc (both “shine” and “chant”) allows the  introduction of a simile involving female work-songs, though the dawns themselves  are presumably not chanting.
The last two segments, in uṣṇih meter, to Dawn and the Aśvins respectively (vss.  13–15, 16–18), are, not surprisingly, less complex. Both hope for the arrival of the  divinities at the sacrifice, accompanied by plenty of presents.
1. These very Dawns have made themselves a beacon. In the eastern half of  the dusky realm they anoint their beam [=sacrificial post].
Presenting themselves, as bold ones present arms, the reddish cows, the  mothers come toward (us).
2. Their ruddy beams have flown up at will. They have yoked their reddish  cows, easy to yoke.
The Dawns have made their patterns as of old. A gleaming beam have  the reddish ones propped up.
3. They chant [/shine] like women busy with their labors, (coming always)  along the same route from afar,
conveying refreshment to the man of good action [=sacrificer], the man  of good gifts, the man who sacrifices and presses soma all the days.
4. She strews ornaments on herself like a dancing girl. She uncovers her  breast like a ruddy (cow) her udder [?].
Making light for all creation, Dawn has opened up the darkness as cows  (would) their pen. 5. Her gleaming ray has appeared opposite. She spreads herself out,  thrusts away the black void.
The Daughter of Heaven has propped up her bright beam, her
ornament, like (a priest) propping up the sacrificial post, the
ornament at the ceremonies, and anointing it.
6. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness. Dawn, dawning,  is making her patterns.
Like one aiming to please, she, shining forth, smiles for splendor. She of  the lovely face has awakened (us?) to benevolence.
7. Light-filled leader of liberalities, the Daughter of Heaven is praised by  the Gotamas.
O Dawn, mete out prizes rich in offspring, rich in men, founded on  horses, tipped with cows.
8. O Dawn, might I attain this glorious wealth, rich in good heroes,  founded on horses, with alien-slaves as its forelock—
o you of good portion, who with fame of wondrous power radiate
forth, motivated by (desire for) the prize, to lofty (wealth).
9. The goddess, overseeing all creatures, (like) an eye, facing toward them,  shines forth widely.
Awakening all life to activity, she has found the speech of every
zealous one.
10. Being born again and again though ancient, (always) beautifying  herself to the same hue,
like a successful (gambler) with the best throw who diminishes the stake  (of his opponent), the goddess keeps diminishing the lifetime of the  mortal as she ages him.
11. Uncovering the ends of heaven, she has awakened. She keeps her sister  [=Night] far away.
Diminishing human (life-)spans, the maiden radiates forth with the eye  of her swain [=Sun].
12. The bright, well-portioned one spreading herself as if (dispersing)  cattle, like a river (spreading) its surge, she has whitened forth widely. Not belittling the divine commandments, she has come into view,
appearing along with the rays of the sun.
13. Dawn, bring that bright (gift) here to us—you who are rich in
prize mares—
by which we may acquire both progeny and posterity.
14. Dawn, here today—o radiant one rich in cows and horses—
richly dawn forth to us, o liberal-spirited one.
15. So yoke the ruddy horses today! O Dawn rich in prize mares;
then convey to us all good portions.
228 I.93
16. Aśvins, (drive) your circuit that brings cows and gold, right up to us,  wondrous ones.
Stop your chariot nearby, like-minded ones.
17. You two, who have made your signal-call (reach) all the way to heaven  and at the same time made light for the people,
convey nourishment here to us, you Aśvins.
18. The two gods, embodiments of joy, wondrous, of golden course— let (the priests) waking at dawn convey them here, for soma-drinking.
## 93 Agni and Soma
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
12 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–8, gāyatrī 9–11, triṣṭubh 12
Another metrically complex hymn, this is the last attributed to Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  in Maṇḍala I. Despite the variety of meters, the piece is unified by the emphasis on  the two gods to whom it is dedicated, and especially by the presence of the dvandva  compound agnī́-ṣómā “Agni and Soma” in every verse. This compound is found  only twice elsewhere in the R̥gveda (both times in Maṇḍala X). Although Agni and  Soma are the quintessential ritual divinities, each representing a crucial sacrificial  substance, this is the only hymn in the R̥gveda explicitly dedicated to them together,  and it is a fairly banal product. However, it is worth noting that, at least in our  view, V.44, sometimes called the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda, seems to concern  Agni and Soma simultaneously, though it is identified in the Anukramaṇī as an All  God hymn.
The essential unity of the hymn is also discernible in its fairly simple  thematic-cum-syntactic structure, which regularly constructs the verse as a rela tive clause referring to the actions of a pious mortal (“whoever serves [etc.]... ”),  and a main clause expressing his reward (see vss. 2–3, 8, 10), as well as in repeated  vocabulary in the earlier and later parts (see, e.g., matches between vss. 2 and 8, 3  and 10). The hymn also has an outer ring: the last word (12d śruṣṭimántam “having  an attentive hearing”) recalls the first verb of the hymn (1b śr̥ṇutam), the imperative  “hear, listen!”
One part of the hymn stands out, verses 4–6, which ascribe various mythological  deeds to the pair. Curiously, the deeds in verses 4 and 5 are really more appropri ate to other gods: the mysterious Br̥saya and the theft in verse 4 are found also  in a hymn to the river goddess Sarasvatī (VI.61.1, 3), while verse 5 sounds like  a generic praise of Indra. In verse 6, however, we do find mythological material  appropriate to the two gods addressed, namely the story of the stealing of those  gods. This is, tellingly, the only place in the hymn where the two gods are treated  separately: Mātariśvan is the figure who stole fire, while the falcon’s theft of soma  from heaven is also often alluded to. 1. Agni and Soma, hear this call of mine, you bulls.
Delight in the well-spoken hymns. Become refreshment for the
pious man.
2. Agni and Soma, whoever today renders this speech as service for  you two,
for him establish an abundance of heroes, the thriving of cattle, an
abundance of horses.
3. Agni and Soma, whoever will piously perform a poured offering or the  preparation of an oblation for you,
he along with his offspring will attain to an abundance of heroes and a  complete lifespan.
4. Agni and Soma, this heroic deed of you two has become conspicuous— that you stole the provender, the cows from the niggard.
You brought low the posterity of Br̥saya. You found the single light for  the many.
5. You, Soma and Agni, of like resolve, placed these lights in heaven. You, Agni and Soma, released from imprecation and from reproach the  rivers that had been held back.
6. Mātariśvan bore the one here from heaven; the falcon stole the other  from the rock.
Agni and Soma, having grown strong through a sacred formulation,  you have made wide space for the sacrifice.
7. Agni and Soma, the oblation set before you—pursue it; yearn for it,  bulls; enjoy it.
Since you are providers of good shelter and good help, therefore
establish luck and lifetime for the sacrificer.
8. Whoever will serve Agni and Soma with an oblation, with a mind  turned toward the gods, with ghee,
guard his (ritual) ordinance; protect him from narrow straits; to his  clan, to his people extend great shelter.
9. O Agni and Soma, who have common property and a common  invocation—crave our hymns.
You two have come together among the gods.
10. Agni and Soma, whoever piously honors you with this (oblation), who  honors you with ghee,
for him shine loftily.
11. Agni and Soma, you will enjoy these oblations of ours here.
Together drive right up to us.
12. Agni and Soma, deliver our steeds (to safety). Let the ruddy (cows) who  sweeten the oblations swell up.
In us and in our benefactors establish powers. Give our ceremony an  attentive hearing.
230 I.94
Most of the next 22 hymns (94–115) are attributed to Kutsa Āṅgirasa by the  Anukramaṇī. Though a few (99–100, alternatively 105) have other poets named,  the presence of the Kutsa refrain in both 100 and 105 (99 is a one-verse hymn)  supports the unity of the collection. The Kutsa refrain, in triṣṭubh, “This let Mitra  and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven,” occupies the  last hemistich of the last verse of every hymn except I.97 (a gāyatrī hymn), 99 (a  one-verse hymn), and 104 (though this last hymn is in triṣṭubh).
The Agni hymns (94–99) are each dedicated to a different form of Agni. There  follow, in the normal order, five hymns to Indra, three to the All Gods, with miscel laneous other divinities making up the collection. The collection is at a generally  high level of poetic craftsmanship, but we will only single out for special mention  104, a challenging Indra hymn, 105, a famous and enigmatic All God hymn, and  the lovely Dawn hymn 113.
## 94 Agni
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15–16
The first fourteen verses in this hymn, in jagatī, end with the refrain “while in com pany with you may we not come to harm.” The first half of the hymn (vss. 1–7) gives  little motivation for this repeated, preventative hope: the subject is primarily the  sacrifice and the mutually beneficial relationship between Agni and the sacrificers.  But in verses 8 and 9 evil rivals of the sacrificer appear, and Agni’s aid against them  is requested. The next two verses (10–11) sketch the dangers posed by Agni himself  as the uncontrolled forest fire, and verse 12 calls for Agni’s help against the most  potent menace of all, the anger of the gods. The remaining verses (13–16) return to  the reassuring realm of properly performed sacrifice, with Agni providing benefits  and protection to the ritualist.
1. For Jātavedas, who deserves this praise, we would bring it into being like  a chariot, with our inspired thought,
for his solicitude for us in the assembly is beneficial. – O Agni, while in  company with you may we not come to harm.
2. For whom you perform sacrifice, that one reaches his goal. Without  assault he dwells in peace; he will acquire good heroes en masse.
He is powerful; constraint does not reach him. – O Agni, while in
company with you may we not come to harm.
3. Might we be able to kindle you. Send our insights to their goal. The gods  eat the oblation poured in you.
Convey the Ādityas here, for we are eager for them. – O Agni, while in  company with you may we not come to harm. 4. We shall bring the kindling, and we shall make oblations to you, while  being attentive at each (ritual) juncture.
For us to live longer, send our insights to their goal. – O Agni, while in  company with you may we not come to harm.
5. His kinfolk [=flames], the herdsmen of the clans, (of) both the
two-footed and the four-footed, roam by night.
You are the great, bright sign of dawn. – O Agni, while in company  with you may we not come to harm.
6. You are the Adhvaryu and the primordial Hotar, the Praśāstar and the  Potar, by birth the one placed in front [/Purohita].
Wise, you prosper all the priestly offices, o insightful one. – O Agni,  while in company with you may we not come to harm.
7. You of lovely face who have the same appearance in all directions— even though far in the distance, you shine across (it [=distance]) as if  right there.
You see across even the blind darkness of night. – O Agni, while in
company with you may we not come to harm.
8. Let the chariot of the soma-presser be in front, o gods, and let our  recitation dominate those whose insight is evil.
Take heed of this speech (of ours) and prosper it. – O Agni, while in  company with you may we not come to harm.
9. With fatal weapons strike away those of evil recitation and of evil  insight, and whatever rapacious ones are in the distance or nearby.
Then for the sacrifice and for the singer make an easy way. – O Agni,  while in company with you may we not come to harm.
10. When you have harnessed the pair of ruddy, wind-sped chestnuts to  your chariot and your bellowing is like that of a bull,
then you spur on the trees [/the winners] with (a flame) whose beacon  is smoke. – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come
to harm.
11. And then the winged are afraid of your roar, when your “drops”  [=sparks], consuming the grasslands, have spread out.
That (makes) an easy way for your own little “chariots” [=flames?]. – O  Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm.
12. This (Agni) here is to be suckled, as the unerring appeaser of the anger  of Mitra and Varuṇa and of the Maruts.
Have mercy upon us! Let the mind of these (gods) be once again (as  before). – O Agni, while in company with you may we not come
to harm.
13. As a god, of the gods you are Mitra, the unerring ally. As a Vasu [/good  one], of the Vasus you are the one beloved at the rite.
Might we be in your broadest shelter. – O Agni, while in company with  you may we not come to harm.
232 I.95
14. This is your benefit—that, when kindled in your own house and  bepoured with soma, you remain wakeful as the most merciful
(of gods).
You provide property and treasure to the man who ritually serves. – O  Agni, while in company with you may we not come to harm.
15. For whom you will perform ritual service, o you possessing good  property, for whom there is blamelessness in his entirety, o Aditi
[=Innocence],
and whom you will rouse with your beneficial power and with
generosity that provides offspring—might we be those.
16. You, o Agni, knowing the quality of good fortune—for us extend our  lifetime here, o god.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 95 Agni (or Agni Ausasa “Agni at Dawn”) ̣
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A typical puzzle hymn in many ways. The dedicand of the hymn, Agni, does not  appear by name until verse 9, and there are only two occurrences of the name, both  vocatives, in the whole hymn (the second being in the final, summary verse 11). The  address to Agni in verse 9 also breaks the uninterrupted 3rd-person description that  holds sway in the hymn up to that point. In what precedes, Agni’s characteristics,  the ritual service given to him, and the entities that render that service are referred  to in oblique fashion.
The Anukramaṇī suggests that it is Agni “at dawn” who is the subject of the  hymn, and indeed the hymn is specifically concerned with the birth, that is, the  kindling, of the ritual fire at daybreak. The birth imagery dominates the first verses,  with Night and Dawn suckling Agni as their calf (vs. 1) and the fingers of the offici
ants begetting him (vs. 2). Three births of Agni are mentioned in verse 3; though  there is some disagreement about whether the three entities mentioned in pāda b are  the sites of the three births, in our opinion only two sites are found there (the sea  and the heavenly waters), and the third birth is the ritual birth that occupied the first  two verses. Again in our opinion, the second half of verse 3 concerns the removal of  the oblation fire (the fire later called the Āhavanīya) to the east.
The remaining verses of the hymn describe the growing strength of the newly  born fire, first barely visible in the kindling sticks (vs. 4), but with flames rising  higher and higher (see esp. vss. 7–8) as he also spreads across the ground (vss. 8–9).  The expected requests for aid and gifts are rather muted and perfunctory (vss. 9cd  and 11b); the focus is on the riddling descriptions. The hymn displays some omphalos characteristics: the middle verses (5–6) show  responsion, and there is a wisp of a ring in the lexical repetitions between verses 2  and 9. But the omphalos effect is not strong.
1. The two of different form [=Night and Dawn] proceed, having (the same)  good goal: one after the other, the two suckle their calf.
At the one [=Dawn] he becomes tawny, possessing his own powers; in the  other [=Night] he is seen blazing, intensely lustrous.
2. The ten (fingers) beget this babe of Tvaṣṭar—the tireless young women  (beget the babe) to be carried about.
Sharp-faced, self-glorious, shining widely among the peoples—him do  they lead around.
3. They attend upon his three births: one in the sea, one in the heaven, in  the waters.
(Going) forth along the forward quarter of the earthly realms [=to
the east], directing the (ritual) sequences, he has distributed them in  proper order.
4. Who of you perceives this one in hiding? The calf begets his mothers  with its own powers.
The babe moves away from the lap of the many hardworking women, the  great poet possessing his own powers.
5. The beloved one, manifest, grows strong among them—the self-glorious  one upright in the lap of those aslant.
Both (world-halves) are afraid of (the babe) of Tvaṣṭar while he is being  born, (but turning) back to face him, the two give the lion pleasure in  return.
6. Both give pleasure like excellent wives. Like bellowing cows they (all  [=men]) have reverently approached (him) in their own ways.
He has become the skill-lord of skills, whom they anoint from the right  (/south) with oblations.
7. Like Savitar, he raises up his arms again and again. He aligns himself along  the two seams (of the world?), the fearsome one charging straight on.
He thrusts his blazing cloak up from his very self; he leaves behind new  clothes for his mothers.
8. He makes for himself a glittering form, which is (even) higher, as he  mingles with the cows and waters in his seat.
The poet keeps grooming his foundation all around, while his insight is  being groomed. He has become the meeting point with the assemblage  of the gods.
9. Your broad expanse encompasses your foundation, the wide-shining  domain of the buffalo.
When kindled, o Agni, protect us with all your self-glorious,
undeceivable protectors.234 I.96
10. He makes himself a stream in the wasteland, a way, and a wave. With  blazing waves he reaches the ground.
He takes all the old things [=dry wood] in his bellies; he roams within  the new, fruitful (plants).
11. In just this way, o Agni, as you grow strong though the kindling wood,  shine out richly for fame, o pure one.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 96 Agni (or Agni Draviṇodā “Agni Wealth-Giver”)
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: triṣṭubh
Simpler and more straightforward than the previous hymn, this one shares a final  verse (9) as well as some themes with I.95: see especially verse 5, where Night and  Dawn suckle Agni, the calf, which matches I.95.1, where the two mothers were  unidentified.
A pāda-length refrain is found in the first seven verses; in the last two of these  (vss. 6–7) the refrain is integrated syntactically into the verse: pāda c with pāda d in  6, the whole verse in 7, while in the first five verses the refrain is independent. Agni  has the epithet “wealth-giver” in this refrain, and in the eighth verse (post-refrain)  that epithet, repeated four times, is the focus. This verse expresses the poet’s desire for  the various types of Agni’s “wealth,” a typical finale. In the earlier parts of the hymn  (vss. 1–5), however, it is not Agni’s material gifts that are dominant, but his ritual and  cosmogonic properties, though his relation to wealth surfaces in verses 6–7 (see also  4a). This gradual integration of the refrain into the fabric of the hymn, both syn tactically and thematically, shows how a skillful poet can deploy even something as  apparently inert as an invariant refrain in building a forward-moving composition.
1. Being born with strength as of old, at once he has acquired all poetic  powers—yes indeed!
Both the waters and the holy place [=earth] make the ally [=Agni]
succeed. – The gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.
2. With the age-old formal invocation [=nivid] and the poetic power of Āyu  he begot these offspring of Manu’s people;
with Vivasvant [=Sun] as his eye (he begot) heaven and the waters. – The  gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.
3. The Ārya clans solemnly invoke him as the foremost one, bringing the  sacrifice to success when bepoured, aiming straight,
the son of nourishment, the Bharata, possessing buttery drops. – The  gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.
4. As Mātariśvan he brings prosperity filled with many desirable things; as  the finder of the sun, he finds a way for his lineage. He is the herdsman of the clans, the begetter of the two worlds. – The  gods uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.
5. Night and Dawn, ever exchanging their color, together suckle their  single child.
Between heaven and earth the bright ornament shines out. – The gods  uphold Agni, the wealth-giver.
6. The foundation of wealth, the assembler of goods, the beacon of the  sacrifice, the bird bringing our thoughts to success.
Protecting their immortality, protecting him, the gods uphold Agni, the  wealth-giver.
7. Both now and before the seat of riches, the ground of what has been  born and is being born,
the herdsman of what is and of much coming into being—Agni, the  wealth-giver, do the gods uphold.
8. The wealth-giver (shall offer) of his surpassing wealth; the wealth-giver  shall offer of (his wealth) along with superior men.
The wealth-giver (shall grant) us refreshment accompanied by heroes;  the wealth-giver shall grant long lifetime.
9. In just this way, o Agni, as you grow strong though the kindling wood,  shine out richly for fame, o pure one.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 97 Agni (or Agni śuci “Blazing Agni”)
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
8 verses: gāyatrī
Like the previous hymn, this one has a refrain, which is also not always syntacti cally integrated in the verse. But here the independence is more jarring because the  refrain is just a participial phrase, not a self-contained clause. The rest of this brief  hymn consists of snatches of expressed hopes for the well-being of the sacrificers  and the patrons and for Agni’s aid in overcoming hostilities. The Sanskrit contains  a pleasing counterpoint of preverbs, which cannot be easily rendered in English.
1. Blazing away the bad for us, blaze wealth here, o Agni,
—blazing away the bad for us.
2. With a desire for good lands, for easy passage, and for goods we offer  sacrifice,
—(you) blazing away the bad for us—
3. So that the most fortunate one of these (would become) preeminent, and  preeminent our own patrons,
—(you) blazing away the bad for us—
236 I.98–99
4. So that we and our patrons would be further propagated through  you, o Agni,
—(you) blazing away the bad for us—
5. When the beams of powerful Agni go forth in all directions
—(you) blazing away the bad for us.
6. For you, o you who face in all directions, encompass (everything) in all  directions
—blazing away the bad for us.
7. O you who face in all directions, carry us across hostilities as if with a boat —blazing away the bad for us.
8. Carry us across (them), as if across a river with a boat, to well-being —blazing away the bad for us.
## 98 Agni Vaiśvānara
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
3 verses: triṣṭubh
A rather perfunctory and quite brief hymn, with phraseology borrowed from other  hymns. Verse 2 seems to refer to the myth of the Agni’s disappearance.
1. Might we be in the favor of Vaiśvānara, for he is the king and full glory  of the creatures.
Born from here, he surveys this whole (world). Vaiśvānara aligns himself  with the sun.
2. Sought in heaven and sought on earth, being sought, Agni entered all the  plants.
Sought forcefully, let Agni Vaiśvānara protect us from harm by day and  by night.
3. Vaiśvānara, let this come true of you: let riches and generous patrons  accompany us.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 99 Agni Jātavedas
Kaśyapa Mārīca
1 verse: triṣṭubh
This one-verse hymn is the shortest of the R̥gveda. Embedded in the Kutsa hymns  and placed at the end of his Agni cycle (I.94–98), it is the only hymn attributed to  Kaśyapa Mārīca in Maṇḍala I, though a number of hymns and verses in hymns are ascribed to him elsewhere, especially in Maṇḍala IX. Its message is simple and  straightforward. The imagery of the boat and the river matches that in I.97.7–8.  Both because of this agreement and because the first of Kutsa’s Agni hymns begins  with a praise of Jātavedas, also in the dative case (I.94.1a), this hymn seems well  integrated in the Kutsa cycle.
1. For Jātavedas we will press soma. He will burn down the property of the  hostile.
He will carry us across all difficult passages, across difficult transits, as if  with a boat across a river—Agni.
## 100 Indra
Five Vārṣāgira poets: R̥jrāśva, Ambarīṣa, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna, and Surādhas 19 verses: triṣṭubh
This first Indra hymn in the Kutsa collection is assigned by the Anukramaṇī to  five named poets with the patronymic Vārṣāgira, only one of whom (Ambarīṣa, of  IX.98) is known from elsewhere. However, the hymn ends with the Kutsa refrain  (vs. 19cd), and the Vārṣāgira attribution must come from the dānastuti, where the  names of these five poets are mentioned (vs. 17, see also 16).
The first fifteen verses (up to the dānastuti, vss. 16–19) end with a refrain  linking Indra to the Maruts, and one of the main themes of the hymn is com radeship:  Indra joined not only with the Maruts but with other like-minded  beings (see, e.g., vss. 4–5, 10–11). The context is almost exclusively martial,  as Indra joins with his forces and his powers to conquer various foes, though  his standard opponents, like Vr̥tra, are curiously absent. The insistent pres ence of the Maruts may mark this as a hymn for the Midday Pressing, where  Indra and Maruts share the oblation. The next hymn also has a strong Marut  presence.
The dānastuti finale begins (vs. 16) with the praise of the gift, a fine mare,  but, after naming the Vārṣāgiras (vs. 17), ends with straightforward praise of  Indra.
Verbally the hymn is structured by the frequent hemistich-initial occurrences  of the pronoun sá “he,” reinforced by plays on this syllable: for instance, verse 1c  satīnásatvā, 18cd sánat. There are also a number of hapaxes, whose translations are  provisional (see vss. 8, 12, 16).
1. He who, as bull at home with his bullish powers, is sovereign king of  great heaven and of earth,
the one having trusty warriors is to be invoked in raids. – Accompanied  by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
238 I.100
2. Whose course, like the sun’s, cannot be reached, (who has)  obstacle-smashing bluster in every raid,
the most bullish one (should come) with his comrades along his  own ways. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us  with help.
3. Whose paths, like those of heaven, go milking out (the milk of) their  semen, unencompassible in their vastness,
he, overcoming hatred, is victorious through his male powers.
– Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. 4. He has become the best Aṅgiras with the Aṅgirases, a bull with the  bulls, while being a comrade with his comrades,
a versifier with versifiers, preeminent along the routes. – Accompanied  by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
5. He, the skillful one, along with the Rudras [=Maruts] as if with his own  sons having conquered his foes at the time for men-conquering, along with the nest-mates [=Maruts] bringing to triumph (deeds)  worthy of fame. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for  us with help.
6. He, confounding the battle-fury (of the foe), the creator of the  battle-elation (of the allies), has won the sun along with our men on this very day, the lord of the settlements invoked by many.
– Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. 7. Him do his help(er)s [=Maruts] cause to take pleasure in the contest  of champions; him do the settled peoples make the protector of  their peace.
He alone is lord of every undertaking. – Accompanied by the Maruts,  let Indra be here for us with help.
8. Him they inspired [?] in the upsurgings of his vast power—the men  inspired [?] the man to help, inspired [?] him to the stakes.
He found the light even in blind darkness. – Accompanied by the  Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
9. He with his left (hand) will hold fast even the overweening (foes), in his  right will hold (all) winning throws massed together.
He, even in association with a weakling, is the winner of the stakes.  – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. 10. As a winner with his hordes, a winner with his chariots, he is known by  all the communities now today.
He with his male powers prevails over taunts. – Accompanied by the  Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
11. Since with his kindred or with his non-kin he will drive together (the  warriors? the spoils?) when the prize of battle (is at stake), he is  invoked by many in (many) ways
for the conquering of the waters, of life and lineage. – Accompanied by  the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. 12. He is the mace-bearer, the Dasyu-smasher, fearsome, mighty, of a  thousand insights and a hundred counsels, skillful—
like a beaker [?] in his vastness, belonging to the five peoples.
– Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
13. His mace roars alongside, sun-winning, like the reverberating, vehement  bellowing of heaven.
Him do gains follow, him prizes. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let  Indra be here for us with help.
14. Whose inexhaustible measure in its vastness, (like our) hymn, will coil  around both worlds on all sides,
he will deliver (us) with his strategies while he is rejoicing.
– Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
15. The limit of whose vast power no gods in their divinity, nor mortals,  nor even the waters have reached—
he projects with his energy beyond earth and heaven. – Accompanied  by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.
16. A chestnut, dusky mare, marked with “stalks” [?] and a blaze,
heaven-bright, a portion of the wealth of R̥jrāśva,
drawing a chariot with bulls at the chariot-poles, gladdening, has
distinguished herself among the clans of Nahuṣa.
17. This very hymn is for you, Indra the bull. The Vārṣāgiras greet your  largesse—
R̥jrāśva with his sidekicks, Ambarīṣa, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna, Surādhas. 18. Invoked by many in (many) ways, having smashed the Dasyus and the  Śimyus to the earth, he has laid them low with his missile.
He has won a dwelling place along with his bright comrades [=Maruts];  he has won the sun; he has won the waters—he with the good mace.
19. Let Indra always speak up for us. Not led astray, may we win the prize. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 101 Indra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī 1–7, triṣṭubh 8–11
The structure of this hymn is under tight control, giving pleasure both by its pre dictable repetitions and by their breaches. Though the hymn falls into two unequal  metrical segments, there is no reason not to consider it a unity: the two segments  complement each other, structurally and thematically. (One might fancifully com pare it to the 8 / 6 structure of a Petrarchan sonnet.)
The jagatī section (vss. 1–7) is characterized most obviously by its refrain, occu pying all of the fourth pāda of each verse. Interestingly this refrain lacks the name
240 I.101
Indra, though this name appears in first or (modified) second position in each of  the third pādas, save for verse 1. Instead it is his connection with the Maruts that  is foregrounded in the refrain, using the same stem, though in a different case,  that appeared in the refrain of I.100. Verses 1 and 7 also deviate from the signa
ture stylistic feature of the middle verses (2–6), that the first three-fourths of these  verses are all relative clauses: a form of the relative pronoun begins each verse, and  each of the two subsequent pādas in each verse contains (and often begins) with  at least one. (Note the explosion of relative pronouns in the final verse 6: five in  three pādas.) This arrangement, with most of the verse devoted to relative clauses  but ending with a main clause refrain, reminds us of the famous Indra hymn II.12,  with its identificatory refrain “He, o peoples, is Indra!” But this one is more com
plex, in that Indra is not identified directly in the refrain. The jagatī section is also  demarcated by a faint ring, the verb “address” (prá... arcatā 1a, abhy àrcati 7c), and  by the fact that Indra is referred to only in the 3rd person in a series of definitional  descriptions in the indicative.
By contrast, the triṣṭubh verses (8–11) switch to direct address to Indra (save for  the final, summary verse with the Kutsa refrain) and to urgent invitations to him  to come to our sacrifice. The Marut theme is continued, however—already in the  first pāda of the first triṣṭubh verse (8a) with a vocative of the same stem (marútvant
“accompanied by the Maruts”) that dominated the jagatī refrain. (See also 9c, 11a.)  A faint ring also defines the triṣṭubh verses, with vr̥jána “(ritual) circle” in both 8b  and 11a.
As for content, it is largely familiar, praising Indra for his victories over various  enemies, for his aid to mortals hard pressed in battle, and for his steadfast lordship.  Needless to say, the Marut element is quite strong, as in the preceding hymn (I.110).  The most striking formulation may be found in the first verse, with its image of  Indra causing the fortresses of the enemy to abort their fetuses.
1. Address a nourishing speech to the exultant one, who, along with  R̥jiśvan, aborted the (strongholds) with their black embryos.
Seeking help from the bull with the mace in his right hand, the one
accompanied by the Maruts do we call for partnership.
2. Who with his bristling battle-fury smote the one with its shoulders apart  [=Vr̥tra =cobra], who smote Śambara, who smote Pipru who followed  no commandment,
Indra, who wrenched down insatiable Śuṣṇa—the one accompanied by  the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.
3. Whose great masculine nature Heaven and Earth (strengthen); in whose  commandment is Varuṇa, in whose is Sūrya,
Indra, whose commandment the rivers follow—the one accompanied by  the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.
4. Who of horses, who of cows is the herdsman exerting his will; who is  acknowledged as steadfast in every action, Indra, who is the weapon of death for the non-presser, even one
standing firm—the one accompanied by the Maruts do we call upon  for partnership.
5. Who is the lord of everything moving and breathing, who first found  the cows for the maker of sacred formulations,
Indra, who brought the Dasyus down low—the one accompanied by  the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.
6. Who is to be called upon by champions and who by the fearful, who is  called upon by those on the run and who by the victors,
Indra, whom all beings altogether set their sights on—the one
accompanied by the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.
7. At the Rudras’ [=Maruts’] direction he goes, wide-gazing; along  with the Rudras the maiden [=Rodasī] stretches her broad
expanse.
Indra the famed does the inspired thought address—the one
accompanied by the Maruts do we call upon for partnership.
8. Whether you, accompanied by the Maruts, will reach exhilaration in the  furthest seat or in the nearest (ritual) circle,
from there journey here to our ceremony: with desire for you we have  made an oblation, o you whose generosity is real.
9. With desire for you we have pressed soma, o very skillful Indra; with  desire for you we have made an oblation, o you whose vehicle is the  sacred formulation.
So, you with your teams, flocking with the Maruts—reach exhilaration  at this sacrifice here, on this ritual grass.
10. Reach exhilaration along with the fallow bays that are yours, Indra.  Unfasten your two lips; unloose the two nourishing streams.
Let your fallow bays convey you here, lovely-lipped one. Eagerly take  pleasure in our oblations.
11. As herdsmen of the (ritual) circle that offers praise to the Maruts, may  we win the prize with Indra.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 102 Indra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī 1–7, triṣṭubh 8–11
The structure of this hymn is superficially identical to that of its immediate prede cessor, I.101: eleven verses, the first seven in jagatī, the last four triṣṭubh. But the  tight syntactic and formulaic control of I.101 is not present here. Nonetheless, the
242 I.102
hymn is stitched together by lexical repetitions, and the two metrically diverse seg ments show especially strong lexical responsions.
The hymn begins with a difficult verse, which has received a number of incom patible interpretations. Ours is, perhaps, especially bold, in that we assume that  the poet (in the 1st person) is speaking to a “you” who is not the god (as most  people assume), but the human praise singer, who may, in fact, be the poet him self. (Such incompatibilities in address are not infrequent in such ritual situ ations; the poet often addresses himself in the 2nd person; see discussion in  Jamison 2009a.) The poet thus announces that the composition of his poem is  complete and it is ready to be recited to its object, the god, who is present in the  verse in the 3rd person.
After naming the cosmic forces whose activities provide support to Indra (vs.  2), the poet turns to two intertwined themes: the aid we beg from Indra in conflicts  and contests, where, we know, our rivals and foes will be seeking the same aid  (esp. vss. 3–6, 9–10), and the immeasurable power Indra commands, power that  accounts for the desire of all contenders to get him on their side (esp. vss. 6–8).  These latter verses play with forms of the root mā “measure, match.” The transi
tion between the jagatī and triṣṭubh sections is especially nicely handled: having  claimed in verses 6–7 that Indra has no match in strength, verse 8 takes up the  exact phrase from verse 6, but asserts that indeed there does exist such a match— but it consists of the whole cosmos in all its divisions. The next verse (9) of the  triṣṭubh section densely repeats and rings changes on the lexicon and thematics  from the early parts of the hymn and thus signals a kind of ring composition.  Verse 10 seems to announce the success of our petitions, though in a different  lexicon. The final verse (11) is a refrain verse, repeated from I.100.19, the last half  of which is the general Kutsa refrain.
1. I present this great visionary thought to you, the praiser of this great  one, when the Holy Place [=the earth] has been anointed for you.
The one victorious in his upsurging and his outsurging, Indra with his  vast power did the gods cheer on.
2. His fame do the seven rivers bear; Heaven and Earth, the Broad One,  (bear) his wondrous form, lovely to see.
For us to look upon (it), to put our trust in (him), the Sun and Moon  roam, traversing in regular alternation, o Indra.
3. Help this chariot forward to win, o bounteous one, which we will cheer  on as victorious for you in the clash,
and help us in the contest with your mind, much-praised Indra. Extend  shelter to us who seek you, bounteous one.
4. Might we conquer their defense with you as yokemate. For us uphold our  stake in every raid;
for us, Indra, create wide space and easy passage. Break the bullish
powers of our rivals, bounteous one. 5. As these peoples here, each for itself, in admiration are calling for you  along with your help, o securer of prizes—
mount our chariot, to win—because your mind, Indra, when it’s settled,  is victorious.
6. Cow-conquering are his two arms—he himself is of unmatched resolve,  providing a hundred forms of help in every action, creating tumult.
In the disorder (of battle) Indra is a match (for all) in his strength. So  the peoples vie in invoking him when they wish to win.
7. Your fame reaches higher than a hundred, bounteous one, and even  more—higher than a thousand among the separate peoples.
The great (Earth), the Holy Place has sparked you who are matchless.  So you keep smashing obstacles, you stronghold-splitter.
8. The (only) match for your strength has threefold divisions: it is the three  earths, o lord of men, and the three luminous realms.
You have grown beyond this whole world. You are without rival, Indra,  by birth and from of old.
9. It is you we call upon first among the gods; you have become the one  victorious in battles.
Let him make this bard of ours fervid and effusive; let Indra put our  chariot in front at the surging out.
10. You have conquered; you have not withheld prizes in the petty contests  and in the great ones, bounteous one.
You, the strong, we hone for help. So, Indra, spur us on in the
challenges.
11. Let Indra always speak up for us. Not led astray, may we win the prize. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 103 Indra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Like I.102, this hymn begins with a difficult verse, treating the two aspects of  Indra’s power, situated on earth and in heaven respectively. We can assume that  the earthbound power has to do with the aid he provides to mortals in battle,  while his heavenly power is displayed by his cosmogonic deeds. The poet claims  the two types of power are mixed together equally and the result serves as a sort  of beacon, an odd image—but the underlying notion must be that of the light  (of Dawn, of Agni) that connects heaven and earth, frequently referred to as a  beacon. Similarly Indra’s twin powers link the heavenly and earthly realms and are  conspicuous in both.244 I.103
Both types of power are treated in the hymn, which has an omphalos struc ture. The cosmogonic deeds are found in the outer frame, verses 2 and 7 (and  8ab), particularly the slaying of Vr̥tra. The inner verses (3–6) concern Indra’s  involvement with us, the Āryas, as we confront our traditional foes, the Dāsas  and the Dasyus, who do not share in the values of the Ārya community. The  omphalos itself consists of verse 4, where Indra acquires several names mark ing his successful progress. The following verse (5)  presents itself as a sort of  epiphany: the people are exhorted to behold the results of Indra’s actions and  therefore believe in his existence. The omphalos structure is marked not only  thematically but verbally. Note the two occurrences of śrád-dhā “trust” in the  inner ring of verses 3 and 5.
The responsion in the outer ring (specifically vss. 2 and 7)  is more complex  and more interesting. Verse 2c begins with the signature formula of the Vr̥tra  saga: áhann áhim “he slew the serpent,” and 7b ends with the word áhim “serpent.”  The phrase in verse 2 lacks the frequent accompaniment, the weapon (vájra) in  the instrumental “with his mace,” while 7b has vájreṇa. But on the surface the  action in that verse is entirely different:  “he woke the sleeping serpent with his  mace.” As argued elsewhere (Jamison 1982/83 and 2007: 110–12), this is a formal  “pun,” which means exactly the opposite of its surface sense. Indra did not nudge  the snake with his weapon to wake him up to fight. Instead the poet combines  the formal causative shape of the verb “awaken” (lit., “cause to awaken”) with  the semantics of its object “sleeping (serpent),” to produce an underlying form  “cause (the serpent) to sleep.” In Vedic, as in English, “cause to sleep / put to  sleep” is a euphemism for “kill,” and “waken the sleeping serpent with the mace”  is simply a particularly clever way to say “slew the serpent.” Since this phrase is  anticipated by the standard áhann áhim expression, which is in the structurally  responsive position in the ring, an alert audience would have no trouble catching  this deep-structure pun.
1. This highest Indrian power of yours did the sage poets hold fast earlier,  (the one) far away and this one here—
this one here on the earth and the other one of his in heaven. The one  (part) is mingled (with the other) equally, like a beacon.
2. He held the earth fast and spread it out; having smashed with his mace,  he sent forth the waters:
He smashed the serpent; he split apart Rauhiṇa; he smashed the cobra— the bounteous one with his powers.
3. He who by nature provides support, being trusted for his power, roved  widely, splitting apart the Dāsa strongholds.
As knowing one, o possessor of the mace, cast your missile at the Dasyu;  strengthen Ārya might and brilliance, o Indra.
4. This is for him who is accustomed to it. Bearing the name “bounteous,” a  name to be celebrated through these human generations, the mace-bearer was advancing to smash the Dasyus when he took for  himself the name “son (of strength)” for fame.
5. Look here at this abundant success of his; put your trust in the heroism  of Indra.
He found the cows; he found the horses; he the plants, he the waters, he  the trees.
6. For the bullish bull of abundant action, for him whose bluster is real, we  will press the soma,
for him, the champion who, tearing them out like a highwayman, goes  about distributing the possessions of the non-sacrificer.
7. This heroic deed you carried out, Indra—that you “awakened” the  sleeping serpent with your mace, as it were.
The wives [=waters?] and the birds [=Maruts?] applauded you who were  roused to excitement; all the gods applauded you,
8. When, o Indra, you smashed Śuṣṇa who brings bad harvest, Pipru, and  Vr̥tra and smashed apart the strongholds of Śambara.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 104 Indra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: triṣṭubh
At nine verses, this final hymn of the Kutsa Indra cycle is longer than its immediate  predecessor by one verse. On this basis Oldenberg identified it as an Anhangslied  (a supplementary hymn appended to the end of a divinity cycle), an opinion sup ported by the fact that, alone of the Kutsa hymns (I.94–98, 100–115), it lacks the  Kutsa refrain always found in the last hemistich of the last verse of each hymn.  (This applies only to trimeter hymns; the gāyatrī hymn I.97, not surprisingly, also  lacks it.) But if “supplementary” suggests something attenuated or in decline, that  suggestion is emphatically false. This hymn is extraordinary complex and challeng ing, especially in its mythological portion (vss. 3–5), and we are far from solving the  many puzzles it presents. It may have been inserted just here in the Saṃhitā because  the mythological portion in part concerns a foe named Kuyava, or the demon “of  bad grain,” that is, bad harvest, mentioned as having been slain by Indra in the last  verse of the preceding hymn (I.103.8ab). There are also several other lexical connec tions between I.103 and this hymn, particularly the two forms of śrád-dhā “trust”  in each hymn, which may have encouraged the insertion, or even the composition,  of this supplementary poem.
As in many hymns, an invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice is found in  the first verse. But some of the features of this verse give us a taste of what is to
246 I.104
come. For example, the apparently straightforward simile in pāda b, rendered here  as “like a steed sounding off,” is actually a triple pun (impossible to convey in  translation): the participle suvānáḥ can belong to three different verbs: “sound,”  “impel,” and “press (of soma).” When Indra takes his seat on the ritual ground, he  is compared to a horse neighing, to a horse that has been driven to the place where  it takes its rest, and finally to soma (which itself is often compared to a horse) being  pressed in its womb. In fact the same phraseology is applied to soma elsewhere (cf.  IX.70.7).
The second verse introduces the theme that will dominate the mythological por tion, the importance of having Indra and the other gods on our side in the battle  against the traditional, perhaps indigenous, enemies of the Ārya, identified as Dāsa  (vs. 2) and Dasyu (vs. 5). The word “color” in the final pāda of the verse is a fre quent way of referring to a cohort, a unified group of people. Our urgent need for  Indra and his aid returns after the mythological portion, in fact starting with the  second half of verse 5. The poet twice asserts his trust in Indra’s power (6d, 7a); this  may not be a mere repetition but refer rather to the two aspects of Indra’s power,  as described in the first verse of the preceding hymn (I.103.1), partly in heaven and  partly on earth. And he also issues a series of peremptory commands, especially  negative commands, to Indra from verse 5ab through verse 8, which ends with a  plea not to split our “eggs” or our “cups,” in our opinion male and female genitalia  respectively. The final verse (9) is again a simple invitation to soma.
The problematic verses 3–5ab need to be interpreted within this outer frame work, the context of Indra’s martial aid to the embattled Ārya. Our interpretation  of these verses is quite speculative and differs from those of others, but we have  attempted to construct a coherent account, while supplying as little extraneous  material as possible. What is immediately striking about the first of these verses  (3) is the presence of two female figures, the “two maidens of Kuyava,” who are  obviously rivers. More rivers appear in the second half of the next verse (4cd).  Now the advance of the Ārya is often obstructed by rivers, which must be forded  (see esp. III.33), and important battles are fought beside these barrier rivers (see  esp. VII.18). The two maidens of Kuyava thus could be rivers initially controlled  by forces impeding the progress of the Ārya. The charming image of the foamy riv
ers “bathing in milk” turns swiftly cruel: “may they both be smashed,” perhaps a  reference to their violent confluence with a mightier river still, the Śiphā (otherwise  unknown). This verse reminds us of V.30.9, in another Indra hymn, in which Indra  confronts an enemy who “made women his weapons” and who has two streams,  perhaps the same rivers as here. Once Indra recognizes the situation, he initiates  battle.
V.30.9 Because the Dāsa made women his weapons, what can they do to me?  His armies lack strength.
Since he [=Indra] distinguished both his [=Dāsa’s?] streams, therefore Indra  advanced on the Dasyu to fight. The point may be that though rivers are formidable natural obstructions, they are  also, by grammatical gender, feminine, and females are, by nature, weak. Conceiving  of rivers as women robs them of their power and allows them to be overcome. The  analogue of Indra’s distinguishing the streams in V.30.9 may be found in our verse  5ab, where the “guide” of the Dasyu, which we interpret both physically as the  streambed and metaphorically as his strategy, is revealed. It is another female who  reveals and recognizes it, and, on the basis of shared lexicon, we think that Dawn  is the figure lurking behind this unidentified feminine. Dawn regularly makes things  visible and knows the way forward, and here she leads the Aryan forces to the very  seat of the enemy.
These Ārya forces are personified in Āyu in verse 4ab. His “navel” has been  effaced for two reasons. On the one hand, the mythic hero Āyu is the son of the  Apsaras Urvaśī and the mortal king Purūravas, but his lot was cast with mortals  when his mother abandoned him (see X.95), and in this sense his true origins have  been, at the least, muddied. But there is a more positive aspect to this phrase; since  he and the other Ārya continue to move forward into ever new territory, where they  came from recedes into the background: their future is forward.
What remains to be explained is the emphasis on the rivers’ “carrying away”  (áva-√bhR̥3a, 3b; √bhR̥4b). Here we feel there may be a latent ritual reference. The  “final bath” (avabhr̥thá, a derivative of áva-√bhr̥) of the sacrificer and his wife at  the end of the classical śrauta ritual is purificatory, removing all ritual pollution.  And it is a commonplace in Vedic that rivers and moving waters in general carry  away stain. The mention of bathing in 3c, combined with the emphasis on “carry
ing away,” suggests that a notion of expiation and ritual cleansing has been super imposed on this battle scene. What is not clear is what is being carried away. Is it  pollution produced by some offense of the enemy? An even more speculative idea  is inspired by the mention of “foam” (phénam 3b): in a well-known myth Indra cuts  off the head of the demon Namuci with the foam of waters (see VIII.14.13), having  tricked him by forswearing all conventional weapons. It is possible that the rivers  here are carrying away the defilement that Indra acquired from this underhanded  killing. It is worthy of note that the Namuci myth is treated in V.30.7–8, right before  the verse cited above about enemy streams.
The last word has not been said about this dense and fascinating hymn, but we  hope to have advanced the discussion.
1. A womb has been prepared for you to sit down in, Indra. Sit down in it  here, like a steed sounding off,
once you have released your vitality [/the birds] and unhitched the horses,  who convey you so well to the mealtime, evening and morning.
2. These men here have come to Indra for help. Even now, immediately, he  should go to them along the roads.
The gods will extinguish the battle-fury of the Dāsa. They will convey  our “color” to welfare.
248 I.105
3. She who knows his [=Kuyava’s?] will carries away by herself; (the other)  by herself carries away the foam in her water.
The two maidens of Kuyava bathe in milk: may they both be smashed in  the torrent of the Śiphā (River).
4. The navel [=lineage, origin] of the Āyu to come has been effaced. He  lengthens his life through the (dawns) in front. The champion reigns. The Añjasī, the Kuliśī, (the Sarasvatī) whose husband is the virile one— they, impelling the milk, carry it with their waters.
5. When that guide [=both riverbed and strategy] of the Dasyu was  revealed, she who recognized it [=Dawn] went to his seat as if
straight home.
Now then, bounteous one, just grant us acclaim. Don’t hand us over, like  a careless man his bounties.
6. You, Indra—give us a share in the sun, in the waters, in blamelessness, in  the praise of the living.
Do no harm to our inner delight. Trust has been placed in your great  Indrian power.
7. And, I think, trust has been placed in this (power) of yours right here. As  bull, bestir yourself toward great stakes.
Don’t (put) us in an unprepared womb, o much invoked one. Indra,  grant vitality and the pressing (of soma) to those who hunger
for them.
8. Don’t smite us, Indra; don’t hand us over. Don’t steal our dear delights. Don’t split apart our “eggs,” o bounteous and powerful one; don’t split  our “cups” along with their contents.
9. Come here nearby. They say you have lust for soma. Here it is,
pressed: drink it, for exhilaration.
Being of broad expanse, rain it into your belly. Like a father, hear us  when you are being called on.
## 105 All Gods
Trita Āptya or Kutsa Āṅgirasa
19 verses: paṅkti, except mahābr̥hatī 8, triṣṭubh 19
This famous hymn has been the victim of a range of unlikely interpretations;  among them that it tells the story of “Trita in the Well” (so Geldner; for discus sion of the verse on which this is based, see the introduction to I.106); that it is  the lamentation of a sick man (so Oldenberg, Noten); that it is the complaint of a  poet who’s unemployed because his patron has died (so Bloomfield 1916: 114–15);  or that it is a charm against a solar eclipse (so Lüders 1959: 576–78). The range  and incompatibility of these hypotheses testify to the interpretive challenges of the poem. Nonetheless, guided by the structure, we feel that we have arrived at an  internally consistent and satisfying interpretation. (See also discussion in Jamison  2007: 82–85).
It is an omphalos hymn. It has nineteen verses, but the last verse is in a different  meter from the rest and does not end with the refrain found in the other eighteen  verses (but rather with the standard Kutsa refrain), so we can legitimately consider  it extra-hymnic for structural purposes. The exact center of the hymn is then verses  9 and 10. As in a number of other omphalos hymns, they are responsive, beginning  identically, with amī́ yé numeral (“those which...”). Their content is, it seems,  mystical—at any rate, it has provoked much scholarly discussion. Also as in other  omphalos hymns a set of concentric verses surround this central pair. But its struc ture is even more intricate than most other omphalos hymns, in that there is also a  certain forward progress in the hymn, held in tension with the architectonic sym
metry of the omphalos structure.
The subject of the hymn is the poet’s doubts and anxieties about the efficacy of  the sacrifice and, in particular, of his own ritual speech and thus about the relation ship between the earthly and heavenly realms, if that relationship exists at all. It is  this central doubt that prompts the refrain “Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you  two world-halves.” The poet wishes both Heaven and Earth to listen to and bear  witness to what he says and thereby prove that there is a relationship between them,  a relationship established and maintained by the sacrifice.
The poet begins with a happy picture of cosmic (vs. 1) and earthly (vs. 2) order,  but he quickly turns to his fear about the maintenance of this order (vs. 3). He fol lows with a series of baffled questions to the gods, introduced by pr̥chāmi “I ask.”  He first questions Agni, the divinity nearest to him, about the fate of his previous  poems (his “truth”), and then turns to the gods in heaven to ask what happens in  heaven to the sacrifice and the poetic formulations of mortals (vss. 5–6). These  questions express almost a loss of faith in the efficacy of these mortal techniques  to make contact with the gods. His anguish grows stronger in verses 7–8, where his  painful thoughts are memorably compared to wolves, to cowives, and to mice gnaw
ing their own tails.
There follows the pair of verses (9–10) we have just identified as the omphalos,  which seem to constitute the oblique response to the poet’s cry for reassurance—a  cosmic vision in which the poet’s connection and kinship with the distant heaven is  manifest, and is attested to by what may be his forefather, the seer Trita Āptya. The  precise nature of this vision is not clear to us, but it seems to involve celestial bod
ies and celestial movement. After this central mystery, the rest of the hymn seems  designed to calm the worries expressed by the poet, in the reverse order of his first  expression, by asserting divine participation in the mortal’s ritual acts. In verse 11 a  cosmic wolf is kept at bay, similar to the earthly, metaphorical one that pursued the  poet in verse 7. In the following verses effective words are established anew (12); Agni  takes charge of the sacrifice (13–14); Varuṇa produces poetic formulations (15); and  the path to heaven and the relations between god and men are made safe (16–17).
250 I.105
Thus I.105 has two structures held in tension—one is the symmetrical architec tural one of concentric rings of verses around a central pair, and the other is the  forward movement of question and answer, worry expressed and reassurance given.  The two structures can be diagrammed as follows:
Structure of I.105 (a): architectural:
1–2 cosmic and earthly order
3 fears about maintaining order
5–6 questions about fate of ritual offerings
7–8 more anguish; thoughts compared to wolves, cowives, mice
9–10 Omphalos: cosmic vision
11 wolf kept at bay
12 effective words reestablished
13–15 gods take charge of sacrifice
16–17 order restored
[18: structure destabilized? (see below)]
Structure of I.105 (b): forward movement:
1–8 poet’s questions and worries
11–17 (gods’) answers and reassurances
The intricacy of the responsive patterns and the tension between the two struc tures compel our attention and provide us with aesthetic satisfaction, even though  we find ourselves puzzled by much of the actual content of the hymn. But there is  a final sly trick that complicates the hymn even more. In the last verse (before the  extra-hymnic one), the wolf returns—the wolf that tracked the poet in verse 7, but  whose threat was curbed by divine power in verse 11. But it seems that that check  was only temporary; the wolf comes back, enigmatically but with a lurking men ace, in verse 18. Have the poet’s fears been calmed after all? Has he really regained  his faith in the efficacy of his own poetry and of the sacrifice they serve? Or will  the wolf prey upon him again? The hymn leaves these questions open and in this  way subtly and uninsistently undermines the reassuring structure of the poem and  destabilizes its architecture. It is a masterful stroke.
1. The moon is here in the waters; the fine-feathered one [=sun] runs in  heaven.
They do not find your track, o lightning bolts with golden fellies.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
2. Those with tasks (pursue) each his own task. The wife draws her
husband to herself. The two squeeze out the bullish milk; having surrendered, he milks out  his sap [/having bound him about, she milks out his sap].
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
3. Let not, o gods, yonder sun fall down [/be miscarried] from heaven. Let us never be in want of the beneficial somian (sap).
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
4. I ask the nearest one [=Agni] about my sacrifice. Will the messenger  [=Agni] declare this:
Where has my earlier “truth” gone? Who bears it now?
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
5. You gods, who are yonder in the three luminous realms of heaven— What is truth for you, what is untruth? Where is the age-old offering  for you?
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.

– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
7. I am one who used (always) to speak some (speeches) at the pressing. But cares (now) pursue this same me, like a wolf a thirsting wild beast. – Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
8. They scorch me all about, like cowives, (like ailing) ribs.
Like mice their tails, the cares gnaw at me, your praiser, o you of a
hundred resolves [=Indra].
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
9. The seven reins [=seers?] that are yonder—to there is my umbilical cord  stretched.
Trita Āptya knows this. He rasps (witness) to the kinship.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
10. The five oxen that stand yonder in the middle of great heaven— this is now to be proclaimed among the gods—they have turned back  (toward home), directed toward a single end.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
11. These fine-feathered ones sit in the middle, on the stairway to heaven. They keep away from the path the wolf that is overtaking the boisterous  waters.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
12. Anew has this (speech) been established worthy to be spoken, good to  proclaim, o gods.
The rivers stream truth; the sun stretches through the real.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
13. O Agni, it exists: this friendship of yours among the gods, worthy to be  hymned.
252 I.106
Seated here, sacrifice to the gods for us as you did for Manu—as the  one who knows better.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
14. Seated here as Hotar, as for Manu, (facing?) toward the gods, as the one  who knows better,
Agni sweetens the oblations, the wise god among the gods.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
15. Varuṇa creates sacred formulations; we implore him as the finder of  the way.
He opens up the thought in our heart. Let a newer truth be born.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
16. The path that is yonder, belonging to the Ādityas, made as something to  be proclaimed in heaven—
it is not to be overstepped, o gods; o mortals, you do not (even) see it. – Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
17. Trita, set down in a well, calls upon the gods for help.
Br̥haspati has heard this, making a broad (space) from narrowness.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
18. Because the reddish wolf has suddenly seen me going along the path, he rears up on having noticed me, like a carpenter with a stitch in
his side.
– Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.
19. With this song may we, with Indra on our side and possessing hale  heroes, be preeminent in the community.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 106 All Gods
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7
After the challenges and pyrotechnics of the previous hymn, this simple appeal  for aid to a range of divinities comes as something of a relief. It is a hymn of the  most straightforward All God type. The most notable feature of the hymn is verse  6, which closely parallels verse 17 of I.105. Here the poet Kutsa is “squeezed down  into a pit” and appeals to the gods for help. There Trita is found in a similar situ
ation and makes the same appeal. The verse conforms better to its context in this  hymn than in I.105: in I.106 the refrain filling half of each verse calls on the gods  to “rescue us from narrow straits,” as exemplified by Kutsa’s confinement, whereas  in I.105 the poet is tormented by spiritual doubts that only in that one particular verse are conceived of as physical confinement. It seems possible that I.105.17 was  adapted from this hymn.
1. Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, the Maruts’ troop, and Aditi do we call  upon for help.
– Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
2. O Ādityas, come here for our wholeness; o gods, become luck itself in the  overcoming of obstacles.
– Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
3. Let the Fathers help us, those good to proclaim, and the two goddesses  [=Heaven and Earth], whose sons are the gods, strong through truth. – Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
4. Inciting the prizewinner Narāśaṃsa here—with appeals for grace we beg  Pūṣan, who rules over heroes.
– Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
5. O Br̥haspati, make easy passage for us always. The luck and lifetime of  yours that was set in place by Manu—that we beg for.
– Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
6. Kutsa the seer, squeezed down into a pit, called on Indra, smasher of  Vr̥tra, lord of power, for help.
– Like a chariot from a hard place, o good ones of good gifts, rescue us  from all narrow straits.
7. Let goddess Aditi, with the gods, keep guard over us. Let the god  Protector protect us, not keeping his distance.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 107 All Gods
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
3 verses: triṣṭubh
The first verse of this brief and elementary hymn continues the theme of “broad  space out of narrowness” found in the refrain of the previous hymn.
1. The sacrifice goes toward the benevolence of the gods: o Ādityas, become  compassionate.254 I.108
Your benevolent thought, inclined our way, should turn you hither—that  which will be excellent at finding a wide place even out of narrow
straits.
2. Let the gods come close to us here with help, being praised with the  melodies of the Aṅgirases.
Indra with his Indrian powers, the Maruts with the Maruts, Aditi with  the Ādityas will extend shelter to us.
3. In this of ours shall Indra take delight, in this shall Varuṇa, in this Agni,  in this shall Aryaman, in this Savitar take delight.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 108 Indra and Agni
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
13 verses: triṣṭubh
For the ritual pairing of Indra and Agni, see the introduction to I.21. This hymn  is structured by patterned repetition that becomes decidedly more restrictive in the  second half of the hymn. The vocative of the dual dvandva “o Indra and Agni”  occurs in every verse but the middle one (vs. 6). In the first five verses this vocative  moves around the verse (though it always occurs in second position in its pāda), but  in the second half (vss. 7–13) it always occurs in second position of the first pāda,  after the subordinator yád “when” (except in the final verse [13], where it appears  after evā́ in the same position). The second half of these same verses (7–12) is a  refrain, which has slowly been assembled in the earlier part of the hymn: its sec ond half is also found in 1d and 6d, and in part in 5d; the end of its first half first  appears in 6c. These elements all come together first in 7cd. And the first halves of  these same verses are thematically superimposable: in each verse several different  potential locations of the gods are listed, which they are urged to leave in order to  come to us.
The contents of the first six verses are more various. The united front and the  joint activities of Indra and Agni are emphasized, though some verses have a dis tinctly Indraic character (esp. vs. 3, where both gods are called “Vṛtra-smashers”)  and some are more in Agni’s camp (esp. vs. 4). The middle verse (6) is, as noted  above, the only verse without an address to the gods (or any mention of them  by name), and it also contains 1st-person direct speech. In it the speaker recalls  his words when he “chose” the gods, presumably as his priests, and these words  announce the necessity for competing with others (in this case the other human  “lords” [not, in our opinion, the nonhuman Asuras, the later Vedic opponents of  the gods]) for the gods’ visitation, the theme that will dominate the rest of the hymn.  Though we hesitate to call verse 6 an omphalos, it does serve as pivot point for the hymn, and its deliberately different structure from both what precedes and what  follows marks it and its position as exceptional.
1. O Indra and Agni, the brightest chariot of yours, which looks upon all  creatures,
with that one drive here, standing together on the same chariot. Then  drink of the pressed soma.
2. As great as this whole creation here is, deep and wide-spreading in its  expanse,
so great let this soma here be, for drinking—enough for you two, to  your thinking, o Indra and Agni.
3. For you two made your own joint name auspicious, and you two, o  Vr̥tra-smashers, are conjoined.
O Indra and Agni, you bulls, having sat down jointly, drench yourselves  in the bullish soma.
4. You two being anointed when the fires have been kindled, with your  offering spoon extended, having strewn your own ritual grass,
with the sharp soma drinks poured about, drive in our direction to
(display) benevolence, o Indra and Agni.
5. O Indra and Agni, which manly deeds you two have done; which forms  and bullish powers you have made your own;
which age-old propitious partnerships are yours—with these, drink of  the pressed soma.
6. Since I said first on choosing you two: “This soma here is to be invoked  by us in competition with the (other human) lords,”
toward this confidence (of ours) (which has) come true—yes! drive here.  Then drink of the pressed soma.
7. When, o Indra and Agni, you are reaching exhilaration in your own  dwelling, when at a brahmin’s or at a king’s, o you who deserve the
sacrifice,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
8. When, o Indra and Agni, you are among the Yadus, the Turvaśas, when  among the Druhyus, the Anus, the Pūrus,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
9. When, o Indra and Agni, you are on the lowest earth, on the middle  one, and on the highest one,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
10. When, o Indra and Agni, you are on the highest earth, on the middle  one, and on the lowest one,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
11. When, o Indra and Agni, you are in heaven, when on earth, when in the  mountains, in the plants, in the waters,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
256 I.109
12. When, o Indra and Agni, at the rising of the sun in the middle of the  heaven you bring yourselves to exhilaration by your own power,
from there, bulls—yes! drive here. Then drink of the pressed soma.
13. Thus, o Indra and Agni, having drunk of the pressed soma, entirely  conquer all rich prizes for us.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 109 Indra and Agni
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Dedicated to Indra and Agni like the preceding hymn, this one takes a livelier and  less predictable course, characterized by a 1st-person voice. This voice announces  in the first two verses that he seeks a better state and must turn to Indra and Agni  for help because his kin-group is unreliable. This is expressed in general terms in  the first verse, but in bitter particulars in the second. Interestingly the deficient rela
tives in that verse are both connections through the female line: his daughter’s hus band and his wife’s brother (the word syālá is specialized for this relationship). In a  patrilocal system like that of ancient India, neither of them would have particularly  close ties to him.
The theme of kinship is continued in verse 3, where the forefathers, a more  satisfactory set of relatives, provide the model for the performance of a soma  sacrifice for Indra and Agni, the success of which seems to have been in doubt  (see 3a). This soma sacrifice continues in verse 4, where the Aśvins, somewhat  surprisingly, participate in its performance. Perhaps the idea is that even other  gods, the Aśvins and the goddess Holy Place, do ritual service to the great Indra  and Agni.
The subject gradually shifts to praise of the two gods’ powers (vss. 5–6) and  requests for their aid (vss. 7–8). In verse 7 the forefathers return, and the poet,  rather indirectly, compares the sacrificial compact the gods had with these ances tors with the one he hopes he has established now.
1. Because, seeking a better state, I have surveyed with my mind my kith  and kin, o Indra and Agni,
there exists for me no other (fatherly) solicitude than you two. So I have  fashioned for you a thought that seeks the prize.
2. Because I have heard of you two as better givers of abundance than a  no-count son-in-law or brother-in-law—
so with an offering of soma for you, o Indra and Agni, I beget a newer  praise. 3. Crying in distress, “Let us not cut the reins,” guiding themselves
following the skills of the forefathers,
the bulls bring about exhilaration for Indra and Agni—for the two
(pressing) stones are in the lap of the Holy Place.
4. For you two, o Indra and Agni, for your exhilaration, the goddess, the  Holy Place, eagerly presses the soma.
You two, o Aśvins, with your auspicious hands and lovely palms—rinse  it with honey, infuse it in the waters.
5. O Indra and Agni, I have heard of you as most powerful at the
distribution of goods, at the smashing of obstacles.
Having sat on the ritual grass at this sacrifice here, make yourselves  exhilarated on the pressed soma, o you of extensive domains.
6. You extend beyond the bordered domains at the battle cries, you extend  beyond earth and heaven,
beyond the rivers, beyond the mountains in your greatness, beyond and  over all other creatures, o Indra and Agni.
7. Bring it to the fore, ready your skill, you two with the mace in your arms.  Help us, o Indra and Agni, with your skills.
Here are the very rays of the sun with which our forefathers were in  communion.
8. O stronghold-splitters with the mace in your hands, ready your skill.  Help us, o Indra and Agni, in the raids.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 110 R̥bhus
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5 and 9
The R̥bhus are originally mortal craftsmen who achieved immortality because of a  series of marvelous deeds. This hymn begins in the ritual here-and-now, where the  R̥bhus, already immortal, are offered their share of the sacrifice by the poet-sacri ficer, who speaks in the 1st person. The story of their achievement is then begun  in verse 2, with the R̥bhus depicted as itinerant skilled workers, rather like the poet  and his comrades (thus perhaps holding out the hope that immortality will come  to them as well). The particular feats they accomplished are then recounted, with  special emphasis on their turning Tvaṣṭar’s single cup into four (vss. 3, 5), the oth ers hurriedly covered in verse 8, interspersed with pleas for their favor.
1. My (ritual) work has been stretched out, and it is being stretched out  again. My sweetest insight is being recited for a hymn.
258 I.111
Right here is the sea (of soma) belonging to the All Gods. Satiate
yourselves together on the (soma) prepared with the svāhā-cry, o R̥bhus. 2. When, facing front, you shrewd ones went forth in search of your daily  bread, kind of like my pals,
o sons of Sudhanvan, after your fill of roaming you came to the house  of Savitar the pious.
3. Then Savitar impelled you to immortality when you went to make  Agohya heed.
This very beaker, the drinking vessel of the lord [=Tvaṣṭar]—though it  was single, you made it fourfold.
4. Toiling with labor, with surpassing skill, the cantors, though they were  mortal, reached immortality.
The sons of Sudhanvan, the R̥bhus, who have the sun as their eye, in a  year became infused with insights.
5. Like a field with a sharp stick, the R̥bhus measured into parts the single  cup, which was gaping—
they who were crying in want at the praise-invocation, seeking highest  fame among the immortals.
6. Let us pour an inspired thought with our know-how, like ghee with a  ladle, for the men of the midspace.
Those who by their surpassing skill followed (the way) of the father of  this one, the R̥bhus mounted to their prize, the realm of heaven.
7. (One) R̥bhu is for us a newer Indra by his power; (another) R̥bhu is a  good one by his goods, a giver by his prizes.
With the help of you, o gods, on a favorable day may we stand up to the  battle thrusts of those who don’t press soma.
8. O R̥bhus, you carved out a cow from a hide; you sent the mother to join  with her calf again.
O sons of Sudhanvan, superior men, with your skillful work you made  your two elderly parents young.
9. Aid us with prizes at the winning of prizes: o Indra, accompanied by the  R̥bhus, break out bright benefit.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 111 R̥bhus
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5
Unlike the preceding hymn, this one passes over the R̥bhus’ marvelous achieve ments very quickly, in the first verse, in favor of appeals to those gods to use their skills for our benefit (esp. vss. 2–3). The signature verb is √takṣ “fashion.” In the  final two verses (4–5) it opens out into a sort of All God hymn, with appeals first  to Indra as master of the R̥bhus and then to other gods with little or no connection  to the R̥bhus.
1. They fashioned the smooth-rolling chariot, working with their
know-how; they fashioned the two fallow bays that convey Indra and  bring bullish goods.
They fashioned—the R̥bhus—for their parents youthful vigor; they  fashioned for the calf a mother to stay by it.
2. For our sacrifice fashion R̥bhu-like vigor; for will, for skill (fashion)  refreshment along with good offspring.
So that we may dwell peacefully with a clan possessing hale heroes, you  shall establish this Indrian strength for our troop.
3. Fashion winning for us, o R̥bhus, winning for our chariot, winning for  our steed, o men.
Might you bring to pass victorious winning for us always, conquering  kin and non-kin in battles.
4. Indra, master of the R̥bhus, do I call upon for help, and the R̥bhus, the  Vājas, the Maruts for soma-drinking.
Both Mitra and Varuṇa now and both the Aśvins—let them impel us to  winning, to insight, to victory.
5. Let R̥bhu sharpen winning for the taking; let Vāja, victorious in the  clash, help us.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
## 112 Aśvins (except Heaven and Earth 1a, Agni 1b) 
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
25 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 24–25
This tightly structured hymn conforms to the list format frequently found in Aśvin  hymns. A pāda-length refrain ends every verse but the last two (24–25), urging the  Aśvins to come with the same forms of help they have used in past rescues and  marvelous deeds. The first three quarters of each verse provides examples of said  deeds; as often in Aśvin hymns, many of these involve little-known or unknown  episodes and proper names of otherwise unidentified clients of the Aśvins, inter
mixed with allusions to myths and legends found at least glancingly elsewhere. This  fast-moving catalogue occupies most of the hymn (starting especially with vs. 5,  through vs. 23), and its effect is to convince the audience that, with so many helpful  interventions behind them, the Aśvins will surely answer our calls for help, as finally  articulated in vss. 24–25.
260 I.112
The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–4), while the rhetorical pattern is still being estab lished, is more difficult and more syntactically and conceptually dense. The climax of  this portion of the hymn is verse 4, where the rhetorical pattern gets its full shape but  the content has not yet settled into the litany that follows. The pervasive double mean ing of verse 4 cannot be conveyed directly in translation, for each part of the verse, on  the one hand, identifies an unnamed divinity associated with the early-morning sacri fice (Wind [Vāyu], Agni, and Soma) by characteristic epithets, while, on the other, all  three descriptions are also appropriate to the Aśvins’ chariot (already mentioned in vs.  2), on which they will make the journey constantly alluded to in the refrain.
1. I reverently invoke Heaven and Earth, to be first in their thought; (I  reverently invoke) Agni and the very bright gharma drink, for (the
Aśvins) to seek on their journey.
Those with which you stimulate the decisive act in the match, for (us to  gain) a share—with those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
2. For you two to give them, inexhaustible (gifts?), easy to carry, have  mounted onto your chariot, as if onto an eloquent (vehicle) for
thinking.
Those with which you help (us) to seek insights at the cultic act—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
3. You two rule over these clans at the command of the divine, through the  might of the immortal.
Those with which you swell the uncalved cow, you superior men—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
4. Those through which the earth-encircler [=Wind] is distinguished in the  might of his extension, through which he of two mothers [=Agni] is  distinguished, transiting in his transits,
through which the wide-gazing one [=Soma] became of triple thought— with those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
5. Those with which from the waters you raised up rasping Rebha, who was  confined and bound, and raised up Vandana to see the sun,
with which you helped Kaṇva desiring gain—with those forms of help  come here, o Aśvins.
6. Those with which you revived Antaka, languishing in foreign parts, with  which unwavering ones you revived Bhujyu,
with which you revive Karkandhu and Vayya—with those forms of help  come here, o Aśvins.
7. Those with which (you made) Śucanti gain the stakes, keeping good  company, (with which you made) the heated pot comfortable for Atri, with which you helped Pr̥śnigu and Purukutsa—with those forms of help  come here, o Aśvins.
8. Those powers with which, o bulls, you (helped) the outcaste, made the  blind to see, the lame to go, with which you released the quail that had been swallowed—with those  forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
9. Those with which you revived the honeyed, inexhaustible river, with  which you revived Vasiṣṭha, you unaging ones,
with which you helped Kutsa, Śrutarya, Narya—with those forms of  help come here, o Aśvins.
10. Those with which you revived Viśpalā, to pursue the way, to gain the  stakes in the contest with a thousand battle-prizes,
with which you helped Vaśa Aśvya and Preṇi [?]—with those forms of  help come here, o Aśvins.
11. Those through which, o you of good drops, a cask streamed honey for  Dīrghaśravas Auśija the merchant,
with which you helped Kakṣīvant the praiser—with those forms of help  come here, o Aśvins.
12. Those with which you swelled the Rasā (River) with a gush of water,  with which you helped the horseless chariot to victory,
with which Triśoka drove up ruddy cows for himself—with those forms  of help come here, o Aśvins.
13. Those with which you drive around the sun in the distance and you  helped Mandhātar [/the thinker] in (the battles for) lordship of lands, with which you helped the inspired poet Bharadvāja—with those forms  of help come here, o Aśvins.
14. Those with which you helped the great Atithigva Kaśojū and Divodāsa  at the smiting of Śambara,
with which you helped Trasadasyu at the stronghold splitting—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
15. Those with which you favor Vamra [/the ant], who drinks up, and  Upastuta, with which you favor Kali, who acquired a wife,
with which you helped Vyaśva and Pr̥thi—with those forms of help  come here, o Aśvins.
16. Those with which, o superior men, you sought a way for Śayu, with  which for Atri, with which for Manu long ago,
with which you drove the (cows?) of Śara for Syūmarśmi—with those  forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
17. Those with which Paṭharvan, with the might of his belly, shone like a  fire laid and kindled, on his drive,
with which you help Śaryāta in (the contest) for great stakes—with
those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
18. Those by which, o Aṅgiras, with your mind you two *find a way out  and go to the forefront at the opening up of (the cave) flooding with  cows,
with which you helped Manu the champion with refreshment—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
262 I.113
19. Those with which you brought home wives for Vimada or with which  you did your best to obtain the ruddy (cows),
with which you brought Sudevī (as wife) [/divine favor] for Sudās—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
20. Those with which you become weal for the pious man, with which you  aid Bhujyu, with which Adhrigu,
(and make) (the woman) R̥tastubh comfortable and easy-bearing—with  those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
21. With which you favor Kr̥śānu in shooting, with which you helped the  steed of the youth in speed—
you bring the dear honey that comes from the bees—with those forms  of help come here, o Aśvins.
22. Those with which you revive the superior man fighting for cattle at the  conquering of men, at the winning of land and descendants,
with which you help the chariots, with which the steeds—with those  forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
23. Those with which, o you of a hundred resolves, you promoted Kutsa  Ārjuneya, promoted Turvīti and Dabhīti,
with which you helped Dhvasanti and Puruṣanti—with those forms of  help come here, o Aśvins.
24. Make speech fruitful for us, o Aśvins; make for us inspired thought, o  wondrous bulls.
I call you down for help at a time when one shouldn’t gamble. Be there  to strengthen us at the winning of prizes.
25. Through the days, through the nights protect us all around, o Aśvins,  with your blessings that can come to no harm.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 113 Dawn (except Dawn and Night 1cd)
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
20 verses: triṣṭubh
Dawn often brings out the best in R̥gvedic poets, and this hymn is no exception.  It consists of separate groups of thematically unified verses without seeming dis jointed, because there is an overall theme: unity amid diversity.
In the first three verses Dawn is contrasted with her opposite number, her sister  Night, but they are eternally conjoined and regularly alternating according to the  divine plan. Verses 4–6, marked off by a pāda-length refrain, present the diversity  of the animate world. Dawn wakes all creatures, and they all have different goals to  pursue in their waking lives, while all being subject to Dawn. Verse 7 provides both  summary and transition; it almost sounds like a hymn-final verse. The substantial middle section of the hymn (vss. 8–15) sees a different kind of  unity in diversity, in what is perhaps the most challenging conceptual question  about dawn. Every day has a dawn and every day’s dawn is, in some sense, the  same, while being quite distinct. Today’s dawn has been preceded by countless many  and will be followed by countless many; she is both last and first. But she is also  the capitalized and personified single Dawn. This conceptual puzzle is presented in  verse 8 (especially the first half), and the gist and lexicon of 8ab are repeated in the  final verse of this section, 15cd, forming a ring around the section. The most dif ficult verse in the hymn, verse 10, also treats this same problem, and the next verse  (11) draws the melancholy conclusion: just as there were earlier dawns, now gone,  so were there earlier mortals who saw those dawns—and others will follow and  replace us, to see the dawns to come. Verse 13 provides indirect solace, by reframing  the many dawns as one Dawn, who dawned before, dawns now, and will continue  to dawn. (The other verses in this section, 9, 12, and 14, simply concern the current  Dawn, in fairly standard terms.)
The final section (vss. 16–20) begins (vs. 16) with a triumphal exhortation, which  indirectly counters the consciousness of inevitable death attending on time stated  in verse 11 with the announcement that life is lengthened by the advent of dawn.  The following verses treat the early-morning ritual: the response of the sacrificial  fire (vs. 17), the offering to Vāyu (vs. 18), the recitation and singing of praise (vss.  17–18), and, of course, the gifts that are distributed at the dawn sacrifice by Dawn  herself (vss. 17–20).
1. This fairest light of lights has come here. The bright sign, wide-reaching,  has been born.
Just as she [=Dawn] is impelled forth for the impulsion of Savitar, so  Night has left behind the womb for Dawn.
2. Having a gleaming calf, herself gleaming white, she has come here. The  black one [=Night] has left behind her seats for her.
Having the same (kin-)bonds, immortal, following one upon the other,  the two, Day (and Night), keep exchanging their color.
3. The road is the same for the two sisters—unending. They proceed on it,  one after the other, commanded by the gods.
They do not oppose each other, nor do they stand still, though well  grounded—Night and Dawn, of like mind but different form.
4. Light-filled leader of liberalities, the bright one has appeared. She has  opened out the doors for us.
Having stirred forth the moving world, she has looked out for riches for  us. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures.
5. The bounteous one (has awakened them), for (even) one who lies  crossways to move, for (another) one to seek wealth to his use,
for (even) those who see (only) a little to gaze out widely. – Dawn has  awakened all the creatures.264 I.113
6. (She has awakened) one for dominion, another for fame, another to  seek greatness, another to go to whatever his goal.
Living being are not alike in what they have in view. – Dawn has  awakened all the creatures.
7. This Daughter of Heaven has appeared opposite, dawning forth, the  youthful one with gleaming garment.
Holding sway over every earthly good, o well-portioned Dawn, dawn  forth here today.
8. She follows the troop of those who go away; she is the first of those  who, one by one, come hither—
Dawn, as she dawns forth, rousing up (every) living being, but
awakening no dead one at all.
9. Dawn, since you have caused the fire to be kindled, since you have  shone forth with the eye of the sun,
since you have awakened the sons of Manu who are about to sacrifice,  so you have made for yourself good profit among the gods.
10. How long (will it be) until she will be together with those who  (previously) dawned forth and those who will dawn forth now?
Bellowing, she yearns after the early ones; thinking ahead, she goes at  pleasure with the others.
11. They have gone, the mortals who saw the earlier dawn dawning forth. (This dawn) has now come to be gazed upon by us. And there are those  coming hither who will see (the dawn) in the future.
12. Keeping away hatred, guardian of truth, born in truth, gracious,  arousing liberalities,
of good omen, bringing to birth (our ritual) pursuit of the gods—here  today, Dawn, as the most fairest, dawn forth.
13. Over and over in the past the goddess Dawn dawned forth. And today  she has dawned forth here, the bounteous one.
And she will dawn forth through later days. Unaging, immortal, she  proceeds according to her own customs.
14. She has flashed forth with her ornaments at the doorposts of heaven.  The goddess has removed the black raiment.
Awakening (the world), with her ruddy horses, Dawn drives hither with  a well-yoked chariot.
15. Conveying hither flourishing valuables, she makes herself a bright  beacon, showing herself ever more brightly.
The last of those who, one by one, have gone, the first of those  radiating forth—Dawn has whitened widely.
16. Raise yourselves up! The living life-force has come here to us. Away,  forth has gone the darkness; light comes hither.
She has left a path for the sun to drive on. We have come to where they  lengthen lifetime. 17. With reins of speech the conveyor (of oblations), the hoarse-voiced  (singer) [=Agni], himself being praised, arouses the radiant dawns.
Today then, o bounteous one, dawn for the one who sings; for us shine  down a lifetime full of offspring.
18. The dawns, bringing cows and hale heroes, who dawn forth for the  pious mortal
when the litany of liberalities is raised like (the litany) of Vāyu—to
them, the givers of horses, shall the soma-presser attain.
19. Mother of gods, face of Aditi, beacon of the sacrifice, lofty—shine  forth.
As creator of lauds, dawn forth for our sacred formulation. Beget (it)  here among our people, o you who bring all valuables.
20. The bright profit that the dawns convey to the laboring sacrificer—the  auspicious thing—
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 114 Rudra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11
A simple but pleasing hymn, characterized by considerable chaining and intertwining  of repeated vocabulary and syntactic structures. The helpful and healing aspects of  Rudra are emphasized—the related words sumatí “benevolence” and sumná “favor”  occur six times in this eleven-verse hymn. His fearsome and angry side is for the most  part downplayed, mentioned in passing in verses 4c and 10a, both beginning “in the  distance.” But Rudra’s possible punitive actions are addressed directly in verses 7–8,  which contain twelve occurrences of the prohibitive negative mā “don’t!”
1. These poetic thoughts do we proffer to Rudra, the powerful one with  braided hair who rules over heroes,
so that he will be luck for our two-footed and four-footed, so that
everything in this settlement will be flourishing, free of affliction.
2. Be merciful to us, Rudra, and create joy for us. To you who rule over  heroes we would do honor with reverence.
Whatever luck and lifetime Father Manu won through sacrifice, that may  we attain under your guidance, Rudra.
3. May we attain your benevolence though sacrifice to the gods, the  benevolence of you who rule over heroes, o reward-granting Rudra.
Bestowing only favor, come roaming toward our clans: possessing heroes  who cannot be harmed, we will pour you an oblation.
266 I.115
4. We call down turbulent Rudra for help, the wandering poet who brings  the sacrifice to success.
In the distance from us let him shoot his divine anger. It is just his
benevolence we choose.
5. We call down with reverence the boar of heaven, flame-red, with  braided hair, turbulent in form.
Bearing in his hand desirable healing remedies, he will extend shelter,  covering, and protection to us.
6. This speech here is spoken to the father of the Maruts—speech sweeter  than sweet, strengthening to Rudra.
Both grant us, immortal one, what nourishes mortals, and be merciful  to our selves, to our progeny and posterity.
7. Not the great one among us nor the wee little one, not the growing one  among us nor the grown—
don’t smite our father nor our mother. Don’t harm our own dear
bodies, Rudra.
8. Don’t do harm to our progeny and posterity nor to our (own) lifespan,  not to our cows nor to our horses.
Don’t smite our heroes, Rudra, when enraged. We, with our oblations,  will always invoke you.
9. Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you. Grant your  favor to us, father of the Maruts,
for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful. It is just your aid
that we choose.
10. In the distance be your cow-smiting and men-smiting (anger). You who  rule over heroes, let your favor be on us.
Both be merciful to us and speak on our behalf, o god, and then extend  double-lofty shelter to us.
11. We have spoken reverence to him, seeking his aid. Let Rudra,
accompanied by the Maruts, hear our call.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth  and Heaven.
## 115 Sūrya
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: triṣṭubh
As in most hymns and verses dedicated to Sūrya, the Sun, this hymn focuses  on his rising. His function as eye of the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, is  mentioned in verse 1 (and in our opinion also in verse 5), and the activity that  his rising inspires, both ritual and mundane, in verse 3. Verses 4 and 5 are more enigmatic and have occasioned much discussion: many scholars believe that both  verses contrast the sun of the day with the “night sun,” the dark side of the sun  that, in the form of a wheel, travels invisibly from west to east to position itself  for the next daily rising. Thus, in such interpretations, in the first half of verse 4  Night gathers up the dark garment she was weaving (see II.38.4) at the advent of  the rising sun, but swathes the night sun in her garment in the second half of the  verse. Two sides of the sun, bright and dark, are also referred to, more clearly,  in the second half of verse 5. Although these interpretations have much in their  favor, we still remain uncertain about what verses 4 and 5 are actually depicting.  On the one hand, the interpretations offered seem too cut-and-dried for the fluid  cosmology of the R̥gveda; on the other, given the usual concentration on the  happy event of sunrise, too much mention of the less auspicious night sun seems  somewhat out of place.
1. The brilliant face of the gods has arisen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa,  and Agni;
he has filled heaven, earth, and the space between: the Sun is the
life-breath of both the moving and the still.
2. The Sun approaches the gleaming goddess Dawn from behind, like a  dashing youth a maiden,
when the men seeking the gods stretch their yokes across, in response to  the auspicious (god) for the sake of an auspicious (thing).
3. The auspicious tawny horses of the Sun—the brilliant ones, worth  cheering on, that win dappled cows—
bringing reverence, they have mounted the back of heaven. They circle  around heaven and earth in a single day.
4. This is the Sun’s divinity, this his greatness: in the middle of (her) work  (Night?) has gathered together what was stretched out.
When he has yoked his tawny horses from their seat, just after that Night  stretches her garment for him.
5. The Sun takes on his own form in the lap of heaven, for Mitra and  Varuṇa to see.
His one surface, gleaming, is unbounded; the tawny (horses) together  bring the other, the black one.
6. Today, o gods, at the rising of the Sun, deliver us from distress and from  disgrace.
– This let Mitra and Varuıa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa, the son of Dīrghatamas (poet of I.140–164), is the poet  of the next eleven hymns (116–126). As Geldner points out, however, Kakṣīvant  refers to himself as pajriyá (I.116.7, 117.6, 120.5) and to his family as the pajrā́ḥ (I.122.8, 126. 4, 5). According to I.121.13 the Pajras are Aṅgirases. Kakṣīvant also
268 I.116
calls himself the son of Uśij in I.119.9 and 122.4; Sāyaṇa identifies Uśij as a dāsī, a  servant woman.
Whatever his family affiliations Kakṣīvant has one of the most distinctive poetic  personalities in the R̥gveda. He is a very skillful, self-conscious, and tricky artist,  setting traps for his unwary hearers and twisting words and phrases into often  impenetrable knots, with an exuberance that we have to admire despite our fre
quent frustrations. He also has clear thematic preoccupations. Approximately half  of his oeuvre is devoted to the Aśvins (116–120), with important catalogues of their  deeds and services. (Much of what we know or surmise about the mythology of  the Aśvins comes from these hymns.) He is also particularly interested in women in  all their aspects: there are important and high-style treatments of the marriage of  Sūryā and the Aśvins’ wooing of her, as well as two lovely Dawn hymns (123–124)  sketching a range of female roles, but there is also a nearly obscene celebration of  a girl he received as a gift from his patron (126.6–7) that presses the boundaries of  R̥gvedic decorum.
Because so much of Kakṣīvant’s artistry is bound up with his manipulation of  the Sanskrit language even at the phonological level, the special flavor of his poetry  is particularly hard to convey in translation, unfortunately.
## 116 Aśvins
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
25 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a catalogue that mentions many stories in which the Aśvins came to  the rescue of those in need but that provides little detail. There is some thematic  linkage among the narratives, which in three instances occur in sets of four. So, for  example, the hymn begins with references to the Aśvins’ chariot or chariots and to  the chariot-animals in verses 1–4 and then returns to them once again not quite at  the end but toward the end, in verses 17–20. Verses 13–16 contain a set of stories  involving body parts: the hands of the Aśvins in verse 13, the mouth of the wolf  in 14, the foot of a mare in 15, and the eyes of R̥jrāśva in 16. Elsewhere the poet  repeatedly returns to references to waters or liquids (vss. 3, 5, 7, 9). Such linked  verses do not structure the hymn tightly, but they keep it from becoming merely a  list of great deeds.
The Aśvins are closely associated with the Pravargya, originally an independent  rite that was incorporated into the classical soma ritual either during the upasad-days  that precede the soma-pressing day or on the pressing day itself. In this rite milk is  poured into a heated pot and offered to the Aśvins. This hymn explicitly refers to  the Pravargya rite in the first verse, which employs the marked verb prá vr̥ñje, which  gave the Pravargya its name. The verb describes either placing the Pravargya pot on  the fire or turning the pot to offer the milk. In the penultimate verse, the poet frames the hymn by an indirect reference to the Pravargya by describing Rebha as “having  twisted” (právr̥kta) in the water.
Many of the deeds alluded to in this hymn are likewise mentioned in the fol lowing four Aśvin hymns (I.117–20), especially the first two, often in the same or  similar phraseology.
1. I twist (the milk-pot) as (one twists) the ritual grass and I stir up the  praise songs, like winds the rain clouds, for the Nāsatyas,
who have carried a wife down to our little Vimada with their chariot that  is swift as a weapon,
2. As they were exulting in their firm-winged, swiftly speeding (steeds) or in  the gods’ spur.
Then, o Nāsatyas, a donkey [=Vimada?] conquered the thousand at stake  in the contest of Yama.
3. Tugra left Bhujyu behind in a cloud of water, Aśvins, as one who has  died (leaves behind) his wealth.
You carried him with your breathing ships [=winged steeds] that bob in  the midspace far from water.
4. Through three nights and through three days, o Nāsatyas, you carried  Bhujyu with your winged ones that wander far beyond:
(you carried him) on the wasteland of the sea, at the far shore of the watery  (sea), with your three chariots with their hundred feet and six horses.
5. Then you two acted as heroes upon the unsupporting sea, which has no  place to stand and nothing to grasp,
when, Aśvins, you carried Bhujyu home after he mounted your ship of a  hundred oars.
6. O Aśvins, the white horse that you gave to (Pedu), whose horse was bad,  to be everlasting well-being (for him)—
that great gift of yours is to be famed. The racehorse of Pedu is ever to  be called upon by the stranger.
7. O men, you two dug out plentifulness for Pajra’s son, Kakṣīvant, who  was praising you.
You poured from the filter, the hoof of the bull-like horse, a hundred  pots of liquor.
8. With snow you two kept away fire and scorching heat. You placed the  nourishment of solid food for him.
You brought Atri up to well-being, who had been brought down into the  earth cleft together with his whole band.
9. You pushed the well far away, Nāsatyas; you put it bottom up, with its  banks [=rim] aslant.
Like waters for drinking they [=inspirations] flowed, for wealth to the  thirsting thousand (descendants [?]) of Gotama.
270 I.116
10. And, Nāsatyas, from Cyavāna, who had become old, you removed his  covering [=aged skin] like a garment.
You extended the lifetime of him who was left behind, wondrous ones,  and thereby you made him the husband of young women.
11. O men, that is your protective cover to be praised and brought to  realization, o Nāsatyas,
when you knowing ones dug (him) [=Vandana] out because he was  beautiful, like a treasure that had been hidden away, for the sake of  Vandana [/for you to be celebrated].
12. O men, I disclose that powerful, wondrous might of yours, like thunder  the rain, in order to win it,
as when Dadhyañc son of Atharvan (disclosed) the honey to you by  means of the head of a horse when he proclaimed it.
13. Puraṃdhi has called upon your two hands again and again, o Nāsatyas,  you of many delights [/of many arms], for what is great on your  journey.
You two heard (the call) of Vadhrimatī like a command. You gave (her  a son) with golden hands.
14. At the critical moment you two freed the quail-hen from the mouth of  the wolf, men, Nāsatyas,
and, you two of many delights, you made the lamenting sage poet  [=Uśanā Kāvya] to gaze far.
15. Because her foot was cut away like the wing of a bird, in the contest of  Khela, at the decisive turn,
right away you inserted a metal shank for Viśpalā to run, when the  stake had been set.
16. R̥jrāśva, who butchered a hundred sheep for the she-wolf—him did his  father blind.
You placed two eyes in the unassailable one for him to gaze afar, o  Nāsatyas, you wondrous healers.
17. The Daughter of the Sun mounted your chariot, like one winning the  finish-line with her steed.
All the gods approved in their hearts, and, Nāsatyas, you two keep  company with her splendor.
18. When you two drove the course for Divodāsa and for Bharadvāja,  Aśvins, urging (your steeds) onward,
your accompanying chariot conveyed wealth. A bull and a river dolphin  were yoked (to it).
19. Conveying wealth with good rule and a full lifetime with good  descendants and good men, Nāsatyas,
you two of one mind journeyed here with the prizes of victory to the  wife of Jahnu, who was setting your portion three times a day. 20. At night you conveyed Jāhuṣa, besieged from every direction, through  the easily traversed airy spaces.
With your chariot that cuts asunder, o never-aging Nāsatyas, you
journeyed through the mountains.
21. At the dawning of a single (dawn), Aśvins, you gave Vaśa the help  (needed) for the battle in order for him to gain thousands (of cattle). Along with Indra you two smashed misfortunes and hostilities away  from Pr̥thuśravas, o bulls.
22. From the (dry [?]) well also of Śara, son of R̥catka, you supplied water  (flowing) upward from below for him to drink.
Also for starving Śayu, o Nāsatyas, with your powers you made his
sterile cow swell (with milk).
23. To Viśvaka Kr̥ṣṇiya, who was seeking your help and singing your praise,  who was aiming straight, Nāsatyas, you gave by your powers
Viṣṇāpū to be seen (once more), like a lost animal.
24. Within the waters through ten nights and nine days, bound and pierced  by the malicious one,
Rebha, who bobbed and twisted in the water—him you two brought  up, like soma with a ladle.
25. I have proclaimed your wondrous deeds, Aśvins. Having good cows and  good men, might I be the lord of this (wealth).
And both seeing and reaching a long lifetime, might I go to old age as  if (going) home.
## 117 Aśvins
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
25 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a catalogue of the heroic deeds of the Aśvins, which ultimately leads  to the poet’s request for heroes (vs. 25). The problem for the poet is that such a  hymn listing so many of the gods’ deeds could easily become just an inventory  without any real coherence. One of the poet’s solutions to this problem is to create  verbal and thematic linkages among verses and sets of verses in order to organize  and unify his composition.
At the highest level the great deeds of the Aśvins are arranged according to  theme. First are deeds in which the Aśvins rescue those who have been hidden away  in some fashion: Atri in the earth cleft (3), Rebha in the waters (4), and Vandana  in the ground (5). Then, the poet shifts from the Aśvins’ rescues to their generosity.  The theme is announced in verse 6 and then exemplified in verses 7–9. The Aśvins  give the gift of a wife (7ab) and husband (7cd), a bright body (8ab), fame (8cd),  and a horse (9). Verse 10 then summarizes this theme and announces a new one
272 I.117
that extends the image of the horse in verse 9. The deeds in the next section turn on  the Aśvins as charioteers and horsemen. They bring prizes to the poet (11ab) and  restore the racing mare Viśpalā (11d). Verses 12–16 connect the Aśvins’ deeds to  the journeys of their chariot and horses. On those journeys they come to the aid of  Cyavāna, Bhujyu, and others. The last extended set of verses, verses 16–22, describe  a variety of different acts, but all these verses mention animals: a quail (16), sheep  and a she-wolf (17–18), a barren cow (20), a “wolf” (possibly a plow; 21), and the  head of a horse (22). This leaves aside verse 19, but the “lame one” here is probably  the mare Viśpalā, one suggestion of Sāyaṇa. Note that the last two sets of verses  overlap at verse 16, a join that again helps hold the poem together.
Another way the poet creates a sense of unity is by the repetition of lexical items,  sometimes used in different contexts. So, the poet uses the unusual verb sám √rī “draw  back together” in verses 4, 11, and 19 to describe a rescue from the sea, the repair  of a horse, and the healing of the “lame one.” Or again, the Aśvins carried down  (ní...ūhathuḥ) a horse or a bride (9b, 20d) and carried Bhujyu out (níḥ...ūhathuḥ) of  the sea (14d, 15c). In 5c níkhāta “buried” describes Vandana; níkhāta occurs again in  12c, although it is not clear to whom the latter verse refers. Sāyaṇa suggests that it is  Rebha, who was “buried” in the waters, an interpretation supported by the reference  to the tenth day (cf. I.116.24). However, since the verb níkhāta was just used with  Vandana in verse 5cd, it may be he to whom the verse refers.
Likewise, the poet links consecutive verses by repeating the same or similar  words. The Aśvins rescue the seer (ŕ̥ṣi) Atri in 3a and the seer Rebha in 4b. Each of  verses 20–22 addresses the aśvinā and the “wondrous ones” (dasrā/dasrau). The four  hemistichs of verses 13 and 14 all begin with yuvóḥ or yuvám. Verses 15 and 16 both  begin ájohavīt “he called again and again.” Such verbal concatenation again helps  unify the diverse contents of the hymn.
The poet explores other kinds of verbal play, some of which create intercon nections within the poem, but others reflect other purposes or simply his artistry  as a poet. For example, víṣakta “drooping” of 20a is phonologically rearranged in  24c as the rare word víkasta “split apart.” There appears to be another phonologi cal connection in verse 16cd between viṣvā́c, the personal name Viṣvāc, which may  mean the “Double-Talker,” and viṣá “poison.” However, the interpretation of this  hemistich is problematic, in part because Viṣvāc and his son are only attested here.  Geldner and others understand the poison to be the means by which the Aśvins  destroy the son of Viṣvāc, but if so, such use of poison by the Aśvins is isolated.  Rather, the poison may have given rise to the son of Viṣvāc, an interpretation sup ported by the phonological similarity of viṣvā́c and viṣá. Perhaps the idea is that  Viṣvāc’s son is born from the “poison” of his “double-talking” speech.
1. The age-old Hotar [=Agni] seeks to win you in order for you to be  exhilarated on the honeyed soma, o Aśvins.
The gift accompanied by the ritual grass is laid out, (as is) my song. With  refreshment, with prizes of victory, journey here, o Nāsatyas. 2. Your chariot, o Aśvins, swifter than mind, drawn by good horses, comes  to the clans.
By which (chariot) you go to the home of the good ritual performer, by  that, o men, travel your course to us.
3. You free Atri, the seer of the five peoples, from narrow straits, from the  earth cleft along with his band, o men—
confounding the wiles of the merciless Dasyu, driving them out, one  after another, o bulls.
4. O Aśvins—you men, you bulls—by your wondrous powers you draw  back together the seer Rebha, who bobbed away in the waters,
like a horse hidden by those of evil ways. Your ancient deeds do not  grow old.
5. Like one who has gone to sleep in the lap of destruction, like the sun  dwelling in darkness, o wondrous ones,
like a buried gem, lovely to see, (dug out) for beauty, you dug him
[=Vandana] out for Vandana [/for our celebration of you], o Aśvins. 6. This (deed) of yours in your earth-encircling course, o men, deserves to  be praised by Kakṣīvant, the son of Pajra, o Nāsatyas:
from the hoof of your prizewinning horse, you poured a hundred pots  of honey for the people.
7. You two, o men, gave Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka Kr̥ṣṇiya, who was
praising you.
Even to Ghoṣā, living at home with her father, you gave a husband,  though she was growing old, Aśvins.
8. You two gave a bright (body) to Śyāva Kaṇva [/Kaṇva, the Dark One]  of the great flood [?], Aśvins.
That deed of yours is to be proclaimed, o bulls: that you bestowed fame  upon the son of Nr̥ṣad [=Kaṇva].
9. Assuming many forms, Aśvins, you carried down a swift horse to Pedu, an unstoppable prizewinning horse that gains a thousand (cows), a
smasher of serpents, deserving to be famed as the surpassing one.
10. These things deserving to be famed are for you, o you who give good  gifts: the formulation, the song, the seat within the two world-halves. When the Pajras call you, Aśvins, travel with refreshment and toward  victory’s prize for the knowing one!
11. Being sung by Sūnor Māna [=Agastya], o energetic Aśvins, digging out  victory’s prize for the inspired poet,
and growing strong alongside Agastya through his poetic formulation,  you draw Viśpalā back together, Nāsatyas.
12. Journeying where?—Toward the good praise of (Uśanā) Kāvya? To a  bed, o sons of heaven, o bulls?—
you dug out the one who was buried like a tub of gold on the tenth day,  Aśvins.274 I.117
13. You, o Aśvins, made the aging Cyavāna a youth again through your powers. Your chariot did the Daughter of the Sun choose, Nāsatyas, together  with its splendor.
14. You turned your minds again to Tugra in your ancient ways, o youthful  ones.
You carried Bhujyu from the flood, from the sea, with your birds, your  silvery horses.
15. Carried forth into the sea, the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu] called upon you  again and again, having gone (to you) on an unwavering course, Aśvins. You carried him out with your chariot, swift as mind, with its good  team, o bulls, to keep him well.
16. The quail-hen called upon you again and again, Aśvins, so that you  freed her from the mouth of the wolf.
With your victorious (chariot) you journeyed across the back of the  rock. You crushed the (son) of Viṣvāc [=the Double-Talker?], born  by poison.
17. Him who had readied a hundred sheep for the she-wolf, who was led  forth into darkness by his merciless father—
in R̥jrāśva you put eyes; you made light for the blind one to see.
18. O Aśvins, you bulls, that she-wolf summoned good fortune and the  winner’s stake for the blind man, saying, “O men!
Like the lover of a maiden is R̥jrāśva (to me), since he butchered a  hundred and one sheep.”
19. Great is your help, a joy itself, o Aśvins. Even the lame one do you draw  back together, o holy ones.
And so Plenty called upon just you two, and you two came to her with  your help, o bulls.
20. Wondrous Aśvins, you made the drooping, barren cow, no milk-cow, to  swell (with milk) for Śayu.
By your powers you carried down to Vimada a wife, the maiden of  Purumitra.
21. O Aśvins, wondrous ones, scattering barley by a “wolf” [=a drill plow?],  milking out refreshment for the race of Manu,
blasting sound at the Dasyu with a bagpipe, you made wide light for  the Ārya.
22. For Dadhyañc, the son of Atharvan, you substituted the head of a  horse, Aśvins.
Speaking the truth, he proclaimed to you Tvaṣṭar’s honey, which was  hidden from you, o wondrous ones.
23. Always, o poets, I delight in your favor. Help all my insights, Aśvins. Give us lofty wealth bringing descendants and worthy of fame, o Nāsatyas. 24. Giving Hiraṇyahasta [the Gold-Handed One], o Aśvins, you granted him  as a son to Vadhrimatī [She Who Has a Steer (for a Husband)], o men. Your raised up Śyāva [the Dark One], who had been split apart in three  places, so that he might live, o Aśvins, who bring good gifts.
25. The sons of Āyu have proclaimed these your ancient heroic deeds, o  Aśvins,
creating for you a poetic formulation, o bulls. Obtaining good heroes,  we would announce the ritual distribution.
## 118 Aśvins
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The structure of the hymn is straightforward. It begins with an invitation to the  Aśvins to come to the sacrifice on their chariot. Indeed, it is their chariot that is  the focus of the poet’s attention through most of the first half of the poem. The  triplets associated with the chariot—its three chariot boxes (vss. 1–2), three wheels  (2), and three turnings (2)—suggest the sacrifice itself with its three soma offer
ings. Within the poem, therefore, the ritual performance thus becomes an image  of the Aśvins’ chariot, and its realization a sign of the arrival of the Aśvins. The  chariot not only brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice but it also brings help to the  sacrificer (vs. 1). Ancient poets have told of the help of the Aśvins (3cd), and the  second part of the poem (vss. 5–9) begins with a recital of the many men and even  animals in their many desperate situations whom the Aśvins have helped. The  hymn then returns to the poet’s own need for help (vs. 10), and in verse 11 there  is once again a summons of the Aśvins. The last verse creates a formal ring, for  just as in verse 1 the Aśvins should come quickly in their “falcon-winged chariot”  (ráthaḥ. . .śyenápatvā), so in verse 11 the Aśvins should come with the “fresh speed  of a falcon” (śyenásya jávasā nū́tanena).
1. Aśvins, let your falcon-winged chariot journey here toward us—filled  with compassion, filled with help—
which is swifter than a mortal’s thought, which has three chariot boxes  and the speed of the wind, o bulls.
2. Journey toward us by your smooth-turning chariot with its three chariot  boxes, with its three wheels, and three turnings.
Swell the cattle (with milk), quicken the chargers, and strengthen the  hero for us, o Aśvins.
3. Racing headlong by your smooth-turning chariot, wondrous ones, hear  this signal-call of the stone.
Have not the inspired poets born long ago said that you are the first to  respond to trouble, Aśvins?
4. Aśvins, let the swift, soaring falcons harnessed to your chariot carry  you here—
276 I.119
those that, crossing the waters high in the heavens like vultures, carry  you to (our offered) enjoyment.
5. Having become pleased, the young girl, the Daughter of the Sun, has  now mounted your chariot, o men.
Let the soaring horses of your wonder [=your chariot], let your ruddy  birds, carry you at the critical moment.
6. You raised up Vandana through your wondrous powers; o wondrous  bulls, (you raised) up Rebha by your powers.
You rescue the son of Tugra from the ocean, and you made Cyavāna  youthful again.
7. You granted nourishment and relief to Atri, who was led down into the  scorching (earth cleft).
Having found pleasure in his good praise, in return you granted sight to  Kaṇva, whose eyes were pasted shut.
8. You swelled the cow (with milk) for Śayu of long ago, who needed help,  o Aśvins.
You released the quail-hen from tight straits, and you inserted a shank  for Viśpalā.
9. You gave to Pedu the serpent-smashing white horse, sped by Indra, o  Aśvins—
the overwhelming, powerful (horse), repeatedly called upon by
the stranger, the strong-limbed bull that wins a thousand
(cattle).
10. Needing help ourselves, o men, we call on you, who are nobly born, for  aid, o Aśvins.
Finding pleasure in our songs, journey here to us by your chariot
bearing goods for our safe passage.
11. Of one accord, Nāsatyas, journey here to us with the fresh speed of a  falcon,
for, as one who has given an oblation, I call upon you, Aśvins, at the  break of the newest dawn of all.
## 119 Aśvins
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
10 verses: jagatī
The hymn begins along expected lines with a summons to the Aśvins to come to  the sacrifice (vs. 1). However, the offering mentioned is not soma, but rather the hot  milk (gharmá) of the Pravargya rite (vs. 2cd). In 2cd and probably verse 3 Kakṣīvant  describes the arrival of the Aśvins, who bring Sūryā, the Daughter of the Sun, to  her wedding. The bridegroom of Sūryā is Soma in the late R̥gveda (X.85), but in 5cd she chooses the Aśvins themselves as her husbands. Pirart (1995: 252) suggests  that yuvā́m pátī is a corruption for yuvā́m pátim* and therefore the line means that  Sūryā chose “the young (Soma) as her husband.” But if the gharmá in this hymn  in some sense displaces the soma, perhaps the poet has replaced the god Soma by  the deities of the Pravargya rite, the Aśvins. For further on the self-choice marriage  of Sūryā and Kakṣīvant’s treatments of it, see Jamison (2001). In this connection  verse 3 contains one of Kakṣīvant’s characteristic verbal tricks: the phrase sūrím  ā́ váram, which literally means “the patron according to his will,” is a scrambling  of *sūriyā́m váram, with a reference to Sūryā (whose name is normally read trisyl labically as Sūr(i)yā) and her svayaṃ-vara (self-choice) marriage. This scrambled  phrase is “repaired” in verse 5 with the straightforward declaration of her choice.  See Jamison (2006).
1. I summon your chariot with its many wiles, swift as thought, with  speeding horses, and worthy of the sacrifice, in order for us
to live—
the winning (chariot) of a thousand banners, bringing hundreds of good  things, obedient to command, and creating wide space—toward (our  offered) enjoyment.
2. At its journey our lofty insight has been aimed at your praise. (Our  praises, going) in (all) directions, converge (upon you).
I sweeten the hot milk; your help comes in return. Ūrjānī [=Sūryā] has  mounted your chariot, Aśvins.
3. When, contending with each another, they have clashed with one  another for beauty—(those) innumerable combatants, victorious in  battle—
then your chariot appears ever brighter in its steep descent, when you  convey the patron according to his will, Aśvins.
4. You came to Bhujyu, tossing (in the sea), with your self-harnessed birds,  conveying him back from his ancestors [=from the dead].
You traveled your most noble track, o bulls, and your great help became  manifest to Divodāsa.
5. For the sake of your marvel [=your chariot], Aśvins, two voices guided  the chariot harnessed by you and its (cargo?) belonging to the warrior  band [? =the Aśvins].
Having come to marriage to you for a partnership with you, the noble  young girl chose you two as her husbands.
6. You give Rebha space from being besieged, (and you cool) the intensely  heated, hot (vessel) with snow for Atri.
You swelled nourishment in Śayu’s cow. Vandana was extended through  a long lifetime.
7. You constructed Vandana, who had fallen apart because of age, like  workers a chariot, o wondrous ones.
278 I.120
Out of the soil you give birth to the inspired poet [=Vandana?]
amid acclaim. Here (too) your skill will prevail for the one
honoring (you).
8. You went to the one piteously crying in the far distance [=Bhujyu],  entrapped by his own father’s abandonment of him.
Your enduring help that brings the sunlight, your brilliant mastery,
arose at the critical moment.
9. And the little fly whispered honeyed (speech) to you, (and now) in  the exhilaration of soma, (Kakṣīvant), the son of Uśij, cries out
(to you):
“You two try to win the thought of Dadhyañc, and then the horse’s
head replies to you.”
10. In friendship you offer to Pedu a white (horse), bringing many boons,  overcoming contenders,
the heaven-bound (horse), hard to overcome by arrows in battles, to be  celebrated, and conquering the lands, like Indra.
## 120 Aśvins
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
12 verses:  gāyatrī 1, 10–12; kakubh 2, kāvirāj 3, naṣṭarūpī 4, tanuśirā 5, uṣṇih 6,  viṣṭārabr̥hatī 7, kr̥ti 8, virāj 9
Even for Kakṣīvant, a master of enigmatic poetry, this is an especially puzzling hymn,  and not surprisingly it has given rise to quite different interpretations. For example,  in Geldner’s view the hymn concludes with the poet’s complaint that his patron  has been ungenerous. Much of the hymn reflects that disappointment: Kakṣīvant  pretends to be a simple man but creates metrically irregular, obscure verses, charac
terized by irony and hidden malice. While there is much to recommend in Geldner’s  approach to the hymn, we have taken a different tack.
The most notable feature of this hymn is its strange metrical pattern. The hymn  begins in gāyatrī (vs. 1), a simple and common meter, but then sinks gradually into  metrical chaos and finally emerges gradually into gāyatrī once again (vss. 10–12).  The metrical transitions are marked by verse 2 in kakubh and verse 9 in virāj. Both  are rarer Vedic meters, but they are meters found elsewhere. However, the middle  section (vss. 3–8) changes meter in every verse and with one exception (vs. 6 in  uṣṇih), the meters are jagged and very unusual. The impression they make is one  of dislocation and even poetic incompetence, although it is obviously an artful and  deliberate incompetence.
This metrical structure underscores the theme of the hymn. The poet begins, in  gāyatrī, with a question about who will earn the support of the Aśvins. The first two  pādas are typical and formulaic. Indeed, they reflect a very old, traditional formula, since the phrasing of ab resembles lines from the Gāthās of Zarathustra: Yasna  33.2 tōi vārāi rādəntī, ahurahyā zaošē mazdā “These will bring success to his desire  and will be to the liking of the Wise Lord.” If this formulaic identification is cor rect, then pāda c may stand in intentionally shocking contrast: it is a question not  about a successful worshiper but about an incompetent one, and immediately after  this question the poet’s meter begins to disintegrate. The poet does not have the  knowledge he needs (2) and fears that he might become someone acetás “without  insight,” a word that recalls ápracetas “inattentive” in 1c and the anxiety that pro pels the hymn. The Aśvins know a certain entranceway, “doors,” that the poet does  not. Pirart (1995: 263) suggests that these doors are the “doors of riches,” after  I.68.10, 72.8, and similarly IX.45.3 = 64.3, and Geldner, the “doors of awareness”  after IX.10.6 and similarly VII.95.6. It would be fully in accord with Kakṣīvant’s  enigmatic style to mean either and both, especially since the poet’s knowledge and  his prosperity are bound together.
Because of his anxiety, the poet calls on the Aśvins to help him (3–4). Verses 5 and  6 are particularly problematic, but they appear to describe the poet’s shortcomings.  His speech is not grand like that recited before the Bhr̥gavāna fire, the fire originally lit  by Bhr̥gu that symbolizes the unity of all the clans, and it is not beautiful (5). His voice  is rough, but he asks the Aśvins to hear his song as if it were the song that Takavāna  sings (6). Takavāna appears only here, but judging from the context he is someone  whose beautiful voice the poet hopes the Aśvins will hear instead of his own raspy  one. The poet thus asks the Aśvins to overlook his faults, and not to consign him and  his people to the evildoings of their enemies (7–8). In the last verses the crisis seems  to have passed. The poet’s verse stabilizes (into virāj), and the poet can hope that his  measured pādas will win him measures of goods (9). At the beginning of this verse he  also demonstrates his ability to puzzle. The subject is a cow, suggested by the previous  verse, but what does the cow represent? Although it looks back several verses, one  possibility is his Speech (vs. 5). Before he couldn’t speak the way he wished, but now  he hopes that his Speech will yield the milk that will bind the Aśvins to him.
In verse 10 the “horseless chariot” of the Aśvins is the hymn, which, safely back  in gāyatrī, is now running smoothly. It will carry the poet to successful sacrifices  (11). This then leaves a problem in interpreting the last verse. Perhaps the anxiety he  expressed in the middle of the hymn was not real but imagined, a kind of a dream.  This last verse then might be the dismissal of that anxiety and of the concern that  he will not receive the patronage he deserves.
1. What oblation to you will bring success, Aśvins? Who will be to the  liking of you both?
How will he make offering?—he, an inattentive man!
2. He should ask just the two [=the Aśvins] who know about the doors—he,  the man who does not know properly, who later (would be) without  insight.
Never are the two inactive around the mortal.
280 I.121
3. We call upon you two knowing ones. Knowing, you should speak to us  a (poetic) thought today.
Distributing portions, the one seeking you chants forth.
4. In my naïveté I ask (you), not (other) gods, about the unerring (soma),  created with the vaṣaṭ-call, o wondrous ones.
Protect us from the more powerful and the more violent one!
5. (The Speech that says,) “I who cry forth as if at the Bhr̥gavāna (fire),  who am beautiful, I the Speech by which Pajriya [=Kakṣīvant]
sacrifices to you”—
seeking refreshment, (I do) not (cry) forth (such Speech) as one
who knows.
6. Hear the song of Takavāna, even though I have rasped it out to you,  Aśvins.
(Set) your eyes here, lords of beauty, upon our home.
7. Because you two were in great joy surely (then) when you had jerked  it away—
o good ones, you should be fine herdsmen for us!—protect us from the  ill-wishing wolf.
8. Do not betray us to a nobody (who is) our enemy. Do not let our cows  go from our house to a nowhere place,
giving sustenance from their udders, though without young.
9. She should give milk in order to establish an alliance with you two.  Measure us for wealth accompanied by prizes of victory,
and measure us for nourishment accompanied by cattle.
10. I have won the horseless chariot of the Aśvins with their prizewinning  mares.
By it I enjoy abundant delight.
11. In every way this easy-moving chariot will carry me again and again  among the peoples, o body (of mine),
to the soma-drinking.
12. So then, I take no account of a dream nor of a rich man who gives no  sustenance.
Both these vanish in the morning.
## 121 Indra or the All Gods
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
15 verses: triṣṭubh
Of all the challenging and maddening hymns in Kakṣīvant’s small but memorable  oeuvre, this hymn may present the biggest challenges and the most maddening set  of puzzles—though the immediately preceding one is at least in competition. It seems that antiquity had a similar reaction, as the Anukramaṇī is not even sure  whether the hymn is dedicated to Indra or to the All Gods. We will here sketch a  structure and suggest some themes, but we make no claims for the correctness of all  the choices made in our translation or commentary.
The predominant deity of the hymn must be Indra, though his name does  not appear until verse 11, and the governing myth of the hymn is that of the  opening of the Vala cave. But other mythic material is interspersed through  the hymn, and the present-day sacrificial situation is also treated—while,  conversely, the Vala myth is sometimes presented as if it were happening  at this moment. In fact, the first verse sets up this scenario, with questions  about Indra’s attendance at a sacrifice where the Aṅgirases, his helpers in the  Vala myth, are performing their hymns. The same prospective appearance  of Indra among the Aṅgirases is also described in verse 3, with the recital  of the Vala myth continued, in the past, in verse 4.  The intervening verse  (2) is also couched in the mythic past and begins (2ab) with Indra’s primal  cosmogonic deed, the separation of heaven and earth. The second half of  verse 2 contains one of the most discussed portions of the hymn, a set of  three memorably described female figures whose relationships to each other  and to the “buffalo” who is gazing upon at least one of them are unclear. In  our view, all three figures are different forms of Dawn, the subject of two  of Kakṣīvant’s other hymns (I.123–124), as she transforms herself from a  young girl choosing her husband (the Sun) to a wife (of the Sun in the form  of a horse) to a mother (of a cow: the light of Dawn is frequently compared  to cows). The buffalo is probably Indra, and the focus on Dawn is appropri ate to a hymn celebrating the opening of the Vala cave and the release of the  dawn-cows.
Verse 4 alluded to the impetus that drinking soma gave to Indra at the opening  of the Vala cave, and the following two verses (5–6) sketch the history of Indra’s  possession of soma and then turn to the soma currently being produced at today’s  dawn sacrifice. The following, quite puzzling verse (7) seems to identify Indra with  the sun and, by implication, with the shining soma of the previous verse, also com
pared to the sun. The poet seems further to suggest that, even in the absence of all  the sacrificial necessities, the presence of radiant Indra is tantamount to a properly  performed sacrifice, for the benefit of the poet and his family. (We suggest that  Kakṣīvant is alluding to himself here, on the basis of similar vocabulary used in  I.126.5.)
Verse 8 begins a series of mythological verses, with an intertwining of the Vala  myth (9ab, 10ab) and that of Indra’s slaying of Śuṣṇa with the aid of Uśanā Kāvya  (9cd, 10cd, 11d, 12) and the related myth of the halting of the Sun’s horses and  chariot (13), with incidental mentions of other deeds of Indra (the Vr̥tra battle,  11c) thrown in. The interpenetration of these mythic allusions keeps the audi
ence off balance, a queasy feeling much increased by the disjunctive and elliptical  syntax.
282 I.121
The final two verses (14–15), asking for protection and valuables, are by contrast  quite straightforward. Presumably on this subject Kakṣīvant did not want the god  to misunderstand.
1. Will he, hastening to the cup of the men seeking the gods, listen properly  to the hymns of the Aṅgirases?
When he has reached the clans of the secure habitation, will the one  worthy of the sacrifice stride widely at their ceremony?
2. He propped up heaven, and he sprinkled its foundation [=earth]. The  ingenious one (provided) movable wealth of man and cow for the prize. The buffalo gazed after (Dawn,) the self-created maiden making her  choice (of husband), (who turned into) the consort of the horse
[=Sun], (then into) the mother of the cow.
3. The surpassing king will come through the days to the age-old call of the  clans of the Aṅgirases for the ruddy (cows).
He will fashion the mace, his team-mate; he will prop up heaven for the  sake of the two-footed and four-footed belonging to men.
4. In the exhilaration of this (soma) you gave the noisy vanguard of the  ruddy (cows), (previously) covered over, to truth,
when the three-humped (herd) was (momentarily) turned back in its  forward surge. You uncovered the deceits and unclosed the doors for  the (people) descended from Manu.
5. For you is this milk, consisting of good semen, which your two bustling  parents brought as a bounty, (for you) to become surpassing—
your blazing legacy, which they gained through sacrifice, the milk of the  ruddy one who gives sap as milk.
6. And now he [=Soma] has been produced—let him give exhilaration as he  advances; he has shone forth like the sun from this dawn,
when the drop, (being impelled) by (priests) having sweat as their
oblation, (itself) pouring with the offering spoon, has reached its old  (ritual) domains.
7. (Even) when a woodpile provided with good kindling should be far away,  the sun (still goes) around the cowpens at the ceremony,
when you [=Indra] shine forth, through the days that bring results, for  the surpassing one [=Kakṣīvant?] whose clan is on the (wedding?)
carts, seeking livestock.
8. You brought here the two tawny (horses) attained from great heaven,  as you were battling for the wellspring (of soma), which was
overwhelming in heavenly brilliance,
when for you to grow strong they milked with stones the exhilarating  tawny (soma), that was frenzied for cows [=milk], befriended by
the wind. 9. Ingenious, you rolled back from the cow the metallic stone of heaven,  which had been brought nearby,
when, o much-invoked one, vanquishing Śuṣṇa, you kept encircling him  with endless deadly weapons.
10. When it is just before the sun enters into (the fold) of darkness, then  cast the missile against the bolt, o possessor of the stones.
Even the power of Śuṣṇa that surrounded him—that you tore away  from heaven, even though it was well-knotted.
11. The two great surfaces that have no wheels, Heaven and Earth, cheered  you on at this deed, o Indra:
You put Vr̥tra to sleep powerfully with your mace, as he was lying upon  the streams, (and you put to sleep) the boar [=Śuṣṇa?].
12. You, o Indra, the manly one driving to the men for help—mount the  (horses) of the Wind, the best conveyors, easy to yoke.
What Uśanā Kāvya gave to you to provide exhilaration, that decisive,  Vr̥tra-smiting mace had he fashioned.
13. You brought to a halt the tawny mares of the Sun for men. Etaśa bore  the wheel; (you were) on your own, Indra.
Having cast (it) forth to the far shore of the ninety and nine (rivers),  you rolled the non-sacrificers over into the pit.
14. Protect us from this evil rage and from difficulty in a close encounter, o  Indra, mace-bearer.
Hold out toward us prizes by the cartload, with horses as their
foundation—for refreshment, for fame, and for liberality.
15. Let not your favor wither away from us, o you great in prizes:
refreshments will completely cover (us).
Give us a share in the cows of the stranger, o bounteous one. Might we  be your most bounteous feasting companions.
## 122 All Gods
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāḍrūpā 5–6
This hymn is divided almost equally between praise and invocation to a variety of  gods (vss. 1–6) and a complex dānastuti (vss. 7–15). As is true of all of Kakṣīvant’s  oeuvre there are many twists and turns along the way. The part devoted to the  gods seems to define an early-morning sacrifice in its first verses, especially those  calling on Dawn and Night (vs. 2), the Wind as well as Indra (vs. 3), and the  Aśvins and Agni (vs. 4), though Rudra and the Maruts (vs. 1), Pūṣan (vs. 5), and,  especially, Mitra and Varuṇa (vss. 6–7, 9) also appear. An early-morning ritual284 I.122
is appropriate for the following dānastuti, since the priestly gifts (dakṣiṇās) are  distributed then.
The dānastuti is filled with personal names, and, as often, it is difficult to disen tangle the relationships among them. In fact it appears that we may be dealing with  competing potential patrons, each praised for a fleeting moment for his generosity  until a larger prize from a different patron is in the offing. In verse 12 the poet seems  to be inviting this competition, promising to act as a kind of kingmaker for whom ever he gets as patron, and in the difficult verse 13 the poet may be suggesting that  patrons with goods to offer are attempting to surpass competing patrons with their  largesse. This interpretation remains uncertain, however.
1. O you of quick fervor [=priests], bring forward your drink, your stalk,  your sacrifice for Rudra who grants rewards.
I have praised (him) along with the heroes of the lord of heaven; (I have  praised) the Maruts as if aiming at the two world-halves.
2. It is for Dawn and Night, like two wives, to strengthen the Early
Invocation—the two that are known in many ways:
(the one) like a barren woman wearing a castoff cloak, (the other) with  the glory of the sun, lovely to see with her golden (ornaments).
3. Let the earth-circling one [=Wind], rising at early morning, invigorate us.  Let the Wind, (child?) of the waters, accompanied by bulls, invigorate us. Sharpen us, o Indra and “Mountain” [=Indra’s mace]. Let all the gods  then create wide space for us.
4. And it is for (Kakṣīvant), son of Uśij [/the fire-priest], to call for me this  glorious pair [=Aśvins], the pursuers (of the oblation), the drinkers,  for the whitening (of dawn).
Put forward for yourselves the Child of the Waters [=Agni], forward the  two mothers [=kindling sticks] of abundant [?] Āyu.
5. It is for (Kakṣīvant), son of Uśij [/the fire-priest], to call the “screecher,”  the laud, for you as if with a shout, at the attainment of the silvery
one [=soma?].
(Put him [=Pūṣan]?) forward for yourselves, for Pūṣan to give. I would  call here Agni’s assemblage of good ones [=gods].
6. Hear these calls of mine, Mitra and Varuṇa, and hear them in your seat  on all sides.
Let the one who grants the gift of hearing, who hears well, hear us—the  Sindhu River with her waters who provides good lands.
7. This gift of yours is to be praised, Mitra and Varuṇa. Having received  hundreds of cows among the Pr̥kṣayāmas: Pajra,
Śrutaratha, Priyaratha, they [=priests and poets] immediately came to  prosperity, upon penning them in.
8. The largesse of him who offers great bounty is to be praised. Together  might we, having good heroes, win (that) of Nahus, who for the Pajras is the man providing prizewinning mares and for me  is the patron (of largesse) consisting of horses and chariots.
9. A man who’s a liar, a crooked liar who presses (soma that’s) like water  for you two, o Mitra and Varuṇa,
he himself installs a wasting disease in his own heart, while the truthful  man gains his object through his oblations.
10. He, spurred by wondrous power, is more forceful than proud Nahus,  and his fame is sung by men.
He whose gifts have been set loose drives as a pumped-up runner,
always the champion in all battles.
11. Now then, as you go to the call of Nahus the patron, o gladdening  kings of immortality, hear
what largesse of Nabhojū and of Nirava there is for the possessor of  the chariot to proclaim in its greatness.
12. “Whichever patron (we belong to), we shall establish him as a force,” so  did they say on the attainment of ten-part (gushing [=soma?]).
The brilliant things in which the assemblage of good ones [=gods] finds  enjoyment—let them all [=gods] gain (them) as their victory prize.
13. Let us find elation in the ten-part gush (of soma?), when the twice five  [=fingers?] come, bringing foods.
The one providing desirable horses, the one providing desirable reins,  and these masters (of goods)—are they heading straight toward the  men to surpass (them)?
14. The “flood” with golden ears and bejeweled necks—let all the gods  make it wide for us.
Let the ruddy ones [=Dawns?], coming here in an instant to the songs  of the stranger, find pleasure in both of us [=singers and patrons].
15. The four young’uns [=foals?] of Maśarśāra and the three of King  Āyavasa, the victorious (come) to me.
Your chariot, o Mitra and Varuṇa, with its long front, with hands as its  guiding rope, has shone like the sun.
## 123 Dawn
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
13 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the loveliest of the R̥gvedic Dawn hymns. It begins with references to the  dakṣiṇā or “priestly gifts” distributed at the early-morning sacrifice (vss. 1–6),  almost as if to get the business of the hymn out of the way. But even here the gifts  are clearly under the control of the lovely young Dawn, whose beauties are hinted  at. The next section (vss. 7–9) confronts the usual conundrums and paradoxes
286 I.123
about Dawn (see also I.113 above)—both her twinned opposite number, Night  (vs. 7), and the identity and diversity of the dawns of each individual day (vss.  8–9), each one dutifully conforming to the rules that order the cosmos by per forming her appointed rounds. In the last of these verses (9), Dawn’s daily journey  is likened to a girl’s going to a lovers’ tryst, and this simile provides the transition  to the next two verses (10–11), where she is compared to a beautiful young woman  showing herself off. The final two verses (12–13) combine the gift theme of the  beginning of the hymn with the periodicity of the dawns treated in the middle  section.
1. A broad chariot has been yoked for the priestly gift. The gods, the  immortals have mounted it.
Up from the dark has arisen the lady of extensive power, being attentive  to the human dwelling place.
2. Earlier than all creation she has awoken, the lofty one, conquering,  winning the prize.
On high she has gazed forth—the young woman come into being again.  Dawn has come here, the first one at the Early Invocation.
3. When today you will share out a share to the superior men among  mortals, o nobly born goddess Dawn,
god Savitar, master of the house, will here declare to the Sun that we are  without offense.
4. To house after house she drives *in her greatness, day after day assuming  (new) names.
Seeking to win, flashing, over and over she has come hither. She has her  share of the very tip-top of goods.
5. Sister of Bhaga, kin to Varuṇa, o liberal Dawn, be first awake.
The institutor of evil should lag behind. Might we conquer him with a  priestly gift as our chariot.
6. Let liberalities rise up, up plentiful gifts; up have the blazing fires stood. The eagerly sought goods hidden by darkness do the radiant dawns reveal. 7. The one goes away; the other approaches: having distinct forms, the two  day-halves proceed in tandem.
Of the two that circle around, the one has hidden the darkness: Dawn  has flashed with her ever-blazing chariot.
8. Of the same appearance today, just the same appearance also tomorrow,  they follow the long(-standing) ordinance of Varuṇa.
The faultless ones make a circuit through thirty “wagon-treks” [=days of  the month], each one encompassing her purpose in a single day.
9. Knowing the name of the first day, gleaming, bright-faced, she has been  born from the dark.
She does not violate the ordinance of truth, every day going to the
appointed place like a maiden to a rendezvous. 10. Like a girl exulting in her body, you go, o goddess, to the god who seeks  to attain you [=Sun].
Youthful, full of smiles, radiant, you reveal your breast in the east
[/before (him)].
11. Of lovely appearance like a maiden groomed by her mother, you reveal  your body to be seen.
Dawn forth widely, o Dawn, auspicious one. The other dawns will not  achieve this of yours.
12. Possessing horses, cows, and all desirable things, aligning themselves  with the rays of the sun,
they go away and they come here again, bearing auspicious
names—the dawns.
13. Guiding yourself following the rein of truth, place ever more auspicious  resolve in us.
O Dawn, easy to invoke, dawn forth to us today. Let there be riches  among us and among our bounteous (patrons).
## 124 Dawn
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
13 verses: triṣṭubh
Another virtuosic Dawn hymn. Here the poet takes the usual generic themes, espe cially Dawn as a beautiful woman, and creates highly specific images, especially in  verses 7–8, which provide a series of almost sociological portraits of ancient Indian  female figures. In verse 7 we first (pāda a) meet a brotherless girl boldly approaching  men; since the brother was important in finding and arranging suitable matches, a  brotherless girl was at a disadvantage in the marriage market and needed to take  initiative on her own. (See Schmidt 1987: 30–75.) The next image is a pun (pāda b),  with one harmless generic image and one shockingly specific one. In the harmless  reading a figure, presumably male, mounts a chariot to seek prizes; in the other a  woman, presumably a prostitute, shows herself off on a platform for money. The  third image (pādas cd) is of the legitimate wife adorned for her husband, but even  there the image shades into that of a loose woman showing her breast. The next  verse (8) treats the common theme of the sisters Dawn and Night, but again Dawn  is presented in a particular female role. In the second pāda, the “girl to be gazed  upon” may well refer to the display motif of the ancient Indian self-choice marriage  (Svayaṃvara; see Jamison 2001), while the “maidens with a choice” may refer to  the same phenomena, girls making their choice of bridegroom at a specially called  assembly (see Jamison 2003).
Even more striking perhaps is verse 4, where Dawn is compared to three differ ent animals or their parts: she is glossy like the breast of a waterbird who preens it;
288 I.124
she reveals herself like an elephant kneeling to drink; and she wakens the sleeping  like a fly, buzzing around again and again. (We owe these interpretations to Thieme  1965 [=1971: 214–27].)
Nothing in the rest of the hymn is quite so quirky, but the standard tropes are  well handled. The common counterpoint between individual Dawn and the multi tude of identical dawns that have preceded and will follow today’s dawn is found  in verses 2–3, 6, and 9. Another common theme, the diversity of beings that Dawn  awakens, appears in verses 1, 6, and 12. The final verses of the hymn raise the hope  of gifts and rewards that will come with the dawn.
1. Dawn as she dawns when the fire is being kindled; the sun as it rises— each has propped up its own light widely.
God Savitar here and now has impelled forth our two-footed, forth our  four-footed, each to go to its task.
2. Not belittling the divine commandments, but diminishing human (life-) spans,
the last of those who, one by one, have gone, the first of those who come  hither—Dawn has flashed forth.
3. This Daughter of Heaven has appeared opposite, dressed in light, in the  same way (as the others), from the east.
She follows along the path of truth, straight to the goal. Like one who  knows the way, she does not confound the directions.
4. She has appeared like the breast of a preening waterbird. Like a female  elephant she has revealed her intimate parts.
Wakening the sleeping like a fly, she has come as the latest of those who,  one by one, have come here again (and again).
5. In the eastern half of the dusky realm that cannot be flown to, the  begetter of cows has put forth her beacon.
She spreads out further, more widely, filling both laps of her two parents  [=Heaven and Earth].
6. Just thus is she, the latest of many, to be seen. Neither the non-kin does  she avoid, nor the kin.
Exulting in her spotless body, neither from the small does she retreat, nor  from the great, as she shines forth.
7. Like a brotherless (girl) she goes right up to men—like one mounting a  chariot seat to win prizes [/(display-)platform to gain property].
Like an eager wife, richly dressed, for her husband, Dawn, like a wanton,  lets her breast spill over.
8. The (one) sister has left the natal place to her older sister. She goes away  from her, like (a girl) to be gazed upon.
Dawning forth with the rays of the sun, she smears unguent on herself,  like (maidens) with a choice going to assemblies. 9. Day after day the latest of those earlier sisters advances from behind  toward the earlier one.
Let the newer ones now dawn richly for us as of old—the
day-bright dawns.
10. Awaken those who grant, bounteous Dawn; unawakening let the  niggards sleep.
Richly dawn for the bounteous ones, o bounteous one, richly for the  praiser, o liberal-spirited one, as you rouse them.
11. This young woman has whitened down from the east. She yokes the  forefront of the ruddy cows.
She will dawn forth now; her beacon will stand out. Agni will reverently  come to house after house.
12. The birds have also flown up from their dwelling and the men who  partake of food, at your first flush.
To the one who is at home you convey much of value, goddess Dawn,  and to the pious mortal.
13. You have been praised, praiseworthy ones, by my sacred formulation.  You, eager (for it), have been strengthened, o Dawns.
Goddesses, with your help may we win spoils in hundreds and
thousands.
## 125 Svanaya’s Dānastuti
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4–5
This hymn falls into two distinct but thematically connected parts. The second part  (vss. 4–7) develops an extravagant picture of the rewards that accrue to the gener ous giver and sacrificer. The whole cosmos seems to exist only to gratify him, and  a place among the gods as an immortal awaits him. The syntax and sentiments are  straightforward and indeed somewhat simplistic.
The other section (vss. 1–3) is quite different. It consists of an apparent dia logue between an “early-coming” figure (vs. 3) and, probably, a householder or  host (vs. 2), with a scene-setting introduction (vs. 1). The word “early-coming”  (prātarítvan) is found only in this hymn and in a narrative in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā (besides the later etymological work, the Nirukta), where the same dialogic rela tionship between the Prātaritvan and a householder, in that case Manu, obtains.  In both passages the Prātaritvan seems to be an itinerant priest or poet, offer ing his ritual services to a sacrificer, his potential host. But he also stands in for  or represents a god who is coming to attend the early-morning ritual. (Compare  the compound of similar form and similar meaning prātaryā́van “early-driving,  early-traveling,” used especially of the Aśvins and their chariot.) Thus, the host is
290 I.125
more inclined to receive the itinerant Prātaritvan because he may be entertaining  a god in disguise, and the Prātaritvan is not only seeking payment for his ritual  work, the dakṣiṇā whose giver is lyrically celebrated in verses 4–7, but also himself  brings (or claims to bring) goods and good fortune for his host, as is emphasized  in all three verses of this portion of the hymn. The relationship between them is  also presented as somewhat coercive or threatening in the second half of verse 2  (which unfortunately contains several hapaxes and is therefore not very clear). The  Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā narrative, a version of “Manu’s Cups,” depicts that threat much  more strongly, as an aspect of the “anxieties of hospitality.” For further discussion  see Jamison (1996a: 184–89).
1. In the early morning, the early-coming (priest/god) establishes a treasure.  An observant man, receiving him (as guest), lays it in himself.
Increasing his own progeny and lifetime with it, possessing good heroes,  he is accompanied by thriving of wealth.
2. [The host:] “He will have good cows, good gold, good horses—for him  Indra establishes lofty vigor—
he who, o early-comer, binds you up like a pard [?] with a thong [?], when  you come hither with goods.”
3. [The early-comer:] “I have come here today early in the morning with a  goods-filled chariot, seeking one who performs (sacrifice) well, the son  of my seeking.
Make (Indra?) drink the pressed (soma) of the exhilarating plant;
strengthen the hero-ruling (Indra?) with liberal gifts.”
4. The rivers, embodiments of joy, milk-cows, flow near to the one who has  sacrificed and the one who will sacrifice;
seeking fame, the streams of ghee on every side go near to him who
grants and has granted.
5. On the back of the firmament he stands firmly fixed. Whoever grants, he  goes among the gods;
to him the waters, the rivers stream ghee; for him this gift-cow (dakṣiṇā)  swells always.
6. For the givers of dakṣiṇās only there are these brilliant (bounties) here;  for the givers of dakṣiṇās there are suns in heaven.
Givers of dakṣiṇās have a share in immortality; givers of dakṣiṇās
lengthen their own lifetime.
7. Let those who grant not encounter difficulty or outrage; let the patrons,  of good commandment, not grow old;
let there be some other enclosure for them, but to the non-granting one  let there come the flames of pain.
## 126 Kaksı̣vant’s Da ̄ ̄nastuti
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 6–7
Kakṣīvant’s last hymn is, to be idiomatic, a humdinger. It details in extravagant  terms the gifts that King Svanaya Bhāvya presented to him, in return for the  fame the poet could bestow on him (see esp. vss. 1d and 2d). The first five verses  list the gifts, especially the (not quite believable) numbers of livestock, given  to Kakṣīvant and his family, the Pajras. The last of these verses (5) ends with  an elaborate simile, not all the details of which are clear, comparing the Pajras  seeking fame with noblemen seeking brides by attending maidens’ Svayaṃvaras  (bridal self-choice ceremonies) with their carts. (The word “cart” [ánas] is spe cialized in the R̥gveda for the vehicle that conveys the bride home.) The phrase  “(the Pajras) sought fame” (5d) provides a ring with the first verse (1d), where  the king, Kakṣīvant’s patron, is “seeking fame,” and brings the dānastuti proper  to a close.
The final two verses (6–7) provide an erotic, indeed rather obscene, appendix,  with a vignette of the poet and one of the girls he received as part of his gift.  Already in verse 3 “ten chariots carrying brides” were mentioned as part of his  loot, and the simile about Svayaṃvaras in verse 5 also helps set up the erotic  atmosphere. Besides the striking simile of a mongoose (kaśīkā, a playful variant  of the poet’s name Kakṣīvant) as sexual partner, verse 6 contains a number of  hapaxes and entirely unclear lexical items, which may well involve phonological  deformation to play on taboo words. (The second half of the verse appears to  allow the word yabh “fuck” to be assembled from parts of several words.) It is a  pity that we understand it as little as we do. The last verse (7) contains the osten sible and crudely seductive speech of the woman herself. Kakṣīvant has indeed  gone out with a bang.
1. Not feeble are the praises I present through my inspiration to Bhāvya  who lives on the Sindhu,
who meted out to me a thousand (soma-)pressings, the invincible king  seeking fame.
2. A hundred neck-ornaments of the king in want (of fame), a hundred  horses I took as soon as they were offered;
a hundred cows of the lord (I), Kakṣīvant, (have taken). (Now) his
unaging fame stretches to heaven.
3. The dusky (horses) given by Svanaya have come to me, and ten chariots  carrying brides.
A thousand and sixty cattle have followed. Kakṣīvant gained them at the  suppertime [=evening] of the days.
292 I.126
4. Forty sorrel (horses) of the ten-wagon train lead at the front a rank of a  thousand (cows).
Steeds arousing delight, covered with pearls, have the Kakṣīvants, the  Pajras swept up.
5. Following the previous presentation, I got for you three yoked (horses?)  and eight cows that suckle the stranger—
(for you,) the Pajras, who sought fame—as those of good lineage
provided with (wedding-)carts seek maidens with a choice, appropriate  to their clan.
6. She who, when squeezed and squished, keeps stinking like a mongoose— fusing (with me), the woman to be enjoyed [/coiled around] gives me  hundreds of “spurts”—
7. (Saying,) “Feel me up—keep going further. Don’t belittle my “little  things [=private parts].
I am entirely hairy, like a little ewe of the Gandhāris.”
Hymns I.127–139 are attributed to Paruchepa Daivodāsi. This poet is especially  fond of the long and elaborate atyaṣṭi meter, consisting of seven pādas, generally  arranged in three groups: 12 12 8 / 8 8 / 12 8. The eight-syllable pādas that end the  first and third “lines” (that is, pādas c and g) generally ring changes on the pāda  that precedes, by repetition of the last word(s), by lexical substitution of synonyms,  or by syntactic complementarity. A simple example of the first is I.127.1c, which  repeats the epithet jātávedasam, which also ended 1b. Lexical substitution is found  in 1g, where sarpíṣaḥ “of the melted butter” replaces ghr̥tásya “of the ghee” in 1f.  Sometimes the “rhyme” pāda contributes material necessary to complete the syntax  established in the preceding pāda. See I.127.2fg, where the rhyme pāda g provides  the verb that must be supplied in the relative clause in pāda f. There are more com plex relationships as well, including what will later be called śleṣas, with a word  or construction having two possible and incompatible readings. A nice example is  I.127.3bc, where the form druhaṃtaráḥ can be analyzed either as druhaṃ-tará “over
coming deceit” or dru-hantara “better at striking wood,” the former prevailing in  pāda b and the latter, because of the simile “like an axe,” in pāda c. This patterned  variation creates a pleasing effect. (In our translation the three groups of pādas are  separated into three lines, and the rhyme pādas c and g are set off by dashes.)
Paruchepa is also fond of rare words, sometimes phonetic deformations of  parallel words in the same verse, puns, and contorted syntactic constructions, and  many of the puzzles in his hymns have not been completely solved. But Geldner’s  judgment of his poetry—“wortreich, aber gedankenarm” (rich in words, but poor in  thoughts)—seems harsh and unjustified. These poems are difficult to work through,  but their verbal artistry and intricacy seem to us to provide a more than sufficient  reward.
## 127 Agni
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atidhr̥ti 6
Full of puns, phonological tricks, and syntactic give-and-take, this hymn celebrates  Agni in both his ritual role (e.g., vss. 1–2, 8, 10) and in his physical power (e.g., vss.  3–4, 6). The pleasures of the hymn come more from the interplay of the verbal ele ments than from any sustained thematic development, and in that sense Geldner’s  “gedankenarm” (quoted above) may be accurate, but who needs thoughts when we  have such words?
1. Agni I consider as the Hotar, rich in gifts, the good one, son of strength,  Jātavedas—like a poet, Jātavedas—
who is the god of good ceremony, with his body erect and pointed
toward the gods.
With his flame he yearns after the blazing forth of the ghee—of the  melted butter being poured.
2. We sacrificers would invoke you as best sacrificer, the oldest of the  Aṅgirases, o poet, with our thoughts—(invoke you) through our poets,  o glowing one, with our thoughts—
(you) like earth-encircling heaven, the Hotar of the settled domains, the flame-haired bull whom these clans (help)—let the clans help (him)  to speed.
3. Because he, shining upon the many with his radiant might, becomes  the overcomer of deceit—the overcomer of deceit, as an axe is an
excellent striker of wood—
at whose attack even the staunch aborts and whatever is solid, like
the trees,
going forth to conquer, he will hold his place, he will not be moved— with his conquering of the wastelands, he will not be moved.
4. Even the firm things give way to him, as is known. (The pious one) does  service with the piercingly hot kindling sticks, for help—he does
service to Agni for help.
He who plunges toward the many, he carves them with his flame
like trees.
Even solid foods he liquefies with his strength—even the solid with his  strength.
5. This fortifying power of his might we acquire in future (days), of him  who by night is more beautiful to see than by day—(more beautiful  to see) than the one who traverses by day [=sun], for (the man) whose  lifespan is not (yet) extended,294 I.127
because his [=Agni’s] lifespan provides a handhold, staunch like shelter  for a son.
His help, apportioned (to us?) or not, the unaging ones are pursuing— the unaging fires are pursuing.
6. For he is very noisy like the Marut troop, thundering widely in the  productive meadows—thundering widely in the disorderly meadows. The taker has taken, has eaten the oblations, as is his due, he the  beacon of the sacrifice.
And then when he is excited, bristling with excitement, all take pleasure  in his path—as the superior men [=Maruts] (take pleasure) in the  path to beauty.
7. When, yet again, the heaven-bound praisers, the Bhr̥gus, tendering  homage, invoke him—the Bhr̥gus, plundering (the fire from heaven),  churning it with piety—
Agni is lord of goods, the blazing one who is their holder—
then his dear coverings the wise one should seek to win—the wise one  should seek to win here.
8. We invoke you, lord of all the clans, houselord common to every one  of them, for benefit—you with your trusty vehicle of songs, for  benefit—
the guest of the sons of Manu, by whose mouth, as if by a father’s, (we) and all the immortals yonder (acquire) vigor—(place) the
oblations and vigor among the gods.
9. You, Agni, are born as strongest by your strength, most tempestuous,  for the divine conclave—like wealth for the divine conclave—
for most tempestuous is your exuberance and most brilliant your  resolve—
and then they attentively surround you, o unaging one—like obedient  (servants), o unaging one.
10. Let your (praise) (stand) out for the great one, who is strong by  strength, wakening at dawn, for Agni, as if for a winner of cattle—let  (your) praise stand (out) for Agni.
When someone with an oblation is calling on him in all the lands, in advance of (dawn’s) rays he “sings” [=crackles] like a hoarse-voiced  (singer)—the glowing Hotar, (in advance of) the rays.
11. Becoming visible in the nearest nearness, bring here to us, o Agni, in  concert with the gods, (riches) through your kind attention—great  riches through your kind attention.
Make us regard something great, o most powerful one, for our
benefit here.
Plunder, churn a great mass of good heroes for the praisers, liberal  one—like a mighty (warrior) with vast power.
## 128 Agni
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
8 verses: atyaṣṭi
The sacrificial fire is the relentless focus of this hymn, and it seldom strays from  the physical location of the fire on the ritual ground. Though its theme is clear  and inescapable, the hymn presents us with manifold interpretive difficulties in its  details, especially in the central verses 4–5, which, with their responsive fronted  krátvā (“though his resolve,” 4cd, 5a), may constitute an omphalos. There is also  some sign of ring composition: the first and last (8) verses each twice refer to Agni  as the Hotar, a word used nowhere else in the hymn, and the mentions of Manu in  verses 1–2 are answered by two occurrences of Manu in the penultimate verse (7).  In general there is much reuse of vocabulary through the hymn, and the poet plays  with the words “good” and “goods” in the second part of the hymn (vss. 5–6, 8).  Though the poet does not himself beg for goods, it seems clear that the desire for  goods he attributes to the gods (8fg) is shared by their human counterparts.
1. This one was born here on the foundation of Manu as the best sacrificing  Hotar, following the commandment of the fire-priests—Agni,
following his own commandment—
all attentive to the one who seeks a comrade, like wealth for the one who  seeks fame.
The undeceivable Hotar has sat down in the footprint of refreshment— enveloped in the footprint of refreshment.
2. The one who sends the sacrifice to its goal along the path of truth: we  make him our familiar with reverence accompanied by oblations—in  the conclave of gods (with reverence) accompanied by oblations.
Because of our presentation of nourishments he does not waste away  with this body,
he whom Mātariśvan (brought) to Manu from afar—the god he brought  from afar.
3. On his way he circles round the earthly (realm) in a single day,
swallowing it up in an instant, the bull (depositing) his seed ever
roaring—depositing his seed ever roaring—
observing with a hundred eyes, the god victorious in the woods,
taking his seat on the nearer ridges—Agni, on the further ridges.
4. Strongly resolved (to sacrifice), installed in front in every house, Agni is  attentive to the sacrifice, to the ceremony—through his resolve he is  attentive to the sacrifice.
Through his resolve he is a ritual expert for the straight-arrow; he has  watched over all beings
from the time when as guest he was born splendid with ghee—as the  conveyor (of the offering), the ritual expert, he was born.
296 I.129
5. When through his resolve and along with the roaring of fire, which is like  the roaring of the Maruts [=thunder], the (offering-)foods are infused  into his forces [=flames]—like foods for the vigorous one [=Indra?]—
because then he stimulates the giving (of good) and of goods by his might, he will rescue us from going astray, from the crooked way—from evil  utterance, from the crooked way.
6. Every (new fire), possessing extensive power, the spoked wheel (of the  sacrifice), the good one, takes (goods) in his right hand; advancing he  does not let (them) loose—because of his longing for fame he does not  let (them) loose.
For everyone who aims straight you have conveyed his oblation among  the gods.
To everyone who performs well he propels his wish—Agni propels apart  the two door-halves.
7. He has been established as most beneficial in the ritual enclosure  belonging to Manu; Agni (has been established) like a noble clanlord  at the sacrifices—a dear clanlord at the sacrifices.
He is master of the oblations of the sons of Manu, the oblations
prepared with the refreshing drink.
He will rescue us from the injury of Varuṇa—from the injury of the  great god.
8. Agni, the Hotar, the depository of goods do they reverently invoke; the  dear, most conspicuous one they have installed as the spoked wheel
(of the sacrifice)—they have installed as the conveyor of oblations— the one who provides all lifetimes and all possessions, the Hotar
deserving the sacrifice, the sage poet.
The gods, seeking goods, (have installed) the lusty one, for help—seeking  goods (they have installed) the lusty one with hymns.
## 129 Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atiśakvarī 8–9, aṣṭi 11
The hymn begins with familiar, and positive, themes: calls to Indra to aid our actual  chariot in prize-contests and also our metaphorical chariot, the sacrifice (vss. 1–2),  and these themes recur throughout the hymn. But the poet seems preoccupied  with more negative topics—not only rivals and enemies in battle (vss. 3–5, 10) and  demons (vss. 6, 9, 11), but also evil thoughts and words (vss. 6–8, 11). Bad Thought  appears to be personified as a menacing female in verse 8, and more surprisingly  Indra seems himself to have potential bad thoughts toward us, his worshipers,  which we must combat by supplying him with good things to think about (vs. 7). Given the forces thus arrayed against us, the calls for Indra’s protection grow ever  stronger toward the end of the hymn (vss. 9–11).
1. The chariot which you, o vigorous Indra, lead forward to gain
wisdom, though it [=chariot] is far away—(which) you lead forward,  faultless one—
just in a single day you will make it to prevail as a prizewinner if you so  desire.
(Thrust forward) (this chariot) for us, the ritual adepts, you faultless  thruster—like this speech for (us,) the ritual adepts.
2. Listen—you who in every battle are to be besought by men for your skill  for the battle cry, Indra—by men for your skill for the charge—
who with the champions win the sun, who with the poets overtake
the prize.
Those showing mastery set him to succeed as their prizewinner—a
fortifying power like a prizewinning steed.
3. For as wondrous one you swell the bullish skin; you keep away every  hostile mortal, o champion—(in that) you shun (that) mortal.
Indra, this to you and to heaven, this to self-glorious Rudra,
to Mitra and Varuṇa I proclaim at length—to the very merciful one at  length.
4. We wish to seek Indra as a lifelong comrade for ourselves, a victorious  yokemate—in the prize-contests a victorious yokemate.
(O Indra,) help our sacred formulations to help in every battle,
for a rival will not lay you low whom you lay low—any rival whom you  lay low.
5. Bow down the arrogance of every (rival) with your help like piercingly  hot kindling sticks—with powerful help, powerful one.
Lead us as before: you are regarded as free of guilt, o champion.
Carry away all (the goods?) from Pūru, as draft-horse—*like the
draft-horse [=Agni] with his mouth, (carry them) to us.
6. I would proclaim this to the soma-drop that is to come, the refreshing (drop)  that is to be poured and that, like him to be invoked [=Indra], sets my
thoughts atremble—the demon-smasher that sets my thoughts atremble. He himself should drive insults and bad thought away from us with his  murderous weapons.
The utterer of evil should drain away lower than low [=be miscarried?]— like a little speck he should drain away.
7. Might we win with our conspicuous invocation [/oblation]; might we win  wealth, o wealthy one, and an abundance of heroes—(wealth) that is  delightful and an abundance of heroes.
When he has bad thoughts (toward us) we would engorge him with  (words) good to think about and with refreshment—
298 I.130
Indra (we would engorge) with invocations to heavenly brilliance that  come true—the one worthy of the sacrifice with invocations to
heavenly brilliance.
8. (Let) Indra (be) more and more preeminent among us with his
self-glorious help in the shunning of bad thoughts—in the shattering  of bad thoughts.
She herself [=Bad Thought] is to be harmed who has sought us out
with her devourers.
She will be smashed, she will not wax strong—like a firebrand flung
aside she will not wax strong.
9. You, Indra, with wealth in profusion for us: drive along a faultless  path—drive forward along (a path) without demons.
Accompany us in the distance; accompany us close to home.
Protect us from a long way, from afar with your superior powers—
always protect us with your superior powers.
10. You, Indra, with surpassing wealth for us: greatness will accompany  you, who are so powerful, for our help—(accompany you) like an
ally for great help.
Most powerful rescuer and helper, (you help) every chariot,
immortal one.
Another one than us—any one—should you harm, o possessor of
the stone—(anyone) who (himself) intends harm, o possessor of
the stone.
11. Protect us, well-praised Indra, from failure, (you who are) always  a requiter of bad thoughts—as a god (a requiter) of bad
thoughts—
a smasher of the evil demon, a rescuer of a poet like me.
For the begetter has begotten you for this reason, o good one—has
begotten you as smasher of demons, o good one.
## 130 Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
10 verses: atyaṣṭi, except triṣṭubh 10
The first two verses of the hymn provide a conventional opening, with an invitation  to Indra to journey here to drink our soma. But this journey motif gives way to a  rapid sampling of Indra’s great deeds: Vala (vs. 3), Vr̥tra (vss. 4–5), battles against  various human and legendary enemies (vss. 7–8), ending with a truly impenetrable  verse (9) about the theft of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot and the involvement of  Uśanā, a myth that also elsewhere evokes all the obscurantism the Vedic bard has in  his control (see, e.g., V.29 and 31). The final verse of this hymn, in a different meter,  sums up the poets’ efforts to praise Indra. The emphasis on mythology in this hymn contrasts sharply with the immediately  preceding Indra hymn, by the same poet in the same meter, which lacks any mytho logical content.
1. Indra, drive here, right up to us from afar, (drive) on your own to the  landing site, like a master of settlements to the rites of distributions— like a king, master of settlements, to his house.
We invoke you, bringing you the pleasing offering when the soma is pressed. Like sons a father (we invoke you) for the winning of prizes—(you) most  munificent, for the winning of prizes.
2. O Indra, drink the soma being pressed by the stones, poured with a  bucket, like a buffalo drinking at a well-spring—like a thirsty buffalo. For your delightful exhilaration, for your most exceptional feeding,
let them [=your horses] guide you here, like the golden (mares) the Sun— like the Sun through all the days.
3. He found the depository of heaven, deposited in hiding, enveloped in the  stone like the embryo of a bird (in an egg)—within the boundless stone. The possessor of the mace, the best Aṅgiras, seeking to win (them) like a  pen of cattle—
Indra uncovered the nourishments that were enclosed—(opened) the  doors to the nourishments that were enclosed.
4. Firmly holding the mace in his hands, Indra honed it sharp like a carving  knife, for throwing—honed it for the smashing of the serpent.
Enveloping yourself with strength, with vast powers, with might, o Indra, like a carpenter a tree from the wooden one [=forest], you cut down (the  serpent)—as if with an axe you cut (him) down.
5. You, Indra, released the rivers to flow at will to the sea, like chariots— like prize-seeking chariots.
The enduring (rivers) hitched themselves up toward the same
imperishable goal,
like milk-cows yielding all milk for Manu—yielding all milk for the people. 6. This speech have the goods-seeking Āyus fashioned for you, like a clever  artisan a chariot—they have fashioned you for favor,
adorning (you / the speech), you inspired poet, like a thoroughbred,  prize-seeking horse at the contests for prizes,
like a steed for power, for winning riches—for winning all riches.
7. You, Indra, split the ninety strongholds for Pūru, for Divodāsa the  greatly pious, you prancer—with your mace (you split them) for the  pious, you prancer.
The strong one brought down Śambara from the mountain for Atithigva, the great one distributing riches with his strength—all riches with his  strength.
8. Indra aided the Ārya sacrificer in battles, affording a hundred forms of  help in all contests—in contests whose prize is the sun.
300 I.131
Chastising those who follow no commandment, he made the black skin  [=barbarians] subject to Manu.
As a burning (fire) scorches everything dried up, he scorches the
thirsty—scorches Arśaśāna down to the ground.
9. Just born, he tore off the wheel of the sun with his strength—(as?) at  the ritual meal the ruddy one [=Agni?/Sun?] steals speech—showing  mastery he steals it—
when you, o sage poet, had come from afar (to the house of) Uśanā
for help,
passing across all appeals for favor as if with Manu—as if passing
across all the days.
10. Because of our new hymns, you splitter of strongholds whose deeds are  bullish, protect us along with your capable protectors.
O Indra, being praised by the Divodāsas, you should grow strong, like  heaven through the days.
## 131 Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: atyaṣṭi
At the beginning of the first verse all cosmic forces conspire in giving Indra the first  rank, as a model for the similar honor and obeisance accorded him by men. But it  quickly becomes apparent (vss. 2–3) that Indra is also an object of contention and  competition among different groups of men, who all want him on their side. This con
tention is vividly depicted in verse 3. In verses 4–5 Indra’s own inclinations become  apparent: he aids priests and sacrificers and chastises those without sacrifice. In verse  6 we announce our own sacrifice to Indra, and thereby make a claim for his attention,  and in verse 7 we ask for further aid against our rivals and ill-wishers.
1. Because to Indra the lordly Heaven has ever bowed, and to Indra the  great Earth has bowed with her expanses—at the winning of heavenly  brilliance with her expanses—
Indra have all the gods in concert placed in front.
To Indra let all the pressings belong that stem from the sons of Manu— all the gifts that stem from the sons of Manu.
2. Because at all pressings those of bullish fervor thrust you forward, (each  of them) separately (thrusts you who are) one and the same—those
seeking to win the sun, (each) separately—
you, like a boat of deliverance, we would place at the chariot-pole of our  forceful (song),
making Indra take notice (of us) with our sacrifices as the Āyus did—as  the Āyus did Indra with their praises. 3. Those seeking aid, paired in opposition, have yanked you back and  forth, at the winning of the cowpen, as they set (the cows) free—being  victorious (over the cowpen), as they set (them) free, o Indra—
when you shove together the two peoples who are seeking cows and  going to (the winning of) the sun,
as you constantly display the bull partnered with (you)—the mace
partnered with (you), Indra.
4. The Pūrus know of this manly deed of yours, o Indra, that you brought  down the autumnal strongholds—being victorious you brought
them down.
You will chastise the mortal without sacrifice, o Indra, lord of strength. You stole the great earth (from him) and these waters—being
exhilarated, (you stole) these waters.
5. Since then they have constantly celebrated this manly deed of yours at  the revels: that, o bull, you aided the fire-priests—that you aided those  acting as comrades.
You made “Game,” for them to prevail in battles.
They kept winning one river after another—seeking fame they kept winning. 6. And now take note of this dawn—for one should enjoy it—of our chant,  of our oblation along with our invocations—at the winning of the
sun, along with our invocations.
When, o Indra, possessor of the mace, as bull you will have in view to  smash the negligent ones,
(listen) to me, this newer ritual adept—listen to the thought of (me), the  newer one.
7. You, powerfully born Indra, grown strong, being kindly toward
us: (smash) the mortal who acts the foe—that mortal, o champion,
with your mace—
smash (him and) whoever wishes us ill. Listen to (us), as the one who  listens best.
Let malevolence stay away, like an accident on a journey—let all
malevolence stay away.
## 132 Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
6 verses: atyaṣṭi
This short hymn contains many puzzles of detail, which render much of the trans lation provisional, but the general theme is fairly clear. The present time and the  current sacrifice are repeatedly highlighted (see, e.g., vss. 1–2), and the contrast  between now and the past is explicitly drawn (see vss. 3–4). As is usual when past
302 I.132
and present are invoked together, we ask Indra to aid us in the same way as he aided  his companions in myth, particularly, here, the Aṅgirases at the opening of the Vala  cave (vs. 4). The theme of speech, both by and about Indra, is also strongly high lighted, especially in the first four verses.
1. With you, bounteous Indra, aided by you, may we overcome those who  do battle over the foremost stakes—may we win against those who
seek to win.
On this, the nearest day speak on behalf of the soma-presser.
At this sacrifice may we pull out the perfect (“hand” of dice) at the
match—seeking the prize, (may we pull out) the perfect one at
the match.
2. At the match to win the sun, at the speech of the Propitiator, at the  very anointing of the one who wakes at dawn [=Agni]—at the very
anointing of the one being prepared [=soma]—
on (that) day Indra is to be invoked by every head [=person], in the way  that is known.
Toward us only let your gifts be directed—the auspicious gifts of the  auspicious one.
3. This pleasurable offering of yours is glittering as of old, when at the  sacrifice they [=sacrificers] made (you), the shield, as a peaceful
dwelling for themselves—you are the shield of truth, a peaceful
dwelling.
You should announce this now yet again. They [=poets?] look within  (themselves?) with the (coming of) the (sun’s) rays [=dawn].
“This Indra is certainly known as a seeker of cows—as a seeker of cows  for those who dwell among their kindred.”
4. Now in the current way and in the earlier one it is to be proclaimed of  you, that you opened up the enclosure for the Aṅgirases—o Indra,
doing your best, (you opened) up the enclosure.
In the same way as for them, win and fight for us.
For those who press soma, weaken anyone who follows no
commandment—who follows no commandment, even when he rages. 5. When the champion makes the peoples see in accord with his
conceptions, seeking fame they will surpass when the prize is set—
seeking fame they will distinguish themselves.
To him they chant, for him to thrust (to them) with his strength a (full)  lifetime along with offspring.
In Indra do our thoughts desire to establish their home—our thoughts  (going) as if to the gods.
6. You two, Indra and “Mountain” [=mace], who fight in the front— whoever would give battle to us, smash that very one away—with a
mace smash that very one. (Under these circumstances, even) an abyss will be pleasing to (that one,)  who has fled into the distance—an abyss he will seek to reach.
O champion, (surround) our rivals all around on all sides—let the
splitter split (them) on all sides.
## 133 Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: triṣṭubh 1, anuṣṭubh 2–4, gāyatrī 5, dhr̥ti [atyaṣṭi] 6, atyaṣṭi 7
This metrically complex hymn is the last one in the Paruchepa Indra cycle and is  longer by one verse than the preceding hymn (I.132). It also falls naturally into  two parts on the grounds of meter, subject matter, and diction: verses 1–5, which  are mostly in dimeter meter and have an Atharvan cast, and verses 6–7 in atyaṣṭi  (or modified atyaṣṭi) meter, which more nearly resembles the atyaṣṭi hymns ear
lier in the cycle. As Oldenberg already saw, we can thus analyze it as two hymns,  of five and two verses respectively, which then conform to the usual patterns of  arrangement.
The first hymn contains a number of odd formations, whose meaning and ety mology are unclear; our renderings are provisional. Despite these uncertainties, we  can happily grasp the gusto with which the poet urges Indra to destroy troops of  witches and other demonic beings.
The second short hymn also enthusiastically rouses Indra against enemies, but in  a style more recognizably R̥gvedic, and it situates the action in the interplay between  the soma-pressing sacrificer and Indra, the recipient of the soma and the sacrifice.
1. Both world-halves I purify with truth; the deceits—great, but lacking  Indra—I burn up entirely,
where the enemies, having attacked, lay slain, crushed all around the  Place of Hostility.
2. You also having attacked, o possessor of the stone: cut off the heads of  the witches
with your foot that overcomes obstacles—with your foot that overcomes  great obstacles.
3. Bounteous one, smash down the troop of these witches
at the mudflat (called) Place of Hostility—at the mudflat (called) Place  of Great Hostility.
4. When you scattered afar thrice fifty of them with your attacks,
this (deed?) of yours displays your zeal—this little (deed?) of yours
displays your zeal.
5. Pulverize the tawny-spiked, ballsy Piśāci entirely, Indra.
Tear down every demon.304 I.134
6. Dash the great ones downward, Indra; listen to us. For heaven has blazed  like the earth with fear, o possessor of the stone—as if with fear of
(the sun’s) heat, o possessor of the stone.
As the most tempestuous one, you speed with your tempestuous,
powerful weapons of death,
smashing those who are not men, o unopposable champion, along with  your warriors—o champion, along with your thrice seven warriors.
7. For the one who presses soma wins the dwelling place of profusion; for  by pressing, he dashes hatreds down through sacrifice—(dashes) down  hatreds toward the gods.
Just by pressing, he desires to win thousands, as an unobstructable
competitor.
To the presser Indra gives what is ready to hand—he gives the wealth  that is ready to hand.
## 134 Vāyu
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
6 verses: atyaṣṭi
As in most Vāyu hymns, the overriding focus here is on Vāyu’s journey to the early morning sacrifice and his right to drink first of the soma. The setting of the hymn  at dawn is conveyed by verses 3–4, and the priestly gifts that are distributed at this  morning ritual are alluded to in verses 1–3.
1. Let the speedy ones, hastening, convey you here to the pleasurable  offering, o Vāyu, to drink first—to drink first of the soma.
Let Liberality stand upright following your intention, recognizing it. On a chariot with a team drive here for giving—o Vāyu, for the giving of  bounty.
2. Let the invigorating drops invigorate you, Vāyu, as they are being  prepared by us, well-prepared, heaven-bound—being prepared with  cows [=milk], heaven-bound.
When his help, being prepared in order to succeed, follows his skill,
our teams, our poetic thoughts are directed toward a single goal, toward  giving—our poetic thoughts call upon him [=Vāyu] (for giving).
3. Vāyu yokes his chestnut pair, Vāyu his ruddy pair, Vāyu the two nimble  ones to the chariot, to the chariot-pole to pull—the best pullers to the  chariot-pole to pull.
Awaken Plenitude, as a lover awakens her who sleeps.
Reveal the two world-halves; make the dawns shine—for fame make the  dawns shine. 4. For you do the gleaming dawns stretch their auspicious garments in  the distance, into the houses at the rays (of the sun)—their brilliant  (garments) at the new rays.
For you will the milk-cow, milking her juice, milk out all good things. You begat the Maruts from the belly—from the belly of heaven.
5. For you do the glittering, gleaming, rapid, strong ones [=soma drinks /  horses] set themselves aquiver at the revels—(like waves) of the waters  they set themselves aquiver.
You does the stealthy (hunter), as he wearies, reverently invoke for good  fortune in his swooping pursuit.
You drink before every creature by statute—you drink because of your  lordship by statute.
6. You, Vāyu, with no one ahead, have first right to the drinking of these  soma drinks of ours—you have the right to the drinking of these
pressings.
And of the clans with their vying oblations who have twisted (you
toward them)—
all their milk-cows have milked out the milk-mixture for you—have  milked out the ghee and the milk-mixture.
## 135 Vāyu (1–3, 9), Indra and Vāyu (4–8)
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
9 verses: atyaṣṭi, except aṣṭi 7–8, arranged in tr̥cas
The second of Paruchepa’s Vāyu hymns is longer than the first, and presumably  originally consisted of three hymns, corresponding to the tr̥ca divisions. For most  of its length it is preoccupied with the usual themes of Vāyu hymns: Vāyu’s journey  to the sacrifice with his many teams and his right to the first drink of soma at the  Morning Pressing. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) is an invitation to Vāyu alone; the second  (vss. 4–6), thematically and verbally parallel to the first, is addressed to Vāyu and  Indra, who share the second soma oblation at the Morning Pressing.
The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is less straightforward. The first of its verses (7) seems to  describes an ongoing sacrifice to which Vāyu and Indra are traveling, a journey con tinued in the first part of verse 8. And the fortunate results of the successful sacri fice are described at the end of verse 8, the thriving of stock and agriculture. But in  between is the mention of a mysterious fig tree. The final verse (9) is even more mys terious, with its unidentified oxen of paradoxical movement and habits. Since the  vocabulary is reminiscent of the Marut lexicon, the oxen may be the Maruts, and  the association of Vāyu (Wind) with the thunderstorm may be depicted. The pas sage also reminds us of the mysterious oxen in I.105.10, which may be astronomical
306 I.135
phenomena. And, of course, in a hymn focused on the soma sacrifice, any unidenti fied referent may be the soma drinks.
1. The ritual grass is strewn. Drive up to us, to pursue it, with a thousandfold  team, o teamster—with hundredfold (teams), o teamster—
for the gods have conceded to you, the god, to drink first.
The pressed, honeyed (soma drinks) have been set forth for you—have  been set forth for your exhilaration and for your resolve.
2. For you has this soma been purified all around by the stones; clothing  himself in coveted (garments) he rushes around the cask—clothing
himself in gleaming (garments) he rushes.
For you is this portion poured among the Āyus, is the soma poured  among the gods.
Travel, Vāyu; drive to our teams [=poetic thoughts], seeking us—drive at  your pleasure, seeking us.
3. With your hundredfold teams drive here to our ceremony, with
thousandfold ones to pursue it—o Vāyu, to pursue our oblations.
Yours is this portion at its proper time, accompanying the reins [=rays]  when the sun (rises).
Being carried, they have been guided by the Adhvaryus—o Vāyu, the  gleaming (soma drinks) have been guided.
4. The chariot with its team will convey you two here for aid, to pursue the  well-placed pleasurable offerings—o Vāyu, to pursue the oblations.
Drink of the honey of the stalk, for the first drinking was established for  you two.
O Vāyu, you two come here with shimmering bounty—and Indra, you  two come here with bounty.
5. Our thoughts should turn you two hither to our ceremonies; they  keep grooming this drop, the prizewinner—(the drop) swift like a
prizewinning steed.
Drink of these (soma drinks), seeking us; come here to us with help. O Indra and Vāyu, (drink) of them, pressed by stones, you two—(drink)  to exhilaration, you two prize-givers.
6. These soma drinks were pressed here in the waters for you two. Being  carried, they have been guided by the Adhvaryus—o Vāyu, the
gleaming (soma drinks) have been guided.
They have surged toward you two, swift across the filter,
seeking you two beyond the sheep’s fleece—the soma drinks beyond the  sheep’s (fleece).
7. O Vāyu, drive beyond sleeper after sleeper. Where the pressing stone  speaks, you two go there—(you) and Indra, go to that house.
Liberality has been sighted; the ghee is flowing. With a full team you two  drive to the ceremony—(you) and Indra drive to the ceremony. 8. Just now you two travel to the poured offering of honey. The victorious  ones [=soma drinks? Maruts?] that approach the fig tree—let these be  victorious for us.
All at once the cows give birth and the grain ripens; the milk-cows do  not give out for you, o Vāyu—the milk-cows do not give up.
9. Here, o Vāyu, are those oxen of yours [=soma drinks? Maruts?],
arm-strong, which fly in the river—the oxen that are greatly arrogant— that are not swift though on dry land, yet are nimble in the mountains  though their home is not there,
like the reins [=rays] of the sun difficult to hold back—difficult for the  hands to hold back.
## 136 Mitra and Varuṇa
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: atyaṣṭi, except triṣṭubh 7
Though the paired divinities Mitra and Varuṇa dominate this hymn, they have  plenty of Ādityan company: Aryaman in verses 2, 3, 5, 6; Bhaga in verses 2 and  6; their mother Aditi in verse 3. And as the hymn nears its conclusion there are  non-Ādityan gods as well: Indra and Agni in verses 6–7, the Maruts in verse 7. The  hymn is defined by a ring formed by verses 1 and 6 (vs. 7 is in a different meter  and extra-hymnic), with matches of key words in both verses: “lofty,” “reverence,”  “compassionate,” and “approach with praise.”
Unlike many Mitra and Varuṇa hymns, the focus here is not on their ethical role,  but on their status as receivers of sacrificial offerings. The rising sun in verse 2 (see  also vs. 3) suggests the Morning Pressing, where Mitra and Varuṇa are among the  dual divinities who receive a joint cup of soma. The position of the hymn, imme
diately following two hymns to Vāyu, the first recipient of soma at the Morning  Pressing, supports this view.
1. Present preeminent, lofty reverence to the two attentive ones; present  an oblation, a thought to the two compassionate ones—the sweetest  (oblation) to the two compassionate ones.
They are the two sovereign kings, whose potion is ghee, approached with  praise at every sacrifice.
And so the dominion of these two is not to be challenged from
anywhere—their divinity is never to be challenged.
2. The way has appeared—a wider one for the wide (light); its path has  been firmly guided by the reins of truth—its eye by the reins of Bhaga. Heaven-dominating is the seat of Mitra and of Aryaman and Varuṇa. And so they two assume lofty vigor, worthy of hymns—lofty vigor to be  approached with praise.
308 I.137
3. Light-filled, sunlit Aditi who upholds the communities do the two  accompany every day—being wakeful every day.
Light-filled dominion do they acquire—the two Ādityas, lords of the drop. Of these two Mitra (is the one who by nature) sets the peoples in order,  but Varuṇa (does as well)—(also) Aryaman sets the peoples in order. 4. Let the one here, this soma, be most wealful for Mitra and Varuṇa, the  one who gives shares in the drinking places—the god who gives shares  to the gods.
Him should the gods enjoy, all of them today in joint enjoyment.
O kings, you shall do just as we beg—you truthful ones, as we beg.
5. The person who has done honor to Mitra and Varuṇa, that unassailable  one do you two protect all around from difficult straits—the pious
mortal from difficult straits.
Him Aryaman guards, him who aims straight following his commandment, him who with hymns tends to the commandment of these two—with  praises tends to their commandment.
6. Reverence I proclaim to lofty heaven, to the two world-halves, to Mitra  and to Varuṇa who gives rewards—to the very compassionate one
who gives rewards.
Approach Indra and Agni, heaven-dominating Aryaman and Bhaga with  praise.
Living for a long time may we be accompanied by progeny—may we be  accompanied by the aid of Soma.
7. With the aid of the gods, with Indra on our side along with the Maruts,  might we consider ourselves self-glorious.
Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa will extend shelter; may we attain it—we and the  bounteous ones.
## 137 Mitra and Varuṇa
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
3 verses: atiśakvarī
Short and relatively simple, this hymn continues the ritual focus of the previous  hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa. The pressed soma in its various forms, the gods’ jour ney to our sacrifice, and the time, sunrise, are its only topics. For some reason,  the hymn has attracted more than its share of scorn: Renou (EVP VII: 33) calls it  “assez banale et facile,” and Gonda (1975: 212) classifies it among hymns that are  “banal, mediocre or devoid of a deeper meaning.” Perhaps the lack of the high  moral tone found in most Mitra and Varuṇa hymns aggrieved these commentators,  but taken on its own terms, with its rollicking rhythm and restricted phraseology, it  makes a pleasant impression. 1. We have pressed—you two, drive hither—with the stones; these
exhilarating ones here are mixed with cows [=milk]—these
exhilarating soma drinks.
You two kings, touching heaven, come here right to us, into our midst. These with their milk mixture are for you two, Mitra and Varuṇa—the  clear soma drinks and those with their milk mixture.
2. Here—you two, drive hither—are the drops, the soma drinks mixed with  curds—the pressings mixed with curds.
And at the waking of the dawn, simultaneous with the rays of the sun, it is pressed for you two, Mitra and Varuṇa, for drinking—the pleasing  one (pressed) for truth and for drinking.
3. This plant, like a dawn cow, do they milk for you two with the stones— the soma they milk with the stones.
Come here right to us, into our midst, nearby, to drink the soma.
Here it is, pressed by men for you two, Mitra and Varuṇa—the soma  pressed for drinking.
## 138 Pūsaṇ
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
4 verses: atyaṣṭi
This hymn lacks the colloquial tone and idiomatic style of most Pūṣan hymns.  Instead, as befits the elaborate meter, this is high-register praise, with a somewhat  bombastic and overblown edge and contorted syntax.
The poet is especially concerned to establish “fellowship” (sakhyá, vss. 2–4) with  the god—fellowship that will bring wealth and aid along with it.
1. Ever further is (the greatness) of powerfully born Pūṣan proclaimed: the  greatness of him, the powerful, does not flag—the praise of him does  not flag.
Seeking his favor, I chant to him, whose help is nearby, who is
refreshment itself,
who, the bounteous, has bound to himself the mind of everyone—the  bounteous god has bound it to himself.
2. So, Pūṣan, with praises I put you forward, like a nimble (horse) on its  course, so that you will get the negligent ones on the move—like a
camel you will carry (us) beyond the negligent ones.
When I, a mortal, call upon you, a god, who are refreshment itself, for  fellowship—
make our songs brilliant—make them brilliant when prizes (are at stake).
310 I.139
3. Pūṣan, since in fellowship with you your admirers who have just this  purpose have benefitted by your aid—have benefitted with such a
purpose (as ours)—
in accordance with this we implore you for a newer team of wealth.
O you who are not wrathful, who are widely proclaimed, be a
contender—whenever a prize (is at stake), be a contender.
4. Will you come near to us, for the winning of this (“team” of wealth), you  who have goats for horses, who are not wrathful but bestowing—you  who have goats for horses, (for the benefit) of those who seek fame?
We would turn you hither with praises that achieve their goal,
wondrous one,
for I do not disdain you, glowing Pūṣan, nor do I spurn your fellowship.
## 139 All Gods
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except br̥hatī 5, triṣṭubh 11
This complex hymn presents many interpretational difficulties, though it roughly  follows the model of the Praügaśastra, a recitation at the Morning Pressing found  also in R̥gveda I.2–3, I.23, and II.41. The order of divinities in the Praügaśastra  is Vāyu, Indra and Vāyu, Mitra and Varuṇa, the Aśvins, Indra, the All Gods, and  Sarasvatī; this hymn follows this order through verse 6:  Indra and Vāyu (vs. 1),  Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 2), the Aśvins (vss. 3–5), Indra (vs. 6), but ends with Agni (vs.  7), the Maruts (vs. 8), Indra and Agni (vs. 9), and Br̥haspati (vs. 10), with verse 11  in a different meter and addressed to all the gods collectively.
The ritual situation is established at the very beginning, with the quotation  of a familiar sacrificial formula ástu śrauṣaṭ, found all over middle Vedic ritual  texts. This ritual-internal quotation is matched, in ring-compositional style, by the  quotation of a praiṣa, or ritual command to the Hotar, in verse 10, the last real  verse of the hymn. It is also clear that the time is early morning (see esp. vs. 4,  though there are also more oblique indications in the first two verses), and that the  sound of the pressing stones is calling the gods to the sacrifice (see vs. 3, and its  ring-compositional echo in vs. 10).
As so often, the difficulties in the hymn may stem in part from the fact that the  poet is reflecting on his poetic lineage and calling. The obscure reference to the  “umbilical tie” or “navel” in verse 1 is made somewhat clearer by verse 9, in which  the poet asserts that his “umbilical ties” are with a series of earlier seers and sacri
ficers, including Manu—whose own ties are to the gods. He thus provides himself  with a poetic pedigree and in following their track, or model, produces his own  hymns that have some chance of reaching the gods, since his predecessors’ did.  In verse 1 he mentions only one such predecessor: Vivasvant (lit., “possessing the shining forth”), who in later Vedic and even in late R̥gveda (Vālakh., VIII.52.1) is  considered the father of Manu and who is often associated, as a proto-priest, with  the pressing of soma. (His Avestan correspondent Vīvaŋuuaṇt is the first man who  pressed haoma [Y 9.4].) So in verse 1 our poet proclaims that he is beginning a new  hymn, by newly attaching himself to a legendary seer-sacrificer. But there is another  likely meaning there as well: Vivasvant is identified as the sun in later Vedic, and  quite possibly in some passages in the R̥gveda as well, and therefore the poet may  also be making reference to the time of “shining forth,” namely early morning.
The double reference to ritual poetry and to dawn continues in verse 2. Mitra  and Varuṇa take “untruth away from truth,” thus enabling the poet and his peers  to see the gods’ golden throne. On the one hand, the untruth can be darkness, and  the removal of this darkness reveals the sun. On the other hand, the priests see this  vision with their insights and their mind, and though they also see with their eyes,  these are the “eyes of soma,” presumably the vision arising from drinking the soma.  So on another level of interpretation what they see is a poetic vision.
The three Aśvins verses (3–5) are fairly clear descriptions of the journey of those  gods to the dawn sacrifice, and the invitation to Indra (vs. 6) is also straightforward,  as is the praise of the Maruts (vs. 8). This clarity is unfortunately obscured in verse  7, whose translation is only provisional, though the direct speech of Agni is quite  intriguing. He seems to be chiding the gods for having given the Aṅgirases a cow  they (or in most interpretations, Aryaman and unspecified others) have milked out.  From the mythological point of view, the cow should represent the cows imprisoned  in the Vala cave that the Aṅgirases helped to liberate. In a ritual context this could  be the cow that provides the milk to mix with soma; in a poetic context the poetic  insight or vision that provided the Aṅgirases with songs. The role of Aryaman here  is entirely unclear.
As noted above, in verse 9 the poet situates himself in the poetic and sacrificial  tradition, and in verse 10, another obscure verse (Geldner calls it “unintelligible”  [unverständlich]), the ritual and poetic ring is closed.
1. (Cry) “Let it be; he will hear.” I place Agni in front through my insight.  Now we choose that heavenly troop—we choose Indra and Vāyu.
Since our (umbilical tie) has been effectively bound anew to the umbilical  tie in Vivasvant’s (sphere),
then let our thoughts go forth—our thoughts (going) as if to the gods. 2. Since, Mitra and Varuṇa, you took untruth away from truth by your own  fervor—by your own fervor of skill—
just in this way among the seats we saw the golden (throne) of you two, just with our insights and with our mind, with our own eyes—with our  own eyes of soma.
3. O Aśvins, the Āyus, seeking the gods, with their praise songs are causing  you two to hear, as if making the signal-call (of the pressing stone)
heard—the Āyus (are causing) you two (to hear) about the oblations.
312 I.139
In you two are all splendors and nourishments, o you who grant all  possessions.
The wheel-rims on your golden one spray (honey)—on your golden  chariot, wondrous ones.
4. It has appeared, wondrous ones: you two unclose the firmament;  your chariot-horses are yoked at the rituals of daybreak—the
unbesmirched ones at the rituals of daybreak.
Your station is on your chariot box, on your golden chariot,
wondrous ones—
(you two) going as if on a path, directing (the chariot) through the  dusky realm—directing (it) straightway through the dusky realm. 5. With your powers, you two whose goods are powers, favor us by day  and by night.
Let your giving never give out—let your giving never give out from us. 6. O bull Indra—these pressed drops, the drink of a bull, pressed by the  stones, are bursting out—for you are the pressed (drops) bursting  out.
Let them invigorate you to giving, to great, glittering generosity. Being praised with songs, you whose vehicle is songs, come here—very  compassionate to us, come here.
7. Listen to us, Agni: Reverently invoked, you will say to the gods worthy  of the sacrifice—to the kings worthy of the sacrifice:
“Since, gods, you have given this milk-cow to the Aṅgirases,
they milk her dry. Aryaman is in partnership with the performer  [=Agni/priest]—he knows her (too), in partnership with me
[=Agni].”
8. Let these manly deeds of yours not get old because of us, and let the  brilliant deeds not age—let them not age before us.
What glittering, immortal (deed) of yours shall sound anew in every  generation,
o Maruts, fix that firm in us as well as (brilliance) difficult to surpass— and what is difficult to surpass.
9. Dadhyañc, the earlier Aṅgiras, Priyamedha, Kaṇva, Atri, and Manu  know my birth—these earlier ones and Manu know mine.
Their attachment is to the gods; our umbilical ties are to them
[=ancient seers].
(Following) along their track I bend (them) here greatly with a song—I  bend Indra and Agni here with a song.
10. (Crying) “The Hotar-priest shall sacrifice,” he wins what is choice of the  wooden (cup) [=soma]. Br̥haspati the seeker sacrifices with the bulls  [=soma drinks?]—with the bulls with their many choice gifts.
By ourselves we have grasped the signal-call of the pressing-stone  signaling its intentions afar. The very resolute one upheld the fittings [?]—the very resolute one
(upheld) the many seats.
11. O gods, the eleven of you who are in heaven, the eleven who are on  the earth,
the eleven who dwell in the waters in their greatness—(all) of you, gods,  take pleasure in this sacrifice here.
Hymns I.140–164 are attributed to Dīrghatamas, the son of Ucatha, who calls himself  Māmateya, the son of Mamatā, in I.147.3, 152.6, and 158.6. The name Dīrghatamas  means the one “of long darkness.” The Br̥haddevatā IV.14–15 (Macdonell) explains  that he received this name because he was born blind, and the poet himself refers to  his blindness in I.147.3. According to the Br̥haddevatā his sight was later restored  by the gods. His name is also an appropriate reflection of the difficulty of many of  his hymns. His affection for word play, symbolic language, syntactic anomaly, and  ambiguous reference makes his hymns distinctive, original, and often highly elusive.  He is one of the most challenging, but at the same time one of the most interesting  poets of the R̥gveda.
His hymns also present an unusual sequence of divinities. The list begins con ventionally enough with I.140–150, which are dedicated to Agni, but the ordinar ily expected series to Indra is missing. Instead 151–153 are to Mitra and Varuṇa,  154–156 to Viṣṇu or to Viṣṇu and Indra, 157–158 to the Aśvins, 159–160 to Heaven  and Earth, and 161 to the R̥bhus. Then 162 and 163 are praises of the sacrificial  horse, and 164, the climax of the collection, is a very long and very puzzling riddle  hymn, which explores the mysteries of several Vedic rites. The second Aśvin hymn,  I.158, is of particular interest because it is ostensibly an autobiographical hymn,  composed when the poet was an old man and on the verge of being pushed aside.  Partly on the basis of this hymn Br̥haddevatā IV.21–25 gives a second legend that  his servants tried to drown Dīrghatamas. But he floated downstream and was res cued in Aṅga where he married and then gave birth to the poet Kakṣīvant.
## 140 Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
13 verses: jagatī, except jagatī or triṣṭubh 10, triṣṭubh 12–13
This first hymn in the Dīrghatamas cycle is bristling with difficulties in detail,  although it remains focused on its central topic, the kindling and spread of the fire.  The first two verses establish the ritual scene, with the ritual fire sitting on (or at) the  vedi, the “altar” that is really a dug-out depression in the ground on the axis between  the eastern and western ritual fires, and with the poet’s presentation of his “thought”  (a praise hymn) as clothing for the ritual fire. But natural fire, which spreads through  the woods and devours them, is also referred to, especially in verse 2.314 I.140
The chronological description of the kindling and growth of fire begins in verse  3 with a vivid depiction of the kindling sticks and the first faint stirrings of smoke  and fire. The growing power of the fire and the swiftness of the spread of its flames,  imagined as horses in verse 4, occupy the next verses (4–10). Fire’s burning of the  plants that stoke it is given an erotic cast in verses 6–8, aided by the fact that several  words for “plant” are feminine in gender. Their very destruction by fire is also envi
sioned as a transformation into a better and more vigorous form (see esp. vss. 7cd–8). The prayers for aid and material goods begin in verse 10, on behalf not only  of a generic “us” but especially mentioning our patrons (vss. 10, 12) and others of  our circle (vs. 12). One striking request is for a metaphorical boat to deliver us to  the far shore of difficulty (vs. 12); the boat is described in some detail, including its  possession of a foot or feet. We wonder if this refers to some sort of primitive keel  or centerboard, which would probably be helpful to ensure that the boat make it  across the current of a swift-flowing river. Unfortunately our knowledge of ancient  Indian naval architecture is not sufficient to decide.
1. To him sitting on the altar, the very bright one whose domain is dear—to  Agni bear forth his womb like a wellspring (of nourishment).
As if with a garment, clothe the blazing one with a thought—the
smiter of darkness whose chariot is of light, whose color is blazing  bright.
2. Having two births, he stretches toward the threefold food. In a year what  was eaten (by him) has grown again.
With the mouth and the tongue of one (of his forms) he is a
thoroughbred bull; with the other he drags down the trees (like) an
elephant.
3. Plunging into the black, jerking back and forth, both his mothers  [=kindling sticks], sharing the same abode, move athwart each other  toward their child—
to him, producing smoke, his tongues stretching forward, stirring
thirstily, quivering, worthy to be attended upon, the increaser of his  father [=priest].
4. For Manu and the offspring of Manu to come they are harnessed—the  speedy (horses) seeking to break free, running fast, drawing black furrows, quick, racing fast, breaking ranks, sped by the wind, swift.
5. After that do these (flames) of his, producing smoke, rise at will, making  and remaking a black void and a great form,
while he goes forth, stroking the great (earth) as his streambed, snorting,  thundering, constantly roaring.
6. He who, like a busy attendant, keeps bending over the brown (females  [=plants])—he goes toward (them) like a bull to his wives, constantly  bellowing. And, showing his power, he beautifies their [?] bodies. Like a fearsome  (bull), the one difficult to grasp keeps shaking his horns.
7. He masses together those spread asunder and those close-packed  [=plants]. Recognizing the (females) just as they recognize him, he
lies in his own (place).
They grow again; they approach divinity. They make for themselves a  form different from their parents, (though) in company with them.
8. For the long-haired spinsters embrace him; despite having died, they  stand erect (to go) forth once again for Āyu [=Agni?].
Removing their old age, he goes constantly roaring, generating a
further living life-force (for them?), which cannot be laid low.
9. Licking all around his mother’s [=earth’s] over-garment, he drives  across the expanse with his powerfully spirited warriors,
producing vigor for the footed, while licking and licking always. The  white (track of ash) follows along his tracks.
10. Shine upon our bounteous (patrons), o Agni. Then as the snorting bull,  the master of the household,
*having set loose the females who have young [=flames], you have
shone, ever flickering and enveloping like armor in battles.
11. Let this well-formed (thought) be dearer to you than one poorly  formed, o Agni, and dearer to you even than your own dear thought. With what of your body shines blazing bright you will win treasure  for us.
12. For our chariot and for our house, o Agni, give us a boat with built-in  oars and a foot [=keel? rudder?],
which will carry our heroes and our bounteous (patrons) and our
peoples to the further shore and which (will be) our shelter.
13. O Agni, may you welcome just our recitation, (as may) heaven and  earth, and the rivers, which sing their own praises
as they go toward an abundance of cattle and of grain through the
long days. The ruddy (dawns/cattle?) will choose refreshment as their  boon (for us?).
## 141 Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
13 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12–13
Like the last hymn, this one is full of puzzles, and also like the last, it focuses  especially on the birth and growth of the fire. The hymn begins and ends with the  installation of the ritual fire (root dhā: 1ab, 13ab), providing a faint ring struc ture; the second mention of its installation, with the adverb pratarám “further
316 I.141
forward,” suggests that it refers to the installation of the new Āhavanīya fire to the  east, a fire removed from the old Āhavanīya at the beginning of classical śrauta  rituals.
The first few verses cryptically describe the various forms of fire (vs. 2) and their  production (vss. 3–4). The means of production are at first mythical or metaphori cal, but in the second half of verse 4 the more familiar ritual churning of the fire is  described, followed by his growth and rapid and unpredictable movement (vss. 5–8;  see also vs. 1c). This type of erratic movement is iconically mirrored with extraor dinary skill by our poet Dīrghatamas, who models it with abrupt changes of tense  and a deliberate disregard for the usual matching of syntax and verse structure. In  our reading there are enjambments across verses in 3–4, 4–5, and 6–7, with sentence  breaks in verse-interior in 4, 5, 6—a very rare conjunction of syntactic anomalies.  The vertiginous effect of piling clause upon clause and image upon image is espe cially marked in the sequence beginning with 6b and lasting through 7—giving us  a faint whiff of the Gerard Manley Hopkins of “The Windhover,” which models a  bird’s flight with verbal means.
The rest of the hymn is somewhat more conventional, beginning with verse 9,  where Agni is addressed for the first time in the 2nd person. Until then not only is  the hymn couched entirely in the 3rd person, but the word agní is entirely absent,  either as the name of the god or as a designation of the natural substance fire.  Verses 9–10 describe Agni’s contributions to the welfare of both men and gods,  while verses 12–13 express hopes for further help and summarize the hymn itself.  But even here, in verse 11 the poet plots a meandering syntactic and conceptual  course starting from the “good fortune” (bhága) desired to be acquired in 10d and  amplified in the first half of verse 11 to a pun on the god’s name Bhaga, with a rich  set of images, a clashing set of objects to the verb “hold fast,” and a covert syntactic  transformation of that very verb at the end of the verse.
All in all, a tour de force of virtuosity.
1. Yes, indeed! It is just so: the luster of the god, lovely to see, has been  installed for wonder, after he was born of strength.
When he zigzags up to it, our thought goes straight to success. Flowing  together, the streams of truth have led (him).
2. Abounding in food, he lies in his own (place) as the wondrous form  of nourishment; his second (wondrous form lies) here among the
mothers, sevenfold kindly.
His third (wondrous form, that) of the bull to be milked, have the young  women begotten—him of tenfold forethought.
3. When the patrons, showing mastery through their power, bring him forth  from the depth, from the form of a buffalo,
when Mātariśvan churns him who, as from olden days, is in hiding in the  mixing vessel of the honey, 4. When he is led forth from his highest father, he mounts the
nourishment-bringing plants in the houses,
when the two [=kindling sticks] set his birth in motion. Just after that  the youngest one became blazing with heat;
5. Just after that he entered into his mothers, within whom the blazing one  (stayed) without suffering harm. He grew widely in all directions,
when he mounted the previous ones [=plants] who spurred (him) on  from of old. He races down into the newer, later ones.
6. Just after that they choose (him as) their Hotar at the rituals of  daybreak. As if gorging themselves on good fortune, they steer
straight (to him),
since he, much praised, with resolve and with might always pursues the  gods and the laud (of) mortals in order to suckle them,
7. When he, worthy of the sacrifice, has spread out, driven by the
wind, wriggling through the old (plants?) like a twisting (snake),
unconfined
in his flight—(the flight) of this burning one of black plumage and
blazing birth, whose road spreads through the airy realm.
8. Like a driving-chariot made by dexterous (men), he speeds toward  heaven with ruddy limbs.
After that these black (plumes) of his, the patrons of the burning one,  retreat from his turbulent flaring, as (from that) of a champion, like  birds (from that) *of the sun.
9. By means of you, o Agni, have those rich in drops [/gifts] become  exultant—Varuṇa whose commandments are upheld, Mitra, and
Aryaman—
since, following them, you were born extending everywhere by your  resolve, encompassing (everything) like a felly its spokes.
10. You, o Agni, impel treasure and the conclave of the gods to the man  who labors and presses soma, o youngest one.
Might we now acquire [/install] you anew, o young (son) of strength,  like good fortune [/Bhaga] at the decisive moment, o you who have
great treasure.
11. For us you will engorge good fortune [/Bhaga] like household wealth  meant for a good purpose, like enduring skill,
([good fortune/] Bhaga) who will hold fast both races [=gods and men],  like reins, (and also) the laud of gods, and (who himself), of good
resolve, (is held fast) in truth.
12. And the bright-flashing, delighting Hotar with his lively horses and  gleaming chariot will hear us.
Without error Agni will lead us with the best leading to desirable safe  passage, to a better state.
318 I.142
13. Agni has been praised with our energetic chants [/with his ardent  flames], while being installed further forward for sovereign rule.
Both those who are our bounteous (patrons) and we (ourselves) would  extend outward, as the sun (extends) beyond the mist.

Unlike Dīrghatamas’s dense and dexterous Agni hymns among which this hymn is  embedded, this Āprī hymn not only follows the set pattern of that genre, but, using  the standard Āprī diction and tropes (for which see the introduction to I.13, as well  as the general introduction, pp. 33, 63), does so without any perceptible tricks or  poetic exuberance. Its only deviation from the norm is having thirteen verses rather  than the usual eleven or twelve, by including both Tanūnapāt (vs. 2) and Narāśaṃsa  (vs. 3) and by having two svāhā verses at the end (12–13). Dīrghatamas (if he is  indeed the poet) seems to be treading water here.
1. Kindled, o Agni, convey the gods here today to the man with offering  spoon extended.
Stretch the ancient thread for the pious man who has pressed soma.
2. O Tanūnapāt, measure out the ghee-filled, honey-filled
sacrifice of an inspired priest like me, of the pious man who labors.
3. Gleaming, pure, and unerring, Narāśaṃsa mixes the sacrifice with  honey
three times a day—the god devoted to the sacrifice among the gods.
4. When solemnly invoked, o Agni, convey Indra here, brilliant and dear, for this thought of mine is twisting its way toward you, o you who have  good tongues.
5. They whose offering spoons are extended are strewing the ritual grass at  the sacrifice with its good ceremonies;
I twist (the grass), which provides the broadest expanse to the gods and  extensive shelter to Indra.
6. Let them gape open—the great ones who increase through truth—for the  gods to come forth:
the purifying, much-desired, inexhaustible Divine Doors.
7. Being happy, let well-ornamented Night and Dawn,
the two youthfully exuberant mothers of truth, sit close together on the  ritual grass.
8. Let the two Divine Hotars, poets possessing gladdening tongues and  offering welcome,
perform this sacrifice for us today, (so it) reaches its goal and touches  heaven. 9. Let gleaming Hotrā Bhāratī [/the Oblation of the Bharatas], fitted in her  place among the gods, among the Maruts,
(also) Iḷā and great Sarasvatī, (all) worthy of the sacrifice, sit on the  ritual grass.
10. Let Tvaṣṭar, inclined toward us, for the sake of our thriving and wealth,  unbind in our navel
that unerring flow of semen as an abundant choice thing, abundant in  itself.
11. Releasing (the sacrificial victim) to the gods, sacrifice to the gods by  yourself, o Lord of the Forest.
Agni sweetens the oblations, the wise god among the gods.
12. To Vāyu, accompanied by Pūṣan and the Maruts, by all the gods, and to Indra, pulsing with excitement from the songs, make oblation  with the svāhā-cry.
13. Come here right up to the oblations made with the svāhā-cry, to pursue  them.
Indra, come! Hear our summons! You do they summon at the
ceremony.

Dīrghatamas Aucathya
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8
The beginning and end of this hymn focus on the ritual fire and our relationship  to it. The poet begins (vs. 1) by presenting to Agni what he has produced, char acterized as an evolving product: an “insight...the thinking of my speech.” The  poet’s concern with his insight returns toward the end (vss. 6–7), where it is hoped  that Agni will pursue our speech and promote our insights. In between the hymn  touches on many of the standard Agni tropes: for example, the beauty and radiance  of the newly kindled fire (vss. 2–3) and its destructive power (vs. 5). It ends (vs. 8) by  begging for Agni’s protection.
1. I present a stronger, newer insight to Agni, the thinking of my speech to  the son of strength,
the Child of the Waters, who, together with the good ones [/Vasus], has  sat down upon the earth as our dear Hotar at his season.
2. As he was being born in the highest distant heaven, Agni became  manifest to Mātariśvan.
By the resolve and the might of him as he was kindled, his blaze
illuminated heaven and earth.
3. His are the dazzling, his the unaging radiant beams—he possessing a  lovely appearance, a lovely face, a lovely flash.
320 I.144
The (beams) of Agni, with the energy of their radiance, are churning like  rivers of the night, across (the nights), unsleeping, unaging.
4. The all-possessor whom the Bhr̥gus have aroused upon the navel of the  earth, of the living world, in his greatness—
Agni—urge him on with songs here in his own home, him who alone  rules like Varuṇa over what is good.
5. Who is not to be hindered, like the roar of the Maruts, like an army  unleashed, like a heavenly missile,
with his sharp fangs Agni eats; he devours. Like a fighter his rivals, he  bears down on the trees.
6. Surely Agni will be the pursuer of our speech? Surely the good one with  the good ones [/Vasus] will grant our desire?
Surely as a goad he would push our insights to win? I sing to him who  has a blazing face with this insight.
7. The one who has kindled him for you all stretches toward ghee-faced  Agni, sitting on the chariot-pole of truth, as if toward Mitra
[/an ally].
A foal [?] while being kindled, shining at the rites, he will raise up our  insight, whose color is blazing bright.
8. Staying close, o Agni, protect us with your kindly, able protectors that  stay close.
With your undeceivable, undistracted, unwinking (protectors), o object  of our quest, protect our kindred all around.

7 verses: jagatī
As in other of Dīrghatamas’s Agni hymns, the kindling of the ritual fire provides  the major theme of this hymn. In particular, the middle verses 3–5 concern the pro duction of fire by the two churning sticks and the growing strength of that fire. The  hymn begins, however, with the already fully matured fire, identified as the Hotar,  going about his ritual duties (vss. 1–2). The verse immediately after the kindling  verses (vs. 6) opens the ritual frame: Agni there is the ruler of the realms of heaven  and earth, and he even attracts those divine figures (probably Heaven and Earth,  though some have suggested Night and Dawn) from their cosmic positions to take  their place on the ritual ground. The final verse (7) is a typical hymn-ending verse,  commending the hymn just recited to Agni’s enjoyment.
1. The Hotar goes forth to his duty with his craft, setting aloft our insight,  which possesses blazing ornaments. He strides toward the ladles turning in respectful circumambulation,  which first kiss his domain.
2. Those who produce the milk of truth [=streams of melted butter?] have  bellowed to him—those surrounded on every side in the womb of the  god, in his seat.
When, borne away, he dwelt in the lap of the waters, then he suckled  upon his own powers by which he speeds.
3. The two of the same vigor [=fire-churning sticks] seek to keep hold of  that marvelous form, constantly crossing each other in turn, toward  the same goal;
after that he is to be invoked like Bhaga. He has been firmly held by us,  as a chariot-driver holds firm the reins of a draft-horse.
4. He whom the two of the same vigor serve—that pair in the same womb,  sharing the same dwelling—
the gray youth was born by day, not by night—he who roams unaging  through many generations of the sons of Manu.
5. Our insights and our ten fingers urge him on. We mortals invoke the god  for help.
From the high plain he sets the slopes in motion. With his advancing  (flames?) he has established the new (ritual) patterns.
6. For in your own person, o Agni, you rule over the heavenly and the  earthly (realm) like a herdsman.
These two lofty, dappled females [=Heaven and Earth? Night and
Dawn?], excelling in splendor, golden, surging, have attained to your  ritual grass.
7. O Agni, enjoy and delight in this speech—o gladdening one of
independent power, born of truth, with strong resolve—
you, lovely to see, facing in every direction, who are delightful to the  sight like a peaceful dwelling abounding in food.

Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5
The hymn begins with the peremptory (2nd pl.) command “Ask him!” In the first  two verses Agni is depicted as the possessor of secret knowledge that we mortals beg  him to impart to us and, in verses 2–3, as the god who is always attentive to the sac rifice whose success he ensures. A sample of his secret knowledge seems to be given  in verse 4, a riddling and, at least for these translators, unsolved depiction of ritual  activity. The final verse forms a ring with verse 1. It begins with a continuation of  the riddling language of verse 4: the “wild beast of the waters” may be a reference to
322 I.146
Agni’s identification with Apām Napāt (“Child of the Waters”), whose roaming in  the woods refers to his burning of firewood. Once installed as the ritual fire in pāda  b, Agni implicitly answers the questions asked of him in verses 1–2 in pāda c: he  explains the ritual patterns to us. In the final pāda he is characterized by the same  vocabulary as in verse 1:  “knowing” (vidvā́n) matching “he knows (veda) of 1a;  “perceiver of truth” ([r̥ta-]cít) matching “the one who perceives” (cikitvā́n) of 1b.
1. Ask him: he has come; he knows. As the one who perceives, he is  implored; he is now implored here.
In him are our commands, in him our wishes [/offerings]. He is the lord  of the victory prize and of unbridled power.
2. Just him do they ask, but he himself does not ask in turn, since, like a  clever man, with his own mind he has grasped it.
He does not forget the first nor the later word. Undistracted, he is
accompanied by his resolve.
3. Just to him go the offering ladles; to him the mares [=streams of ghee?].  He alone will hear all my words.
Enjoining many ritual commands, triumphant, bringing the sacrifice to  success, offering uninterrupted help, (though) a child, he has taken on  his ferocity entirely.
4. He proceeds in a reverential approach (to them) when they [=flames?]  have raised themselves up together. Just born, he has crept together
with the conjoined ones.
He touches the swelling one for joy and delight, when the willing females  [=streams of ghee?] go to him standing right there.
5. This wild beast of the waters that roams in the woods has been installed  upon the uppermost skin.
He has declared the (ritual) patterns to mortals—the knowing Agni. For  he is the perceiver of truth who is really present (here).
## 146 Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Dīrghatamas’s usual preoccupation with the birth and growth of the ritual fire.  In verse 1 Agni is seated in the lap of his two parents, in our opinion the fire churning sticks, though they are not explicitly identified and other interpreters see  the two as cosmic entities. (See I.140.3, 141.4, 144.3–4 for other allusions to these  sticks in Dīrghatamas’s Agni hymns.) The fire grows in verse 2 and is tended in  verse 3. Unidentified duals are found in both verses; the ambiguity seems deliber ate, allowing the pair to represent both the churning sticks in the ritual realm and Night and Dawn (or Heaven and Earth) in the cosmic realm, as the diction referring  to the pair becomes closer to that used especially of Night and Dawn elsewhere.  After a somewhat enigmatic verse (4) sketching Agni’s relationship with poets, the  god is depicted as a birth-giver (using a word ordinarily appropriate only to the  female at parturition)—thus bringing his life-cycle full circle, as it were, from birth  to giving birth.
1. I will hymn three-headed, seven-reined Agni, who is without deficiency,  seated in the lap of his parents [=fire-churning sticks],
one (stick) that moves and one that stays firm—(Agni,) who has filled all  the luminous realms of heaven.
2. The great young bull has grown upon the two (sticks?). Unaging, ever  young, he stands tall.
He sets his feet down upon the back of the broad (earth); his ruddy  (flames) lick the udder.
3. Converging upon the same calf, the two well-grounded milk-cows  wander apart on their separate ways,
measuring their roads whose end can never be reached, taking upon  themselves all the intentions of the great one.
4. Clever poets guide his step, guarding with their heart, in different ways,  the one exempt from age.
Seeking to win him, they have surveyed the river. He has become
manifest to them as the sun toward men.
5. Desirable to be seen, a thoroughbred around the racecourse; greatly to be  invoked for the small one to live,
since in many places he has become the birth-giver to these embryos—  he, the generous one for all to see.
## 147 Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a departure from Dīrghatamas’s focus in previous Agni hymns on  the creation and spread of the ritual fire. Though it begins in a ritual situation (vs.  1) and the poet commends his ritual speech to Agni in the first half of verse 2, the  poet then becomes preoccupied with potential hostilities directed against him by  malevolent and dishonest men and how to foil them. He counts upon the protec
tors deployed by Agni (vs. 3), who may well be the flames referred to in verse 1, and  more generally assumes that well-performed worship of Agni will enlist that god in  his protection. Who the hostile mortals are is not made clear, though in a R̥gvedic  ritual context rival sacrificers are the most likely culprits.324 I.148
The insistence on the cheating and duplicity of these rivals and the general  embattled but combative tone of these verses remind us somewhat of similarly con tentious passages in the Old Avestan Gāthās attributed to Zarathustra.
It is also worth noting that this is the first time in the Dīrghatamas cycle that he  refers to himself by name, that is, by his metronymic Māmateya (vs. 3).
1. How do the blazing (flames?) of you, of Āyu, panting hard, perform  ritual service with prizes of victory, o Agni,
when, establishing both progeny and posterity, the gods delight in the  melody of truth?
2. Take heed of this most munificent speech of mine that has been brought  forward, o youngest one of independent will.
One man reviles but another sings welcome: as an extoller, I extol your  body [/myself], o Agni.
3. Agni, your protectors who, watching, guarded blind Māmateya
[=Dīrghatamas] from distress,
those of good (ritual) action has the possessor [/knower] of everything  [=Agni] guarded. Though wishing to damage, the cheats did no
damage at all.
4. O Agni, the ungenerous one wishing us ill and full of hostility who  harms us by his duplicity,
let this heavy spell be back at him: he should bring harm upon his own  body by his evil words.
5. Or, o strong one, the mortal who with premeditation harms a mortal by  his duplicity,
from him protect your praiser, o you who are praised. Agni, no one
should give us over to distress.
## 148 Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn shares some of the concern about malicious enemies with the previous  hymn (I.147); see especially verses 2a and 5. However, the situation is more fluid  and the identity of both friends and enemies is unclear, since the subjects of some  crucial actions are not specified and a liberal use of injunctive verb forms blurs the  temporal reference.
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with an apparent reminiscence of the original mythic  theft of fire and its first installation on the ritual ground. The performers of this  installation (1c) are not identified, but seem likely to be the gods. Verse 2 presents  two inimical but unnamed groups: those who cannot damage Agni but presumably  want to (2a) and those who delight in all his actions (2cd). The latter must be the performers of the ritual, probably both the current mortal ones and the gods who  initiated the sacrifice in verse 1, but the enemies in 2a are defined only by their con trast with the others. Verse 3 appears to reprise the action of verse 1, but in present  time as the regular (re-)installation of the ritual fire for the regular, repeated rites  performed by men—given the “leading forward” of 3c, perhaps the removal of the  Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya fire and its deposit in the east of the ritual  ground.
Verse 4 is a thematic intrusion, with a standard description of a wildfire in  nature. Verse 5 returns to the topic of 2a: Agni’s invulnerability even when only  nascent. A notable feature of verse 5 is the mention of the inability of the blind  enemies of Agni to afflict him with the evil eye, given that Dīrghatamas identified  himself as blind in the immediately preceding hymn (I.147.3).
1. Since with effort Mātariśvan stole him, the Hotar bringing all goods,  belonging to all the gods,
whom they installed for wonder among the clans of the sons of Manu,  dazzling like the sun, far-radiant,
2. Just him, who gives (inspired) thoughts, they cannot damage. Agni is my  armor: he delights in this.
They take pleasure in all the acts of him, the bard who produces the  invitatory praise.
3. Whom even now those worthy of the sacrifice have grasped in his very  own seat and installed with lauds,
him they lead forth, grasping him in their quest, hastening like
chariot-horses.
4. The wondrous one dissolves many things with his fangs. After that,  far-radiant, he shines in the wood;
after that the wind fans his flame, like an arrow, the shot of a shooter,  through the days.
5. Whom neither cheats nor hurtful men hurt with their hurt, though he is  in the womb,
him can the blind, unable to see, not damage by casting an eye on him.  His very own ones who please him have guarded him.

Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: virāj
The name Agni is not mentioned in this short and enigmatic hymn. Especially in the  first verse and a half its application to Agni is quite uncertain; Geldner suggests that  Soma is referred to there. In our view the poet is certainly keeping the referent open  at the beginning of the hymn, but moves closer and closer to a clear identification
326 I.150
of Agni as the hymn proceeds. This gradual disclosure of the subject of the hymn  replicates the way that the fire is slowly and carefully kindled and then emerges from  its hiding place, flaming up, when it catches. The kindling is cryptically depicted in  verse 2, while the burst of light and energy takes over verse 3. In the final two verses  (4–5) he is identified as Hotar, a standard role for Agni, and he is revealed as fully  grown, powerful, and a partner in the sacrifice with the mortal worshiper. Thus the  hymn reflects Dīrghatamas’s usual preoccupation with the birth of Agni, though it  is treated somewhat differently here.
1. The lord of the house hastens toward great riches—the forceful one here  in the footprint of the forceful good thing.
The stones just honor him as he soars near.
2. He who is the bull of the two world-halves as of men by his renown,  whose surge is swelled [/drunk] by living beings,
who, though running forward, would still remain fixed in his womb,
3. Who has illuminated the low-lying flatland like a stronghold—a steed, a  poet, like a charger bursting forth,
shining like the sun, possessing a hundred selves [=flames?].
4. Possessing two births he has surmounted the three luminous realms,  blazing through all the airy spaces—
the best sacrificing Hotar in the seat of the waters.
5. Here he is, the Hotar possessing two births, who with desire for fame has  granted all desirable things (to him),
the easily spurred mortal who performs ritual service for him.

3 verses: uṣṇih
A curious pendant to Dīrghatamas’s Agni cycle, with many puzzles despite its  brevity. The poet seems to begin by declaring his allegiance and service to Agni  and making his claim for guest-friendship (hence the “stranger” in vs. 1) and pro tection on that basis. In verse 2 he rejects the patronage of a non-sacrificer, despite  his riches, while in verse 3 he returns to the benefits that accrue to the devotee  of Agni.
1. Performing much ritual service for you, I call myself a stranger (under  the protection) of you, o Agni,
as if under the protection of the great goad [=sun].
2. (I go) away (from the protection) of the rich man who lacks force, who  gives nothing even when oblations are made,
who, not seeking the gods, is never forthcoming. 3. O inspired one, (I) a mortal (call myself) the luminous one, great, the  proudest in heaven.
Zealous for you, o Agni, might we become more and more preeminent.
## 151 Mitra and Varuṇa
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
9 verses: jagatī
The second part of this hymn (vss. 6cd through 9) is fairly straightforward, depict ing Mitra and Varuṇa as the focus of the sacrifice and the patrons of the sacrificer.  The first part is a different story—enigmatic in reference and convoluted in expres sion. However, it appears to concern the same topic: Mitra and Varuṇa’s presence at  and participation in the sacrifice. We can therefore think of the hymn as an example  of large-scale “poetic repair,” with the second part rephrasing the first in less con torted expressions. (On poetic repair see Jamison 2006.)
The hymn begins with the birth of Agni, presented both as ritual fire and as  formidable god. The first half of verse 1 places the birth at the sacrifice itself, “amid  the cows and the waters,” in our opinion referring to the two auxiliary substances  necessary for soma preparation, the milk for mixing and the water for rinsing and  diluting. But in the second half of the verse the birth causes cosmic consternation,  with the two worlds set atremble by his size and his “song,” presumably a reference  to the crackling of a blazing fire.
Mitra and Varuṇa make their appearance in verse 2, as sacrificial partners of  a named soma-offerer; they are brought to the ritual ground and urged to aid the  ritual participants. But the theme of birth returns in verse 3.  Contrary to most  interpretations, we consider the birth in question to be Agni’s birth, treated already  in verse 1, not the birth of Mitra and Varuṇa. (The dual pronoun vām in 3a is in  Wackernagel’s Position, and we construe it later in the verse, as often.) As in verse  1, humans assist at the birth of the ritual fire, a birth that has cosmic resonances.  Mitra and Varuṇa also assist, bringing their skill to bear for the sacrifice (here  referred to as “truth” [r̥tá]) and the fire. Their contributions to the sacrifice are also  treated in verse 4; the skill mentioned in verse 3 they bring from heaven (4c), while  they also make ready the soma-preparing waters mentioned in verse 1 (4d). Soma  preparation is also the subject of the next verse (5). The cows (that is, their milk)  are depicted turbulently milling around the ritual ground, bellowing at the three  times of day associated with soma-pressing—dawn, midday, and sunset. (It should  be noted that vs. 5 is the most puzzling verse in the hymn, and our interpretation  does not entirely match those of others scholars.) In the first half of verse 6 we  return to the ritual fire, kindled in verse 1—or rather to its flames, conceived of as  “long-haired females.” (The poet, Dīrghatamas, uses the same image and the same  word in I.140.8, where the reference to flames is clearer.)
328 I.151
As mentioned above, the highly wrought and cryptic treatment of the sacrifice  and Mitra and Varuṇa’s place in it is succeeded, starting with the second half of  verse 6, by a fairly uncomplex restatement of the major themes.
1. Whom [=Agni] like an ally [/Mitra] those very attentive ones, seeking  cattle, begot with energy at the ceremony amid the cows and the
waters—
the two world-halves trembled by reason of his dimensions and his song,  in confronting him, the dear help of (all) the races, worthy of the
sacrifice.
2. Just now when the associates of Purumīḍha the soma-offerer, like allies  [/Mitras], have brought you two forward,
now find the will and the way for the one who chants, and listen to the  possessor of the dwelling place, you two bulls.
3. The settlements attended upon (his) birth, which was worthy to be  proclaimed in the two world-halves, for the sake of your great skill,
o bulls.
When you bring it [=skill] for truth, when for the steed [=Agni?], with  the oblation you energetically pursue the rite.
4. It is the settlement greatly dear (to you) that (gets) ahead, o lord(s)—o  truthful ones, you two loudly sound your lofty truth—
You (hitch up) your skill from lofty heaven (to be) ready at hand; you  hitch up the waters like an ox to a yoke-pole.
5. (Like) the two great (world-halves) in their greatness you two propel the  desirable reward here. The milk-cows, pushing and shoving (though)  not raising dust, are at the (ritual) seat.
They cry out to the sun at its zenith (and) up to its setting (and) through  the dawns, like a bird (screeching) in swooping pursuit.
6. The long-haired females [=flames] have bellowed to you for truth, where  [=ritual seat] you are chanting the way, o Mitra, o Varuṇa.
Send (them) surging down by yourselves; swell our insights: you two have  control over the thoughts of the inspired poet.
7. (The man) who as he labors piously serves you with sacrifices, the poet  and Hotar who performs the sacrifice, bringing his thoughts to
success—
it’s him that you come near; you pursue his rite. Seeking us, come here to  our songs and our good thinking.
8. They anoint you first with sacrifices and with cows. O truthful ones, as if  at the yoking of mind
they bring you songs along with uninterrupted thought. With
undistracted mind you have attained rich (vigor).
9. You have acquired rich vigor; you have attained it—rich, great, and  enduring—with your magic arts. Through the days neither the heavens nor the rivers have attained your  divinity, nor the Paṇis your bounty.
## 152 Mitra and Varuṇa
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The nub of this hymn may be found in verse 5c, “(Though it cannot be) compre hended, the youths enjoy the formulation,” and the poet almost seems to be recom mending this course of action to us, the audience:  to enjoy poetic formulations  whether we understand them or not. The hymn provides a number of examples on  which to test this advice.
The power of formulated truth and the frequent opacity of its verbal form are  both treated early in the hymn. In the first verses the poet affirms the close associa tion of Mitra and Varuṇa with truth and their power to defeat untruth (see 1cd, also  indirectly 3d), while in both 2a and 3b he questions the ability of ordinary people to  comprehend. The object of the comprehension is left undefined (“this,” 2a; “that,”  3b), but in our opinion it is the formulation, or the “truth,” or the speech of the  gods and/or poets. He then implies that whether or not we comprehend is immate rial, for mantras proclaimed by poets come true (2b) regardless of whether or not  they were understood by their hearers.
Verse 3 seems to contain a few test formulations (3a, 3c) and comments on them  (3b, 3d). The formulations are constructed as paradoxes: the footless one who is  first of the footed (3a); the embryo who carries its own burden, contravening the  usual expectation that the embryo is the burden that the mother bears (see, e.g.,  III.46.5, VI.67.4, X.27.16). The next three verses (4–6) concern the familiar myster
ies of the ritual day: the rising of the sun following the dawns (vss. 4–5) and the  flaring up of the fire fueled by streams of melted butter (vs. 6). These predictable  daily occurrences are implicitly identified as conforming to “the ordinance of Mitra  and Varuṇa” (vss. 4d, 5d).
The final verse is a simple invitation to the sacrifice with prayers for the  gods’ aid.
1. You two wear garments of fat; your counsels are unbroken torrents. You have brought low all untruths; you keep company with truth.
2. Many a one will not comprehend this (formulation?) of theirs, (but) the  virile mantra, proclaimed by poets, comes true.
The mighty four-edged (weapon) smites one with three edges; the
scorners of the gods were the first to waste away.
3. “Footless she [=Dawn] goes as the first of the footed.” Who
comprehends that (formulation?) of yours, o Mitra and Varuṇa?
330 I.153
“The unborn child bears his burden even here.” He guides the truth
across; he has brought down untruth.
4. We look him over, the lover of maidens [=Sun], only when he is going  forth but not when he is settling down near (them)—
(the Sun) wearing (garments) not removed (from the loom), (still)
stretched out (on it)—following the dear ordinance of Mitra and
Varuṇa.
5. Born without a horse, a steed without a rein, ever whinnying he [=Sun]  flies with arched back.
(Though it cannot be) comprehended, the youths [=Maruts? Aṅgirases?  gods?] enjoy the formulation, as in (the presence of) Mitra and Varuṇa  they hymn their ordinance.
6. Aiding the son of Mamatā [=Dīrghatamas], the milk-cows will swell the  one who gives pleasure with formulations [=Agni?] in the same udder. Knowing the ritual patterns he should seek a share of the food. Seeking  to win her with his mouth, he should make broad space for Aditi
[/Boundlessness].
7. Might I turn you two here, Mitra and Varuṇa, to the enjoyment of our  oblation by my reverence, o gods, and with your help.
Ours is the formulation that should prevail in battles; ours is the
heavenly rain that provides deliverance.

This little collection of Dīrghatamas’s Mitra-Varuṇa hymns (I.151–153), which  have especially concerned their presence at and participation in the sacrifice, ends  with this short piece announcing the present sacrifice offered to the two gods. It  focuses on the ritual details and on the priestly personnel.
1. Of one accord we shall sacrifice greatly to you two, o Mitra and Varuṇa,  with oblations, with reverence,
and with ghee, you ghee-backed ones, as when the Adhvaryus among us  bring (soma) to you along with their insights.
2. A well-turned preliminary praise song, like the yoking up (of mind), has  been offered to you two, (following) your ordinance, o Mitra and Varuṇa; when the Hotar anoints you at the ritual distributions, the patron is  striving to attain your favor, o bulls.
3. Aditi, the milk-cow, swells for truth and for the person who gives  offerings, o Mitra and Varuṇa,
when serving you at the ceremony, he spurs you two on. The one upon  whom the oblation is bestowed [=Agni] is like the human Hotar. 4. When the clans are to be exhilarated, the cows and the goddess Waters  swell the (soma) stalk for you,
and the lord of this house of ours is foremost. Pursue (the rite); drink of  the milk of the ruddy cow.
## 154 Viṣṇu
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the only hymns dedicated entirely to Viṣṇu, this composition reads almost  like a round, with phraseology that is constantly repeated and recombined. The focus  of the hymn is narrow: the three strides made by Viṣṇu, which measured out the cos mic spaces, earth, midspace, and heaven, and provided room for the creatures to live.  These strides are also conceived of as footsteps, which contain the good things sought  by the poet, and which he aspires to reach (vss. 5–6). This goal provides a forward  thrust to the poem, despite the uniformity of the vocabulary throughout. Viṣṇu’s  footsteps are also credited with somewhat surprising actions: in verse 4 they “find ela tion by their own power” and in verse 6 the highest step “shines down amply.”
1. Now shall I proclaim the heroic deeds of Viṣṇu, who measured out the  earthly realms,
who propped up the higher seat, having stridden out three times, the  wide-ranging one.
2. In this way Viṣṇu will be praised for his heroic deed—(he who is) like a  fearsome wild beast, living in the mountains and roaming wherever it  wants,
in whose three wide strides dwell all living beings.
3. Let my fortifying thought go forth to Viṣṇu, the mountain-dwelling,  wide-ranging bull,
who alone with just three steps measured out this dwelling place here,  long and extended,
4. Whose three steps, filled with honey, never becoming depleted, find  elation through their own power,
who alone supports heaven and earth in their three parts and all living  beings.
5. Might I reach that dear cattle-pen of his, where men seeking the gods  find elation,
for exactly that is the bond to the wide-striding one: the wellspring of  honey in the highest step of Viṣṇu.
6. We wish to go to the dwelling places belonging to you two [=Viṣṇu and  Indra], where there are ample-horned, unbridled cows.
There that highest step of the wide-ranging bull shines down amply.
332 I.155
## 155 Viṣṇu and Indra (1–3), Viṣṇu (4–6)
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
6 verses: jagatī
This hymn starts by praising Indra and Viṣṇu jointly (vss. 1–2), but by verse 3 (pace  the Anukramaṇī) it is entirely Viṣṇu’s. The beginning seems to offer alternative sce narios for the creation of the wide space that is ordinarily attributed to Viṣṇu’s  three strides. In verse 1 the two gods standing on the back of the mountains seem  to enlarge the space, and in verse 2 their clash (presumably with unnamed enemies)  creates breathing room, while they also deflect the arrow of the archer Kr̥śānu,  whose presence here is not explained. (Kr̥śānu is best known as the archer who
shoots at the falcon that steals the soma from heaven; cf. IV.27.3, IX.77.2.) The first half of verse 3 showcases two contrastive pairs: unspecified females  (possibly hymns?) who strengthen his masculine nature, and (by implication) a son  who induces his two mothers (Heaven and Earth?) to enjoy the semen. The para doxical quality of these actions is clear, but the exact contents are not. The second  half of the verse introduces the “three” so characteristic of Viṣṇu, though used of  names, not strides; nonetheless, the same expansion of space, into highest heaven,  seems to be at issue. Verse 4 seems almost like a “repair” of verse 3: it is clear in 4a  who is tending to “his great masculine nature” (unlike 3a), and in the second half  we have the familiar three strides, not three names. Verse 5 continues the theme of  the three strides, while a different numerological topic, the year, closes the hymn  (vs. 6).
The paired verses 3 and 4, with their mysteries and paradoxes, appear to consti tute an omphalos.
1. Announce in chant the drink from the stalk to the great champion who  exercises insight [=Indra] and to Viṣṇu,
the two undeceivable ones who stand on the back of the mountains
mightily like (riders) on a steed heading straight to the goal.
2. The turbulent clashing of you two vehement ones is right to the point: it  makes wide space for you two soma-drinkers, o Indra and Viṣṇu,
who cause (the arrow) to go wide just as it is being aimed at the mortal,  the shot of the shooter Kr̥śānu.
3. These (females) strengthen that great masculine nature of his; he leads  his two mothers down to enjoy the semen.
The son sets in place the lower and the higher names of the father and  the third name in the luminous realm of heaven.
4. It is just this very masculine nature of his that we sing—of him, the  forceful rescuer who gives rewards and keeps the wolf away,
who strode widely across the earthly (regions) with just three paces, for  the wide-ranging to live. 5. On catching sight of just two strides of him of sunlike appearance, a  mortal bestirs himself.
His third no one will dare, not even the winged birds in their flight.
6. With the four times ninety names [=days], he has caused the paired  (horses) [=days and nights] to quiver like a wheel set rolling.
Having a lofty body, measuring out (the realms?) with verses, the youth  who is no boy returns to the challenge.
## 156 Viṣṇu
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: jagatī
The primary deed of Viṣṇu, his claim to fame—the three strides—is not mentioned  directly in this hymn. Instead, he is presented as a protean divinity, likened to or  identified with a number of other gods, especially Agni. This superimposition begins  with the first pāda of verse 1, where he is compared to Mitra, and in verse 2b the  association with the Wives of the Gods immediately brings Tvaṣṭar to mind. In verse  4d he is identified either with Indra/Br̥haspati or with an Aṅgiras in the allusion to  the Vala myth, and earlier in that verse (pāda b) “the ritual expert associated with  the Maruts” may be a reference to Indra, who may be called “ritual expert of the  Maruts” (vedho marútām) in I.169.1. But the primary association appears to be with  Agni. The title “ritual expert,” though used of other gods (like Indra, see above), is  especially characteristic of Agni, and the references to Viṣṇu as embryo and to his  birth (vss. 2–3) are typical Agni themes (compare 3b especially with VI.48.5, of the  birth of Agni). The “three seats” in verse 5 also recalls Agni with his three hearths,  and this word may in fact signal the point of contact between Viṣṇu and Agni, since  “three” is the number that defines Viṣṇu’s great deed, and the “three seats” could  be the three footprints left by his strides. (See the footprints as places in I.154.4–6.)
The theme of Viṣṇu’s multiple identities is announced, in typically oblique  fashion, in the middle verse of this hymn:  “recognizing him, announce his very  names” (3c).
1. Become kindly like an ally [/Mitra]—you with ghee as your drink,  traveling your ways, extensive and having far-reaching brilliance.
Then for you, o Viṣṇu, praise can be brought to success only by one who  knows, and sacrifice can be made to succeed by one who offers an
oblation.
2. Whoever will do service to the ancient ritual expert and to the newer one,  to Viṣṇu together with the Wives (of the Gods),
who will speak of his birth, the great birth of the great one, just he will  surpass in renown even his yokefellow.334 I.157
3. You praisers, carry him to term in the way that is known—the ancient  one who is by birth the embryo of truth.
Recognizing him, announce his very names. Let us share in the favor of  you who are great, o Viṣṇu.
4. That resolve of his does king Varuṇa follows, that do the Aśvins, the  resolve of the ritual expert associated with the Maruts.
Viṣṇu upholds the highest skill that knows the days, when with his
comrade(s) he opens up the pen.
5. The divine one, Viṣṇu, who sought for Indra to accompany him, sought  for the one of good action as the one who acts (even) better,
the ritual expert, possessing the three seats, he enlivened the Ārya. He  apportioned to the sacrificer a portion of truth.
## 157 Aśvins
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
6 verses: jagatī 1–4, triṣṭubh 5–6.
As is usual for the Aśvins, this hymn is a morning hymn (vs. 1) recited at the begin ning of the sacrificial day. Less typical but elsewhere attested (e.g., VIII.5) is its  implicit representation of the Aśvins as bringers of rain. This theme is most obvi ous in verse 2, for in 2b ukṣatam, translated “increase,” is a śleṣa, to be read also  as “sprinkle.” The “ghee and honey” by which the Aśvins bring increase to the  dominion are the rain they sprinkle on it. If “honey” refers to rain in verse 2, then  so also do their “honey-bearing chariot” (vs. 3) and their “honeyed whip” (vs. 4).  At least here the latter probably refers to lightning (Pirart 1995: 296, with reference  to Blair 1961: 152–54). The rain they bring is fertilizing for all beings, both animals  and plants (vs. 5). Likewise, the description of the Aśvins’ sending fire and water  into the trees (vs. 6) refers to the water, which not only allows the trees to grow but  also carries fire that emerges when wood is kindled.
The theme of the Aśvins as bringers of rain is interwoven with that of their  chariot as a reflection of the sacrifice. The sets of three often associated with them  and their chariot refer to the three soma-pressings (cf. also I.34). Here, significantly,  in verse 3 their chariot has three wheels and three chariot boxes. And finally, the  Aśvins are not only bringers of rain, but they are also bringers of healing (4cd, 6).  These two functions are connected because they both give and extend life.
One last note: in verse 6 rā́thyebhiḥ “through the parts of your chariot” is a  hapax and there are several other plausible interpretations of it: among them the  chariot-horses (Sāyaṇa), chariot-skills (Geldner), and reins (Pirart). Since the  hymn mentions the chariot itself and its boxes, wheels, whip, and horses, we sug
gest that the word encompasses all those things that constitute the chariot—and  therefore the rain and the sacrifice—and that complement the healing remedies  they bring. 1. Agni has awakened; the Sun rises from the earth; great, glowing Dawn  has dawned widely with her ray of light.
The Aśvins have harnessed their chariot to make their journey. The god  Savitar has spurred the living world in all directions.
2. When you harness the bull that is your chariot, Aśvins, then increase  [/sprinkle] our dominion with ghee and honey!
Enliven our sacred formulation in the contests! We would share the  riches in the heroes’ victory.
3. Let the three-wheeled, honey-bearing chariot of the Aśvins with its swift  horses, which is well-praised, journey near.
With its three chariot boxes, the generous (chariot), bringing all good  shares, will carry good fortune here to both the two-footed and
four-footed.
4. Carry nourishment to us, Aśvins, and mix us with your honeyed whip. Extend our lifetime, wipe away our diseases, repel hatred, and be
companions to us.
5. You place the embryo in the females of moving beings; you place it  within all living things.
You, o bulls, have sent fire and water here into the trees, Aśvins.
6. You are healers through your healing remedies, and you are also  charioteers through the parts of your chariot.
And again, o powerful ones, you set dominion upon him who ritually  serves with his oblation and by his thought.
## 158 Aśvins
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–5, anuṣṭubh 6
This is an elusive hymn, but a particularly interesting one since it appears to be auto biographical—although whether it refers to the actual life of the poet or to the life  of the poet as his own literary creation is not entirely clear. The best starting point  may be the final verse, in which the poet describes himself as old, but nevertheless as  the “chariot-driver” of the waters and a “formulator (of the truth).” He is still a poet  and a powerful one at that. The problem the hymn addresses, therefore, could be an  attempt by the poet’s patrons or fellow poets to retire him, and therefore he calls upon  the Aśvins to help him show his mettle as a poet. One of the wondrous acts of the  Aśvins is to rejuvenate, and therefore it is not surprising that he would turn to them.
Even if this is the right approach to the hymn, a fair number of difficulties  remain. In verse 2 the poet asks who will serve the Aśvins, if not he, so that the  two gods will take their place “in the track of the cow.” As often elsewhere, the  cow is the inspired hymn, and therefore the “track of the cow” should be the  place of the sacrifice, where the inspired hymn is recited. In praising the Aśvins
336 I.158
the poet alludes to the two gods’ great deeds of rescue, which turn on the theme  of water. In verse 3 the poet mentions the story of Bhujyu, who was rescued from  the water by the Aśvins. In verse 5 is the story of a man whom Dāsas bound and  tossed into the rivers. The story is unknown, but presumably that person was also  rescued from the waters. These rescues anticipate the poet’s final claim in verse  6 to be the master of the waters. The significance of this is not clear, but it may  mean that he can bring the rain through the power of his recitations and rituals.  These stories of drowning, of too much water, also contrast to the poet’s plea  in verse 4 not to be dried out by time and not to be burnt up, as if he were like  kindling. Despite his age the poet is and wishes to remain vital, not to become a  dried-out old stick of a man.
The Br̥haddevatā (IV.21–25) presents the story or stories mentioned in verse 5 as  the story of Dīrghatamas himself. According to it, his slaves (dāsas) tied up the old,  blind Dīrghatamas and immersed him in the waters of the river. One of them, called  Traitana, tried to strike him with sword, but ended up cutting to pieces his own  head, shoulders, and chest. Eventually Dīrghatamas washed up near the country  of the Aṅgas, where he was rescued. Later he had a son, Kakṣīvant, by a servant of  the king. It is unlikely that this is the story known to the R̥gveda or even that verse  5 tells the story of Dīrghatamas, unless metaphorically. Still, the reference to the  Dāsas seems to be of particular significance. The earlier part of the hymn develops  a repetitive phonological pattern with daśasyátam (1b), dásrā (1c), dāśat (2a), and  dáśatayaḥ (4c). These words, most of which have a marked position in the pāda,  seem to lead toward the story of the Dāsas. These Dāsas did try to destroy someone  but ended up destroying themselves, and perhaps this is the message that the poet  wishes to impress upon those who are trying to push him aside.
1. You two Vasus, Rudras, who give many counsels, strengthening (our  praise) in preeminence—favor us, o bulls,
since the son of Ucathya [=Dīrghatamas] is the legacy (left) for
you, wondrous ones, since you two have run forth (to him) with
unstinting help.
2. Who will serve you two for this very favor, when, Vasus, by his homage  you two will take your place in the track of the cow?
Awaken for us plentiful gifts filled with riches, acting as if with a thought  to fulfill our wishes.
3. Because your harnessed (chariot)—swelling, rugged—was set apart in the  middle of the flood for the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu],
I would come to your sheltering help by flying ways, as a hero (flies) his  course.
4. The praise song should give wide space to (me), the son of Ucathya. Let  these two winged females [=Night and Dawn] not milk me dry.
Let the piled-up, ten-stick kindling not burn me, when he [=Agni], whom  you bound by the trunk of his body, chews at the earth. 5. “The rivers, best of mothers, will not swallow me!” (he cried,) when the  Dāsas sank him, tightly bound.
When Traitana hewed away the head, the Dāsa himself ate his own chest  and shoulders.
6. Dīrghatamas, the son of Mamatā, though having grown old in the tenth  stage (of life),
becomes the chariot-driver of the waters that are moving toward their  goal and the formulator (of the truth).
## 159 Heaven and Earth
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: jagatī
The various, and sometimes paradoxical, relationships between (masculine)  Heaven and (feminine) Earth, and their joint relationship with their sons, the  gods, are the topic of this hymn. The two are named in the first and last (5) verses  of the hymn, while in between they are only referred to by kinship terms. In the  first half of verse 2 their parental roles are kept separate:  father and mother,  but in the second half they are subsumed in a pregnant dual, “two fathers.” The  tables are turned in verse 3, where they appear as “two mothers.” Although both  of these duals are frequently used in the R̥gveda for the paired parents of both  genders (and such is their reference here), the alternation in this hymn seems  meaningful and contextually appropriate. Minds are not associated with either  gender exclusively, so that “the mind of the. . .father and of the mother” in verse  2ab belongs to each individually, whereas in 2c it is, properly, two fathers who  “possess good semen.” The reason for the feminine “two mothers” in verse 3 is  less clear, though as objects acted upon they may evoke the feminine. After these  various parental designations, the poet branches out in verse 4b, identifying the  two as both siblings and a married couple, with a subtle but unmistakable sug gestion of incest.
In the meantime, the beloved paradox of children giving birth to their parents is  given full play in verses 3 and 4.
As discussed in the introduction to I.160, this hymn is a virtual twin to the one  that follows.
1. I shall start up the praise, along with sacrifices, to Heaven and to Earth,  the two great ones growing strong through truth, the discerning ones,  at the rites of distribution,
those of wondrous power, whose sons are gods, who together with the  gods tender things of value (to the mortal) who has an insight right to  the point.
338 I.160
2. And I turn my mind to the great and self-powerful mind of the
undeceivable father and of the mother, with my invocations.
The two fathers possessing good semen have made the land wide for  offspring and immortal in its expanses.
3. These their sons, good artisans with wondrous powers, begot the two  great ones, two mothers, to be first in their thought.
You two protect what is real in upholding the standing and the moving;  you protect the footprint of your son who is unduplicitous [=Agni?]. 4. Masters of magical power, having good forethought, they measured  [=created] the kindred pair who share the same womb, the married
couple who share the same dwelling place.
They stretch an ever newer thread to heaven and within the sea—the  very brilliant poets.
5. The desirable largesse of Savitar shall we think upon today at the  impulse of the god.
For us, o Heaven and Earth, through your kind attention establish
wealth consisting of goods and a hundred cows.
## 160 Heaven and Earth
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: jagatī
Like I.159 this hymn is dedicated to Heaven and Earth and consists of five verses in  jagatī meter, but the similarities are stronger than those bare facts suggest: I.160 is  structurally identical to 159, and they share phraseological and thematic patterns.  Like 159, 160 names Heaven and Earth only in its first and last verses, with the  references in between conveyed by kinship terms and adjectival duals, patterning  in much the same way as in 159—first separate designations for father and mother  (159.2ab, 160.2b), then duals identifying the pair with one gender or another (“two  fathers” 159.2c, “two mothers” 159.3b versus “two world-halves/rodasī” [fem.,  depicted as girls] 160.2c, “two fathers” 160.3a).
One of the notable features of 159 is the relationship between Heaven and Earth  and their sons, the gods. The same parental relationship is depicted in 160, but with  a single son, the Sun. As in 159, this son is first introduced in verse 1, but also as in  159 the theme is developed primarily in verses 3–4, where the same paradox of the  child begetting his parents is employed (esp. in 160.4, but note the child milking out  his own milk from his parents in vs. 3). Similar or identical words are used: the son  in 160.4a is “the best artisan of the artisans (apás) of the gods,” while the sons in  159.3a are “good artisans” (svápas); the two fathers of 159.2c “possess good semen”  (surétas), just as the bull representing Heaven does in 160.3c. Two verbs are used  to express the sons’/son’s begetting of the parents: the literal √jan “beget” (jajñuḥ 159.3b, jajā́na 160.4b) and the metaphorical √mā “measure out” (mamire 159.4a,  ví...mamé 160.4c); both the sons of 159 and the son of 160 possess magical power  (māyínaḥ 159.4a, māyáyā 160.3b).
Once seen, the pervasive underlying identity of these two hymns cannot be denied,  but it is an index of the art of Dīrghatamas that the poems strike the audience as com pletely distinct and that, as far as we are aware, their patterned similarity has not previ ously been recognized—unlike other such pairs, like the Vālakhilya hymns VIII.49–50,  51–52, or IV.13–14, IX.104–105, as discussed by Bloomfield (1916: 13–14).
1. Because these two, Heaven and Earth, beneficial to all, truthful, are those  who uphold the poet of the airy realm,
he speeds between the two Holy Places of good birth—the god, the  blazing Sun, between the two goddesses, according to his ordinance. 2. The two great ones of broad expanse, inexhaustible, the father and  mother, protect living beings—
the two world-halves, the very boldest ones, who are like (girls) inviting  admiration, when their father has decked them out with their forms. 3. That draft-horse, the son of the two fathers, the insightful one
provided with the means of purification purifies living beings by his  magical power.
Out of the dappled cow and the bull possessing good semen he has
milked his blazing milk all the days.
4. This one here, the best artisan of the artisans of the gods, who begat the  two world-halves beneficial to all,
who measured out the two airy realms with a display of his good resolve,  with unaging props—he has been universally praised.
5. While being sung, o great ones, you will establish great fame for us and  lofty dominion, o Heaven and Earth,
by which we will extend (our control) over the communities all the days.  Jointly impel to us power worthy of wonder.
## 161 R̥bhus
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
14 verses: jagatī 1–13, triṣṭubh 14
This is a difficult hymn, but one essential for understanding the R̥bhus and their  relation to the Third Pressing. Its narrative tells how the R̥bhus attained immortal ity and entered among the gods—or seems to. This theme is stated in verse 2 and  elaborated in verses 11–14. The R̥bhus were priests who attained status as gods by  their sacrificial performance. As gods they are worshiped in the Third Pressing, and  therefore it is not surprising that the ritual acts by which they became gods are those
340 I.161
of the Third Pressing. For a detailed discussion of these acts, see the discussion by  Brereton (2012).
The hymn begins by reference to one of the great acts of the R̥bhus, their trans formation of a single soma cup into four soma cups. This act signifies their divin ization because the four cups represent four soma offerings to Indra and the three  R̥bhus. A single cup would have restricted the soma offering only to Indra. The  hymn opens with the R̥bhus’ address to Agni, who has been sent by the gods. This  dialogue takes place in the middle of the action, for apparently Agni has pointed  to the camasá, the ritual soma cup, and the R̥bhus are concerned that Agni thinks  that they have insulted this soma cup in some way (vs. 1). But Agni reaffirms the  command of the gods that the R̥bhus create four cups out of this one, and he  offers to make them gods (vs. 2). However, the R̥bhus reply that they have much  more to do as priests before they themselves become the objects of worship. First,  they need to make a horse. Elsewhere they fashion the two horses of Indra, and it  is to this act that verse 3 likely refers. The making of these horses points toward  the Hāriyojanagraha, an offering to Indra as he harnesses his horses to leave the  ritual ground at the end of the Third Pressing (see also I.61–63, 82). Second,  they need to make a chariot, which can represent the hymn or the whole ritual.  Third, they need to make a milk-cow, which represents the already-pressed soma  stalks, which are made to yield additional soma in the Third Pressing. And finally  they need to make young two who are old. The two might be the sacrificer and  his wife or another pair. Once the R̥bhus have accomplished all their great sac
rificial deeds, then they will be worthy to follow Agni to heaven (vs. 3). Tvaṣṭar  is introduced in verse 4 probably in connection with another rite in the Third  Pressing in which the Wife of the Sacrificer receives indirect access to the soma.  Verse 5 returns to the four cups and we now learn that Tvaṣṭar, who had origi
nally made the one cup, is angry that the R̥bhus are modifying his creation. The  R̥bhus protect themselves by taking on “other names.” These “other names” may  be their priestly offices, and by these names or priestly offices the “maiden” will  rescue them. The hymn gives little clue to identity of the “maiden,” but she may  be Sarasvatī (cf. VI.49.7) or even Speech (Vāc) herself. In either case, the words  that the R̥bhus master or the knowledge that they possess somehow protects them  from the anger of Tvaṣṭar. Vs. 6 affirms that the R̥bhus did succeed in becoming  gods and divine recipients of soma.
In verse 7 the hymn returns to the sacrificial acts that made them immortal: the  soma-pressing (see vs. 10), the rejuvenation of the aging pair, the creation of a  horse, and the harnessing of the chariot that is the sacrifice or the hymn. Verse 8  marks a return to a dialogue, now between the R̥bhus and the gods. According to  Sāyaṇa, the “water” and the “rinse-water of muñja-reeds” that the gods offer the  R̥bhus are the soma of the first two pressings. This interpretation is contextually  justifiable, but such a denigration of these first two pressings is unlikely. Oldenberg  suggests that the gods first offer the R̥bhus two inferior drinks and only then and  finally the soma. If we take this approach, the first offering would be water, and the second might be a kind of faux-soma. The word múñja approximates mū́javant,  the mountain from which the real soma comes, and therefore the “rinse-water of  muñja-reeds” may represent an inferior approximation of soma. It is only the third  time and in the third soma-pressing that the gods offer the R̥bhus the real soma.  Structurally verse 9 continues verse 8, since again three things are mentioned, of  which the third is the best. However, it is difficult to say what the feminine noun  described as vadharyántī “weapon-wielding” in pāda c might be, since the adjec
tive is otherwise unattested. According to Sāyaṇa, it is either the earth or a line of  clouds and its weapon is lightning. Along similar lines, Geldner suggests that it is  the rainy season and again that its weapon is lightning. Interpreting vadharyántī slightly differently, Witzel and Gotō understand it as the axe (svádhiti) “serving  as a weapon.” We resolve the ellipsis by drawing its sense from the verb pra √brū
“proclaim” in pāda c and the reference to spoken truths in pāda d. The first two  R̥bhus praise water and fire, which are essential to the sacrifice, but the third R̥bhu  recognizes true speech as the most essential element.
Verse 10 returns once again to the great sacrificial deeds of the R̥bhus and this  time especially to the soma that is prepared in the Third Pressing. In the Third  Pressing soma stalks from the first two pressings are pressed again to yield addi tional soma. In verse 10 these stalks are the “lame cow”—lame because they have  already been pressed—which are then soaked in water. The “carving” of the cow is  the re-pressing of the stalks, and the dung is the now thoroughly mangled stems of  the soma plant. The place of 10d is not clear. Whoever the “parents” may be, the  “sons” are likely the R̥bhus or the priests that they represent.
The last sequence of verses, 11–14, probably describes the ascent of the R̥bhus  to immortality, but even if this is correct, the details are obscure. At best we can  point out a few possible identifications and a few possible interpretations. Agohya  in verse 11 is probably the Sun as the “Unconcealable One,” although he might also  be Savitar. In I.110.2–3 the R̥bhus’ attainment of immortality is connected with  Agohya, and if Agohya is the Sun, then perhaps one stage in the R̥bhus’ ascent is to  the sun. The Sun governs the year, and therefore the “grass on the heights” may rep
resent the summer pasturage, and “the waters in the valleys” the winter pasturage.  In verse 13 the identification of the goat and the dog as the sun and moon is doubt ful. It assumes that the bastá “goat” is ajá ekapád, “the one-footed goat,” which  elsewhere is the Sun. The identification of the moon as “the dog” follows Śatapatha  Brāhmaṇa XI.1.5.1, in which the moon is called the heavenly dog. In the last verse,  the gods move throughout the visible world seeking the R̥bhus, but perhaps they do  not find them because they have gone from the visible world.
1. [The R̥bhus:] “Why has the best, why has the youngest one come here  to us? For what messenger’s duty does he speed? What is it that we
have said?
We have not insulted the cup with its great hollow. Brother Agni, we have  spoken only of the excellence of the wooden (vessel).”
342 I.161
2. [Agni:] “ ‘Make the one cup to be four’—that the gods said to you. For  that I have come to you.
Sons of Sudhanvan, if you will do thus, you will become worthy  (recipients) of the sacrifice along with the gods.”
3. When you replied to the messenger Agni, “A horse must be made, and a  chariot also must be made here.
A milk-cow must be made, and the two must be made young. When we  have done these things, brother, we will follow you [=gods].”
4. Having done these things, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Just where has he  gone who came here to us as a messenger?”
When he caught sight of the four cups that were made, just then  Tvaṣṭar was anointed among the Wives (of the Gods).
5. When Tvaṣṭar said, “We shall smash those who have insulted the cup  that gives drink to the gods”—
they [=the R̥bhus] make other names for themselves during the  soma-pressing—by their other names the maiden will rescue them. 6. Indra has hitched up his two fallow bays, and the Aśvins their chariot.  Br̥haspati drove near (the cow) of all forms.
You—R̥bhu, Vibhvan, and Vāja—went to the gods. By your skillful  work you came to a share in the sacrifice.
7. From the hide you made the cow to flow (milk) by your insights. You  made those young who were the aging pair.
O sons of Sudhanvan, you fashioned a horse from a horse, and having  hitched up the chariot, you journeyed toward the gods.
8. [The R̥bhus to the gods:] “You said, ‘Drink this water, or drink this, the  rinse-water of muñja-reeds.
Sons of Sudhanvan, if you do not in any way find satisfaction in this,  you shall find exhilaration in the Third Pressing rite.’”
9. One (R̥bhu) said, “Waters are most important,” and the other said,  “Fire is most important.”
(The third) one proclaimed the weapon-wielding (speech?) from among  the many. Speaking truths, you carved the cups.
10. One drives the lame cow down to the water. One carves the flesh,  carried here with a basket.
Up till sunset one bore away the dung. Have the parents given help to  their sons?
11. You made grass for him on the heights and waters in the valleys by your  skillful work, o men,
when you slept in the house of Agohya: you do not continue that here  today, o R̥bhus.
12. When, having shut your eyes, you crept around the living worlds, where  were your loving parents? You cursed him who took your arm. Who made a declaration (to you),  to him you also made a declaration.
13. After you slept, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Who awakened us here, o  Agohya?”
The billy-goat [=the Sun?] said the dog [=the Moon?] was the awakener.  Here today, after a year, you opened your eyes.
14. The Maruts travel through heaven, Agni along the earth; the Wind here  travels through the midspace;
Varuṇa travels through the waters and seas—seeking you, o sons of  strength.
The following two hymns treat the Horse Sacrifice (Aśvamedha) and are the only  absolutely clear reflections of this ritual in the R̥gveda.
## 162 Praise of a Horse (Aśvastuti)
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
22 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3, 6
The first of the two Aśvamedha hymns focuses on the actual sacrifice, with an  almost cinematic treatment of the proceedings and an unflinching look at the gory  details. The hymn begins with the parading of the horse on the day of sacrifice: the  year-long preliminaries in the classical Aśvamedha are not mentioned here, and it  is not easy to tell how much elaboration accreted to this ritual in the post-R̥gvedic  period—though it seems likely that the R̥gvedic version was a much simpler affair.
After an initial verse calling on an array of gods to bear witness to the celebra tion of the horse, there follow three verses (2–4) devoted to the goat that is led  in front of the horse and that is itself sacrificed before the killing of the horse.  The goat is the only sacrificial animal mentioned in the hymn besides the horse,  in contrast to the classical version of the rite in which a multitude of wild and  domestic animals are, at least theoretically, bound for sacrifice (and in general  then released). In verses 5–6 a variety of priests (5) and minor ritual functionaries  (6; see also the cooks in vs. 12) are mentioned—the priests being urged, somewhat  shockingly, to “fill your bellies” on the sacrifice. This group of officiants seems to  correspond on the human level to the gods assembled in verse 1, and all are thus  implicated in the performance of the sacrifice, as are the poet himself and his fel
low seers in verse 7.
The gaze then turns to the sacrifice proper (vss. 8–17) and to the equipment asso ciated with the horse (vss. 8, 14, 16), the equipment for cooking the oblation (vs.  13), and, most dramatically, the physical evidence of the slaughter: the fly-blown  flesh and the sticky blood and guts (vs. 9), the bloated belly and the smell of the  butchered animal (vs. 10), the cooking juices running off the skewered beast on344 I.162
the fire (vs. 11). All of the mentioned paraphernalia and the gore are meant to  accompany the horse itself to the gods. This section of the hymn gains much of its  power from a dual focus: the gritty reality of an actual sacrifice competes with the  reverential attitude to the victim, regularly addressed in the 2nd person—such that  the horse is endowed almost with personhood while at the same time being dismem
bered, cooked, and consumed. For this reason, in 3rd-person contexts we use the  pronouns “he, him, his” for the horse, rather than “it,” et cetera: the poet will not  allow us to objectify or neuter-ize the animal and requires us to come to terms with  what “we” are doing to “him.”
The description of the dismembering becomes more detailed beginning in verse  18, where the axe approaches the horse’s ribs. Although this carving up logically  precedes some of the sacrificial actions treated before—especially the cooking of the  already butchered horse—there is a reason for its positioning here. We are entering  the third and last part of the hymn, in which the horse is sent on his journey to the  gods. The emphasis in these carving verses (18–20) is on the proper order of the cut
ting and the patterned positioning of the pieces of the horse, so that he can make its  own way on his “undamaged” legs (vss. 18, 20). The pieces of the horse are arranged  to re-form the actual body of the horse, and this reconstituted body is complemented  by the lifebreath (ātman) that is also making the journey to the gods (vs. 20). The  climax is reached in verse 21, where the horse is assured that he is not dead or injured  and that his journey to the gods will be made easily, in company with the mounts of  the gods. The hymn ends (vs. 22) with the hope that the sacrificed horse will bring  us good things, and with an unemphatic prayer for our “guiltlessness,” presumably  because of the potential guilt associated with the killing of the horse.
To those who know the classical śrauta version of the Aśvamedha the most strik ing omission in this hymn is any mention of the sexual intercourse (or simulated inter course) of the chief wife of the king and sacrificer with the just slaughtered horse. If  our interpretation of X.86, the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, is correct—that it is a burlesqued ver sion of an Aśvamedha with a randy monkey as victim—the missing sexual element in  our hymn here was omitted out of delicacy rather than being unknown to the R̥gveda.
1. Let not Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Āyu, Indra the lord of the R̥bhus, and  the Maruts disregard us
when we shall proclaim the heroic deeds of the prizewinning, god-born  racehorse at the ritual distribution.
2. When they lead the gift [=goat] held fast in front of (the horse, which is)  decked out with a fresh garment and with family treasure,
facing well forward, constantly bleating, the goat, representing all forms,  passes into the fold of Indra and Pūṣan.
3. This billy-goat, belonging to all the gods, is led in front, along with the  prizewinning horse, as Pūṣan’s portion.
When (they lead the goat) as the pleasing fore-offering along with the  steed, it is Tvaṣṭar himself who stimulates him for (the deed) that
brings good fame. 4. When the sons of Manu lead around the horse to be offered three times  along (the path) that goes to the gods in proper order,
then the goat, Pūṣan’s portion, goes first, announcing the sacrifice to  the gods.
5. The Hotar, the Adhvaryu, the Expiator [?], the Fire-kindler, the  Handler of the Pressing-stones, and the well-inspired Reciter—
with this sacrifice, well prepared and well offered, fill your bellies.
6. The hewers of the sacrificial post and its conveyors, those who
fashion the knob for the post for the horse,
and those who assemble the equipment for cooking the steed—let the  applause also of those urge us on.
7. (When) he went forth, at that same time my thought was produced— (when) the straight-backed (horse went forth) to the regions of
the gods.
The inspired seers cheer him on. We have made him well connected to  the prospering of the gods.
8. The lead-rope of the prizewinner, the harness of the steed, the halter on  his head and his bridle,
and the grass brought up into his mouth—let all this of yours be also  among the gods.
9. What of the horse’s flesh a fly has eaten, or what is smeared on the  sacrificial post or on the axe,
what is on the hands of the Queller-priest and what on his nails—let all  this of yours be also among the gods.
10. The contents of his belly that bloats up, the odor of his raw flesh— let the Queller-priests make that well-done and let them cook the ritual  offering until it’s cooked to readiness.
11. What runs down from your leg as it’s being cooked by the fire when you  have been impaled on the spit—
let that not stick to the ground nor to the grasses; let it be given to the  gods, who are eager for it.
12. Those who inspect the prizewinner when cooked and who say about  him: “It smells good! Take it off (the fire)!”
and those who draw near in hopes of a share of the meat of the steed— let the applause also of those urge us on.
13. The probe for the meat-cooking cauldron, the cups for the pouring  of broth,
the covers of the bowls that keep them warm, the hooks, and the
baskets are in attendance around the horse.
14. (The gear) that made him set his stride, come to a halt, and turn aside,  and the foot-fetter of the steed,
and what he drank and what fodder he ate—let all this of yours be also  among the gods.
346 I.163
15. Let the fire that smells of smoke not besmirch you; let the blazing hot  cauldron not topple over.
The one sacrificed, sought out, and greeted when the cry “vaṣaṭ” is
made: that horse do the gods receive.
16. The mantel they spread out for the horse, the over-mantel, and the gold  (trappings) that are for him,
the harness, and the foot-fetter—(all these), his own dear things, hold  the steed fast among the gods.
17. If, in riding you, anyone goaded (you) with his heel or with a whip,  along with too much “come on, come on,”
I make all these sweet for you with a sacred formulation, as (priests)  sweeten them [=oblations?] by the ladling of the oblation at the rites. 18. The axe converges on the thirty-four ribs of the prizewinning horse,  who has connection with the gods.
Arrange his legs, undamaged, into patterns, and carve them up joint by  joint, having called them out in order.
19. There is one carver of Tvaṣṭar’s horse and two to hold him fast: such is  the proper way.
The (sacrificial portions) I make from your legs according to the proper  order, just those lumps, one after the other, do I offer in the fire.
20. Let your own dear lifebreath not burn you as you go along; let the axe  not bring the parts of your body to a standstill.
Let a greedy man who is no carver, skipping steps, not make your legs  damaged with a knife gone awry.
21. Truly in this way you do not die nor are you harmed: you go to the gods  by paths easy to travel.
The two fallow bays (of Indra) and the two dappled mares (of the
Maruts) have become your yokemates. The prizewinning (horse) has  taken his place at the chariot-pole of the (Aśvins’) donkey.
22. (Let) the prizewinner (win) for us a mass of good cattle and good  horses, male children, and all-prospering wealth.
Let Aditi make guiltlessness for us. Let the horse, accompanied by our  oblations, win sovereignty for us.
## 163 Praise of a Horse (Aśvastuti)
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn, the other one devoted to the Horse Sacrifice, is very different in tone,  style, and intent from its predecessor, but they clearly form a pair. In fact, this  hymn can be taken as the concrete fulfillment of the announcement in the first verse of the prior hymn (I.162.1): “...when we shall proclaim the heroic deeds of  the...horse.” That hymn did not itself actually accomplish this claim, for there  was no real praise of the horse or what he did. But this hymn has all the trappings  of a proper praise hymn. It begins with a number of verses (vss. 1–4) about the  miraculous birth and mythic history of the horse and its cosmic connections and  divine identifications.
In our opinion, the rest of the hymn concerns the horse’s journey to heaven,  the very journey presented also at the end of 162 (esp. vs. 21). But this is now  no ordinary horse: he is now identified with the sun and described in exalted  and enigmatic language. After a brief mention of the horse tackle in verse 5,  the journey begins in verse 6. That the traveler is the sacrificed horse is strongly  suggested by the language, which connects it to the horse’s journey in 162: the  poet mentally sees the lifebreath (ātman) as it flies, reminding us of the horse’s  lifebreath in 162.20, and this lifebreath as bird is moving on “paths easy to  travel,” the same phrase spoken reassuringly to the horse in 162.21. With the  identification of the sacrificed horse with the sun-bird thus firmly established,  the poet is free to elaborate and complicate his mental vision of the journey in  the following verses (7–11), not all of which are entirely clear. The poet’s vision  also seems to identify the horse/sun-bird with poetic inspiration, in phraseology  that is reminiscent of the “Pataṃga” hymn (X.177), where poetic inspiration  takes the form of a bird.
As this lyrical passage comes toward its end, the figure of the horse reasserts  itself, and the connections to 162 become stronger again. In the much-discussed  verse 10, in our opinion the arrangement of the divine horses, compared to the  V-shaped formation of geese in flight, refers to the divine mounts that accompany  the sacrificed horse in 162.21. Verse 11 addresses the horse as it flies in the guise of  the sun-bird, but we return to the real world of the sacrifice in verse 12, which in  ring-compositional fashion picks up the procession of goat and horse to slaughter  that began 162, reprising some of the language of that hymn as well (úpa prā́gāt “has gone forth” in 163.12–13 and 162.7; puró nīyate “is led in front” in 163.12 and  162.3). The summary verse (13) sends the horse on his way and again expresses  hopes for a return on our sacrificial investment.
1. When you whinnied on first being born, rising from the sea or from the  fertile soil,
(having) the two wings of a falcon, the two forelegs of an antelope— your great birth was worthy of praise, o steed.
2. Trita yoked him, who had been given by Yama; Indra was the first to  mount him;
the Gandharva grasped his halter. O Vasus, you carved the horse out of  the sun.
3. You are Yama; you are Āditya, o steed. You are Trita by reason of your  hidden commandment.
348 I.163
You were separated all at once from Soma [=the moon?]. They say that  you have three (kinship) bonds in heaven.
4. Three bonds they say you have in heaven, three in the waters, and three  within the sea.
And you will appear to me like Varuṇa, o steed, (in the place [=sea])  where they say is your highest means of begetting.
5. Here are (the waters?) to rub you down, o prizewinner, and here places  for the winner to set his hooves.
Here I saw your good halters, over which the herdsmen of the truth  keep guard.
6. With my mind I recognized your lifebreath from afar, a bird flying  below heaven.
I saw your winged head panting along the dustless paths easy to  travel.
7. Here I saw your highest form, seeking to win refreshments in the track  of the cow.
When the mortal attained the benefit from you, just after that the  foremost devourer of plants [=Agni] awakened (you?).
8. The chariot (goes) after you, after you the dashing youth, o steed; after  you the cows, after you the good fortune of maidens.
The troops have gone after your companionship. The gods have  measured themselves against your heroic strength.
9. Having golden horns [=rays], his feet copper, swift as thought he was  (an) Indra in the lower (realm).
The gods themselves came to eat the oblation of him, who first  mounted the steed.
10. The heavenly chargers take their places like geese in formation—with  the edges (of the formation) their legs, its middle hollow,
its nose a hero [=the lead horse], when the horses have driven their  heavenly drive.
11. Your body is flying, o steed; your perception is swooping like the  wind.
Your horns [=rays], dispersed in many places, keep flickering in the  wilderness.
12. The prizewinning steed has gone forth to slaughter, reflecting with a  mind turned to the gods.
The goat, his umbilical kin, is led in front. The poets and singers come  along behind.
13. The steed has gone forth to the highest seat, to his father and mother  [=Heaven and Earth].
He should go to the gods today, for he is most pleasing (to them); then  he expresses his hope for desirable things for the pious man.
## 164 All Gods (Riddle Hymn)
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
52 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 12, 15, 23, 29, 36, 41; prastārapaṅkti 42; anuṣṭubh 51
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn to a variety of gods:  All the Gods (1–41),  Speech (42a, 45), the Waters (42b), Dung-smoke (43a), Soma (43b), Agni, Sūrya,  Vāyu (44), Sūrya (46, 47), the Wheel of the Seasons (48), Sarasvatī (49), the Sādhyas  (50), Sūrya or Parjanya or Agni (51), Sarasvant or Sūrya (52). Such diversity creates  the impression that this hymn is a fairly loose assemblage, although its thematic and  structural programs indicate that the hymn, or the bulk of it, constitutes a coherent  composition. Among the more recent and significant studies of the hymn are those  of Brown (1968) and Houben (2000), which also discuss older interpretations and  upon which we have drawn extensively and gratefully.
The hymn has continued to attract scholarly attention in part because it has  continued to escape satisfying interpretation. One reason is that the hymn was com posed to be enigmatic, to be never fully decipherable. But even if we will never be  able to solve all its puzzles, we can appreciate how it functions as an enigma and  perhaps why. Since the hymn makes both implicit and explicit reference to Vedic rit ual, including rites other than the soma ritual, one way into the hymn is through its  connections to ritual. Even though the later ritual application of R̥gvedic hymns is  not always a reliable guide to their original ritual contexts, it offers a place to start.  According to Aitareya Āraṇyaka V.3.2, verses 1–41 are part of the Vaiśvadevaśastra,  a recitation at the midday offerings of the Mahāvrata ceremony, and Śāṅkhāyana  Āraṇyaka II.18 places the whole of the hymn in the Mahāvrata rite. This Mahāvrata  rite is a variation of the Agniṣṭoma soma ritual that was performed on the next to  last day of the year-long Gavāmayana rite. It may well be that the application of  the hymn in the Mahāvrata rite is secondary (Houben 2000:  502), since there is  no explicit reference to the Mahāvrata in the hymn and, for such a long hymn,  little even to the soma sacrifice more generally. But there is a thematic connection  between this hymn and the Mahāvrata. According to Kauṣītakī Brāhmaṇa XIX.3,  the Mahāvrata fell on the winter solstice. Whatever else I.164 may be about, much  of it concerns the sun in one way or another (e.g., vss. 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 25, 33,  44, 46, 48). The winter solstice, when the sun has halted its southward movement  and is about to turn northward, would be a natural time to consider the sun and its  appearance and therefore may provide the seasonal context for the hymn.
A second ritual context for the hymn is the Pravargya rite, which is an offering  of heated milk and ghee to the Aśvins. In the classical Agniṣṭoma soma ritual, the  Pravargya was performed twice daily on the three days leading up the soma-pressing  day; originally, however, it may have been a rite independent of the soma ritual. The  śrautasūtras (cf. van Buitenen 1968: 93, 96–98) prescribe the recitation of verses  26–28, 31 (=X.177.3), and 49 in the Pravargya, and at least verses 26–29 refer
350 I.164
directly to the Pravargya rite. Thus, as Houben (2000) has demonstrated, significant  parts of this hymn are concerned with the Pravargya.
These two rituals, the Mahāvrata and the Pravargya, have one thing in com mon:  they are the principal subjects of Āraṇyaka texts. The Āraṇyakas or “for est” books are later Vedic works that explored rituals and the interpretations of  rituals thought to be too dangerous to be taught within the village. The R̥gvedic  Āraṇyakas concern especially the Mahāvrata rite, and the Yajurvedic Āraṇyakas,  the Pravargya. In our view this hymn was not primarily composed for recitation in  a particular rite, although to be sure some of its mantras were ritually employed.  Rather, this poem is an early example of Āraṇyaka-like interpretation. Its function  is to disclose the meaning of the rites, particularly the Mahāvrata and Pravargya  rites. It might seem odd that a R̥gvedic hymn could anticipate the later Āraṇyaka  literature. However, according to the Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya Sūtra II.11.13, once a stu dent has learned the saṃhitā, his teacher may guide him though the rahasya, the  secret teaching, which the sūtra defines as the Āraṇyaka (cf. Oldenberg 1888: 291).  Even if, as Oldenberg (293) argues, study of the rahasya meant the recitation of the  mantras of the Mahāvrata, not study of the interpretation of the rite, the sūtra still  points toward a direct pathway between the R̥gveda and the study that eventually  came to constitute the R̥gvedic Āraṇyakas.
Key to grasping the meaning of the ritual is understanding the links between  ritual acts and both the cosmos and the person. The complexity of the hymn  derives especially from the multiplicity of reference of its verses, which connect  ritual, cosmos, and person. Thus, the verses frequently refer simultaneously to the  ritual (adhiyajñam) and to the world (adhidevatam), especially to the sun, and  sometimes also to the human body or the human being (adhyātmam). There is no  unproblematic verse in this hymn, but as an example, consider the possibilities of  the first verse. Lines abc of that verse describe three brothers: the gray Hotar, the  ravenous middle brother, and the brother with ghee-smeared back. Scholars have  offered a variety of identifications for the brothers: the sun, wind, and fire (Sāyaṇa);  the Āhavanīya or offering fire, the Dakṣiṇa or southern fire, and the Gārhapatya  or household fire (Geldner); the original form of Agni, lightning, and the terres trial Agni (Brown); and the sun, lightning, and the fire heating the Pravargya pot  (Houben). It is likely that ancient hearers of the hymn made not one but several of  these sets of identifications. In our view the verse has both a ritual (adhiyajñam)  and a cosmic (adhidevatam) meaning. On the one hand, the three brothers can be  a triad of ritual fires—either the three that Geldner sees or perhaps three phases of  the sacrificial fire (gray embers, flaming fire, and fire flaring as it receives ghee). But  they can also be a triad of cosmic fires (perhaps the sun, moon, and earthly fire,  which correspond to the three ritual fires, or another of the identifications proposed  above). In 1d the clanlord and his seven sons refer primarily to the sacrificer and the  seven priests (cf. II.1.2). But the sacrificer might also be embodied in the Sun and the  seven priests in Agni, or the clanlord might be the Sun and his seven sons, the stars  of the constellation of the Seven Seers, Ursa Major. We will never know which of these or what other interpretations the poet intended, but it is likely that the verse  operates on several levels that connect ritual and cosmos.
The brief exegetical possibilities we have provided in the translation at best sug gest primary referents, even though other secondary identifications may also be  implied. So, for example, verses 2 and 3 move back and forth between adhiyajñam  and adhidevatam meanings. The “seven” in 2a appear to be the “seven” of 1d, who  are primarily priests (an adhiyajñam interpretation). However, the “single wheel”  in 2a suggests the sun (adhidevatam) more than the ritual fire. This interpretation  is supported by verse 48, since there the single wheel is the disk of the sun, which is  drawn by the “single horse,” Etaśa, the horse that pulls the Sun’s chariot. In verse 3  the poet foregrounds ritual referents: the seven may again be priests, and, as is often  the case, the chariot has now become a symbol of the sacrifice itself.
Another characteristic of this hymn, and another reason for its obscurity, is its fre quent use of word play. The poet favors words that are not etymologically or semanti cally related but that sound as if they ought to be. For example, in verse 13d sanā́d “from of old” is echoed by sánābhiḥ “along with its nave” and in 14a sánemi “along
with its felly.” Or again, in 14a ví vāvr̥ta “has turned away” anticipates 14c ā́vr̥tam “covered over.” In verse 5 ajá “unborn” can also mean “goat,” and therefore can sug gest Aja Ekapad, the “One-Footed Goat,” a symbol of the Sun. According to Thieme  (1987: 338), the poet even uses an implied homophone in verse 16. The stars of the  constellation called “the Kr̥ttikās” are envisioned as women. The word for “women”  in pāda a is stríyaḥ from the stem strī́. There is also a closely homophonous mascu line stem stŕ̥ “star,” which does not occur in the verse but which would have been  known to its hearers. The poet is saying that although the Kr̥ttikās are strī́ “women,”  people call its constituents stŕ̥ “stars,” and therefore they speak of those Kr̥ttikās,  even though they are women, as masculine “stars.” As the verse concludes, only a  poet who a master of words would understand this, and a poet who does understand
it becomes even greater than his father, who would likely have been his teacher. Thematic continuities and repeated use of similar poetic devices help unify the  hymn. The hymn is also unified by its recursive structure created by parallelisms  in its beginning and conclusion. For example, the poet speaks of the One (éka) in  verse 6 and again toward the end of the hymn, in verse 46. In verse 6 that which  is the “One” assumes the form of the Sun. At the other end of the poem, in verse  46, the One reappears and, through speech, takes the form not only of the Sun,  but also of Agni, of Mātariśvan (the fire-bringer), and of other deities as well.  Verses 7cd and 47 (as well as verse 51) describe the course of the waters upward by  means of the rays of the sun and then downward as rain. Verses 2–3 and verse 48  describe the Sun’s chariot and especially its single wheel. The final verses, 49–52,  form an independent recursive unit. Verses 49 and 52 concern respectively the femi nine Sarasvatī, the river goddess, and the masculine Sarasvant, who is Agni and the  Sun according to 52ab. The linkage of fire and water or sun and rain is a constant  throughout the hymn. It is reasserted in the verses fitted between those to Sarasvatī and Sarasvant. Verse 51 describes the cycle of the water to heaven and then back
352 I.164
down to earth and the correspondence between the sacrificial fire that invigorates  the gods in heaven and the rain that invigorates the earth. Verse 50, which is quoted  from X.90.16, refers to the cycle of the sacrifice, which like the water cycle oper ates between heaven and earth. The sacrifice has its origins in heaven, but it is now  performed on earth and directed back toward heaven. Such formal devices help  maintain a sense of coherence in a hymn that covers substantial ritual and thematic  territory.
We do not propose to discuss the verses of the hymn in detail, but we do want  to provide some additional information and to illustrate especially the movement in  this hymn between different levels of meaning. Verse 8 refers to the story of Dawn’s  incest with her father, who is sometimes the Sun and sometimes Heaven. Depending  on which of the two is her father—and either is possible in this verse—Dawn’s child  might be the Sun or Agni, the ritual fire. Verse 14 describes the movement of the  Sun, but here it is its movement at night, when its bright side is turned away from  earth and it moves from the west to the east. Verse 15 continues the description  of the night (cf. Thieme 1987). The seven who are born at the same time might be  the seven stars of the constellation of the Seven Seers. Of these stars six are paired  (15b) and one is single (η Ursae Majoris).
In verses 20–22 is the famous riddle of the tree that has continued to remain  a puzzle. The two birds have been interpreted as the waxing and waning moon  (Thieme 1949: 55–73) the moon and the sun (Kuiper 1970: 127–28), the sun and  the gharma pot (Houben 2000: 520–22), and two seekers of knowledge (Geldner).  Whatever the birds may be, the verse ultimately concerns the acquisition of knowl
edge or inspiration, the “sweet fig” (vs. 22) at the top of the tree. Given the enig matic character of this hymn, it is not surprising that this knowledge remains out of  reach. Following the riddle of the two birds are three verses (23–25) that present the  development of ritual speech that perhaps embodies the knowledge represented in  the “sweet fig.” According to verse 23 gāyatrī, triṣṭubh, and jagatī lines are extracted  from hymns composed in the gāyatrī, triṣṭubh, and jagatī meters. That is to say,  the shorter constituent, the poetic line, is drawn from the larger, the whole poem.  But then verse 24 begins with the gāyatrī line, which is the basis for the “chant”  (arká), the hymn that is sung, and the chant is the basis of the “melody” (sā́man)  on which many verses may be sung. If so, then this verse begins with the shortest  constituent, the line, from which develop the longer songs and chants. Similarly,  the triṣṭubh line is the basis for longer recitations, śastras in the later tradition. The  reason that the verse divides the chant and the recitation between the gāyatrī and  triṣṭubh lines is that the eight-syllable gāyatrī line could be used as the basis for  chants in the R̥gvedic tradition, while the eleven-syllable triṣṭubh line was used in  recitations. Thus in lines ab, reversing verse 23, the shorter (the chanted or recited  line) is the basis for the longer (the chant or recitation). This order is continued in c,  which moves from individual lines to the complete recitation. In d the shortest con stituent of all, the syllable, is the basis for the largest constituent, everything that  is chanted or recited by the seven priests. This movement from long (the composed hymn) to short (the poetic line) to long (chants and recitations), and finally from  shortest (the syllable) to longest (everything chanted or recited) knits together the  entirety of ritual speech and ultimately concentrates it in the syllable. As such, these  two verses anticipate verse 46, in which the “One” is the basis for many names. Verse  25 also presents the smallest constituent as the basis for the larger. According to it  the gāyatrī stanza is the foundation for the longer jagatī stanza and the rathantara chant. The gāyatrī verse is the basis of the jagatī, because the jagatī verse has twice  the number of syllables as a gāyatrī (48 and 24 respectively). It is the basis of the  rathantara chant because the rathantara melody is set to VII.32.22–23, verses in  br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī meters. Verses in these two meters are combinations of jagatī
and gāyatrī lines. The gāyatrī is thus the foundation of both the jagatī and rathan tara and as such surpasses both of them.
The theme of inspired Speech (Vāc) is taken up again in verses 36–42. It is intro duced in verses 36 and 37, in which the poet shifts attention to ancient ŕ̥ṣis “seers,”  whose “insights” and “thought” are brought into the present by poet. However, the  poet does not understand his own inspiration (vs. 37), which is finally a gift of the  gods or, more specifically, a gift of Agni. According to verses 39–42, this inspired  Speech descends to the human realm like water in order to sustain life on earth.  While the emphasis in these verses is on Speech as a cosmic principle and human  possession, a specific ritual reference is also not far away. As Geldner observes,  verse 40 accompanies I.164.26–27 in Atharvaveda Śaunaka 7.73, a hymn to the  gharma drink of the Pravargya rite.
In verses 26–29 the hymn focuses on the Pravargya rite. Verse 26 begins with the  cow, whose milk will be the offering, and then describes the heating of the gharma  pot, into which milk will be poured. In 27a the gharma pot makes a sound hiṅ as  it is heated, and because it contains milk, the pot now becomes the cow. Her calf  is probably Agni, an identification supported by 28ab, which can describe a pot  placed on the fire. In verse 29 the meaning of the cow has shifted again, and she  is now the milk “enclosed” within the gharma pot. When milk is poured into the  heated pot, a pillar of flame erupts in what is the most dramatic visual moment in  the entire soma rite as now performed. In 29cd the milk or the cow thus becomes  lightning, exploding upward from the pot. Although the reference to the Pravargya  rite is less obvious in verse 30, the verse may refer to the boiling ghee in the gharma  pot to which the milk is added (Houben 2000: 510) and therefore to an earlier stage  of the ritual than does verse 29. Houben’s interpretation of verse 30 is partly based  on the observation that verse 31 is the mantra prescribed by the śrautasūtras for the  rite of heating and gazing at the gharma pot, which also belongs to an earlier stage  of the ritual. Houben may be correct in seeing a reference to the Pravargya rite, but  both verses 30 and 31 are also open to additional interpretations. For example, the  “herdsman” in 31a could be the breath (cf. Geldner; also Houben 2000: 508–9) or  the Sun (Sāyaṇa) or both.
Similarly, Houben (2000: 523) also explains verse 43 as reflecting the Pravargya  rite. He understands the “dung-smoke” to be smoke from the fire fueled by horse354 I.164
dung that is used to fumigate the gharma pot. The “dappled bullock” could then  be the mixture of milk and ghee that is heated in the gharma pot. But again, this  verse can be more than a description of the Pravargya. The “first foundations”  (pāda d) should refer not just to the beginning of a particular ritual performance,  but to the institution of the sacrifice (cf. X.90), and therefore point to an addi
tional interpretation that locates the form and origin of the sacrifice in the cosmos.  The “midpoint” (viṣūvánt) can refer to the Viṣūvant day (as in I.84.10), the sum mer solstice, which is the ritual midpoint of a year-long sattra ceremony. This sug gests that the fire beyond the earthly fire is the sun, perhaps wrapped in cloud, the  “dung-smoke,” since the solstice should occur around the beginning of the rainy  season. The sun can also be the “bullock,” which is “dappled” because of clouds or  sunspots. The “heroes” can be priests, but they may also be gods, who are gathered  around the sun. All these ritual and macrocosmic interpretations are not exclusive  since, according to the Āraṇyakas and Brāhmaṇas, the heated gharma pot can rep resent the sun (e.g., KauB VIII.3, TĀ V.8–9).
In verse 33 the Sun is the likely speaker, although Geldner’s idea that the speaker  is the Wind and Breath would maintain the dual reference to cosmos and person.  The imagery of these verses appears again in verse 38, in which the subject of lines  ab may be the breath (Geldner) or the Sun. The image of the birth of an embryo  in verse 33 leads to verses 34–35, which speak of “the navel of the living world”  and the “seed” or semen of the horse. These two verses form a brahmodya, a ritual  exchange of question and answer, in the Horse Sacrifice (ĀśvŚS X.1–3, ŚāṅkhŚS  XVI.6.5–6). The verses are appropriate to the Horse Sacrifice and may have been  adopted into this hymn from that sacrifice. Here the verses continue the reference  to heaven and earth and to the sacrifice, which becomes the image of the world.
1. This treasured one, the gray Hotar—his middle brother is the
ravenous one;
his third brother is the one with ghee-smeared back. In him I saw the  clanlord with his seven sons.
2. The seven harness the chariot with a single wheel [=the Sun]. A single  horse with seven names draws it.
Triple-naved [=with three seasons?] is the unaging, unassailable wheel,  on which all these living beings rest.
3. As its seven horses, the seven [=the priests] who stand upon this chariot  [=the sacrifice] draw the seven-wheeled (chariot).
Seven sisters [=voices of the priests] together cry out (the words) in
which the seven names of the cows [=poetic speech] are imprinted.
4. Who has seen the first one [=the Sun/Agni] as he is being born, when his  boneless (mother) [=the Waters?] carries the one having bones [=the  one who is a living being]?
Where is the life, blood, and breath of the earth? Who will approach the  knowing one to ask this? 5. Naïve, not understanding, in my mind I ask about these imprinted  tracks of the gods.
Upon the full-grown calf [=the fire] the poets have stretched the seven  warp-threads (of the sacrifice) in order to weave.
6. Unperceptive, I ask also the perceptive poets about this in order to  know, since I am unknowing:
What also is the One in the form of the Unborn [=the Sun] that has  propped apart these six realms (of heaven and earth)?
7. Let him speak here, who knows the imprinted track of this treasured  bird [=the Sun].
The cows [=rain clouds] yield milk [=rain] from his head [=the Sun].  Clothing themselves in a cloak, they have drunk water with the foot  [=the Sun’s rays].
8. The mother [=Dawn] gave her father [=the Sun/Heaven] a share in the  truth, for in the beginning, through her insight, she united (with him)  by her mind.
Recoiling, she whose essence was her child [=Agni/the Sun] was pierced  (by her father). Just those offering their reverence went to the
(morning) invocation.
9. The mother was harnessed to the yoke-pole of the sacrificial reward;  her child stood up amid the penned cows.
The calf [=Agni] bellowed and looked toward the cow of every color  [=Dawn], three wagon-treks (in the distance).
10. Carrying three mothers [=earths] and three fathers [=heavens] alone, he  [=the Sun] stands upright: they do not cause him to weary.
On the back of yonder heaven they [=the gods] recite the speech that  knows everything but does not inspire everyone.
11. Twelve-spoked, the wheel of truth [=the Sun] ever rolls around
heaven—yet not to old age.
Upon it, o Agni, stand seven hundred twenty sons in pairs [=the nights  and days of the year].
12. They speak of the father [=the Moon] with five feet [=the seasons] and  twelve forms [=the months], the overflowing one in the upper half of  heaven.
But these others speak of the far-gazing one [=the Sun] in the nearer  (half) fixed on (the chariot) with seven wheels [=the Sun, Moon,
and visible planets] and six spokes [=the seasons, in a different
reckoning].
13. In the five-spoked wheel [=the year] that rolls round—on that do all  living beings take their stand.
Its axle does not become hot, though its load is heavy. From of old it,  along with its nave, does not break apart.
356 I.164
14. Along with its felly, the unaging wheel [=the night Sun] has turned  away. Harnessed to the outstretched (yoke-pole) [=the airy realm?],  ten (horses) draw it.
Covered over, the eye of the Sun moves through the airy realm. All  living beings are fixed upon it.
15. They speak of the seventh of those who are born at the same time as  the one born alone, saying, “the twins, the Seers born of the gods,  are only six.”
What (places) are desired by these [=the Seven Seers] are distributed  according to their spheres. While (the one) [=the pole star] stands  still, the ones varied in appearance [=the stars of the Seven Seers]  quiver.
16. Though they [=the Kr̥ttikās, the Pleiades] are women, yet they speak  of them as men to me. He who has eyes sees; the blind man does not  differentiate.
One who is a poet, a (poet’s) son, perceives them. One who recognizes  these (women), he will be the father of his father.
17. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here [=at the horizon], the  cow [=Dawn] carrying her calf [=the Sun] has stood up by her foot. In which direction is she? Toward which side did she go away? Where  does she give birth, for it is not within the fold?
18. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here is he [=the Sun] who  knows his father.
Showing himself to be a poet, who will proclaim this here: from whence  has divine thought been born?
19. What (chariots [=sacrifices?] come) this way—they say that those (will  go) away; what (chariots go) away—they say that those (will come)  this way.
O Soma and Indra, (the deeds) that you two have done, these draw  (those chariots) like (horses) harnessed to the yoke-pole of the
airy realm.
20. Two well-feathered (birds), yokemates and companions, embrace the  same tree.
Of those two the one eats the sweet fig; the other, not eating,
keeps watch.
21. Where the well-feathered (birds), never blinking, cry out for a share of  immortality and for the ritual distributions,
here the forceful herdsman of the whole living world, the insightful one,  has entered me, the naïve one.
22. Just that tree on which all the honey-eating, well-feathered ones settle  and give birth,
they say, has the sweet fig at its top. He who does not know the father  will not reach up to that. 23. How the gāyatrī (track) [=gāyatrī line] is based upon a gāyatrī (hymn) or  how a triṣṭubh (track) [=triṣṭubh line] was fashioned out of a triṣṭubh  (hymn),
or how the jagat track [=jagatī line] is based on the jagat [=jagatī]
(hymn)—only those who know this have reached immortality.
24. By the gāyatrī (track) [=line] one measures the chant; by the chant  the melody; by the triṣṭubh (track) [=line] (one measures) the
recitation;
by the two-footed and the four-footed recitation the (full) recitation. By  the syllable the seven voices assume their measure.
25. By the jagat [=jagatī] (stanza) he buttressed the river in heaven; in the  rathantara (chant), he watched over the Sun.
They say that there are three kindling sticks [=three lines in a gāyatrī stanza] belonging to the gāyatrī (stanza). By its greatness it [=the
gāyatrī stanza] has passed beyond those in greatness.
26. I summon this milk-cow giving good milk, and the deft-handed milker  will milk her.
Savitar will impel the most excellent impetus in us. The gharma pot has  been heated: this shall I proclaim.
27. Making the sound hiṅ, the goods-mistress of goods, seeking her calf,  has come near through (my) thinking.
Let this inviolable cow give milk to the Aśvins. Let her increase for our  great good fortune.
28. The cow bellowed after her blinking calf. She made the sound hiṅ against his head (for him) to bellow.
Lowing toward his hot jaw, she bellows her bellow and swells her swell  of milk.
29. This hums—that by which the cow is enclosed. She bellows her bellow,  resting upon the smoky (fire).
Because she has put down (what is) mortal with the sound “chit-chit,”  becoming lightning, she pushed away her covering.
30. Breathing, life rests (though remaining) on its headlong course, stirring  (though) steadfast in the midst of the dwelling places.
The living one keeps moving by the will of the dead one; the immortal  one shares the same womb with the mortal one.
31. I saw the herdsman who never settles down, roaming here and afar  along his paths.
Clothing himself in those that converge and diverge, he moves back and  forth among living beings.
32. He who created him does not know him. He is far away from him who  has seen him.
He is surrounded within the womb of his mother. Having many
offspring, he has entered into destruction.
358 I.164
33. [The Sun:] “My father, my progenitor, is Heaven; here is my navel. My  mother, this great Earth, is my relation.
My womb is within the two open cups [=Heaven and Earth]. Here my  father placed the child [=the Sun] of his daughter [=Dawn].”
34. I ask you about the farthest end of the earth. I ask where is the navel of  the living world.
I ask you about the seed of the bull(-like) horse. I ask about the highest  heaven of speech.
35. This altar here is the farthest end of the earth. This sacrifice here is the  navel of the living world.
This soma here is the seed of the bull(-like) horse. This formulator here  is the highest heaven of speech.
36. The seven children of the (two world-)halves [=the Seven Seers], the  seed of the living world, take their place by the direction of Viṣṇu in  the spreading expanse.
By their insights and their thought these encompassing perceivers of  inspired words encompass (everything) everywhere.
37. I do not understand what sort of thing I am here: though bound,  I roam about in secret by my thinking.
When the first-born of truth [=Agni] has come to me, only then do  I attain a share of this speech here.
38. He goes inward and outward, controlled by his own will—he, the  immortal one of the same womb as the mortal one.
Those two are ever going apart in different directions. They observe the  one; they do not observe the other.
39. The syllable of the verse, upon which all the gods have settled, is in the  highest heaven—
he who does not know that (syllable), what will he accomplish by his  verse? Only those who know it sit together here.
40. Because you would become blessed, feeding upon good pasturage, so  then we would also be blessed.
Feed on grass always, o inviolable cow [=Speech]! Coming here, drink  pure water!
41. The buffalo-cow [=Speech] has bellowed, fashioning oceans. One-footed  and two-footed, she is four-footed,
having become eight-footed and nine-footed: she has a thousand  syllables in the highest heaven.
42. Seas flow everywhere from her: by that the four directions live, from that the syllable flows, upon that does everything live.
43. At the midpoint, beyond this nearer (fire), I saw dung-smoke from afar. Heroes cooked the dappled bullock. These were the first foundations  (of the rite). 44. Three long-haired ones gaze out in succession: in a year one [=Agni] of  them shears away (the land) for himself;
another [=the Sun] gazes upon everything with his powers; the rush of  another [=Wind] is visible, but not his form.
45. Speech is measured in four feet [/quarters]. Brahmins of inspired  thinking know these.
They do not set in motion the three that are imprinted in secret; the  sons of Manu speak the fourth (foot/quarter) of speech.
46. They say it is Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni, and also it is the winged,  well-feathered (bird) of heaven [=the Sun].
Though it is One, inspired poets speak of it in many ways. They say it is  Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan.
47. Along the dark course, tawny well-feathered (birds) [=flames], clothing  themselves in the waters, fly up toward heaven.
These have returned here (as rain) from the seat of truth [=heaven].  Only then is the earth moistened with ghee.
48. The chariot-wheel (of the Sun) is one, its wheel-segments are twelve, its  wheel-naves are three: who understands this?
They [=the days] that wander on and on are fitted together on that, like  three hundred pegs, like sixty (more).
49. Your breast, which is ever full, which is joy itself, by which you make all  desirable things prosper,
which confers treasure and finds wealth, which brings good gifts—o  Sarasvatī, you prepare that to suckle us here.
50. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice: these were the first  foundations.
These, its greatnesses, followed to heaven’s vault, where the ancient
Sādhyas and the gods are.
51. This water remains the same: it goes up and down throughout the days. Thunderstorms vivify the earth, and fires vivify heaven.
52. The heavenly well-feathered, lofty bird, child of the waters, and  beautiful (child) of the plants,
the one bringing satisfaction by the rains from what is bounded by
waters: Sarasvant!—him do I call upon again and again for help.
The last collection of hymns in the first maṇḍala, I.165–191, is attributed to  Agastya, who according to later tradition was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa and of  the Apsaras Urvaśī. Several times in his hymns, however, Agastya refers to himself  as Mānya, the son of Māna (e.g., I.165.14–15, 177.5, 184.4). The collection opens  with hymns to the Maruts or to Indra and the Maruts (165–173) and hymns to  Indra (174–178). Somewhat oddly placed after these is a hymn that takes the form  of a dialogue between Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (179). Next are hymns to
360 I.165
the Aśvins (180–184), followed by a series of single hymns, first hymns to Heaven  and Earth (185) and to the All Gods (186), then a praise of food (187), an Āprī hymn (188) and an Agni hymn (189), a hymn to Br̥haspati (190), and the concluding  hymn of the first maṇḍala, a charm against poisonous animals (191). Like the col
lection of Dīrghatamas, the Agastya hymns thus form an unusual sequence. Also like the Dīrghatamas hymns, the Agastya hymns are stylistically creative,  especially in his hymns to Indra and the Maruts. He uses puns and verbal play (e.g.,  167), suppression of key words and ambiguous reference (171, 174), intricate simi les and unexpected turns of phrase (168, 169), syntactic innovation (168, 173, 174),  and striking imagery (173, 176). This lively and difficult poetry marks Agastya as  one of the great masters of the R̥gvedic tradition. He is best known for three hymns,  165, 170, and 171, which together describe how Indra and the Maruts argued over  a sacrifice offered by Agastya and were finally reconciled with one another, and for  his dialogue with Lopāmudrā (179), which turns on the tension between the ascetic  ideal and the responsibility to continue the family lineage. But both the set of Indra  and Marut hymns and the dialogue with Lopāmudrā also concern questions of  ritual innovation that define Agastya not only as a great poet but also as a signifi cant figure in the development of Vedic ritual practice.
In all but six of his hymns Agastya concludes with his signature pāda vidyā́meṣáṃ vr̥jánaṃ jīrádānum “May we know refreshment and a community having lively  waters.” Also 165–168 share the same final verse, as do 175 and 176, and 183  and 184.
## 165 Indra and the Maruts
Indra (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10–12), the Maruts (3, 5, 7, 9), and Agastya (13–15) 15 verses: triṣṭubh
R̥gveda I.165, 170, and 171 together tell a story in which Indra and the Maruts  argue over their rights to a sacrifice offered by the sage Agastya. In the absence of  a full, contemporary narrative, it is difficult to reconstruct the events of this story.  Apparently Agastya’s sacrifice was originally intended for the Maruts. Indra arrived  at the place of the sacrifice first, however, and complained that nothing was being  given to him (170). Agastya, frightened by the god (cf. 171.4), then gave the sacri
fice to Indra. At this point the Maruts arrived expecting that the sacrifice would be  offered to them. Agastya tried to appease the Maruts (171), who were understandably  angry that the sacrifice had gone to Indra. Indra and the Maruts then confront one  another (165), and each side asserts its power and worthiness to receive the sacrifice.  Ultimately, however, the Maruts concede Indra’s superiority (165.9), and Indra and  the Maruts become reconciled with one another (vs. 11) and share the sacrifice. At the  very end of the hymn the poet states one of the reasons that he recalls this story: he  hopes to be reconciled to the gods, just as the Maruts were reconciled to Indra. Stanley Insler has proposed the attractive theory that this group of hymns  forms a small Aindramāruta epic, whose purpose was to justify a ritual change  that occurred during the time of the poet. In the classical Vedic ritual the Midday  Pressing is dedicated to Indra along with the Maruts, but for much of the core  R̥gveda the Midday Pressing belongs to Indra alone. This narrative tells how the  Maruts also came to share the soma along with Indra.
In verse 9d we read kariṣyā́ḥ with Oldenberg and others, and in verse 15c we read  ’vayā́m, also with Oldenberg.
1. [Indra:] With what beauty have the Maruts—all of the same age, all of  the same nest—joined altogether?
With what thought? From where have these antelopes come? With a  desire for good things (these) bulls chant explosively.
2. In whose sacred formulations have the youths found delight? Who turned  the Maruts here to the rite,
(thinking,) “By what great thought shall we bring them to rest, soaring  like falcons in the midspace?”
3. [Leader of the Maruts:] Why do you travel alone, Indra, although you  are great, o lord of the settlements? Is this proper for you?
Confronting us, are you going to negotiate with us beautiful ones? You  should tell us what you have for us, o master of the fallow bays.
4. [Indra:] The formulations, the thoughts, the pressed soma are good  fortune for me. My explosive power rises; the pressing-stone is
brought forth to me.
The hymns hope for, receive me joyfully. These two fallow bays carry us  here to them.
5. [Leader of the Maruts:] For this reason, yoking (our chariots) with  nearer (horses) that guide themselves and making our bodies
beautiful,
we now yoke antelopes also (as our lead team) by our great powers, for  you have experienced our independent will, Indra.
6. [Indra:] Where was this independent will of yours, Maruts, when you  tasked me alone to smash the serpent?
For I, the powerful and mighty, possessed of might, humbled with my  weapons those of every rival.
7. [Leader of the Maruts:] You did many things when we were there, with  our united manly powers (ready) to be deployed, o bull;
we shall do many things in accordance with your purpose, o most
powerful Indra, when we, o fellow Maruts, shall wish it.
8. [Indra:] O Maruts, I smashed Vr̥tra with my Indrian strength, having  become mighty through my own rage.
Bearing my mace in my arms, I made these all-gleaming waters go easily  to Manu.
362 I.166
9. [Leader of the Maruts:] This is conceded to you, generous one: There is  no one like you known among the gods.
Neither one who is born nor one who was born will attain you. What  *you will do, do!—o you who are grown fully strong.
10. [Indra:] Even if I am alone, let my force be far ranging (to do) what in  my daring I shall now do according to my inspired thinking,
for I am known as the powerful one, Maruts. What things I shall set in  motion, just I, Indra, am master of these.
11. The praise song here has exhilarated me, o Maruts, the formulation  worthy to be heard that you created for me, o men—
for me, (who am) Indra, the bull and strong combatant—for (me), your  companion as my companions, for me myself by you yourselves.
12. It is just so: Reflecting me here and receiving fame and refreshments as  my irreproachable (warrior band),
you, who are to be seen all around with your shimmering colors, have  pleased me, and you will please me now, o Maruts.
13. [Narrator:] Now who has given liberally to you here, Maruts? Journey  forth to your companions here, o companions!
Knowing our thoughts intimately, o you shimmering ones, be aware of  these, my truths.
14. [Indra:] Since the praise poet will here offer friendship (to you) as if to  his friend, (and since) the wisdom of the son of Māna [=Agastya]
has brought us here,
turn here to the inspired poet, o Maruts. The singer chants these
formulations for you.
15. [Narrator:] This is your praise song, Maruts—this song of the praise  poet Māndārya, son of Māna.
With his refreshing offering he would beg *reconciliation (with you) for  himself. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively  waters.

Many of the usual Marut themes are present in this hymn: the awesome and ter rifying power of the thunderstorm (vss. 4–6), their glittering bedecked bodies and  chariots (vss. 9–11), their aid to pious men (vss. 2–3, 7–8), their role as singers for  their comrade Indra (vss. 7, 11). Although the order of elements seems somewhat  random, these praises are set within a tight frame. Verse 1 begins “we shall proclaim  their greatness,” which is echoed exactly by verse 12 “this is your greatness”: the promised proclamation has reached its end. Verse 13 is similarly structured, begin ning “this is your kinship...,” and the final verse (14) before the refrain sets forth  what the poet wishes from the Maruts.
Punctuating the hymn is an awareness of the balance between their past glories  and benevolence and the ones of the present day (see esp. vss. 1, 8, 13), and the  model of their previous generosity to sacrificers is given embodiment in verse 13,  where Manu’s offering of poetry induces the Maruts to appear to him with their  favors.
1. We shall now proclaim this to the overpowering race—proclaim their  previous greatness to the beacon of the bull.
As if through kindling on your course, you powerfully noisy Maruts, as  if in battle, produce your powers, o able ones.
2. Holding their honey close like their own son, the playful ones play, eager  at the rites.
The Rudras [=Maruts] approach the reverent man with help; the
self-powerful ones do not neglect the maker of oblations.
3. To whom the immortal helpers have given riches and prosperity—to the  man who does pious service with the oblation—
for him the Maruts, like (steeds) spurred on, sprinkle the many realms  with milk—they are joy itself.
4. Of you who with your powers enveloped the realms—your spontaneous  dashes swooped forth.
All creatures and habitations take fright. Brilliant is your course when  your spears have been extended.
5. When the manly ones of turbulent course make the mountains roar, or  have stirred the back of heaven,
every tree takes fright at your drive; every plant bends forward as if  driving a chariot.
6. You, mighty Maruts, you invulnerable band—with kind attention deliver  us to your benevolence.
Where your missile with its gory teeth scrapes (a path), mightily it
liquefies (the trees) as a well-placed (goad) sets the livestock flowing. 7. (The Maruts) whose generosity is (as steady as) a pillar, whose gifts are  not withdrawn, the restless ones, well-praised at the rites—
they chant forth the chant for the drinking of the exhilarating (soma);  they know the foremost manly deeds of the hero [=Indra].
8. With your strongholds with a hundred coils, o Maruts, guard that man  from crookedness and evil whom you (previously) aided,
whom you (now) protect from (evil) utterance amid the flourishing of his  descendants, you mighty, powerful ones who confer abundance.
9. All good things are set on your chariots, Maruts—like powers competing  with each other.364 I.167
On your shoulders, in the vanguard, are spangles; your axle turns the  wheels separately but at the same time.
10. Many good things are on your manly arms, on your breasts brilliants,  dazzling ornaments,
on your shoulders antelope (skins), on your wheel-rims razors. Like  birds their wings, your splendors have spread out.
11. Great by their greatness, extending, extensive, visible from afar like the  heavenly (realms) with their stars,
gladdening, good with their tongues, sounding with their mouths, the  Maruts, linked to Indra, encircling him with their rhythm.
12. This is your greatness, o well-born Maruts: your gift is long(-lasting), like  the commandment of Aditi.
For the person of good action to whom you gave it, not even Indra
makes it go awry through dereliction.
13. This is your kinship to the earlier generation, o Maruts, that as
immortals you many times favored its laud.
By reason of this poetic insight (of Manu’s), having favored his
attentive hearing, the superior men [=Maruts] showed themselves to  Manu all at once through their wondrous deeds.
14. The abundance stemming from you, o powerful Maruts—through  which we shall stay powerfully swollen for a long time,
toward which the people in the community will stretch out—to that  might I attain, *to my desire, with these sacrifices.
15. Here is a praise for you, o Maruts, here a hymn from Māndārya, the  respectful bard.
With refreshment he would beg propitiation for himself. – May we
know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 167 Maruts (except Indra 1)
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A particularly fine example of Agastya’s poetic skill. The first few verses invite first  Indra (vs. 1) and then the Maruts (vs. 2) to come to us; the last few verses (8–10)  before the refrain (vs. 11) celebrate the massive strength of the Maruts (vss. 8cd–9),  and again express the hope that Indra and the Maruts will stand by us (vs. 10), with  a curious detour through the topic of the Ādityas’ protective powers (vs. 8ab).
But the heart of the hymn (vss. 3–7) is devoted to the Maruts’ relationship with  their consort Rodasī, whose name is identical, save for accent, with the dual referring  to the “two world-halves” (rodasī versus ́ ródasī, though the latter can also some times be used for Rodasī). The verses are marked by what in Classical Sanskrit poetry  would be called śleṣa (“punning”), and the tone is curiously mixed: Rodasī is both extravagantly praised and at the same time scornfully compared to a loose woman,  with those two incompatible attitudes conveyed in the same words. (Unfortunately,  the understated deftness of these verbal plays is overwhelmed by our necessarily  labored and clumsy explanations.) For example, in verse 3 Rodasī is compared to a  young woman running after men by going to the public gaming hall, but also com
pared to fine ceremonial speech appropriate to a public occasion. The same word  (sabhā́vatī) is used both for her shameful appearance in the public hall and her role as  speech honored in public. In verse 4 the word sādhāraṇyā́ “common” is used both of  the Maruts’ joint cherishing of Rodasī and in a simile comparing her to a whore. (This  kind of verbal condemnation of a polyandrous woman is familiar in later Sanskrit  in the taunts sometimes directed to the noble Draupadī, wife of the five Pāṇḍavas in  the Mahābhārata.) A complex pun in the second half of verse 4 plays with the partial  identity of Rodasī and the two world-halves; the grammatical aspects of this pun  cannot be treated here. Despite the somewhat slighting treatment in the similes of  verses 3–4, Rodasī takes on the role of bride in verses 5–6 by mounting the nuptial  chariot like the mythological model of the bride, Sūryā. This depiction of ceremonial  marriage provides a transition to the ritual here-and-now (vss. 6cd–7), where not only  the Maruts, but also Rodasī along with the Wives of the Gods, appear at our ritual.
1. A thousand are your forms of help to us, o Indra, a thousand your most  welcomed refreshments, o possessor of the fallow bays,
a thousand your riches, to exhilarate us. Let your thousandfold prizes  come near to us.
2. Let the Maruts, masters of artifice, drive hither to us with their help, or  with their preeminent, heaven-lofty (riches?),
even when they, while furthest away, are running their teams on the far  shore of the sea—
3. (The Maruts), to whom (Rodasī) has been joined, positioned well, up  close to them like their own spear—she ghee-rich, garbed in gold,
roving in secret, like a young woman going to men when she’s bound for  the public hall [/provided with a public forum] like ceremonial speech. 4. Away (went) the resplendent, irrepressible Maruts in their flood; they  joined (with her) in common, as if with a common (whore).
The fearsome ones did not push Rodasī away as they did push the two  world-halves apart. The gods took pleasure in strengthening (her/
them), for companionship.
5. If it please her ladyship to accompany them—Rodasī with unloosened  braid had her mind set on the men—
like Sūryā she mounts the chariot of the one who does honor, she whose  face is turbulent like the approach of a cloud.
6. The youths caused the young woman to mount for beauty, she steadfast  and commingling (with them) at the ceremonies.
When the chant is accompanied by oblations for you, o Maruts, and the  one who has pressed soma, seeking friendship, sings the song,
366 I.168
7. I proclaim what of theirs is worthy of proclamation, that the greatness  of the Maruts is truly present,
when in company with them, her mind set on the bulls, she, self-reliant  and firm, brings with her the well-portioned Wives (of the Gods).
8. Mitra and Varuṇa (and Aryaman) protect from the unspeakable (fault);  Aryaman makes the unlaudable (men) atone.
And the unstirrable fixed things stir, (when) your wish-granting (flock)  has grown strong, o Maruts.
9. For they have not reached the limit of your swelling strength, o Maruts,  nearby to us nor even in the distance.
These (Maruts), swollen with bold swelling strength, have boldly
hemmed in hatred like a flood.
10. Might we today, might we tomorrow call ourselves dearest to Indra in  the competition,
(as) we (did) before, and let this be a great thing for us through the
days: let the R̥bhu-ruling (flock) consisting of (these) superior men
[=Maruts] stay by us.
11. Here is a praise for you, Maruts, here a hymn from Māndārya, the  respectful bard.
With refreshment he would beg propitiation for himself. – May we
know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 168 Maruts
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8–10
After an appeal to the Maruts from the poet-sacrificer (vs. 1), the hymn settles down  with gusto to a description of the Maruts as thunderstorm, a description executed  with all of Agastya’s artistry. It is rich with elaborate and trickily constructed simi les and with striking images and jarring turns of phrase. For the latter, consider  the first simile in verse 2: “self-produced like fissures.” Neither the contents of the  simile itself nor its application to the Maruts is immediately clear, but on further  reflection the “self-produced fissures” call to mind earthquakes and their sudden  and unpredictable power to open fissures in the ground, and this image seems an  apt comparandum with the Maruts and their impetuous exercise of their power.  Agastya plays with syntax, too, as in 5b where the verb “quiver” is used transitively  in the frame of the simile and intransitively in the simile itself. In fact, in this hymn  Agastya seems to want to deploy as many different types of structurally and con
ceptually twisted images as he can (the technical details of all of which we cannot  treat here).
The theme throughout is that, although the Maruts display great violence in  their stormy onslaught, the result is the welcome and fructifying rain (see most clearly vs. 7). This theme is nicely expressed in 3cd, which juxtaposes and combines  the warlike and the peaceful: a spear compared to a woman (see also the previ ous hymn, 167.3), and dagger and bangle placed together in their hands, a pairing  emphasized by their phonological similarity: khādíś ca kr̥tíś ca.
1. With sacrifice after sacrifice to you (performed always) in the same way  (am I) victorious. Thought after thought have you received, as they
travel to you, the gods.
With well-twisted (hymns) might I turn you our direction, for the welfare  of the two world-halves, for great help.
2. They who, self-produced like fissures, self-strong, were born to
refreshment, to sun(light)—the shakers—
numbering in thousands like the waves of the waters, to be extolled
[/*bound?] by the mouth like cows, like oxen.
3. They who, like soma drinks, pressed when their stalks are satiated, once  they have been drunk, sit in the hearts like friends—
on their shoulders (a spear) clings tight like a clinging woman; in their  hands both bangle and dagger are placed together.
4. Self-yoked, (their horses) have driven down from heaven at will. Spur  (them) on with your own breath, (as if) with a whip, you immortals.
Dustless, powerfully born, the Maruts with their glinting spears make  even the fixed places stir.
5. O you Maruts with lightning as your spears, who is the one among  you who sets (the fixed places) to quivering by your own breath, like  someone with his tongue quivering between his jaws?
(You) who stir up the wastelands on your journey as if stirring
refreshments [=rain], who propel many, like Etaśa [=Sun’s horse] on  his daily round.
6. Where is the farther (part) of this great dusky realm, where the closer  (part), o Maruts, in which you have driven?
When you stir up the firmly compacted entity like loose pieces, you fly  through the turbulent flood with a stone.
7. Violent like your winning yet bringing sun(light), turbulent yet ripening  and swelling, o Maruts—
your gift [=rain] is welcome like the ritual gift-cow of a donor, and it is  of broad expanse and scintillating like lordly (Rodasī).
8. The rivers sound in response to your wheel-rims, when they raise up the  speech coming from the (storm) clouds.
The lightning-flashes smile down on the earth, when the Maruts sprinkle  ghee upon her.
9. Pr̥śni gave birth to the turbulent face of the unruly Maruts for great joy  [/battle].
They, in shared delight, begat the formless (cloud) mass. Just after that  they surveyed their vigorous self-power.
368 I.169
10. Here is a praise for you, Maruts, here a hymn from Māndārya, the  respectful bard.
With refreshment he would beg propitiation for himself. – May we

## 169 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāj 2
The subject of this hymn is the tense ritual standoff and negotiated settlement  between Indra and the Maruts—who both came to Agastya’s sacrifice expecting it  as exclusive offering—a situation also depicted in I.170–171 and the great dialogue  hymn I.165. Although the Anukramaṇī names Indra as sole dedicand, the Maruts  appear in every verse but 4 (though not by name in 6); however, Indra is the only  god addressed—in fact, a vocative indra and a form of the 2nd singular pronoun  appear in each of the first six verses and in the last one (8)—while the Maruts are  always in the 3rd person. There is thus a definite imbalance in their roles.
The poet begins by flattering Indra and suggesting that he is superior to the  Maruts, but soon implies that the Maruts are getting ahead (vs. 2), and coopera tion is suggested (vss. 1ab, 3). In the middle verses (4–5) the poet begs Indra for  wealth in the sacrificial context (as shown by the priestly gift cow in verse 4), and  this sets the stage for the reconciliation between Indra and the Maruts on the sac rificial ground (vss. 6–7). In the final verse Indra is urged to join with the Maruts in  giving us wealth, and is promised in return that he will be praised by the gods, that  is, by the Maruts, who, however, will also receive praise—from the poet-sacrificers.
Not surprisingly, since Agastya is the poet, the hymn is full of intriguing difficul ties and studied similes, such as the superficially puzzling maxim in the second half  of verse 3, which turns on the paradox of waters producing dry land (by silting up  the channel?).
1. Indra, you are the one who goes (before) even the great one [=Marut  flock] as it *drives; you are the defender even from great dereliction.
O ritual adept, as observant one win the favors of the Maruts for us, for  they [=favors] are dearest to you.
2. They have hitched themselves up, Indra—your (Maruts), who know as  their own the tributes stemming from all communities among mortals. The battle-thrust of the Maruts is racing ahead in the winning of the  prize-contest whose reward is the sun.
3. This spear of yours has been fixed among us, Indra; the Maruts speed the  formless (cloud) mass, with all its gear.
For even a fire blazing in the brushwood can produce pleasurable
offerings, as waters do an island. 4. You, Indra—give us wealth, like a present in the form of a most
formidable priestly gift cow.
And the praises that will be enjoyable to you and to Vāyu will swell with  victory-prizes, as (priestly gift cows) swell their breast of honey.
5. In you, Indra, are most overflowing riches, the leaders of whoever seeks  the truth.
Let the Maruts have mercy upon us, the gods who up till now have
provided the way, as it were.
6. Drive forth toward the men who grant rewards [=Maruts], Indra. Take  your place on the earthly seat of the great one [=Marut flock],
now when their wide-striding antelopes have come to a standstill, like the  manly forces of a stranger at a ford.
7. The trampling of the antelopes of the fearsome, irrepressible Maruts is  heard opposite as they come here,
those who fly with their helpers in swarms to the mortal who seeks
battles, as if to a debtor.
8. You, Indra, along with the Maruts—for the Mānas dig out proliferating  riches, tipped with cows, destined for all men.
You will be praised, o god, by the gods [=Maruts] (also) being praised.  – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 170 Indra
Indra (1, 3), Agastya (2, 5), Indra or Agastya (4)
5 verses: br̥hatī 1, anuṣṭubh 2–4, triṣṭubh 5
For this hymn see the introduction to I.165. This hymn is the opening of the  story, in which Indra confronts Agastya, who has prepared an offering for the  Maruts rather than for him. Indra asks Agastya if there is really is to be noth ing for him and how can one understand how such a thing could happen (1ab)!  Indra warns Agastya that he may be able to fool someone else with promises of  future offerings, but he cannot deceive or deny Indra (1cd). In fear, Agastya tries  to convince Indra that he should not take the offerings intended for the Maruts,  since they are his warriors, but rather come to some sort of accommodation with  them (2). But Indra insists and accuses Agastya of ignoring him altogether (3).  Agastya quickly capitulates and orders the sacrifice to be readied for Indra (4),  but he still hopes that Indra will come to an agreement with Maruts to share the  offering (5).
Curious is the use of the 1st dual verb tanavāvahai “we two shall extend (the sac rifice)” in verse 4, for it is unclear who the second subject, besides Agastya, would  be. It might perhaps be Indra, taking an active role in his own sacrifice, but we sug gest rather that it is Agastya’s wife Lopāmudrā, who is his ritual partner in I.179.
370 I.171
1. [Indra:] Now is there nothing? And tomorrow nothing? Who
understands this (nothing), which is unmistakable (to me)?
The thought of another can be bewitched and what he expected is lost. 2. [Agastya:] Are you going to strike us down, Indra? The Maruts are your  brothers.
Make a proper arrangement with them. Do not strike us down in your  confrontation (with them).
3. [Indra:] If you are our companion, brother Agastya, why do you
overlook us?
For we understand what your thinking is: it is only to us that you do not  wish to give.
4. [Agastya:] Let them ready the altar. Let them kindle the fire in front  (of it).
The appearance of the immortal (soma will be) there. We two shall
extend the sacrifice for you.
5. You are the master of good things, o lord of goods. You are the foremost  institutor of alliances, o lord of alliances.
O Indra, come to an agreement with the Maruts, and then eat the
oblations in the proper ritual order.
## 171 Maruts (1–2) and Indra and the Maruts (3–6)
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
For this hymn see the introduction to I.165. In this episode Agastya pleads with  the Maruts to reconcile themselves with Indra and with him. He first addresses the  Maruts (1–4) and then turns to Indra himself (5–6). In verse 4 Agastya explains  to the Maruts that Indra terrified him and although the offerings were prepared  for them, Agastya was forced to give them away to Indra. Then he addresses Indra  and asks that Indra together with the Maruts prosper the “sons of Māna.” Māna  is Agastya’s father, and therefore Agastya is seeking prosperity for his extended  family. In verse 6 he pleads with the god not to attack the Maruts, who are his own  men (6a), for ultimately Indra will be even greater because of his alliance with the  Maruts (6cd).
In 5a usrā́ḥ “ruddy” primarily describes the dawns, but it could also modify the  “sons of Māna.” This ambiguity associates the luster of the dawns with the luster  that Agastya wishes for his family. The ruddy color of the dawns is also the charac teristic color of cattle and further suggests that the luster of the sons of Māna will  be based in their wealth of cattle.
1. [Agastya:] I come before you with this, my reverence. With my hymn  I beg the favor of you overpowering ones. Through your generosity and knowing ways, o Maruts, put aside your  anger! Unhitch your horses!
2. Fashioned by my heart and mind, this praise song with my reverence is  set in place for you, o Maruts, o gods.
Being pleased in mind, travel here to it, for you are those growing strong  by just (such) reverence.
3. Praised, let the Maruts have mercy on us, and praised, let the generous  one [=Indra] (have mercy)!—he who is the greatest good luck.
Let our carved [?] wooden (cups) stand upright throughout all (our)  days, o Maruts, in accordance with our desire to win.
4. (Then was) I retreating from this mighty one, Maruts, trembling from  fear of Indra.
These oblations (of soma) were sharpened for you, but we have sent  them away. Have mercy upon us!
5. (The fame) by which the sons of Māna will shine with power during the  ruddy (dawns), at the dawning of the ever-constant (dawns)—
grant (that) fame to us, o bull!—You together with the Maruts, you  the mighty one together with the mighty ones, you the enduring one  giving strength.
6. O Indra, protect your men from the stronger one [=Indra]. Be one whose  anger with the Maruts is appeased,
establishing yourself as the strong one through (the Maruts) bearing  their good signs. – May we know refreshment and a community
having lively waters.
## 172 Maruts
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: gāyatrī
A brief and simple pendant to Agastya’s Indra/Marut cycle. The Maruts as bring ers of rain are celebrated as sudā́nu “having good drops” (vss. 1–3), an epithet that  can also mean “having good gifts.” The poet asks that the negative aspects of the  thunderstorm stay far away from him and his people.
1. Bright be your course, bright with your help, o Maruts rich in drops, who gleam like snakes.
2. In the distance be your straight-aiming arrow, you Maruts rich in drops, in the distance the stone that you hurl.
3. Avoid the clans of Tr̥ṇaskanda (“Grasshopper”), you rich in drops. Set us upright, to live.
372 I.173
## 173 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
13 verses: triṣṭubh
The opening of the hymn (vss. 1–4) depicts the beginning of a sacrifice, as the priests  assemble and raise the song of praise and the other features of the sacrifice take their  places. The expectation of Indra’s arrival and enjoyment of the sacrifice ends verse  4. The next three verses (5–7) constitute a formal praise of Indra, with a lovely image  (vs. 6) of the god dressed in all the parts of the cosmos. These three verses, especially  verse 7, also depict Indra as a feisty combatant whom competing forces wish to have  on their side; the striking image in 7ab is of a tug-of-war. In the next verses (8–9) we  redouble our efforts to secure him for our sacrifice. Verse 10 reprises the theme of  Indra as the focus of competing factions, in a very dense and complex set of images,  while verse 11 expresses the ritualists’ belief that a properly performed sacrifice will  bring Indra here, however long it takes. The meandering route of the sacrifice in that  verse is replicated in form by the meandering syntax. Verse 12 is a thematic departure,  as well as a return to the rivalry of Indra and the Maruts over Agastya’s sacrifice;  here the poet once again offers sacrifice to both parties. The hymn ends (vs. 13) with  a familiar type of summary verse, with internal reference to the poem that is ending.
As a product of Agastya, this hymn poses many verbal puzzles and provides  many verbal rewards.
1. He sings the sāman bursting out like (the song of) a bird; we chant this  (chant) that is growing strong, bringing the sun.
The cows, the milkers, the undeceivable ones are on the ritual grass, so  that they will entice here the one whose seat is in heaven.
2. The bull chants along with the bulls whose sweat is an oblation, like a  ravenous wild beast, when he would out-sing (them).
The exuberant Hotar sings forth his zeal. The young blood, deserving  the sacrifice, supports the pair (of priests).
3. The Hotar approaches, circling around the fixed seats (of the sacrificial  beasts). He bears the embryo of the earth through the years.
The horse neighs while being led; the cow bellows. Speech wanders
between the two worlds like a messenger.
4. We have done these more attainable *deeds [=ritual activities] for him.  Those seeking the gods carry the actions further.
He will enjoy them—Indra of wondrous luster, coming easily like the  Nāsatyas, standing upon his chariot.
5. Praise this Indra, who is the “real thing,” who is a champion, who is a  benefactor, standing upon his chariot.
More combative even than his opponent, provided with bulls, he’s the  one who smashes apart even the enveloping darkness.
6. Since he stands out from (other) superior men in just this way by his  greatness, the two worlds befit him, like belts. Indra has enwrapped himself in the earth, like a circlet. The
autonomous one wears heaven like a headdress.
7. O champion, you who are the choice of those who are in battle, you  most in the vanguard, you who are to be yanked around (by the
opposing sides)—
to Indra do they of one accord (direct?) their battle-cries in
exhilaration, they who applaud you also as patron by reason of your  victory prizes.
8. Thus, because the soma-pressings in the sea [=mixing of soma with  water] are luck for you, when the waters, the goddesses, reach
exhilaration among these (cows) [=mixing with milk] for you,
every cow will yield to you to be enjoyed, if you pursue the people, also  the patrons, with holy fervor—
9. So that we shall be in good fellowship with him and through him  possess good dominance, as if through the lauds of men—
so that Indra will be there for us, standing upon our praise, leading our  hymns, like a powerful one (leading) the work [/ritual performance].
10. The contenders—(crying) “Indra with mace in hand will be ours!”— seeking (the one in) the middle [=Indra], try to win him over with
their sacrifices,
as those seeking an ally, (approaching) a lord of strongholds in regard  to his good command, (try to win him over) with lauds of men.
11. For any sacrifice that reaches fulfillment, even though it swerves along,  meandering in mind,
brings Indra to the house, as if bringing a thirsting man to a ford—as a  long road brings home a man who reaches his goal.
12. Don’t (involve?) us here in your battles with the gods [=Maruts], o  Indra. For there is propitiation for you, tempestuous one,
from the one offering oblations, whose song in its flood also extols the  great Maruts, who grant rewards.
13. This praise for you, Indra, is in us. With it you will find the way to us,  you of the fallow bays.
You should turn us here to good faring, o god. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 174 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
Another hymn bursting with Agastya’s tricks, here especially in the realm of daring  syntax and deliberate omission of key words. The hymn celebrates Indra’s great deeds,  especially his victories over multiple named and unnamed opponents. Allusions to374 I.174
the Vr̥tra myth and the release of the waters recur throughout the hymn (vss. 2, 3,  9), though the name Vr̥tra is mentioned only once (vs. 2). The first verse urges Indra  to “guard the gods,” and he appears in that role as protector of Agni and his ritual  activities (vs. 3) and enforcer of the norms of Ārya society, as embodied in the three  principal Ādityas (vs. 6). Others who break the Ārya social contrast—the impious, the  godless, the speakers of scorn, and the breakers of alliances (vss. 2, 6, 7, 8)—also fall  victim to Indra as enforcer. Thus, though the tone is martial, the message is moral.
Two separate devices structure the hymn. On the one hand, the vocative indra (always to be read trisyllabically) appears in the first pāda of every verse immedi ately after the caesura. On the other hand, there is ring composition: the first and  last (10) verses name Indra as “giver of victorious power” and “protector of men,”  while verse 2 has numerous echoes in verses 7–9.
1. You are king, Indra: guard those who are gods and the superior men;  protect us, lordly one.
You, as lord of settlements, are our surpassing benefactor, you the real  possessor of goods and giver of victorious power.
2. You subdued the clans whose speech was scornful, Indra, when you split  the seven autumnal strongholds, their shelter.
You set the flooding waters in motion, faultless one. You made Vr̥tra  subject to the youth Purukutsa.
3. Drive the troops whose lord is a champion [=you], Indra, and (those  [=Maruts?]) with whom now (you gain?) heaven, much invoked one.
Guard insatiable Agni going in triumph; like a lion, (guard) his labors in  the house at dawn.
4. They [=enemies] will lie now in the same womb, Indra, for the
glorification of your metal-edged weapon in its greatness.
When by battle he sent the floods, the cows surging downward, he
mounted his two fallow bays; boldly he swiped the battle-prizes.
5. Convey Kutsa, Indra, in whom you take pleasure. Eager for the halter are  the two silvery horses of the Wind.
Then tear off the wheel of the Sun at the moment of encounter. Mace in  hand, he will charge the opponents.
6. Once you had smashed those who rout their allies, and had smashed the  impious when you were strengthened by the stimulant, o Indra of the  fallow bays,
those who saw before them Aryaman in company with these two [=Mitra  and Varuṇa], they were shattered by you, taking their progeny along. 7. The sage poet [=Uśanā Kāvya?] murmured, o Indra, at the winning  of the chants [/(sun’s) rays]: “He has made the earth a pillow for
the Dāsa.
The bounteous one will make the three (worlds?) bright with drops; he  has embedded in a woeful womb the one who speaks evil in scorn.” 8. These are your old (deeds), Indra; new ones have come: you
overpowered and exploded the many (strongholds) for the lack of joy  [/end of battle] (of the godless).
You split the godless (clans) into pieces, like strongholds; you bowed  the weapon of the godless reviler.
9. You, the tumultuous one, Indra, set the tumultuous waters in motion,  flowing like streams.
When you will cross the sea, o champion, make Turvaśa and Yadu
cross to well-being.
10. You, Indra, should be at all times our man-protector of men, who best  keeps the wolf away
and giver of victorious power over all our contenders. – May we know  refreshment and a community having lively waters.

Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except skhandogrīvī 1, triṣṭubh 6
The shorter compass of dimeter meter (vss. 1–5) seems to cramp Agastya’s style  somewhat. The most obvious device in this hymn is the relentless repetition of  forms derived from a very few roots: mad “become exhilarated” (vss. 1, 2, 5), sah “be victorious” (vss. 2–3), san/sā “win” (vss. 1, 2, 3, 5). These three roots create an  inescapable poetic logic of cause (exhilaration) and effect (conquer [enemies] and  win [prizes]), but the effect is still rather clumsy.
Verse 4 stands out as the exception, as it contains no forms of any of the signa ture roots, and it compresses within it a whole mythological complex: the stealing  of the wheel of the Sun, and the involvement of Kutsa, the horses of the Wind, and,  by implication, Uśanā Kāvya in that obscure story—a myth also alluded to in the  preceding hymn (I.174.5, 7, as well as often elsewhere, e.g., I.130.9).
One other feature is worthy of note: the image in verse 3cd, of Indra “firing” the  Dasyu like a piece of pottery.
1. Become exhilarated: might has been drunk by you, like the cup’s  exhilarating exhilaration, you of the fallow bays.
The bullish drop is for you the bull, the drop that is the competitor that  best wins thousands.
2. Let it come here to us—your exhilarating bullish exhilaration worthy to  be chosen,
possessing victorious power, winning, victorious in battle, immortal. 3. For you are a champion, a winner; you impel the chariot of Manu. Possessing victorious power, you fire the Dasyu who follows no
commandment, like a cup with flame.
376 I.176
4. Steal the wheel from the Sun, o poet, showing mastery with your  strength.
Convey Kutsa, bane for Śuṣṇa, with the horses of the Wind.
5. For most unbridled is your exhilaration and most brilliant your resolve. By reason of (the exhilaration?) that smashes Vr̥tra and (the resolve?)  that finds wide space, might you be thought the best winner of horses. 6. Just as for the previous singers, Indra, you became like joy, like waters for  the thirsty,
(so) I keep invoking you according to the formal invocation [/nivid].  – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 176 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
Though also in dimeter meter, this hymn displays an exuberance that the previ ous one (I.175) lacks. Both hymns begin with the same imperative (mátsi “become  exhilarated”) and end with the same verse (6), but in this hymn the soma drop is  generally the addressee, urged to mastermind Indra’s great actions, and especially  to help Indra destroy his, and our, enemies. The language is lively and the images  unclichéd; note for example verse 2cd, where the scattering of power is likened to  the sowing of seed in furrows just plowed by a bull.
1. Become exhilarated, to seek betterment for us. O drop, as bull,
enter Indra.
Showing your mettle, you drive the rival; you do not find a rival
facing (you).
2. Make the hymns enter into him, who is sole (king) of the domains, following whom autonomous power is strewn, like grain whenever a bull  is plowing,
3. In whose hands are all the goods of the five settlements.
Cause our deceiver to be spied out. Like a heavenly missile, smash him. 4. Smash anyone who doesn’t press soma, anyone difficult to get at who is  no joy to you.
Give his possessions to us, even though he will laud himself as a patron. 5. You aided (him,) the doubly exalted (Indra), so that the ridge-frequenter  [=soma] will be his at the chants.
In the contest, o drop, you helped Indra’s prize-seeker to the prizes.
6. Just as for the previous singers, Indra, you became like joy, like waters for  the thirsty,
(so) I keep invoking you according to the formal invocation [/nivid].  – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.

## 177 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Bloomfield (1916: 155) remarks of this hymn, “[It] is certainly late clap-trap. The  jingly use of stems vŕ̥ṣan and vr̥ṣabhá furnishes its main claim to attention. All its  repeated pādas are suspect.” Although we moderns might tend to be less outspo ken, this is certainly one of Agastya’s lesser efforts. The standard tropes of invita tion to the sacrifice (vs. 1ab), journey (vss. 1cd–3), and arrival (vs. 4) are presented  without complexity, and with a certain recycling of vocabulary—not only the “bull”  words scornfully noted by Bloomfield, but also “right up here” (arvā́ṅ vss. 1, 2, 5),  “one such as me” (madrík vss. 1, 3), and the usual lexicon of the journey. The only  really notable feature of the hymn is the first half verse, which uses a number of dif ferent terms to situate Indra in relation to the human populations, while implicitly  asking him to choose us as his destination among these populations.
1. Here (let) the bull of the peoples, filling the domains, the king of the  communities, much-invoked Indra (come).
Praised, seeking fame, having hitched up the two bullish fallow bays,  drive right up to one such as me with help.
2. Your bullish bulls, Indra, which are yoked by sacred formulations, the  steeds provided with a bullish chariot—
mount them; with them drive right up here. We invoke you, Indra, when  the soma is pressed.
3. Mount the bullish chariot. The bullish soma is pressed for you, the  honeyed drinks poured forth.
Having hitched up, with the two bulls, o bull of the settlements, with the  two fallow bays, drive on an easy slope up to one such as me.
4. Here is the sacrifice, proceeding to the gods; here is the ritual meal, here  the sacred formulations, here the soma, Indra.
The ritual grass is strewn. Drive forth toward it here, able one. Drink,  having sat down on it. Unharness your two fallow bays here.
5. Well-praised, drive right here, Indra, up to the sacred formulations of the  bard of Māna’s lineage.
May we know through your aid, as we sing at dawn... – May we know  refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 178 Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
One might fancifully suggest that all the difficulties that were stripped out of the  immediately preceding hymn (I.177) to produce that elementary composition have
378 I.178
been piled into this one, which has a number of intractable problems in grammar  (see especially the plural verb with apparent dual subject in verse 2b) and interpre tation. Nonetheless, the overall intent of the hymn is clear.
In the first two verses the poet asserts the usual relationship between mortal  praise and divine aid. Indra gives his attention to the current poet as he did to  previous ones, it is hoped, and therefore should fulfill our desire. The content of  this desire is expressed in an obscure phrase, “all things around the waters of Āyu,”  which has been explained by Paul Thieme (1949: 41 n. 2) as the territories that can  be inhabited by men because water is available. Verse 2 more or less repeats the  sentiments: Indra will surely not deprive us, and he will surely come to our sacrifice.  The question is what Indra will not deprive us of: the grammatical difficulties of  pāda b alluded to above add to the interpretational puzzle. If the two sisters here  are Night and Dawn, as most scholars believe, it is presumably whatever these two  temporal entities (treated as plural, not dual, because they consist of many days  and nights?) produce in the progress of time. The sisters could also be the two hands  (treated as plural because each consists of five fingers). The waters make another  appearance in this verse, with no more clarity than in verse 1.
The next verse (3), which is the center of the hymn, predicates of Indra (in agent  nouns difficult to render literally) an array of roles in which he gives aid to mortals,  and the final two verses (4–5), beginning with a summary evā́ “even so, in the same  way,” urge Indra to fulfill some of these roles.
1. Since, Indra, the same attentive hearing of yours still exists by reason of  which you stood by the (previous) singers with your help,
don’t let our wish that magnifies (you) come up short. Might I attain all  things of yours (that are) around the waters of Āyu.
2. King Indra will not cheat us (of those things) that the two sisters  [=Dawn and Night? hands?] will make in their own womb.
The easily goaded waters also toiled for him. Indra will come to our  fellowship and vitality.
3. Indra, champion in battles, is the one who conquers with his superior  men, the one who hears the call of the bard crying in distress,
the one who brings the chariot of the pious man to the fore (when he is)  nearby, and the one who raises up the songs, if he is there in person.
4. Even so, (let) Indra with his superior men, with a desire for good fame,  the devourer of strengthening nourishment, overcome the allies.
He will be praised in the competition for refreshment and at the debate— as the one active in every way, as the (very) laud of the sacrificer.
5. With you, bounteous Indra, may we overcome our rivals who think  themselves mighty.
You be our rescuer and be for our strengthening. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 179 Agastya and Lopāmudrā [Anukramaṇī: Rati “Delight”]
Lopāmudrā 1–2, Agastya 3–4, student 5–6 (so the Anukramaṇī)
6 verses: triṣṭubh, except br̥hatī 5
This justly famous and memorable hymn compresses much matter in a few verses.  The first four verses consist of a dialogue between the seer Agastya, the poet of  this hymn cycle (I.165–191), and his wife Lopāmudrā. It concerns, and contains  in embryo, a persistent theme in Indian religious literature and thought, the com
peting and incompatible goals of male religious figures: ascetic practice and the  production of sons, and it also presents the figure who mediates these goals: the  sexually eager woman who seduces the ascetic, who can thus attain the second goal  without actively abandoning the first (see, e.g., Jamison 1996a: 15–17).
Lopāmudrā speaks the first two verses, urging her husband to allow them both  to cease their ritual labors and have sex. She mentions the deleterious effects of old  age (vs. 1c) and cites as a precedent for her proposed course of action the pious  ancients who nevertheless also stopped working from time to time (vs. 2). In our  view (and that of the Anukramaṇī and Sāyaṇa, inter alia, contra a number of mod
ern scholars, who assign vs. 4 to Lopāmudrā), Agastya speaks the next two verses  (3–4). In verse 3 he counters her proposal with a vigorous call to renewed reli gious endeavor, which he casts as a battle against a tricky and numerous enemy that  they, as a married couple (mithunaú), can defeat together. The word mithunaú is a  charged one, because it of course can refer specifically to a sexual pairing. And this  is what appears to be rather graphically illustrated in verse 4, where Agastya suc cumbs to his lust, as Lopāmudrā engages him in intercourse. The “steadfast” (dhī́ra)  man is undone by the “flighty” (ádhīra) woman.
The next two verses (5–6) are assigned by the Anukramaṇī to a student, and  at least verse 5 may contain the expiatory statement of someone, quite possibly  a brahmacārin or Vedic student, who has broken a vow, quite possibly the vow  of chastity, and has undertaken ritual purification. The myth embodied in the  previous dialogue acts as a Legendenzauber, a magic spell that provides a myth
ological precedent for the misdeed and its expiation. (See Thieme 1964:  76.)  The final verse (6) summarizes the happy results for Agastya, despite—indeed  because of—his lapse: he attained offspring as well as power and a place among  the gods.
Although verse 5 provides support for the expiatory theory, we are inclined to  think there is something more going on, and that the conflict between Agastya  and Lopāmudrā reflects a theological struggle dimly perceptible beneath the sur face of the late R̥gveda—the struggle between the innovative theologians who favor  introducing the new ritual model involving the Sacrificer’s Wife as partner on the  ritual stage, and the conservatives who consider it a dangerous model with poten tially disastrous side-effects. Agastya in verse 3 appears to be a spokesman for the  innovators, urging an energetic ritual partnership between husband and wife—a
380 I.180
partnership that deteriorates in the next verse into a mere sexual encounter. In this  reading Agastya must undertake the penance in verse 5, and although everything  comes out right for him, the hymn cannot be seen as a ringing endorsement of the  introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife.
1. [Lopāmudrā:] “For many autumns have I been laboring, evening and  morning, through the aging dawns.
Old age diminishes the beauty of bodies. Bullish (men) should now come  to their wives.”
2. [Lopāmudrā:] “For even those ancients, who served truth and at one with  the gods spoke truths,
even they got out of harness, for they did not reach the end. Wives
should now unite with their bullish (husbands).”
3. [Agastya:] “Not in vain is the labor that the gods help. Let us two take on  all contenders;
let us two win here the contest of a hundred stratagems, when as a united  couple we will drive on.”
4. [Agastya:] “The lust of a mounting bull [/waxing reed = penis] has come  to me, lust arisen from here, from there, from everywhere.
Lopāmudrā makes the bullish one flow out; the steadfast man does the  flighty woman suck while he is snorting.”
5. [Student or Agastya:] “This soma within my heart, just drunk, do  I adjure:
Whatever offense we have committed, let him forgive that, for of many  desires is mortal man.”
6. Agastya, digging with spades, seeking offspring, descendants, power— with regard to both “colors” [=offspring and ascetic power] the mighty  seer throve. He arrived at his hopes, which came true among the gods.
## 180 Aśvins
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
Agastya’s trickery and virtuosic obscurity are fully on display in this hymn. As  a consequence we are uncertain about the correctness of many details of our  interpretation, but puzzling out the hymn provides an exhilarating ride—per haps appropriately, since the hymn begins and ends with the Aśvins’ chariot-drive  around the cosmic spaces. This ring composition is signaled by the responsions  between verses 1 and 10: the chariot “flies around” the airy realms and the (cosmic)  floods in 1ab and “speeds around” heaven in 10c (a parallel with a clever twist in  the Sanskrit, where the verb “flies” [dī́yat] is a close phonological match with the word for “heaven” [dyā́m]), and a physical feature of the chariot, its wheel-rims or  fellies, is mentioned in both verses, but with different words (paví 1c, -nemi 10c).  This ring composition provides a structure in which both the Aśvins’ journey to  and participation in the sacrifice and the poet’s exploration of the boundaries of  language can be anchored.
In our view the flying journey begun in verse 1 brings the Aśvins to the sacrifi cial ground and its ritual fire in verse 2, a fire that is itself characterized as having  “wide flight,” that is, as physically spreading out and up when kindled. The next  two verses depict several of the Aśvins’ earlier deeds as creating a reciprocal benefit  for them at the current sacrifice. Verse 3 notes that they (primordially) put the milk  in cows, a fact of nature that is often marveled at in the R̥gveda—that a “cooked”  (that is, ready to consume) substance, milk, is derived from its container, the “raw”  flesh of the living cow. Now this same milk is going into cups to provide the Aśvins’  oblation. Similarly, in verse 4 the sweet gharma drink that they produced for the  mythological figure Atri comes back to them at this sacrifice. Both of these verses,  particularly 3, bristle with difficulties.
With verse 5 the poet turns to his own situation and, in subsequent verses, that  of his fellow singers and their patrons. In 5 he presents himself, in the 1st person sin gular, as a poor man beset with difficulties, expressing the hope that with his praise  he can bring the Aśvins to his sacrifice and induce them to make gifts. Verse 6 has as  its subject the poet’s patron, depicted in two punning verbs (6c) as actively involved  in the sacrifice; the poet here (6d) hopes that this patron will act in good faith and  according to his proper duty by receiving the Aśvins’ gifts and then redistributing  them to the poet and his fellows. Verses 7 and 8 present a series of interlocking  causal clauses with shifting subjects. In 7ab because “we singers” do our job of  praising the gods, our patron is not stingy. “We singers” (of 7ab) in the 1st person  plural transform into Agastya in the 3rd person singular (8cd) via a set of clauses in  which the human half of the divine/human interface is left unspecified, and indeed  other crucial grammatical information, like the verb in 8ab, is missing. In our inter
pretation, Agastya, who is of course the poet (who appeared in the 1st person sin gular in vs. 5), is the subject of the whole of verse 8, and he is calling the Aśvins to  the Morning Pressing, the sacrifice appropriate to them, whose ritual substance, the  soma, is characterized by the difficult hapax vírudra “apart from/without Rudra/ the Rudras [=Maruts].” We believe (after a suggestion of Geldner’s) that this word  encodes a reference to Agastya’s mythological engagement with the Maruts (see  especially the dialogue hymns I.165, 170, 171) and his attempts to ensure that the  Maruts get a share in the sacrifice. Here, since the Maruts are associated with the  Midday Pressing, the offering of soma to the Aśvins in the early morning would be  made without the Maruts, despite Agastya’s loyalty to the Maruts and his general  eagerness to provide them offerings. In any case, clearly Agastya has had ritual suc cess, crowned both by widespread praise (8c) and by the possession of thousands  (presumably of cows or other livestock).
382 I.180
Verses 9–10 return to the gods’ chariot journey and are relatively straightfor ward, with a particularly uncomplicated demand for horses for us and our patrons  in 9cd.
1. Your easily controlled horses (fly around) the airy realms, when your  chariot flies around the floods.
Your golden wheel-rims spray (honey); drinking of the honey you
accompany the dawns.
2. You descend to the movement of the steed of wide flight [=ritual fire],  the one belonging to men, foremost at the sacrifice,
when your sister [=Dawn] will bring you, o you welcomed by all,
and (the singer) solemnly invokes you for victory’s prize and for
refreshment, o honey-drinkers.
3. You set milk in the ruddy (cow)—the cooked in the raw—(set) down the  cow’s primordial (substance),
which (milk) is (now) going within the wooden (cups) for you, as a
blazing twisting (snake [=fire]) goes among the trees, o you whose
breath is truth. The one with the oblation is performing sacrifice.
4. You chose the honeyed hot drink for Atri, to send it here like a surge  of water.
Now (the refreshing drinks) of honey come back to you, like chariot  wheels on the quest for livestock, o Aśvins, superior men.
5. With a laud might I turn you here for the giving of a cow, as the
time-worn son of Tugra did, o wondrous ones—
a great roar (as if) of water accompanies you two great ones—(might  I,) worn out from anxiety and without cattle, (turn) you (here), o you  who are worthy of the sacrifice.
6. When you team up your teams, o you of good gifts, you send abundance  nearby by your own autonomous powers.
Our patron gives the ritual prompt [/will please]; he toils [/will pursue]  like the wind. Like one who well follows his commandments, he has  taken victory’s prize, in order (to show) great (generosity?).
7. Since we, your trusty singers, are expressing our admiration for you, the  niggard with his hoard is far away.
And since, o Aśvins, (you are) irreproachable, because you protect (the  man) who has the gods nearby, o bulls,
8. And since (Agastya summons) you, o Aśvins, through the days at the  winning of the first outpouring of (soma, offered) apart from the
Rudras [=Maruts],
Agastya, proclaimed of men among men as if with a tumult of praise  songs [?], is conspicuous by his thousands (of cows).
9. When by the greatness of your chariot you carry yourselves forward, you  drive forth like the Hotar [=Agni] of Manu, o streaming ones. Provide an abundance of good horses to our patrons and (to us): might  we be companions of wealth, o Nāsatyas.
10. Today, o Aśvins, we would call your chariot here with praise songs for  ever newer good faring—
(the chariot) that speeds around heaven with undamaged fellies. – May  we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 181 Aśvins
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: triṣṭubh
Although not at the same degree of difficulty as Agastya’s immediately preceding  hymn to the Aśvins, this one certainly has its share of puzzles—though, as so often,  it restricts itself almost entirely to the Aśvins’ journey to the sacrifice and the sacri fice itself. The hymn begins at the sacrifice, with the Aśvins acting as priests (vs. 1),  but then draws back temporally to the usual invitation to travel to the sacrifice (vss.  2–3). Verse 4 gives us a tantalizing glimpse of a potential differentiation between  the two Aśvins, who are otherwise almost always treated as identical and identically  functioning twins.
Verses 5–6 are entirely parallel to each other in structure and return to the jour ney theme, but introduce another, though unnamed, figure by way of a slippery use  of the word anyá “other.” In verse 4 paired anyá’s referred to the two individual  Aśvins, but in the following two verses, each containing an anyá in pāda c, the  Aśvins are jointly established in the first half of the verse and implicitly contrast  with the unidentified “other” of pāda c. In our opinion this “other” must be Indra,  identifiable because of the pair of fallow bay horses in 5c, a pair of horses that are  uniquely Indra’s in the R̥gveda. It is not surprising that the Aśvins and Indra  should be journeying at the same time, since both are recipients of parts of the  Morning Pressing.
The final verses (7–9) take place on the sacrificial ground. Verse 8 is especially  rich in striking images of the ritual: the sacrificial fire is depicted as a “gleaming  wasp” whose sound is likened to a praise hymn, and the imminent mixing of soma  and milk gives rise to a complex erotic image, with the soma a swollen “bullish  cloud” at the “pouring out” (séka) of the milk—its swelling attributed to its sexual  excitement at the “insemination” (séka) of the cow. In general, swelling as a sign of  abundance is a consistent theme in the latter part of the hymn (vss. 5c, 6c, 8b, 8c).
1. What (portion) of nourishments and riches (do) you two dearest ones  (draw up), when, acting as Adhvaryus, you draw up (a portion) of the  waters?
This sacrifice here has made its own encomium for you, o you
depositories of goods, helpers of the peoples.384 I.182
2. Your blazing, milk-drinking horses, the heavenly steeds whose speed is  the wind’s,
the mind-swift, straight-backed bulls—let (those) self-ruling
[/self-directing] ones convey you Aśvins here.
3. Your chariot with its glossy chariot-box should come here like a
forward-coursing stream, for good faring—
(the chariot) that is worthy of the sacrifice and swifter than mind,
(saying) “I am in front,” o you mounters of the bull [=chariot], you
holy ones.
4. Born (one) here, (one) there, the two have always bellowed together with  (one) flawless body but with their own (multiple) names.
One of you is lauded as the victorious patron of the good battler, the  other as the son of heaven dispensing a good portion.
5. The attentive lead (horse) of you two, your sorrel, should go forth,  following your will, to the (sacrificial) seats,
(as should) the two fallow bays of the other [=Indra]. They will become  swollen with prizes—the skittish (horses) as they (go) through the airy  realms with their cries, o Aśvins.
6. Like a bull setting out to conquer, your (lead horse) of (many) autumns,  dispatching many refreshing drinks of honey, goes forth
along the routes of the other [=Indra]. (The horses) will become swollen  with prizes; (like) high, roiling rivers they have come to us.
7. A substantial song has been sent surging to you, flowing in three parts to  the plumped-up (ritual grass?), o ritual experts, Aśvins.
When you are approached with praise, help the man in need; whether on  your journey or not, hear my summons.
8. And this very song of the gleaming wasp [=sacrificial fire] swells in the  seat of men, which has three layers of ritual grass.
O bulls, the bullish cloud [=soma] is swollen as if at the insemination of  a cow [/at the pouring out of the cow (=milk)], showing favor to the  sons of Manu.
9. Just as Pūṣan and Plenitude (summoned) you, o Aśvins—the one with  the oblation sings (to you, as if) to Agni, as if to Dawn,
when I summon you, singing to you, with a longing for wide space.
– May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 182 Aśvins
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6, 8
The hymn begins (vs. 1) by addressing the ritual participants (in the plural) and  announcing the Aśvins to them; the poet then addresses the Aśvins themselves with extravagant praise (vs. 2), but in the next verse (3) he expresses some impatience  with them: why are the gods wasting their time with a non-sacrificer? They should  destroy such people and reward us, the faithful sacrificers and poets (vss. 3–4). The  “baying hounds” of verse 4 may well be a reference to rival poets.
Most of the remainder of the hymn (vss. 5–7) is devoted to the tale of Bhujyu,  son of Tugra, whom the Aśvins rescued with a marvelous boat (or boats) when he  was set adrift in the sea. This exploit was alluded to briefly by Agastya in I.180.5  and is treated several times in Kakṣīvant’s Aśvin hymns (esp. I.116.3–5, I.117.14–
15) as well as elsewhere in the R̥gveda.
The final verse (8) is a typical summary verse, referring to the poem just recited  and ending with the Agastya refrain.
1. This (ritual) pattern has now been set: (all of you,) attend upon it!  The chariot has its bulls: become exhilarated, (all) you of inspired
thought!
(Here are) the two holy ones who quicken thought, who provided
the goods to (the mare) Viśpalā, the sons of heaven whose
commandments are bright for the good performer (of ritual).
2. Because you holy ones are the first of Indras and the first of Maruts, the  most wondrous wondrous ones and the best chariot-driving chariot  drivers,
you bring your full chariot loaded with honey. With it you drive right up  to the pious man, o Aśvins.
3. What are you doing here, wondrous ones; why are you sitting (by) some  man, who, though offering no oblations, makes a great show of
himself.
Pass him by; wear away the life of the niggard. Make light for the
eloquent inspired poet.
4. Crush the baying hounds on every side; smash the scornful. You know  how (to do) these things, o Aśvins.
Make every speech of the singer adorned with treasure. Both of you, o  Nāsatyas—help my laud.
5. For Tugra’s son (Bhujyu) in the rivers you made the boat, with a body  [=cockpit?] and wings [=sails?],
with which you carried him out with (your?) mind directed toward the  gods. With good flight you flew out of the great surge.
6. The son of Tugra, thrust down within the waters, thrust forth into  darkness that offered nothing to grab onto—
the four welcome boats of paunchy (shape?), sent by the Aśvins, deliver  him up to safety.
7. What tree emerged in the midst of the flood to which the son of Tugra  clung in his distress,
to grab hold of its leaves as if to the feathers of a wild bird in flight? You  carried him up, o Aśvins, for (his story) to be heard.
386 I.183
8. O Nāsatyas, superior men, it should stay by you—the solemn speech that  the sons of Māna have spoken for you
today from this seat belonging to soma. – May we know refreshment and  a community having lively waters.

Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
A simple and straightforward hymn, especially in comparison with the first  two of Agastya’s Aśvin hymns (I.180–181), almost entirely concerned with  the Aśvins’ chariot and their journey to the sacrifice. In this hymn they travel  with Dawn (vs. 2). The dangers of the journey and their possible neglect of us  are briefly touched on (vs. 4ab), but with little anxiety, before the offerings are  announced to them.
1. Harness that which is swifter than mind, which has a triple chariot-box  and three wheels, o bulls,
with which you drive right up to the dwelling of the good performer (of  rituals). You fly with the tripartite (chariot) like a bird with its feathers. 2. The smooth-rolling chariot rolls on as it goes toward earth, when you  stand on it, resolved to fortify (us).
Let this hymn here accompany the wonder with wonderment; you keep  company with Dawn, the Daughter of Heaven.
3. Mount your smooth-rolling chariot, the one providing the oblations that  rolls on according to your commandments,
by which you two, o Nāsatyas, superior men, drive your circuit for our  descendants and ourselves to prosper.
4. Let neither the wolf nor the she-wolf venture against you. Do not avoid  (us) nor pass (us) by.
Here is the portion deposited for you, here the hymn, o wondrous ones,  and here the deposits of honey for you.
5. Gotama, Purumīḍha, Atri—(each one), providing the oblations,
summons you two for help, o wondrous ones.
Like those going in a straight line to the directed direction, drive here to  my summons, o Nāsatyas.
6. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness. A praise hymn has  been set out in response to you, o Aśvins.
Drive just here along the paths leading to the gods. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 184 Aśvins
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This last hymn in Agastya’s series to the Aśvins is a symmetrically shaped five-verse  composition, since the final verse (6) is simply repeated from the previous hymn  (183.6). The first two verses call the gods to the sacrifice and urge them to enjoy the  sacrifice and be attentive to the poet. Verses 4–5 return to the scene of the sacrifice,  requesting that the gifts and attention of the Aśvins be directed to us, not to others  (vs. 4), while verse 5 contains a common type of summary of the hymn in which it’s  found, announcing its completion (5ab), and ends with the Aśvins in the company  of Agastya (5d). The poet’s positioning of his own name directly adjacent to that  of the Aśvins (voc. Nāsatya) in the final pāda of this series was surely deliberate.
The middle verse (3) makes a brief detour into mythology: the participation of  the Aśvins in the bridal journey of Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun (5ab). The verse  is addressed, in the first instance, to Pūṣan, who also participates in this episode  elsewhere. Several obscure images are found in this verse—the simile comparing  the Aśvins to arrow-makers (3a) and the journey of their lead horses (3cd) with the  well-nigh-impenetrable simile involving “vast Varuṇa,” which may refer to the sea  and reflect the generally later association of Varuṇa with waters. These difficulties  are, of course, appropriate to a structurally isolated middle verse.
1. We would summon you today and you later on. When dawn is breaking,  the conductor (of words) with solemn words (summons)
the Nāsatyas, the sons of Heaven, wherever they are, for the man who  gives even more than the stranger.
2. Bring yourselves to exhilaration in our company, o bulls! Beat up the  niggards when you are exhilarated by the wave (of soma).
Listen to me, you superior men, brought here through sacrifice by the  invitations of my thoughts, and (be) attentive with your ears.
3. O Pūṣan, the two gods, the Nāsatyas, as if making arrows ready for glory,  (made ready) the bridal procession of Sūryā.
Your lead horses, born in the waters, zig-zag along the wagon-treks as if  over the worn (surfaces) of the vast Varuṇa [=the sea?].
4. Let your (honeyed) gift be for us, honeyed ones. Spur on the praise song  of the bard, the son of Māna,
when the separate peoples applaud your (deeds) worthy of fame, in order  to (attain) an abundance of good heroes, o you of good gifts.
5. This praise song with a good twist has been made for you by the sons of  Māna, o bounteous Aśvins.
Drive your circuit for the sake of our descendants and ourselves,
becoming exhilarated in company with Agastya, o Nāsatyas.
388 I.185
6. We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness. A praise hymn has  been set out in response to you, o Aśvins.
Drive just here along the paths leading to the gods. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 185 Heaven and Earth
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This eleven-verse hymn falls into two connected sections. Verses 2–8 all end with  a pāda-long refrain; since this refrain seems to be an implicit response to verse 1,  we believe that 1–8 form a coherent whole, ending with an expiatory verse (8) and  then followed by a three-verse summary referring to the hymn-within-a-hymn that  precedes.
The refrain addressed to Heaven and Earth, “protect us from the formless  void,” expresses the Vedic fear of the darkness and lack of definition character istic of pre-creation chaos. Heaven and Earth help dispel that fear and provide  protection from the void in several ways. They are the defining structures of the  cosmos, and within the shaped space they produce between them, all separate  forms, animate and inanimate, exist. This seems to be the point of verse 1c, “they  carry everything that is a name”; we take this as a version of the later Sanskrit  nāma-rūpa “name and form,” the multiplicity of individual entities, defined by  the conjunction of a physical form and a word for it. Heaven and Earth are also  the parents of the Sun, the light that allows the individual forms to be seen. Their  parentage of the Sun is, in our opinion, the subject of verses 2–4, though the Sun  is not mentioned directly. The embryo of verse 2 is the “gift of Aditi” in verse 3  (the Sun is already called ādityá, son of Aditi in the late R̥gveda; see, e.g., I.191.9),  while verse 4 describes the wonder that Heaven and Earth are never burned by  the Sun, their son. (On this kinship relation, see also the Heaven and Earth hymn  I.160.)
Heaven and Earth define space, but they also, in part via their son, define  time: the regular alternation of day and night is first mentioned in verse 1d. The two  complementary pairs, Heaven and Earth and Night and Dawn, are treated together  in verse 4c, and in our opinion the siblings of verse 5 are more likely Night and  Dawn than Heaven and Earth, since they are located “in the lap of their parents,”  that is, Heaven and Earth. However, the latter pair are definitely the subject of  verses 6–7, and their role in conception is highlighted again. The final verse of the  refrain-bounded section (8) seeks expiation for an unnamed offense, and offers the  current hymn (“this hymnic vision”) to that end.
The last three verses (9–11) develop this theme. The poet expresses the hope  that the verbal products he has just produced will help him: his “lauds belonging to men” (a variation on the technical term nárāśáṃsa, vs. 9), and the “truth” he  addressed to Heaven and Earth (vss. 10–11).
1. Which of these two is the earlier, and which the later? How were they  born, o poets? Who fully understands?
By themselves the two carry everything that is a name. Day and Night  roll through (them) like two wheels.
2. The two, unmoving and footless, conceive an ample embryo, moving  and footed,
like a natural son in the lap of his parents. – O Heaven and Earth,
protect us from the formless void.
3. I invoke the gift of Aditi, which is without fault, without aggression,  without weapon, and provided with sunlight and reverence.
O you two world-halves, beget it for the singer. – O Heaven and Earth,  protect us from the formless void.
4. We should be devoted to the two who are never scorched, (always) giving  help with their help, to the two world-halves whose children are the gods, to the pair among the gods, along with the pairs among the days. – O  Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void.
5. The two young women, sisters, siblings [=Night and Dawn?],
contiguous and uniting with each other in the lap of their parents,
sniff-kissing the navel of the world. – O Heaven and Earth, protect us  from the formless void.
6. The two broad and lofty seats do I invoke with truth, the begetters of  the gods with their help,
they of lovely countenance who conceive the immortal one. – O Heaven  and Earth, protect us from the formless void.
7. The two, broad and wide, voluminous and of distant boundary, do  I address with homage in this sacrifice,
who, bringing good fortune and advancing well, conceive (the
embryo). – O Heaven and Earth, protect us from the formless void.
8. If we have ever committed any offence at all against the gods or against  a comrade or against the lord of the family,
this hymnic vision should be propitiation to them. – O Heaven and
Earth, protect us from the formless void.
9. Let both lauds belonging to men help me; let both (Heaven and Earth)  accompany me with aid, with help.
There is much for him who gives even more than the stranger. Becoming  exhilarated by the refreshment, might we be refreshed, o gods.
10. I of good wisdom have spoken this truth to Heaven and to Earth to  hear first.
Let the two of them protect from disgrace and difficulty in close
quarters. Let the mother and father guard (us) with their help.
390 I.186
11. Let this come true, Heaven and Earth, which I address to you two, o  Father and Mother.
Become the nearest of the gods with your help. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 186 All Gods
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Although this hymn provides numerous small difficulties and twists of phrase char acteristic of Agastya, its basic outline is very simple: god after god is urged to come  to our sacrifice, beginning with Savitar (vs. 1) and ending with the gods collectively  (vs. 10d), and working through a list of divinities both major (e.g., the Ādityas [vs. 2],  Indra [vss. 6cd–7], the Maruts [vss. 8–9]) and minor (e.g., Ahi Budhnya [vs. 5]), in no  apparent order. There is much emphasis on shared activity, with expressions like “in  concert” (sajóṣas vss. 2–3, 6), “along with” (smát vss. 6–8), “like-minded” (sámanas vs. 8). The invitations end with verse 10; as so often, the final verse (11) is an internal  reference to the hymn itself and its power to satisfy the gods.
The beginnings of the verses and half-verses display an intricate pattern of rep etition that cannot be rendered in translation: with matching preverbs in verses 1–2  and 9–10 (the latter showing an especially complex phonological pattern), and the  verses of the middle section (5–8) all opening with utá “and” (as well as additional  matching material). The “and” especially contributes to our sense of the additive  quality of the invitations to the gods.
1. Let god Savitar, who belongs to all men, come to us here at the rite with  ritual refreshments and a good laud,
so that you, o youths [=gods], will reach exhilaration nearby us—(let)  inspired thought (come) to the whole moving world at the evening
mealtime.
2. Let all the gods together come here to us: Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa  in concert,
so that they all will become our strengtheners and will make (all things)  easy to overcome, like faltering power.
3. I will sing for you to the dearest guest, to Agni, with my lauds, I who  prevail in concert with (him?),
so that our good praise will be Varuṇa. And he [=Agni] will deliver
refreshments like a patron praised by a stranger.
4. With a desire for gain I hasten for you with homage to Dawn and Night,  (who are) like a cow that is easily milked,
as in one and the same day I measure out my chant in milk of dissimilar  forms (though found) in the same udder. 5. And let Ahi Budhnya create joy for us. As a (cow) swelling (with milk)  pursues her young, the River pursues (the hymn?)
with which we will speed the Child of the Waters, whom the bulls
having the speed of thought convey.
6. And let Tvaṣṭar come right here to us, in concert with the patrons, at  the evening mealtime.
Indra, the Vr̥tra-smasher, who fills the domains, the most powerful of  men, should come here to us.
7. And our horse-yoked thoughts lick him like cows their tender young. Our songs approach him, the sweetest smelling of men, like
wedded wives.
8. And let the like-minded Maruts along with Rodasī sit here for us—their  weapons grown strong,
their horses dappled, their chariots like streams—the gods who care for  the stranger, like yokemates in alliance.
9. Now that they have become conspicuous in their greatness, they hitch  up their advance teams with a well-twisted (hymn),
then, when, like a (lightning) bolt on a clear day, their weapons spray  all the salt-land.
10. Bring the Aśvins forward to help; bring Pūṣan forward, for they are  powerful by nature,
(as are) Viṣṇu without hatred, the Wind, and the Master of the R̥bhus.  I would turn the gods here for their good favor.
11. Here among us is this visionary hymn, o you who are worthy of the  sacrifice; it should provide you your fill and a place to sit—
(the hymn) that, seeking goods, takes its place among the gods. – May  we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 187 Praise of Food (Annastuti)
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: anuṣṭubgarbha 1, gāyatrī 2, 4, 8–10, anuṣṭubh 3, 5–7, anuṣṭubh or br̥hatī 11
On the surface a charming address to food, couched throughout in the 2nd per son, this hymn nonetheless enfolds some mysteries. In the straightforward verses  (esp. 1–3, 6), the poet praises food as the necessary support and help for both gods  and men, a theme summarized in the final verse (11).
But the nature of food and of its “juices” (rásāḥ) is also explored in several  obscure verses (esp.  4–5), where they have a cosmic dimension. In our view, the  juices of verse 4, “dispersed throughout the (cosmic) realms and adjoined to heaven  like the winds,” are the rains, localized in the midspace like the winds—and more  generally the endlessly circulating cosmic waters that fall as rain, produce food in
392 I.187
the form of plants and animals, and return to heaven by evaporation and by ritual  offering. In verse 5 these juices both yield food (as the nurturing rains) and are part  of, or belong to, food (as the juicy parts of plants and animals).
The hymn takes a ritual turn in the last four verses (7–10) before the summary  verse (11). Verse 7 seems to introduce the early-morning ritual; in the next three  verses (8–10), marked by a refrain, food is sacralized—made equivalent to soma  (vs. 9) and to a plant, perhaps the soma plant (vs. 10), each addressed as “friend of  the winds” (see vs. 4 for food’s association with the winds)—and transformed into  ritual offerings. The generic “waters and plants” of verse 8 become the milk and  grain mixed with soma in verse 9. (The exact application of vs. 10 is unfortunately  unclear.) In each case, the addressee is urged to “become just the fat,” in other  words (in a more robust society than ours) the choicest part of the food substance.
1. Now I shall praise food, the support and power of the great,
by whose might Trita shook Vr̥tra apart till his joints were parted.
2. O sweet food, honeyed food, we have chosen you:
for us be a helper.
3. Draw near to us, food—kindly with your kindly help,
joy itself, not to be despised, a very kind companion without duplicity. 4. These juices of yours, food, are dispersed throughout the realms, adjoined to heaven like the winds.
5. These (juices) are those that yield you, o food, and they also are part of  you, sweetest food.
Those who receive the sweetness of your juices press forward like
strong-necked (bulls).
6. On you, food, is the mind of the great gods set.
A dear (deed) was done at your signal: he smashed the serpent with
your help.
7. When yonder dawning light of the mountains has come, o food, then you should also come here to us, honeyed food, fit for our portion. 8. When we bite off a full share of the waters and plants,
o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.
9. When we take a share of you when mixed with milk or mixed with  grain, o Soma,
o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.
10. Become the gruel, o plant, the fat, the steaming [?] suet [?],
o you friend of the winds—become just the fat.
11. We have sweetened you with words, o food, as cows [=milk] (do) the  oblations—
you as feasting companion for the gods, you as feasting companion
for us.
## 188 Āprī
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: gāyatrī
Like the other nine Āprī hymns in the R̥gveda, this one treats a set series of sacrifi cial elements in a set order, using the same key words, italicized in translation. It is  not as bare-bones as some examples of the genre (such as I.14, the first in the text),  and phraseologically it closely resembles X.110.
1. Kindled today you rule as a god with the gods, o conqueror of
thousands.
As messenger and poet, convey the oblations.
2. O Tanūnapāt, for the one following truth the sacrifice is anointed  with honey,
while providing refreshments in thousands.
3. Being libated, as the one to be solemnly invoked, convey to us the gods  worthy of the sacrifice.
O Agni, you are the winner of thousands.
4. With their power they strewed the ritual grass, which brings a thousand  heroes, toward the east,
where, o Ādityas, you rule widely.
5. Wide-ruler and Complete-ruler, wide-ranging and preeminent, those  which are many and many more—
the Doors flowed ghee.
6. Because, having lovely ornaments and lovely adornments, the two rule  [/shine] widely with splendor,
let Dawn (and Night) take their seats here.
7. Because they are the two foremost Divine Hotars, poets possessing  lovely speech,
let them perform this sacrifice of ours.
8. O Bhāratī, Iḍā, and Sarasvatī—all of you whom I implore—
spur us on to splendor.
9. Because preeminent Tvaṣṭar anointed all the beasts (with) their forms,  by sacrifice win their fat for us.
10. By yourself send (the sacrificial animal) to the fold of the gods, o Lord  of the Forest.
Agni will sweeten the oblations.
11. Agni, the leader of the gods, is anointed by the gāyatrī-chant.
He shines at the svāhā-calls.394 I.189
## 189 Agni
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Although this hymn begins with a hope for an easy journey to wealth, it is clear  that the poet sees menace everywhere, from which he begs Agni for protection.  The imaginative catalogue of possible hazards and enemies continues through verse  6. Verse 7 breaks this pattern, but implicitly suggests why Agni will remain on the  poet’s side:  the god distinguishes between sacrificers and non-sacrificers, and he  makes himself available to the former.
The hymn ends with a typical summary verse characterizing the hymn that pre cedes. The poet’s claim that he has spoken “enigmas” seems overblown; in the uni verse of R̥gvedic discourse this hymn is remarkably straightforward, and Agni is  unlikely to find interpreting it particularly challenging. The final verse does, how ever, draw attention to a structural feature of the hymn: the first seven verses all  contain the vocative of the god’s name, in insistent initial position in the first three,  then somewhat postponed in the next four. In the summary verse the direct address  to Agni is absent, and he appears instead in the locative, a grammatical shift that  underlines the change of topic.
1. O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path, since you know all the (ritual)  patterns, o god.
Keep from us transgression, going its crooked way. Might we offer you  the greatest expression of reverence.
2. O Agni, deliver us anew to the far shore, beyond all hardships, with your  blessings.
And become a wide fortress, thick and broad, for us, and luck and
lifetime for our progeny and posterity.
3. O Agni, keep from us afflictions, (so) they will afflict peoples without  Agni’s protection.
Renew the earth for us to go easily upon it, o god worthy of the sacrifice,  along with all the immortals.
4. Protect us, Agni, with your unwearying protectors, and when you blaze  here in your own dear seat.
Let not fear find your singer, neither now nor later, o youngest
mighty one.
5. Do not release us, Agni, to the evil man, nor to the greedy one, the cheat,  nor to misfortune.
Do not hand us over to the toothed one who bites nor to the toothless,  nor to one who does harm, o strong one.
6. One like you, o Agni born of truth, when hymned, will stretch wide a  shield for our body from everyone who seeks to harm or to revile—for you watch widely  over crooked ways, o god.
7. Distinguishing between the two [=sacrificers and non-sacrificers?], you  pursue the sons of Manu at the early mealtime, o Agni worthy of the  sacrifice.
At the later mealtime you become tractable for Manu, to be groomed  like a foal [?] by the fire-priests.
8. We have spoke enigmas in his presence—I, the son of Māna, (have  spoken them) in the presence of mighty Agni.
May we win a thousand together with the seers. – May we know
refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 190 Br̥haspati
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Br̥haspati, the lord of formulations, is here presented as both producer and receiver  of sacred speech and sound. This theme is established in the first verse, where  my chants strengthen Br̥haspati, who himself is the “leader of song.” The physi cal movement of words and sound—between mortals and gods, between earth  and heaven—is a repeated theme in the hymn (see esp. vss. 2, 4, 7). The difficult  verses 3 and 4 concern a particular kind of sacred sound, the signal-call (ślóka)  that Br̥haspati launches daily, most likely a call announcing the sacrifice or some  part of it.
The Br̥haspati depicted in this hymn is no mere gentle wordsmith, but militant  and aggressive, compared to a bellowing bull (vs. 1), a fearsome wild beast (vss. 3,  4), a bird of prey (vs. 7). His words are missiles (vs. 4), and those who underestimate  him and seek to exploit him receive his punishment (vs. 5).
1. With chants I will strengthen anew the unassailable bull of gladdening  tongue, Br̥haspati,
the brightly shining leader of song to whom the gods and the mortals  harken as he bellows.
2. Words follow close upon him in proper sequence, like a gush that has  been sent gushing from those serving the gods,
for Br̥haspati, far-ranging straightway through the wide spaces, has  become equal to Mātariśvan in regard to truth.
3. A praise song and an offering of reverence, as well as his signal-call, will  he hold forth, like Savitar his two arms—
(the call) that happens every day according to his will, (the call) of the  undemonic, which is powerful like a fearsome wild beast.
396 I.191
4. When his signal-call speeds in heaven and on earth like a steed, the  discriminating one [=Br̥haspati?], bringing wondrous apparitions, will  control it, *like a steed—
as also when these missiles [=words] of Br̥haspati, like the charges of  wild beasts, go to the heavens that possess serpentine wiles.
5. Those who are wicked and tough, who live off you who are good, taking  you for a ruddy little bullock, o god—
to the evil-minded one you do not concede anything of value; you just  punish the reviler, Br̥haspati.
6. (You are) easy to approach like a path leading to good pastures, but  difficult to hold onto like an ally gratified by (all those) around.
The unassailable ones who watch over us have taken their stand,
unclosing the enclosed (cows).
7. On whom the chants, like streams, converge, like rivers on the sea with  their banks as wheels,
Br̥haspati, the knowing one, gazes between both, the ford and the waters,  (like) a bird of prey.
8. Just so has the great, powerful one, powerfully born, the bull Br̥haspati,  the god, been established in his place.
When praised, let him establish for us what brings heroes and cows.
– May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters.
## 191 Against Poisonous Animals
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except mahāpaṅkti 10–12, mahābr̥hatī 13
Very Atharvan in style, this hymn, directed against stinging and poisonous insects,  does indeed have a number of parallels and near-parallels in the Atharvaveda. Like  that text, it frequently uses expressions of the immediate past (especially in the aor ist) as a triumphant predictor of successful measures taken in the present. That is,  a statement like “they have been wiped out” (vs. 1d), though apparently referring to  the past, probably instead announces, hopefully, that the current verbal spell along  with whatever physical magic practices have been undertaken will ensure that the  desired effect will have happened this instant. Unfortunately we have no real idea  what the physical rites involved, though judging from parallels like Atharvaveda  VII.56, entitled by Whitney “Against poison of snakes and insects,” it may well have  involved healing plants and insect-eating birds.
The first nine verses of the hymn are directed particularly against adŕ̥ṣta—“the  unseen, invisible”—apparently small biting insects. English has a remarkably close  counterpart in the colloquially named “no-see-ums,” which also share behaviors  with their Sanskrit counterparts: clinging to grasses (vs. 3) and becoming especially  virulent in the early evening (vss. 4–5). And anyone who has ever attempted to swat a flying bug ruefully recognizes the commands given in verse 6: “stand still! come  to rest!”
In the rest of the hymn (vss. 10–16) the speaker works to render ineffective and  harmless the poison of poisonous insects more generally. One of the most salient  features of this part of the hymn is the density of diminutivization, that is, of the  use of the colloquial, low-register -ka-suffix, which appears not only on nouns  referring to bugs and birds, but also on pronouns and demonstrative adjectives (vss.  11, 15) and even on a participle (vs. 16). (For further on the sociolinguistics of the  -ka-suffix, see Jamison 2009b). Though for the most part the tools deployed against  the poison are homely ones—little birds and plants, insofar as we can tell—this  section of the hymn begins with higher rhetorical ambitions and a mythic model.  In verse 10, whose interpretation is much disputed, the speaker fastens the poison  on the sun and the skin containing the poison (in our view) “on the house of the  possessor of liquor (surā).” Although most commentators, beginning at least with  Sāyaṇa, interpret the latter action as an unmarked simile likening this action to  the fastening of the poison on the sun, in our view it is a parallel mytho-ritual  action and provides the mythic model for the ritual actions that follow. Again in  our view, the possessor of liquor is Indra—a reference to a myth well known in the  Brāhmaṇas and already clearly present in the late R̥gveda (X.131.4–5), in which  Indra, sickened from drinking an excess of soma, is made to drink the usually for bidden alcohol surā by the Aśvins and Sarasvatī. The surā was not pure but mixed,  and both the Aśvins and Indra perform the singular feat of separating the two  mixed liquids in the course of drinking them—a detail found in the R̥gvedic treat ment just cited. The ability to separate liquids, to get rid of (or nullify the effects of)  the noxious one and preserve the beneficial one, is what the ritual performer desires  here, as the last two pādas of the refrain (vss. 10–13ef) make clear.
1. The stinger that isn’t a stinger, and the one that’s a real stinger—
these are the two—they’re called fleas. The no-see-ums have been
wiped out.
2. As she comes, she smashes the no-see-ums, and as she goes away, she  smashes them.
Smashing them down, she smashes them, and crushing, she
crushes them.
3. The reeds and the damn reeds, the darbha-grasses and (the bugs) on the  sira-plants [?],
the no-see-ums on the muñja-grass and on the vīraṇa-grass—all have  been wiped out at once.
4. The cows have sat down in the cowshed; the wild animals have settled  down—
down (also) the lights of the peoples. The no-see-ums have been
wiped out.
5. And these very ones have come into sight in the early evening, like  thieves.
You no-see-ums seen by all, you have become recognized.
398 I.191
6. Your father is Heaven, and your mother the Earth. Your brother is  Soma, and your sister Aditi.
You no-see-ums seen by all, stand still! come to rest!
7. The ones on (my) shoulders, the ones on (my) limbs, the little needle  bugs with their stingers out—
you no-see-ums, there is nothing at all for you here. All of you, get  worn down at once!
8. Up from the east comes the Sun—the smasher of the no-see-ums, seen  by all,
crushing all the no-see-ums and all the sorceries.
9. Up has flown yonder Sun, incinerating all the many—
the Āditya (up) from the mountains, the smasher of the no-see-ums,  seen by all.
10. I fasten the poison on the Sun, the skin (containing it) on the house of  the possessor of liquor [=Indra].
Even now he will not die, and we will not die.
The mounter of the fallow bays [=Indra] has (made) its [=poison’s] trek  far in the distance; the honeyed (plant) has made you honey.

13. Of the nine and ninety tormentors of poison,

these have carried away your poison, like women with jugs
(carrying) water.
15. Such a little teeny kuṣumbha-bug—I split that itty-bitty thing with a  rock.

16. The little teeny kuṣumbha-bug said this, as it made its teeny turn forth  from the mountain:
“Without juice is the poison of the little scorpion, without juice is your  poison, little scorpion.”

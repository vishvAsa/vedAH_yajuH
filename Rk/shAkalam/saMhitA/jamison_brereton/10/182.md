182 (1008) Br̥haspati
Tapurmūrdhan Bārhaspatya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Br̥haspati, the master of ritual speech, is called upon to aid our speech, but also to  punish all forms of evil speech and their speakers.
## 1
Let Br̥haspati lead (our thought) across the difficult depths, but for the  utterer of evil he will lead his thought back (against him).
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.
## 2
Let Narāśaṃsa help us at the Fore-offering; let the After-offering be luck  for us at the invocations.
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.
## 3
Let him of scorching head scorch those who are demons; those who hate  the sacred formulation are for his arrow to smite.
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.

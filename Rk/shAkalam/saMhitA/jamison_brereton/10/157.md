157 (983) All Gods
Bhuvana Āptya or Sādhana Bhauvana
5 verses: dvipadā triṣṭubh
Short and simple, this hymn calls for help and cooperation from Indra and a variety  of gods in the first three verses. The last two verses are notable for what is probably  the only reflection in the R̥gveda of that corporate entity, the Asuras, and of the  eternal hostility between them and the Devas (“gods”), ubiquitous in middle Vedic  and providing a major mythological cycle in those texts. Elsewhere in the R̥gveda  the word ásura generally means “lord” and is applied to gods as well as to humans,  viewed positively or negatively. It is only in this very late hymn that we see the germ  of the later division of divine beings into the two inimical moieties of Devas and  Asuras. For further on this question, which has important implications for Indo Iranian as well as Vedic religion, see Wash Edward Hale (1986) as well as the discus
sion in our introduction and passim.

Along with the Ādityas, let Indra, flocking with the Maruts, be the helper  of our bodies.

The gods upon having smashed the Asuras when they came—the gods  guarding their own godhood—

Led the ray [=sun] to face toward (us) with their skills. Just after that  they surveyed their vigorous self-power.

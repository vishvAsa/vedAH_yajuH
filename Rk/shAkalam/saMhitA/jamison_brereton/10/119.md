Self-Praise of the “Lapwing” [laba]
Laba Aindra
13 verses: gāyatrī
A famous and often translated 1st-person account of the experience of soma-drink ing. Who the 1st-person speaker is meant to be has generated much discussion. The  Anukramaṇī calls this the ātmastuti “self-praise” of a laba (a word that does not  appear in the hymn or in the R̥gveda), a particular type of bird, the lapwing—while  commentators have generally identified the speaker either as the poet or as a par ticular god, usually Indra or Agni. We are inclined toward a version of the interpre tation of George Thompson (2003). Thompson situates the hymn in the genre of  ātmastuti, with its boastful self-assertion and the impersonation, or role-playing, by  a poet of “a divine agent.” Under this interpretation, the speaker is fundamentally  the poet, but the poet consciously taking on the voice and identity of another entity
or entities—in our view, both that of a bird and that of a god, indeed of Indra. The presence of the poet is clearest in his claims about his mind and the thought  that approaches him and that he shapes (vss. 1, 4–5). It is even possibly visible in  the spirited refrain—“Have I drunk of the soma? Yes!”—in which the speaker inter rogates himself and only after this internal verbal exchange asserts that he has con sumed soma. (One might suggest, only partially in jest, that Indra would not need  this verbal self-reassurance.) To characterize the soma-drinking experience the poet  borrows the identity of a bird, suggesting that the overwhelming sensation is that of  flight, lifting him up (vss. 2–3), making the people on the ground seem impossibly  small and insignificant (vs. 6) and his own wings large enough to cover the cosmos  (vss. 7, 11). But this prodigious creature cannot be only a bird, for the speaker boasts  of his control of the cosmic spaces and his ability to move the earth at will (vss. 8–10).  These boasts are most appropriate to Indra, who commonly manipulates cosmic enti ties, who is most likely to engage in self-vaunting ātmastuti (cf., e.g., X.48–49), and  who is the archetypal soma-drinker among the gods. The hymn ends (or almost ends)  with the apparent epiphany of Indra in verse 12, triumphantly announced by “here  I am” (ahám asmi) and calling attention to his presence in the ritual arena. The final verse (13) seems an anticlimax, and its contents also sit uneasily in the rest  of the hymn. The identity that this 1st-person speaker claims, that of oblation-carrier  (havyavā́hana), is responsible for the view that the speaker throughout the hymn is  Agni, for havyavā́hana and its variant havyaváh are always epithets of that god. But  the fact that Agni speaks this verse does not require that he be the speaker in the rest  of the hymn. In our view this verse, like many final verses, marks a shift of subject or  a coda. The speaker is indeed Agni. It seems possible that Indra’s epiphany in the pre ceding verse has brought him face to face with the principal god of the ritual and the  ritual ground, namely Agni, and that Agni borrows the rhetoric of Indra to make his  own counter-boast and assert the importance of his own role—though his somewhat  pedestrian self-comparison to a well-equipped household contrasts almost comically  with the soaring and exuberant language of the rest of the hymn.

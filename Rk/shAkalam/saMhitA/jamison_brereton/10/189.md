189 (1015) Sārparājñı or Su ̄ ̄rya
Sārparājñī
3 verses: gāyatrī
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Sūrya or to the shadowy figure  Sārparājñī ([female] descendant of the Queen of the Snakes), who is also said to  be its author. The former identification seems far more likely, or, rather, the hymn  appears to be set at the dawn sacrifice and to play with the various sources of light
1660 X.190–191
that compete and combine at that time: the sun and the ritual fire, as well as Dawn  (vs. 2ab). The fire, and in part its counterpart the sun, is portrayed as a variety of  animals: a (male) cow (vs. 1), a buffalo (vs. 2), and a bird. The association of speech  with the bird is also found in the Pataṃga hymn (X.177) and probably reflects the  importance of ritual speech at the dawn sacrifice. There are no signs of snakes,  much less their queen.
## 1
This dappled cow has stridden here and sat in front of its mother
and its father, as it goes forth toward the sun.
## 2
She moves within the realms of light, breathing in from his
breathing-out.
The buffalo has looked out across heaven.
## 3
He shines [/rules] over the thirty domains. Speech is established for  the bird
at each dawn and throughout the days.

186 (1012) Vāyu
Ula Vātāyana
3 verses: gāyatrī
As with X.168, although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as  Vāyu, he is only called Vāta “Wind” here. He is credited with the ability to provide  healing (vs. 1) and, in all three verses, to keep us alive and prolong our lifetimes.  This strong association between life and the wind must be mediated through the  latter’s identification (bandhu) with breath, although this identification is not made  explicit in the hymn.
## 1
Let the wind blow hither a remedy, which is luck itself, joy itself, for  our heart.
He will lengthen our lifetimes.
## 2
O Wind, you are father to us, and brother, and comrade to us.
Make us live.
## 3
What deposit of immortality has been deposited yonder in your house,  o Wind,
give us of that for us to live.

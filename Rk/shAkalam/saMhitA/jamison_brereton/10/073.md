Indra
Gaurivīti Śaktyā
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A dense and difficult hymn, with many cryptic allusions to Indra’s birth and some  of his exploits. The Anukramaṇī ascribes it to the same poet as V.29, the first Indra  hymn in the Vth Maṇḍala, and indeed this hymn has links to some of the fragmen tary narratives in the early Indra hymns of V, especially V.30 and 31.
The hymn begins and ends with the birth of Indra; the unusual and difficult  nature of that birth was also the subject of IV.18. In verses 1–2ab it seems that  Indra’s mother was beset with some trouble at the time of his birth. Nonetheless,  he was successfully born but required strengthening by the Maruts. The account  of his birth at the beginning of the hymn is quite straightforward when compared  to the one given in verse 10, where several alternative sources of Indra are sug
gested. The common opinion seems to be that he “came from a (male) horse,”  though “I” (the poet) have a different view. And the last word (or non-word) is  Indra’s: “whence he was born, only Indra knows that.”
The material immediately after the birth story is extremely cryptic, and our  interpretation is quite speculative. We believe that verses 2cd–5ab combine two  motifs: a ritual situation, the early-morning sacrifice, and a mythological one, the  image of Indra as cosmic begetter and tender parent. The dawn ritual is suggested  by the Aśvins’ journey to the sacrifice with Indra (3d, 4b) and the apparent men
tion of early morning in 2d. The mythological material is harder to evaluate and  to bring into a coherent schema. In 2cd it seems that something, quite possibly the  worlds, were covered, perhaps sexually, by a “great foot(print),” and from the dark ness there came embryos, presumably engendered in this encounter. Since Indra’s  feet are mentioned in the next verse (3a), it seems likely that the “great foot” in verse  2 is Indra, covering the worlds and begetting the embryos.
Verse 4 brings us the curious image of Indra with a thousand hyenas in his  mouth. Though Geldner, for example, considers this simply a measure of how big  a mouth Indra has and specifically denies that it has anything to do with the wide spread Brāhmaṇa stories of Indra and the hyenas, this seems disingenuous. Since  the hyena word appears only twice in the R̥gveda and only once in conjunction  with Indra, it seems perverse not to explore the possible connection with these later  tales. The Brāhmaṇa narratives and the light they may shed on this passage are  discussed at length in Jamison (1991: pt 1). Suffice it to say that hyenas carry their  young around in their mouths like cats, and the image here suggests that Indra is  functioning as an attentive parent to his brood. Another aspect of Indra’s parental  role may be found in the next verse (4cd), where Indra “makes fast” thousands in  an otherwise unidentified female: “make fast” seems a reasonable euphemism for  impregnate or implant embryos. This section concerning Indra’s fatherhood seems  to come to an end in 5ab.

After this we turn to Indra’s great deeds, especially the slaying of Namuci (5cd– 7), a deed also treated in the related hymn V.30.7–8. Why the abrupt switch from  Indra as parent to Indra as killer? The answer probably lies in the early-morning  context of this hymn. Indra famously vowed not to kill Namuci by day or by night,  or with a weapon dry or wet. The weapon, according to later accounts, was foam  (also glancingly alluded to in VIII.14.13), and the time of slaughter the morning  twilight—the exact time depicted in the hymn. We also consider the “darkening  mists and darkness” of 5d to be the weapon used for the slaughter (rather than the  later foam), since mist, too, counts neither as wet nor as dry. This mist, diffused like  smoke, though directed at Namuci, settles “even on the two of the same name,”  whom we identify as the Aśvins, mentioned several times previously in the hymn,  who make their journey during the early morning twilight.
Verse 8 summarizes Indra’s accomplishment of his deeds by way of his epi thets and acknowledges the applause of the gods, but it ends (8d) with a cryptic  allusion to another of Indra’s deeds, continued, in our view, in the first pāda of  verse 9. Another tale favored in the early Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V is the chariot  race between Indra and the Sun, in which Indra steals the Sun’s wheel and puts  his chariot in front of the Sun’s, though it had been behind (see, e.g., V.31.11). The  “topsy-turvy” outcome of 8d and the stuck wheel of 9a are suggestive of this myth.  The rest of verse 9 simply celebrates Indra’s fructifying of the plants and animals,  which may remind us of his parental role earlier in the hymn, and with verse 10 we  return to his mysterious birth. In the final verse (11) the poets ask Indra for aid in  their plight.
## 01
You were born as the strong one for powerful might, the gladdening  strongest one with manifold designs.
It was just the Maruts who strengthened Indra then, when his mother,  best at pushing (in childbirth) [/running], was going to set the hero to  running.
## 02
She, even though caressing (him), was sunk down because of the
activities of (demonic?) deceit. They [=Maruts] strengthened Indra
much with their laud.
These (worlds) were as if covered over [/sexually “covered”] by a
great footprint [=Indra]. From the dark, from the early morning,
embryos arose.
## 03
Lofty are your feet when you go forth. The Vājas and whatever (others)  were there strengthened (you).
You, Indra, took a thousand young hyenas in your mouth. You should  turn the Aśvins hither.
## 04
In the same way—swiftly—you drive to the sacrifice; convey the Nāsatyas  hither for fellowship.
Indra, you made fast thousands in the wife of the good one
[=impregnated her?]; the Aśvins gave bounties, o champion. 5. Becoming exhilarated, to produce progeny from truth, Indra (went) to  the goal with his vigorous comrades.
Because with these (wiles of his) he came right up to the Dasyu
[=Namuci], to his wiles, he scattered forth darkening mists and
darkness.
## 06
You sent the smoke for him [=Namuci] down even on the two of the  same name [=Aśvins]; you smashed (him) down, Indra, like the cart
of Dawn.
You went with your lofty, avid comrades; at one blow you smashed his  heart’s foundations.
## 07
You smote Namuci who sought combat, rendering the Dāsa without  wiles, for the seer.
You made the paths comfortable for Manu, as if they went straightaway  to the gods.
## 08
You have fulfilled your names completely; showing mastery, you have  taken (them) in your fist.
The gods cheer you on in your vast power. You turned the wooden
things [=chariots?] topsy-turvy,
## 09
When his wheel was sunk down in the waters. And that should seem  just honey to him,
the udder bound tight onto the earth, the milk that you placed in the  cows and in the plants.
## 10
When they say, “he came from a horse,” I think of him rather as born  from strength:
he came from (battle) fervor; he stayed in a secure house [=womb?]. But  whence he was born, (only) Indra knows that.
## 11
The fine-feathered birds have flocked to Indra—the Priyamedhas, seers  in need.
Open up the dark (place); fill our eye. Free us who are bound as if by  a snare.

To a Dead Man
Yamī
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn has a parallel in the Atharvaveda (XVIIII.2.14–18), where it is found  among the funeral verses, and in the ritual sūtras it is used at the burning of the  corpse. Each verse describes the character and habits of the distinguished fore fathers now resident in the other world, and ends with a refrain urging the dead  man to go and join them there.
## 01
Soma purifies himself for some; others reverently approach ghee.
Those for whom honey flows forth—right to them let him go now.
## 02
Those who were unassailable because of their fervor, who have gone to  the sun because of their fervor,
who have made their own fervor into greatness—right to them let him  go now.
## 03
Those who fight in prize-contests, who as champions abandon their  bodies,
or who confer a thousand priestly gifts—right to them let him go now. 4. Also those ancients who were servers of truth, truthful, strong
through truth,
the forefathers full of fervor, o Yama—right to them let him go now.
## 05
The poets of a thousand devices who protect the sun,
the seers full of fervor, o Yama—to those born of fervor let him go now.

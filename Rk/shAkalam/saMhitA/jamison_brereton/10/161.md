161 (987) Against Disease
Yakṣṃanāśana Prājāpatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 5
With Atharvaveda parallels (AVŚ III.11.1–4, VIII.1.20; AVP I.62), this charm  announces the restoration to life, indeed long life, of a man who has succumbed to  some disease or other (vs. 1).
## 1
I release you, with an oblation, to living, from the unknown disease, from  the kingly disease.
Or if a Grabber has truly grabbed him in this way, from her, o Indra and  Agni, release him.
## 2
If his lifetime is exhausted, or he is (already) departed, or if he has just  gone down to the face of death,
I bring him here from the lap of Dissolution. I have redeemed him for a  hundred autumns.
## 3
With an oblation with a thousand eyes, conferring a hundred autumns  and a hundred lifetimes, I have brought him here,
so that Indra will lead him through a hundred autumns to the far shore  of all difficult going.
## 4
Live in strength for a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a  hundred springs.
For a hundred (years) let Indra and Agni, Savitar, and Br̥haspati restore  him, with an oblation conferring a hundred lifetimes.
## 5
I have brought you here; I have found you. You have come here again, o  you who are new again.
O you with hale limbs, I have found your eye hale and your
lifetime whole.

Indra (1–2, 4), Assorted Divinities (3)
Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni
4 verses: jagatī
A fairly conventional invitation to the soma sacrifice. One of Indra’s great deeds,  the conquering of the sun, is alluded to (vss. 1–2), and already in verse 1 he is asked  for wealth. The final verse is spoken by Indra himself, who accepts both the soma  and the praise while recognizing that he is entitled to these offerings only if he  provides good things in return. One noteworthy feature is the poet-priest’s claim to  have himself consumed copious amounts of soma (vs. 4).

## 01
This honey is poured around for you, Indra: you rule over the tub of  pressed soma.
Make for us wealth consisting of many heroes. Having heated up your  heat all around, you conquered the sun.
## 02
The conqueror of the sun who finds great exhilaration in the soma-stalk  do we call here to the pressings—the all-around able one.
Take notice of this sacrifice of ours here. Come here! We beseech the  bounteous one who conquers his opponents.
## 03
Under the ordinance of King Soma and King Varuṇa and under the  protection of Br̥haspati and Anumati,
today at our praise invocation of you, bounteous one, I consumed tubs  (of soma), you establisher and regulator.
## 04
[Indra:] Urged on, I have done my own consuming at the vat, and as the  foremost patron, I sweep up this praise song,
if at the pressing I have come back to you two, Viśvāmitra and
Jamadagni, in your house with the winnings.

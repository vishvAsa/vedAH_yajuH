4 verses: jagatī, except āstārapaṅkti 4
This hymn celebrates the god Sun, or more specifically his light, in terms more usu ally applied to heroic warrior-gods like Indra.
## 1
Let the lofty (light) blazing forth drink the somian honey, imparting an  unswerving lifetime on the lord of the sacrifice—
he who, sped by the wind, stands guard by himself, he fosters the
creatures; he rules [/shines] widely in many places.
## 2
The lofty (light) blazing forth, well supported, best winner of prizes, real,  is fitted into the foundation, the buttress of heaven.
Smasher of foes, smasher of obstacles, best smasher of Dasyus, the light  has been born, the smasher of lords, smasher of rivals.
## 3
Here is the fairest, the highest light of lights: the lofty one is called  all-conquering, wealth-conquering.
The all-blazing, greatly blazing Sun spreads his broad might, his
unshakeable strength to be seen.
## 4
Flashing forth with your light, as the Sun you went to the luminous  realm of heaven,
you by whom all these worlds are supported here, you who accomplish  all work, who possess all that is proper for gods.

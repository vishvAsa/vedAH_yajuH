Indra
Devajāmaya Indramātaraḥ
5 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn presents a tender image of unidentified females rocking  the baby Indra, and verse 2 continues with a more conventional treatment of his  birth. But the birth motif disappears (except for an attenuated version in vs. 5c): the  hymn then continues with standard praise of his powers—the word ójas “might” is  positioned prominently in four of the five verses (2–5).
## 01
Rocking (him), the busy women attend upon the new-born Indra,
receiving (him) as their share of the abundance of heroes.
## 02
You, Indra, were born from power, from strength, from might.
You, bull, are really a bull.
## 03
You, Indra, are the smasher of Vr̥tra. You spread out the midspace. You propped up heaven with your might.
## 04
You, Indra, carry in your arms the chant for joint enjoyment,
while sharpening your mace with your might.
## 05
You, Indra, dominate all created things by your might.
You came into being throughout all the worlds.

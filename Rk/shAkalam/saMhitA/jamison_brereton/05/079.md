79 (433) Dawn
Satyaśravas Ātreya
10 verses: paṅkti
A hymn with a remarkably unwavering focus on material gain. Since the priestly gifts  (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the dawn ritual, the goddess Dawn is often associated

with wealth and giving, but here very little attention is given to any other aspect of  the goddess. The tone is set by the increasingly monotonous refrain: “o well-born  lady, liberal with horses.” Several patrons are named in the first verses (1–3), and the  poet hopes that patrons in general will be the recipients of Dawn’s bounty, in order  for them to redistribute it to the poets (4–8).
The usual attention to Dawn’s beauty, her first appearance, her journey, her  cows, and so forth is entirely missing in this hymn, which does, however, con tain one striking image, in verse 9. Why a laggard Dawn would be compared  to a thief isn’t entirely clear, but it is quite possibly because thieves worked  at night.
## 1
Awaken us today for great wealth, o Dawn, as heaven-bright one,
just as you also awakened us at Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 2
You who dawned forth at Sunītha Śaucadratha’s, o Daughter of Heaven, dawn forth at the mightier Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 3
As one bringing goods hither, dawn forth for us today, o Daughter of  Heaven—
you who dawned forth at the mightier Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 4
The (oblation-)conveyors who greet you with praises, far-radiant one— those very splendid ones (will become) possessed of gifts and lovely  presents, through your bounties, o bounteous one
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 5
For whenever these throngs appear to you (fit) for the giving of bounties, eager, they surround those who give immoderate benefit [=patrons]
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 6
Upon them confer glory in heroes, bounteous Dawn—upon the patrons, who, bounteous (themselves), have granted us immoderate benefits
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 7
To them bring lofty brilliance and glory, o bounteous Dawn,
to the patrons who apportion to us benefits consisting of horses
and cows
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 8
And bring to us refreshments along with cows, o Daughter of Heaven, simultaneously with the rays of the sun, with his glittering,
gleaming beams
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 9
Dawn forth, Daughter of Heaven. Don’t keep dragging out your work  over a long time,
lest the sun scorch you with his beam as (he might) a swindling thief – o well-born lady, liberal with horses. 10. So much you ought to give, o Dawn, or more—
you who, as you dawn, far-radiant one, do not dwindle for the praisers – o well-born lady, liberal with horses.

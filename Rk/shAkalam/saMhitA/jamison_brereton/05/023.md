23 (377) Agni
Dyumna Viśvacarṣaṇi Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4
This hymn invokes the fire that grants wealth, especially a wealth of cattle (vs. 2),  which brings with it dominance over surrounding lands. At the same time the ability  of Agni to grant wealth and power also depends on the sacrificers who bring the  ritual grass (3a), who establish Agni as their Hotar (3c), and whose words confer  power on him (1d). The references to the tribes who pursue Agni (vs. 3) and to  Agni himself as the one “who belongs to all lands” (vs. 4) suggest that the fire of  this hymn either was or was at least compared to the common fire that united the  various Ārya peoples.
## 1
O Agni, bring here wealth that is overpowering through the power of  your brilliance
and that, with prizes at stake, will be powerful over the lands by means  of my mouth [=my speech].
## 2
O powerful Agni, bring here that wealth overpowering in battles,
for you are the real and infallible giver of the prize that brings cattle. 3. For, with their ritual grass twisted, all the tribes as one
pursue you as their cherished Hotar in your seats [=fire places] for the  sake of many desirable things.
## 4
For as always, that one who belongs to all lands acquires power against  evil intents.
O Agni, here in these dwellings shine richly for us, o blazing one, shine  brilliantly, o pure one.

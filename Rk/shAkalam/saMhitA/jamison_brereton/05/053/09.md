Let not the Rasā (River), the Anitabhā, the Kubhā, the Krumu, let not  the Sindhu bring you to a halt.
Let not the overflowing Sarayu hem you around. On us alone let your  favor be. 10. Your troop of chariots, the glittering Marut flock of newer (“hymns”  [=thunderclaps])
do the rains come following after.

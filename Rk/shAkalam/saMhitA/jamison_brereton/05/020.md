Agni
Prayasvanta Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh
As in the previous hymn and the three that follow, the name of the poet has been  extracted from the hymn itself, in this case from práyasvant “bringing pleasing offer ings” in verse 3. The dominant theme is the songs, which are explicitly mentioned in  every verse except verse 2, and even there they are probably the understood object  in ab. Verse 2 is the most interesting in the hymn because it is not clear to whom the  poet refers. It sounds as though the people he criticizes are rival poets, who have  prospered through Agni, but who are in some way not acting or not performing the  ritual properly now.
## 01
The wealth that even you hold in regard, o Agni, best winner of
victory’s prize,
that yokemate of ours I will extol with songs as worthy of fame among  the gods. 2. O Agni, those grown strong by your mighty power who do not send  (songs)
(to keep) away hatred, away crookedness, follow (the commandments) of  one who is under the commandments of others.
## 03
We choose you, o Agni, as our Hotar, ensuring success for our skill. Bringing pleasing offerings, we summon with our song the one who is  first in the sacrifices.
## 04
As (we strive) in this way for your help day after day, o powerful one, for wealth and for truth, o you of strong will, we your feasting
companions would be united with cattle and we would be united with  heroes.

Indra
Atri Bhauma
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
As was already noted, this hymn is paired with V.38, sharing some vocabulary and  themes, but this one is more coherent in both syntax and thought. The first three  verses urge Indra to give in abundance, while in the last two (4–5) the poet urges his  fellow Atris to praise the god.
## 01
What is given by you in profusion, bright Indra, possessor of the stone, that largesse bring here to us with both hands full, you finder of goods. 2. What you consider worthy to be chosen, that heaven-ruling thing bring  here, Indra.
Might we know you as the unbounded (ocean) for giving.
## 03
Your thought, famed and lofty, which is eager to give, should be realized. With it split apart even the strongholds for plunder to win, possessor of  the stone.
## 04
Most bounteous of bounteous ones, the king of the settled domains, Indra (do I call) nearby for you [=Atris?] to eulogize. He takes pleasure  in the hymns as well as the many (eulogies).
## 05
Just for him a poet’s speech, for Indra a solemn word worthy to be  pronounced;
for him whose vehicle is the sacred formulation the Atris strengthen their  hymns, the Atris beautify their hymns.

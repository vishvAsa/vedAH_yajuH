Only fourteen of the eighty-seven hymns of the maṇḍala are attributed or alter nately attributed to Atri himself (V.27, 37–43, 76–77, 83–86). The majority of the  hymns were composed by Ātreyas, descendants of Atri, thirty-six of whom are  mentioned by the Anukramaṇī in Maṇḍala V.  In the Anukramaṇī’s reckoning,  only three of the Ātreyas—Vasuśruta (3–6), Sutambhara (11–14), and Śyāvāśva  (52–59, 81–82)—composed more than one or two hymns, and only Atri himself,  Śyāvāśva, and Avasyu Ātreya (31, 75) provided hymns to more than one deity or  set of deities in this book. Unlike, for example, Maṇḍala III, the Viśvāmitra Family  Book, the eponymous poet is thus not the major poet of Maṇḍala V. Rather, Atri  is principally an ancestor, perhaps a fairly distant one, of a large family of poets.  Atri appears as a figure in hymns by Ātreyas (2, 7, 15, 73, 74, 78) and in one hymn  of his own (40), sometimes in reference to narratives associated with him, such  as his rescue by the Aśvins (73.6, 78.4) or Atri’s restoration of the sun (40.6–8).  In final verses poets occasionally refer to themselves and their people as “Atris”  (22.4, 39.5, 40.9, 67.5)—a plural that only occurs in the Vth Maṇḍala. In addition  to Atri and Ātreyas, there are other poets from families connected to the Atris in  some way. Among them are Āṅgirasa poets, to whom two hymns (15, 35) are attrib uted. The Āṅgirasa poets are one of the two dominant families in VIII, which also  contains seven hymns ascribed to Ātreya poets (or in the case of VIII.91, a female  [Ātreyī] poet). The presence of Āṅgirasa poets in V and of Ātreya poets in VIII  points to the close connection between Atri poets and the Kāṇvas and Āṅgirasas.  Geographically, the Atris ranged broadly from the rivers in the northwest, includ ing the Kabul (Kubhā) and Kurram (Krumu) rivers, extending to the Yamunā in the  east. Strikingly, it is the same poet, Śyāvāśva, who mentions rivers in the northwest  (53.9) and the Yamunā (52.17).
The Atris and their associates address a broader range of deities in their hymns  than do many of the other poetic families. The distribution is as follows:  Agni  (1–28), Indra (29–40), the All Gods (41–51), the Maruts (52–61), Mitra and Varuṇa  (62–72), the Aśvins (73–78), Dawn (79–80), Savitar (81–82), Parjanya (83), Earth  (84), Varuṇa (85), Indra and Agni (86), and the Maruts (87). The last hymn, which  returns to the Maruts, is an addition to the original collection and unusual in a  number of respects. Metrically it is in a long lyric meter, and thematically it features  an unusual pairing of the Maruts with Viṣṇu.
660 V.1
The Atri Maṇḍala contains a noteworthy collection of hymns to the All Gods  (41–51). A number of these feature riddles and verbal play, but none is as challeng ing as V.44, which Geldner called the most difficult hymn in the R̥gveda. The hymn  does not name the god or gods it praises, but the very last verse mentions Agni and  Soma, leaving the hearer to divine what the rest of the hymn is about. Complicating  that task are lexical, syntactic, and morphological puzzles, ellipses without obvious  resolution, and, above all, a likely dual reference that points to the mystery at the  heart of the hymn.
The Marut cycle attributed to Śyāvāśva Ātreya (52–61) contains the longest  sequence of hymns dedicated to these gods in the R̥gveda and is a remark ably exciting and satisfying achievement. Other hymns of note include two  hymns to gods of the natural world, V.80 to Dawn and V.83 to Parjanya, the  Thunderstorm. The first is the most famous and certainly one of the most beau tiful of the hymns to Dawn in the R̥gveda, famed for its sensual portrayal of  Dawn as a beautiful woman revealing herself to men. The latter is an energetic  picture of the storm god, roaring loudly and flooding the earth. The rains are a  constant theme in a number of the strongest hymns in this collection, including  V.54, which vividly describes the Maruts and the storms they bring, and V.63,  which rumbles repeated sounds in its praise of Mitra and Varuṇa as masters  of the monsoons. The single hymn to Varuṇa in this collection, V.85, presents  both a grand vision of the god as the creator of the world and a more intimate  one of Varuṇa as a god who can forgive offenses and free people from them.  In general, the Atri poets were at their best in describing natural phenomena,  especially thunderstorms, which they both fervently desire and fear because of  their power.
## 1 (355) Agni
Budha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn describes the kindling and birth of Agni in the morning rite. In the  middle section of the hymn, the poet links verses by repeating an image from the  second hemistich in the opening hemistich of the next verse. So in 4d and 5a Agni  as a horse is born “at the beginning of days,” although in verse 4 this may be Agni  as the sun, while in verse 5 Agni is clearly the sacrificial fire. Note the difference in  color: the horse is “gleaming” or “white” in verse 4, but “ruddy” in verse 5. The  poet almost repeats 5d in 6a, except that he has shifted the tense in 6d to a more dis
tant past indicating the passage of time between the verses. More loosely, in 6c Agni  is a sage poet (kaví) and in 7a an “inspired” poet (vípra). In 7d the priests “groom”  (mr̥janti) Agni, imagined as a horse, and in 8a “fit to be groomed, he is groomed”  (mārjālyò mr̥jyate). In 8d Agni is ahead (prá √as) of other fires and in 9a he goes  ahead (prá √i) of other sacrificers. Though a common metaphor, the image of Agni as a horse or a chariot-driver  is treated with originality. Most strikingly, in verse 3, instead of the priests awaken ing Agni, Agni awakens the hymn, “the bridle” (raśanā́) of the horse that pulls the  chariot, the sacrifice itself, while the dakṣiṇā, the sacrificial reward to the priests, is  the horse. The end of the verse shifts to the metaphor of Agni as a growing child.  The word for “tongues” of flame, juhū́, can also mean a sacrificial ladle, and this  ambiguity is the basis for the ellipsis of the noun.
1. Agni has awakened by the kindling wood of the peoples in response to  Dawn, approaching like a milk-cow.
Like young (birds) rising toward a branch, his radiant beams leap forth  to heaven’s vault.
2. The Hotar has awakened to sacrifice to the gods. Benevolent Agni has  stood tall in the early morning.
As he is kindled, his brightening face has become visible. The great god  has become free from darkness.
3. When he has awakened the bridle [=the hymn] of the (priestly) troop,  blazing Agni is anointed with blazing cows [=milk].
Then Reward is harnessed, racing toward the prize. Tall, with his tongues  he suckled upon her [=the Ladle], who is stretched out.
4. Toward Agni the thoughts of those seeking the gods converge, like eyes  upon the sun.
When Dawn and Night, differing in color, give birth to him, the
gleaming prizewinning steed is born at the beginning of days.
5. Since the thoroughbred has been born at the beginning of days—the  ruddy one has been laid upon the laid wood—
laying seven treasures in every house, Agni has taken his seat as the  Hotar, the superior sacrificer.
6. Agni took his seat as the Hotar, the superior sacrificer, in the lap of his  mother, in the wide, sweet-smelling place [=the altar]—
he, the young poet, outstanding among many, truth-possessing, the  maintainer of the peoples, and kindled in their midst.
7. Now they summon forth this inspired one bringing success in the rites,  Agni the Hotar, with their acts of reverence.
They groom with ghee their own prizewinning steed, who stretches
through the two world-halves by truth.
8. Fit to be groomed, he is groomed in his own (house) as master of the  house, praised by poets, our kind guest.
A bull of a thousand horns and having its power, o Agni, you are ahead  of all the other (fires) by your strength.
9. At once, Agni, you go ahead beyond the other (sacrificers), for him to  whom you have become manifest as the most beloved,
as one to be summoned, to be marveled at, far radiant, the dear guest of  the clans of the sons of Manu.
662 V.2
10. To you, o youngest Agni, the peoples bring tribute from near and far. Attend to the favor of the most fortunate (sacrificer)! Lofty and great is  your propitious shelter, o Agni.
11. Today mount your radiant chariot, o radiant Agni, that is shared with  the (gods), fit recipients of sacrifice.
Knowing the paths, convey the gods here across the wide midspace for  them to consume the offerings.
12. We have spoken an extolling speech to the wise poet, the
bull-strong bull.
With reverence Gaviṣṭhira has rested his praise song in Agni, as if
resting the wide-spreading golden disk in heaven.
## 2 (356) Agni
Kumāra Ātreya or Vr̥śa Jāna or both
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 12
Geldner provides a long introduction to this hymn and concludes that it deals with  the disappearance of the fire-god Agni as if he were a household or ritual fire that  has suddenly gone out or a newly churned or kindled fire that does not emerge.  More specifically, we suggest, it may have been composed as a prāyaścitti or expia
tion for a sacrificial fire that has gone out as offerings were poured into it and to  accompany a rite of restoring the fire.
In verses 1–2 the hidden child is Agni. The young mother (vs. 1) and wet nurse  (vs. 2) could be the firewood (samídh fem.) that keeps the fire hidden, and the chief  wife, the máhiṣī, who gave birth to Agni, may be a fire-churning stick (aráṇī fem.).  Yet in verse 1 the poet assures himself that Agni will emerge and take his ritual  place to the east as he usually does. The poet sees Agni far away from his place  in the rite (vss. 3–4), but who is this Agni? Is he other fires, or, as we think more  likely, the sun, moving from the east toward the west? Verse 5 offers syntactic chal
lenges—the masculine yéṣām and the sense of ná ... cid—but the cattle or bulls of  Agni that it mentions may be the flames (arká or arcí masc.?) that the poets hopes  the god will drive to the sacrificial place. Agni should find release from the powers  who would deny the fire to the poet and his peoples (vs. 6), and thus should release  the sacrificers from whatever limits them (vs. 7). However, Agni has departed the  sacrificial place in anger—a fact that one of the gods, perhaps Indra or Varuṇa  or conceivably even Agni himself, has made plain. But Indra knows where Agni  is and has guided the sacrificers so that they may recover him (vs. 8). Ultimately,  nothing can keep Agni from the sacrificers, as the presence of Agni as the sun in  heaven shows (vss. 9–10), and he will honor the command of the gods to help the  sacrificer (vs. 12).
Geldner also summarizes a narrative later connected to this hymn, mentioned  in Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa XIII 3.12, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa III 94, Br̥haddevatā V 12–23 and given also by Sāyaṇa. According to the version of the Br̥haddevatā, King  Tryaruṇa was riding in a chariot driven by his purohita Vr̥śa Jāna. A brahmin boy  was killed by the chariot, and the king blamed the purohita. Vr̥śa brought the boy  back to life, but then stormed away in anger because of the king’s accusation. When  the purohita departed, however, so did the fury of the king’s sacrificial fire and with  it the ability of the fire to cook the oblations. Therefore the king went to Vr̥śa and  persuaded him to return as his purohita and to restore the fire’s fury. When he came  back, Vr̥śa found that a Piśācī woman in the king’s house had taken the fury of the  king’s fire. But by reciting V.2.9 Vr̥śa caused the fury to return and to burn the Piśācī woman. As Geldner rightly concludes, this story draws on elements of the hymn,  but the hymn is surely not based on it.
1. In secret the young mother carries the child who is swaddled; she does  not give him to his father.
His face is not one that changes (its face): the peoples see it in front, set  down in the circle of spokes.
2. Young woman, who is this child whom you carry as his wet nurse? The  chief wife has given birth to him,
for the embryo grew strong through many autumns, and I saw him
(newly) born, when his mother bore him.
3. I saw him with golden teeth and flaming color far away from his  homeland, showing the measure of his weapons,
as I gave to him my immortal (soma) without impurity. What can those  without Indra, without recitations, do to me?
4. I saw him moving from his homeland into the distance, going in beauty  in many ways like a herd (moving) together.
They did not keep hold of him. Because he has been born, the young  women become gray.
5. Who will keep my little young blood separate from the cattle, which have  never had a stranger as their herdsman?
They who have kept hold of him, let them release him. The watchful one  will drive the animals to us.
6. Hostilities have set down the king of dwellings, the dwelling place of the  peoples, among mortals.
Let the formulations of Atri release him. Let them who scorn become  those to be scorned.
7. You loosed even Śunaḥśepa, who was bound, from his thousand (bonds),  from the sacrificial post, since he exhausted himself (in sacrifice).
So unloose the fetters from us, o Agni, watchful Hotar, after having  taken your seat here.
8. Because, becoming angry, you had gone from me, the protector of the  commandments of the gods announced (that) to me.
Because the knowing Indra has kept you in his sights, instructed by him  have I come here, o Agni.664 V.3
9. Agni radiates in all directions with a lofty light. He makes visible all  things by his greatness.
He overpowers ungodly guiles and those of evil ways. He sharpens his  horns to pierce through the demonic.
10. And in heaven let there be the roars of Agni with their sharp weapons  to smash the demonic.
Even in his elation his (furious) radiance breaks forth. Ungodly
evasions will not hinder him.
11. This praise song for you, o you who are powerfully born, have I, the  inspired poet, fashioned as a clever artisan (fashions) a chariot.
If, Agni, you will gladly receive that very (song), o god, thereby we
would win the waters together with the sun.
12. “The bull of powerful neck, having become full-grown, will drive  together unchallenged the possessions of the stranger,”
thus the immortals have spoken to this Agni here. He will offer
protection to Manu bearing ritual grass; he will offer protection to
Manu bearing offerings.
## 3 (357) Agni
Vasuśruta Ātreya
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn opens with identifications of Agni with the Ādityas—Varuṇa and  Mitra in verse 1 and Aryaman and Mitra in verse 2. The reason for these identi fications is not immediately clear, and indeed in various ways the poet also mar shals the presence of other gods: Indra in verse 1, the Maruts, Viṣṇu, and Rudra  in verse 3, and all the gods again in verse 1. After invoking the presence of the  gods, the poet then describes the installation of the sacrificial fire (vss. 4–5). In  verses 6–7 he asks that the presence of the sacrificial fire also mark the presence  of Agni’s help against those who are offending against his people and himself.  He mentions evil speech (vs. 7) and curses brought against its speaker (vss. 7,  12)  and also against thieves and cheats (vs. 11)  threatening him. He therefore  asks the god for rescue (vs. 9). This concern explains the prominence of the  Ādityas at the beginning of the hymn, since they are the gods who oversee social  relations among humans and therefore can protect against people who seek to  harm others.
1. You, o Agni, are Varuṇa when you are born. You become Mitra when  you are kindled.
In you are the all the gods, o son of strength. You are Indra for the pious  mortal.
2. You become Aryaman when you belong to young girls (at marriage). You  bear a secret name, o you of independent will. They anoint (you as) Mitra with cows [=milk/butter], like a
well-established (ally), when you make the lord and lady of the
household to be of one mind.
3. For your splendor the Maruts groomed themselves, o Rudra, when you  came to beloved, shimmering birth.
The track of Viṣṇu that was set down as the highest, by that you protect  the secret name of the cows.
4. By the splendor of you (who are lovely to see), the gods are lovely to  see, o god. Receiving many things for themselves, they serve the
immortal one.
The fire-priests have seated Agni as the Hotar of Manu, giving homage  to him as the “Recitation of Āyu.”
5. No ancient Hotar was a better sacrificer than you, o Agni. There is no  one higher in poetic arts, o you of independent will.
One belonging to the clan of which you will become a guest will
vanquish mortals through the sacrifice, o god.
6. Helped by you, o Agni, we would vanquish mortals—we, striving after  goods and awakening with our offering;
we, in the competition and in the ritual distributions of the days; we,  with our wealth, o son of strength.
7. The one who will bring offense or blame against us—all of you: set evil  upon him, the speaker of evil.
O watchful Agni, smash this curse (of him) who harms us with
duplicity.
8. At the dawning of this (dawn), o god, the ancients, making you their  messenger, offered you sacrifice with oblations,
when, o Agni, you speed amid the gathering of riches as the god being  kindled by mortals and by the good (gods).
9. Fight! since you know how. Rescue your father [=the priest], who  considers himself your son, o son of strength!
Watchful one, when will you look toward us? O Agni, when will you,  perceiving the truth, take your place?
10. Your father sets many names (on you) as he sings praises, good one, if  you will find pleasure in this.
Desiring this, Agni will gain (divine) favor (for us) with the strength of  a god, having become full grown, will he not?
11. Certainly, o youngest Agni, carry the singer beyond all difficulties. Thieves have appeared and cheating peoples. Devious ones of unknown  intention have come.
12. These pleas have come toward you, or rather this very offense has been  spoken to (you), the good one.
Having become full grown, this Agni here will not betray us to the curse  nor to him doing harm.

## 4 (358) Agni
Vasuśruta Ātreya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
In this hymn the poet sets forth what we—the poet and the other sacrificers—will  do and receive within the frame of what Agni, typically addressed in the 2nd  person, will accomplish. The poet draws attention to “we” and “you” by front ing the personal pronouns and using their non-enclitic forms. He announces this  strategy in the first verse, which begins with tvā́m “you,” and then the following  verses largely describe Agni as the sacrificial fire, who conveys the oblations to  the gods (vs. 2) and the gods to the oblations (vs. 4). Verses 5 and especially 6, the  omphalos verse, mark a thematic movement from the sacrificial fire that serves  the gods to the fire that mortals serve and that serves mortals. In verse 7 the first  word of each pāda and in verse 8 the first word of each hemistich is “we” or “us.”  Enclitic and non-enclitic forms of the 1st-person plural pronoun also occur in  verses 9 and 10, and in verse 10 the poet personalizes the verse even more deeply  by using 1st-person singular verbs:  jóhavīmi “I repeatedly invoke” and aśyām
“may I attain.” The last verse abandons the 1st person altogether, instead refer ring to the recipient of Agni’s favor as “he,” and with tvám “you” in the first  pāda, it returns to the initial focus on Agni.
1. In you, o Agni, goods-lord of goods, I find elation at the rites, o king. Through you we would win victory’s prize, racing to the prize. We would  prevail against the battle-charges of mortals.
2. Conveying our oblations, unaging Agni is our father, the one
far-reaching, far-radiant, and lovely to see among us.
Illuminate fully the refreshments of a well-run household. Mete out full  measures of fame in our direction.
3. The poet of the clans, the clanlord of the (clans) of the sons of Manu,  blazing, purifying, ghee-backed Agni—
him have you all installed as the Hotar knowing all things. He will win  desirable rewards among the gods.
4. Take pleasure, o Agni, along with the libation, aligning with the rays of  the sun.
Take pleasure in our kindling wood, o Jātavedas, and convey the gods  here to eat the oblations.
5. As the pleasing lord of the house and the guest in the home, journey to  this our sacrifice since you are the knowing one.
Having smashed to pieces all attacks, o Agni, bring here the sustenance  of those challenging us.
6. With your weapon send the Dasyu into hiding, while creating vigor for  your own body,
and thus protect us when the prize is at stake, o Agni, best of men, since  you bring the gods safely across, o child of strength. 7. We would do you honor, o Agni, with our recitations; we, with our  oblations, o pure one of auspicious flame.
For us speed wealth that fulfills all wishes; for us grant all goods.
8. Take pleasure in our rite, o Agni, son of strength with three abodes, and  in our oblation.
May we be those acting rightly toward the gods. Protect us by your
shelter with its three defenses.
9. Carry us across all difficult depths and difficult ways, o Jātavedas, as if  across a river by a boat.
O Agni, being sung with reverence as if by Atri, become the helper of  our bodies.
10. Thinking with a simple heart, I, a mortal, who repeatedly invoke you,  an immortal—
among us grant glory, o Jātavedas. May I attain immortality through  offspring, o Agni.
11. For whom you will make a wide, comfortable place, o Jātavedas, since  he acts rightly toward you, o Agni,
he will attain a wealth of horses, sons, heroes, and cattle for his
well-being.

Vasuśruta Ātreya
11 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn follows the usual sequence of the Āprī litany, although it omits the normal  explicit reference to the barhis, the ritual grass, in verse 4. Until the very end of the  hymn, the poet uses the imperative except in verse 2, which has the subjunctive, and  in verse 6, in which he announces that he is beseeching Evening and Dawn but does  not directly state what he wishes to occur. However, he implies a request for strength  by calling the two deities vayovŕ̥dh “increasing vigor.” The last verse, however, shows  a decided shift that is signaled by the complete absence of a verb. Through the repeti tion of the ritual call svā́hā, the verse marks the moment at which the priest makes  the offering that should culminate or accomplish all the things urged before.
1. To the well-kindled flame offer sharp ghee,
to Agni Jātavedas.
2. The undeceivable Narāśaṃsa will sweeten this sacrifice,
for he is the poet with honey in his hands.
3. When invoked, o Agni, convey here dear shimmering Indra
with his easy running chariots, to help us.
4. Having the softness of wool, spread widely, (o ritual grass): the chants  have cried out to you.
Be here to win gain for us, beautiful one.
668 V.6
5. Divine doors, gape open, giving easy access to help us.
Fill the sacrifice, further and further.
6. The two of beautiful appearance, increasing vigor, the young mothers  of truth,
Evening and Dawn—them we beseech.
7. On the wind’s flight let the two divine Hotars of Manu, being invoked, come to this our sacrifice.
8. Iḍā, Sarasvatī, and Mahī, the three goddesses who are joy itself— let them, unfailing, sit upon the ritual grass.
9. Tvaṣṭar, come here as the kind one, far-ranging in the prosperity (you  bring), and in your own person
help us at every sacrifice.
10. Where you know, o Lord of the Forest, to be the hidden names of the gods, there make our oblations go.
11. Svāhā to Agni and to Varuṇa, svāhā to Indra and to the Maruts, svāhā to the gods—the offering!
## 6 (360) Agni
Vasuśruta Ātreya
10 verses: paṅkti
The hymn is dominated by references to prizewinning horses. In verse 3 Agni gives  the prizewinner, which may be Agni himself. In pāda d of the verse, therefore, the  one who “journeys to what is valued” is Agni both as a god retrieving the reward  for the sacrificers and as a metaphoric horse racing to the prize. Again in verse 7  Agni’s flames are horses and the prize toward which they strive is cattle, first men
tioned in verse 1, along with horses. Allusion to horses is indirect in verse 10, but in  10ab the priests “guide” Agni—assuming with Geldner and Renou that ajuryamur is haplology for ajuryáṃ yamur—as they might guide a horse. Then in d they hope  for an “abundance of heroes and this abundance of swift horses.” There are various  possible explanations for why the poet speaks of tyád “this” abundance. One is that  there is a comparison between the horses they hope to gain and Agni’s flames imag ined as horses. If so, then “this abundance” would mean an abundance of horses  equivalent to the present abundance of flames.
1. I think of Agni, who is the good one, to whom milk-cows go home, swift chargers (go) home, and our own prizewinners (go) home.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
2. He is Agni, who is sung as the good one, whom the milk-cows approach  together,
the fast-running chargers (approach) together, and well-born patrons  (approach) together.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers. 3. Since Agni, who belongs to all domains, gives the prizewinner [=Agni?]  to the clan,
(since) Agni (gives the prizewinner) that is very ready for wealth, when  pleased, he journeys to what is valued.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
4. Agni, here would we kindle your brilliant and unaging (flame), o god, so that this your kindling stick, admired more, will shine in heaven.
– Bring here refreshment for the praise singers.
5. Agni, for you the offering is poured here, accompanied by our verse, o  lord of the glistening flame,
beautifully shimmering, wondrous clanlord, and conveyor of oblations. – Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
6. And these fires are at the forefront among fires. They foster everything  of value.
They hasten it; they speed it; they drive it onward in proper order.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
7. These flames of yours, o Agni, are greatly arrogant prizewinners, which, by the soaring of their hooves, dart toward the double
enclosures of the cows.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
8. Agni, bring the new ones here to us, the praise singers—(those)  refreshments and good settlements.
We would be those who have recited verses, those having you as our  messenger in every house.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
9. O you who are beautifully shimmering, you make the two spoonsful of  melted butter ready within your mouth,
and so you should fill us (with plenty) at our hymns, o lord of
vast power.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
10. Thus they *have guided the *unaging Agni with songs and sacrifices in  proper order.
He will grant to us an abundance of heroes and this abundance of swift  horses.
– Bring refreshment for the praise singers.
## 7 (361) Agni
Iṣa Ātreya
10 verses: anuṣtubh, except paṅkti 10
At the beginning (vss. 1–3) the poet repeats the word sám “together” alone or in  compounds. The first pāda draws particular attention to the word with its repetition
670 V.7
of sa(m): sákhāyaḥ sáṃ vaḥ samyáñcam. In the middle verses (4, 5, 7, 8) sám is  echoed by the particle smā/sma “again,” or more exactly “as always.” The last verse  (10) is in a different meter, and, marked by its opening íti “with these words,” it  stands outside of the main body of the poem. The real concluding verse, therefore,  is verse 9, in which sám is echoed again, this time by śám “luck.” The one verse  in which neither sám nor one of its echo words occurs (6) is actually a dependent  clause that is completed by verses 7–8. The sound repetitions thematically link the  union (sám) of both the priests and the offerings, the return of Agni (sma/smā), and  finally the good luck (śám) that the sacrifice will bring to Agni and the benefit that  Agni will bring to both gods and humans.
As mentioned above, the poet extends a statement across three verses (6–8).  This highly unusual construction marks the climax of the hymn, which describes  the moment when Agni “streams forth.” Indeed, the extended statement even  iconically suggests the extension of the sacrificial fire as it creeps throughout  the wood. However, this strategy creates challenging syntax: verse 6 is a relative  clause describing Agni, verse 7 a causal clause that explains how it is that Agni is  a homeland for Āyu and his descendants, and verse 8 concludes with the appear
ance of Agni.
Finally, one philological explanation:  in verse 7 we read ákṣitam rather than  ā́kṣitam with the Padapāṭha.
1. O companions, (unite) together your united refreshment and praise  to Agni,
to the highest (dweller) of the dwellings, to the child of nourishment  endowed with strength,
2. At the encounter together with whom, wherever it be, delighting men  [=priests] (unite) in the session of men [=the sacrifice]
and whom even the worthy (gods) kindle and our folk bring to birth. 3. When we get together the refreshments and together the oblations of the  sons of Manu,
he for his part has taken the rein of truth with the vast power of his  brilliance.
4. Again he makes a beacon here, even during the night, for him who is  far away,
when he, the pure one, again diminishes the lords of the forest (into ash),  himself unaging.
5. In whose service they again pour down their sweat upon his paths, they have mounted this land of his own noble birth like the backs (of  horses).
6. The much coveted one whom the mortal finds in order that he suckle  everyone [=both gods and mortals],
(the one who is) the sweetening of foods and also the homeland for Āyu, 7. Because like a mower, he again mows the uninhabitable wasteland like a  grazing animal— he of golden beard and blazing teeth, the craftsman whose might is  never blunted—
8. Him his mother bore bearing easily, when she successfully obtained the  good fortune (of Agni’s birth),
(for the sacrificer), for whom, as for Atri, blazing (Agni) again streams  forth like an axe.
9. (For the sacrificer), who is luck for you so that you suckle (everyone), o  Agni, o you having butter as your soma-drink,
establish brilliance and fame here among these mortals, (establish)
insight here.
10. With just these words, I take the battle-fury of Adhrij, the (sacrificial)  animal given by you.
Then, o Agni, Atri should overpower the Dasyus, who never give; Iṣa  should overpower men [=other sacrificers].

Iṣa Ātreya
7 verses: jagatī
The poet begins each verse with the object phrase tvā́m agne “you, o Agni,” except  verse 5, which subtly breaks the pattern by beginning tvám agne, with the nomina tive subject pronoun instead of the accusative. Thematically the hymn emphasizes  the roles of Agni as the fire of the household, of the clan, and of the clans col lectively. The poet remembers that the ancestors kindled Agni (vss. 1–2), that their  descendants, the present clans, continue to do so now (vs. 3), and that through Agni  they gain sustenance (vs. 5).
1. You, o Agni, did the truth-seekers kindle—the ancients (kindled) the  ancient one—for your help, o you made with strength,
(you) the much-glittering, all-nurturing one worthy of the sacrifice, the  desirable master of the household, lord of the house.
2. You, o Agni, did they seat as the first guest of the clan, as the lord of the  house with blazing hair,
with lofty beacon and many forms, winning back the stakes, offering  good protection and good help, striving to bring (mortals) to old age. 3. You, o Agni, do the clans of Manu’s sons invoke as the one knowing  priestly offices, discriminating, and best granting treasures,
being in hiding yet visible to all, o you who bring good fortune,
resounding mightily, sacrificing well, and having ghee as your
splendor.
4. You, o Agni, the steadfast one, have we always approached with homage,  singing with our songs.
672 V.9
Being kindled, find pleasure in our (songs), o Aṅgiras—(you) a god (in  those) of a mortal—with a glorious (fire?), with your bright lights.
5. You, o Agni, with your many forms establish vitality for every clan in  your ancient way, o you much praised.
By your strength you rule over many foods. When you have flared, that  flare of yours is not to be challenged.
6. You, o Agni, o youngest one, did the gods make their messenger, the  conveyor of the oblations, when you were kindled.
They have established you of wide expanse, having your birthplace in  ghee, anointed (with ghee), as the flaring eye that propels thought.
7. You, o Agni, anointed with ghee from of old, have those seeking your  favor kindled with good kindling.
Having become fully grown and increased by the plants, you spread over  the earthly expanses.

Gaya Ātreya
7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
The poet has taken special pains to link one verse to the next. Verses 2–3 form a  single statement with two relative clauses joined by the marked conjunction utá.  Verses 3–4 both begin with the same words utá sma “And...again,” and verse 5 also  begins with a similar and conjunctive ádha sma “Then...again.” The final pāda  also begins with utá, but sounds almost like an afterthought. Its seeming superflu
ity calls attention to it as an addition and thereby also to the serial concatenation  across the hymn’s verses.
Less clear is the purpose that such concatenation serves. One possibility is that  this structure is a verbal icon of various kinds of ritual strings. Thus it might reflect  the poet’s request in the first verse that Agni “convey our oblations in proper order.”  That is, the connection of verses one to another might anticipate the connected  sequence of offerings made into the fire. Or it might reflect the convergences of sacri
fices, sacrificial rewards, and sacrificial participants at the rite, all mentioned in verse  2, or the union of Agni’s flames, amplified by the image of metals smelted together in  verse 5. Or it might even indicate the alliance between gods and humans signified by  the appearance of Agni as Mitra, the god of alliances, in verse 6. Or all of the above.
1. You, Agni, a god, do mortals summon, bearing offerings.
I think you to be Jātavedas: convey our oblations in proper order.
2. Agni is the Hotar of the dwelling rich in gifts, in which the ritual grass is  twisted,
upon whom sacrifices converge and the prizes and seekers of fame
(converge); 3. And to whom the churning stick has again given birth like a new calf— Agni, the supporter of the clans of the sons of Manu, performing
good rites.
4. And like a son of twisting (snakes) you are again hard to grasp,
you, who are the consumer of much wood, o Agni, like a grazing animal  in a pasture (consuming much grass).
5. Then he whose smoky flames all together join together—
when Trita in heaven blows upon him like a blower [=smelter] (of
metals), he becomes sharp as if at the blowing (of bellows).
6. By your help, o Agni, and through my proclamations of (Agni as) Mitra,  would I—
would we cross over difficulties of mortals, as those repelling hatred do. 7. Let our men (be) dominant over wealth, o Agni. Bring that here, o  strong one!
He makes us dwell in peace; he makes us thrive; he comes in order (for  us) to gain the prize of victory. And let him be present to strengthen  us in battles.

Gaya Ātreya
7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4, 7
Oldenberg (1897: 390) remarks that this hymn “seems to stand parallel with” the  preceding hymn, which is attributed to the same poet. The hymn comprises a direct  and energetic plea for wealth both for those chanting praise songs and for their  patrons, their sūrís, explicitly mentioned in verses 3 and 6. In verse 3 it is not clear  whether “patrons” and “men” refer to patrons and priests or whether “men” is in  apposition to patrons, and then in verse 4, whether those beautifying the songs are  patrons or priests or both. If both, which we think most likely, then the “gifts of  horses” could refer to actual horses that patrons bring and metaphoric horses, the  songs that priests offer.
The hymn is marked by repeated pointing at Agni as the one who can and  should bring this wealth. So verses 2, 3, and 7 all begin with a 2nd-person pronoun  followed immediately by an address to Agni: “You, o Agni!” In verse 2 there is  a progression from Agni’s will to sacrifice, to his skill to do so, and finally to his  “effective action” in performing the rite, at which point he becomes “worthy of the  sacrifice,” that is, both worthy to perform his priest’s role and worthy to receive  offerings as a god.
1. O Agni, who are never poor, bring here the most powerful
brilliance to us.
With wealth and abundance, cut a path to victory’s prize for us.674 V.11
2. You, o undeceiving Agni! By your will, by your readiness of skill for us, and by your effective action—upon you has lordliness mounted—you  are worthy of the sacrifice, like Mitra.
3. You, o Agni! Increase for us the household and prosperity of these, our patrons (and) our men, who have obtained rewards through
praise songs,
4. Who with their gifts of horses, o shimmering Agni, beautify songs  for you—
(these) men, spirited with high spirits, whose acclaim (rises) more loftily  even than heaven. In person he [=Agni] attends (to them).
5. These flashing flames of yours, o Agni, go boldly,
like earth-encircling lightning bolts, their sound like a chariot chasing  the prize of victory.
6. Now, (bring us wealth) to help us, o Agni, and to give to the zealous one, and for our patrons to pass safely through all regions.
7. You, o Agni, o Aṅgiras, having been praised and being praised, bring us wealth that overwhelms the wide-reaching one, for your praisers and for  us to praise (you), o Hotar. And be present for us to grow strong in
battles.

Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: jagatī
As in the previous hymn, there is an energetic pointing to Agni, who is insistently  named at the beginning of each pāda in verse 4 and addressed in the 2nd person at  the beginning of 5abc and 6a, d. There is also an emphasis on Agni’s expanse: his  radiance (vs. 1) and his smoke (vs. 3) touch heaven; he is a visible beacon (vss. 2,  3); he is present in every household (vs. 4); he is filled with vast power (śávas, vs.  5); and he even extends backward in time all the way to the first man, Vivasvant  (vs. 3). The description of Agni as shining for the Bharatas (vs. 1) may explain why  there is this emphasis on his expanse. The Agni of this hymn may be the tribal  fire of the Bharatas, and therefore the poet wishes to emphasize Agni’s presence  among all the people of the Bharatas and the extent of the Bharatas’ territory  or power.
1. The herdsman of the people has been born, the awakened, well-skilled  Agni, for a new safe passage.
His face covered with ghee, blazing (Agni) radiates brilliantly for the  Bharatas with lofty (radiance) that touches heaven.
2. As the beacon of their sacrifice, as the foremost one placed to the fore,  men have kindled Agni in his threefold abode. On the same chariot with Indra and the gods, he of strong resolve sits  down on the ritual grass as Hotar to perform the sacrifice.
3. Though ungroomed, you are born blazing in your two mothers [=the  fire-churning sticks]. As the delighting poet of Vivasvant, you rose up. They made you grow strong with ghee, o (ghee-)anointed Agni. Your  smoke became a beacon, resting upon heaven.
4. Let Agni successfully pursue our sacrifice. Agni do men distribute in  every house.
Agni became their messenger, conveying the oblations. Choosing Agni,  they choose him who possesses a poet’s purpose.
5. For you, Agni, let this most honey-filled speech, for you let this inspired  thinking be a joy for your heart.
You do the songs fill with vast power, like great streams the river [=the  Sindhu], and (you) do they make strong.
6. You, Agni, did the Aṅgirases find, though you were hidden in secret,  resting in every piece of wood.
Being churned, you are born to great strength. You they call the child of  strength, o Aṅgiras.
## 12 (366) Agni
Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn repeatedly asserts that the poet is speaking the truth (r̥tá), and therefore,  since Agni himself speaks the truth (vs. 3) and attends to the truth (vs. 2), he should  attend to the poet and grant his wishes. In verse 5 the poet contrasts himself and  his truth-speaking with those who were apparently once his allies, whose words  and whose attacks against him are now twisted and false. The questions in 4bcd  are ironic, for in fact Agni offers no protection to a lying cheat. Pāda 4a might also  be taken ironically or not: the bonds (bándhana) could be the bonds of friendship  with Agni—in its other two R̥gvedic attestations the word means “connection” in  a neutral or positive sense—or they could be the fetters that the poet clearly hopes  are the cheat’s reward.
1. Forth to lofty Agni, worthy of the sacrifice, to the bull of truth, the lord,  do (I bring) my thought,
well purified in my mouth at the sacrifice like ghee (in Agni’s mouth);  I bring (forth) my song to be face-to-face with the bull.
2. O you attentive to the truth, attend to just the truth. Bore through to the  many streams of truth.
I do not (serve) the sorcerer by strength nor by duplicity; I serve the  truth of the flame-red bull.
676 V.13
3. In what fashion, o Agni, do you, speaking the truth according to the  truth, become aware of our newer speech?
The god who is rites-guardian of the rites’ sequence knows of me; I do  not (know) a lord other than him, the winner of wealth here.
4. What bonds do you have for the cheat, Agni? What brilliant protectors  will keep winning gain (for him)?
Which ones protect the wellspring of untruth, o Agni? What herdsmen  are there for false speech?
5. These inconstant companions of yours, Agni, though they used to be  kind, have become unkind.
These have injured themselves by their words, speaking twisted things  against him who goes straight.
6. The one who summons you to the sacrifice with homage, o Agni, protects  the truth of the flame-red bull.
For him let there come a dwelling place, wide and bringing success, (and  also) the posterity of Nahuṣa, who is spreading in every direction.

Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Like the previous hymn, which is also attributed to Sutambhara, this hymn empha sizes the praise song offered to Agni, which causes Agni to grow and to perform  the sacrifice as the Hotar. The course of the hymn follows that growth of Agni. In  verse 1 the sacrificers are just beginning to kindle Agni. He then spreads wide (vs.  4) and is made strong (vs. 5), until finally, in the last verse, he encompasses the gods.
1. Chanting, we invoke you; chanting, we would kindle you,
chanting, o Agni, for your help.
2. For Agni we will conceive a praise song, an effective one today for him  who touches heaven,
for the god, as we seek goods.
3. Agni is pleased at our songs—he the Hotar, who is here among the sons  of Manu.
He will perform sacrifice to the divine race.
4. You, o Agni, are spread wide as the pleasing Hotar to be chosen.
Through you they stretch out the sacrifice.
5. You, o Agni, best prizewinner, do the inspired poets make strong when  you are well praised.
Give us an abundance of heroes.
6. O Agni, like a rim the spokes, you surround the gods.
I reach toward your shimmering generosity.

## 14 (368) Agni
Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
As in his previous two hymns Sutambhara emphasizes the power of the praise song  to awaken Agni. Here he fronts the name of Agni (vss. 1, 4–6) or a pronoun referring  to Agni (vss. 2, 3) in every verse. Verses 2–3 are not so much exceptions as a variation  of the structure of the other verses. These two verses form a single statement that  withholds the name “Agni” until it is fronted in their last pāda, 3c. Then verse 4 and  the following verses pick up “Agni” and continue with it as the first word in the verse.
1. Agni—awaken him with a praise song, kindling the immortal one. He will place our oblations among the gods.
2. Him they invoke in the rites—mortals (invoke) the immortal one,  the god—
to be the best sacrificer among the people of Manu,
3. Because him do they invoke one after another with a spoon dripping  with ghee, him the god
Agni, to convey the oblation.
4. Agni shone as soon as he was born, smashing Dasyus and darkness with  his light.
He found the cows, the waters, and the sun.
5. Agni, to be invoked as our poet—serve him, ghee-backed!
Let him—he will hear!—track my summons.
6. Agni, governing all territories, have they increased with ghee and  praise songs
of good insight and eloquence.

Dharuṇa Āṅgirasa
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Elizarenkova (1995: 152) calls dharúṇa “support” the “magic word” of this hymn,  since this word is repeated and echoed by other derivatives of √dhR̥or by similar  sounding words. By attributing the hymn to Dharuṇa, the Anukramaṇī implies that  the poet is playing on his name, although it is likely that the Anukramaṇī derives the  name of the poet from the repetition of this word. The purpose of this repetition of  dharúṇa is to underscore the role of Agni as the “supporter of wealth, the support  of goods” (vs. 1). The name of Agni is postponed to the very end of the line of this  first verse and then is never mentioned again, although echoing Agni the next to last  word of the hymn is the name of Atri.
678 V.15
The rest of the hymn presents a number of linguistic and exegetical problems,  and this translation accepts the minor emendation in verse 4c of jarase to járase proposed by Oldenberg. The second verse is particularly mysterious and the trans lation does not fully unravel it. Geldner suggests that the unnamed subjects are  the Aṅgirases, ancient singers, who established the truth as the foundation of the  sacrifice in heaven and who, together with their “born” sons, attained the “unborn”  Ādityas or the gods generally. We offer another view in the translation. In this inter pretation, the subjects are priests, who by the truth of their words support the truth  that is the rightly performed sacrifice, which itself is a support, the support of the  gods. The priests support the sacrifice by placing it on its support, the heavenly ideal  of the sacrifice. In doing so they also support the gods, who gather at the earthly  sacrifice, the foundation of heaven. In this way the priests attained the unborn gods  by means of their sacrificial fires that have been “born.” To be sure, like much else  in this verse, the identification of those “born” is uncertain, but note that the bodies  of Agni, the different sacrificial fires, are mentioned in verse 3 and that also in this  verse the ancient Agni, this time in the singular, is “newly born.”
In verse 5, as Geldner rightly notes, the image is from racing. The beckoning  prize of victory maintains the diminishing strength of the racer. In the sacrificial  context the prize may be Agni’s reward, the offerings of melted butter that revive  the flagging fire. Thus according to the latter half of the verse, the fire hides within  the wood, but after it is revived, it appears again majestically.
1. I bring forth my song to the ritual master and poet worth finding, to the  glorious ancient one.
Seated in ghee is the very kind lord, the supporter of wealth, the support  of goods, Agni.
2. By truth they [=the priests] support truth, the support, on the powerful  (support) of the sacrifice in the highest heaven,
and (support) the superior men [=the gods], who have sat down on the  support at the foundation of heaven—they who have attained the ones  unborn by those born.
3. They stretch out the bodies (of Agni), which keep away confinement, and  great vitality, hard to surpass, for the ancient one.
Though newly born, he would cross the boundaries (of the fireplace), but  all around they hem him in, who is like a raging lion.
4. When, spreading, like a mother you carry more and more peoples to be  suckled and to see,
and when *you awaken, acquiring more and more vitality, you go all  around with varying forms in your single person.
5. Now let the prize of victory protect the limit of your strength as you give  as your milk broad support for wealth.
Hiding your track like a thief, then appearing greatly for wealth, you  have rescued Atri.

Pūru Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This and the following hymn are attributed to the same poet, and indeed the two  hymns show many parallels: they have the same meter and the same number of  verses, and their concluding pāda is identical. Geldner notes that this hymn, like  many of the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala, uses rare and affected expressions.  Certainly the syntax in this hymn is challenging, especially in verses 3–4, whose  complex construction marks the climax of the hymn. The two verses describe the  point at which Agni is burning most brightly. At that moment he has become the  powerful ally and benefactor of the sacrificers, and at that moment Agni shines  beyond both heaven and earth.
Both in these verses and elsewhere in the hymn the poet emphasizes the alliance  among Agni, the priests, and their patrons. In verse 1, for example, the expression  mitráṃ ná compares Agni to Mitra, the god of alliances, and simultaneously com pares him to a mitrá, an ally. The first is the primary sense, as it is elsewhere, here  especially because the hymn refers to Bhaga, another of the Ādityas, in verse 2.
1. Because there is lofty vitality for radiance, chant to the god Agni, whom mortals have installed to the fore, like Mitra, with their
proclamations.
2. Because he is the Hotar of the peoples in the arms of skill throughout  the days,
Agni allots the oblation in the proper sequence, like Bhaga a wish.
3. At our praise of this generous one and in our companionship with him  full-flamed,
our mightily roaring compatriot, in whom all (beings) have placed
unbridled strength—
4. For then, o Agni, (you are) ready to give abundant heroes to these (your  companions)—
the two world-halves do not encompass him, though youthful, nor his fame. 5. Now come to us! Being sung, o Agni, bring here a desirable reward to us and our patrons, who together will receive well-being.
– And be present to strengthen us in battles.
## 17 (371) Agni
Pūru Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
A striking image in this hymn is that of the mouth—the mouth of Agni, who  receives the offerings, and the mouth of the priest, who recites the hymns. The poet
680 V.18
associates or even identifies these mouths in verse 2 by using ásya “of this one,” to  refer to either Agni or the priest, and in verse 5, where the mouth is equally that of  Agni and that of the priest. The poet insists on these two mouths because they are  the means by which the patron of the sacrifice can think himself glorious (vs. 2). In  verse 3, however, the poet refers only to the mouth of Agni and shifts to a sexual  image. The “thrust” could be the thrust of the poet’s song or it could be the thrust  of the fire-churning. Because it carries a sexual connotation, line c then describes  the semen of Agni that gives birth to lofty flames.
1. Here, o god, by his sacrifices the mortal (should summon) the mightier  one for help;
Pūru should summon Agni to give help, when a good rite has been
performed.
2. Since, by reason of the mouth of this one [=both Agni and the poet], o  distributor [=sacrificer], you think yourself to have greater glory for  yourself,
(you should summon) him, the vault of heaven with his shimmering  blaze, the delighting one beyond inspired thinking.
3. Surely it is by the mouth and flame of this one, who is hitched up by  thrust and song,
by whose semen, like that of heaven, flames blaze aloft,
4. And it is by the will of this one—discerning, wondrous—that there are  good things here on the chariot [=the sacrifice].
So then Agni is proclaimed as the one to be invoked among all the clans. 5. Since the desirable reward is now just ours, our patrons follow after the  mouth (of Agni and the poet).
O child of nourishment, protect us that we prevail. Be capable that we  have well-being.
– And be present to strengthen us in battles.

Mr̥ktavāhas Dvita Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This hymn is a dānastuti, a praise of generous patrons. Renou calls it a dānastuti for  the whole preceding sequence of hymns. Dvita, who calls himself, perhaps jokingly,  mr̥ktávāhas “him of the broken vehicle,” summons Agni to reward Dvita’s patrons.  Agni should give them fame, although this fame is also partly and directly created  by the hymn itself. They deserve this reward because they have generously given  Dvita a gift of many horses (vss. 3, 5). The hymn praises Dvita as well, if indirectly,  when it mentions the “brilliant insight” of the singer (vs. 4), which because of him  exists among the patrons. 1. Early in the morning much beloved Agni, guest of the clan, should be  praised,
the immortal who rejoices at all the oblations among mortals.
2. Your own skill is at the ready for Dvita of the broken vehicle.
He receives the (soma-)drop in proper sequence even as your praise  singer, o immortal one.
3. For you do I summon him of long-lived blaze with a song for (you)  generous ones,
whose chariot speeds away undamaged, o giver of horses,
4. Or among whom is brilliant insight, who protect the recitations in (the  singer’s) mouth.
The ritual grass has been strewn near him [=Agni] of sun-like majesty,  and they have wrapped themselves in fame.
5. For those who have given me fifty horses for our joint praise,
for the generous men, o Agni, make bright and great fame, lofty (fame)  filled with men, o immortal one.
## 19 (373) Agni
Vavri Ātreya
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–2, anuṣṭubh 3–4, virāḍrūpā 5
As other translators have remarked, this hymn is enigmatic. Renou even describes it  as a collection of disjointed verses, and it is true that in its five verses the hymn has  three different meters.
The first two verses describe the birth of Agni in terms that suggest human birth.  The fire is born from a womb of wood, its first covering, and appears with a caul  of smoke, its second covering. Having emerged, it peeps out from the hollow of  the lower churning stick that gave it birth. Then priests nurture Agni’s growth into  manhood, and perhaps Agni himself, as Geldner suggests, becomes a fortress for  them, or perhaps the sacrificial ground governed by Agni is their fortress.
In verse 3 it is not clear who Śvaitreya might be. He could be Agni himself,  whose kin would be his flames. Or he might be a clan leader or even, as Geldner  argues, a racing bull. Because the relationship between Br̥haduktha and Śvaitreya is  unclear, it is equally uncertain how to understand the relationship between 3ab and  cd. Br̥haduktha is elsewhere a poet, and although the Anukramaṇī abstracts Vavri  Ātreya as the name of the poet of this hymn from the vavrí “covering” in the first  verse, it is more likely that Br̥haduktha is actually the poet. He is apparently seeking  the prize the way a horse does. Oldenberg points out that in the Vājapeya sacrifice  there is a mantra that invites the horse to drink honey, perhaps to give him strength,  and perhaps this custom lies behind the simile in d. The mystery deepens in verse  4, but it appears that Agni, when he is born, then mates with the two fire-churning
682 V.20
sticks that give him birth as he consumes them. The act would seem to be unholy,  but that is merely Agni’s deception.
The last verse apparently describes the fully mature Agni, flinging his flames in  the wind. On this verse, see Hoffmann (1954/61: 46–47 [=1975: 375–76]); he is surely  correct to read sandhr̥ṣájas, which could mean “daring warriors” or the like, instead  of san dhr̥ṣájas with the Padapāṭha.
1. His low appearances [=low flames] are born forth. From the covering (of  wood) a covering (of smoke) has become visible.
He gazes out in the lap of his mother [=the lower churning stick].
2. Attentive, they [=the priests] have poured various offerings.
Unblinkingly, they protect his manly power.
They have entered into the firm fortress.
3. The kin of Śvaitreya have grown strong brilliantly, as have their peoples. With ornamented neck, Br̥haduktha (is) seeking the prize with this
(honey) [=soma?], like (a prize-seeking horse) with honey.
4. (His semen) dear like the milk of desire, (his act) unkindred (incest) with  two [=fire-churning sticks] that are kin,
like the vessel of hot milk in whose belly is the prize, (he is) the
undeceivable deceiver of every one.
5. Playing, o ray of light, you are here for us, ever finding yourself in  alliance with the biting Wind.
Hurl those well-sharpened flames, like daring warriors their sharp
(weapons), o you who stand in the belly [=fire pit].

Prayasvanta Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh
As in the previous hymn and the three that follow, the name of the poet has been  extracted from the hymn itself, in this case from práyasvant “bringing pleasing offer ings” in verse 3. The dominant theme is the songs, which are explicitly mentioned in  every verse except verse 2, and even there they are probably the understood object  in ab. Verse 2 is the most interesting in the hymn because it is not clear to whom the  poet refers. It sounds as though the people he criticizes are rival poets, who have  prospered through Agni, but who are in some way not acting or not performing the  ritual properly now.
1. The wealth that even you hold in regard, o Agni, best winner of
victory’s prize,
that yokemate of ours I will extol with songs as worthy of fame among  the gods. 2. O Agni, those grown strong by your mighty power who do not send  (songs)
(to keep) away hatred, away crookedness, follow (the commandments) of  one who is under the commandments of others.
3. We choose you, o Agni, as our Hotar, ensuring success for our skill. Bringing pleasing offerings, we summon with our song the one who is  first in the sacrifices.
4. As (we strive) in this way for your help day after day, o powerful one, for wealth and for truth, o you of strong will, we your feasting
companions would be united with cattle and we would be united with  heroes.

The name of the poet is extracted from sasá “grain” in verse 4, which sticks out  as an unusual word in an unusual context. The poet, whatever his name might be,  pairs and links similar-sounding words and expressions. The last line of the first  verse devā́n devayaté yaja (1d) is echoed in the first line of the last verse deváṃ
vo devayajyáyā (4a). He fronts accented forms of the 2nd-person pronoun at the  beginning of 2a (tvám) and 3a (tvā́m), both to be read disyllabically, as is normal for  tvám but not for tvā́m. These repetitions are thematically the more significant since  the poet emphasizes the 2nd-person address to Agni and his role as a god (vss. 3,  4) sacrificing to the gods. But there are other repetitions as well. For example verse  3 links su- and uṣ-sounds: mā́nuṣe ...súprīta ...srúcas...ānuṣák sújāta sárpirāsute.
1. Like Manu, we would install you. Like Manu, we would kindle you. O Agni, Aṅgiras—like Manu, sacrifice to the gods for the one seeking  the gods,
2. For, o Agni, it is you who, well-pleased, are kindled among the people  descended from Manu.
The sacrificial ladles go to you in their proper order, o you, the well-born  one whose drink is melted butter.
3. It is you whom all the gods, as one, have made their messenger.
Waiting upon you, o poet, they invoke you, a god, in the sacrifices.
4. The mortal should invoke for all of you the god Agni with sacrifice to  the gods.
O blazing one, shine when you are kindled. Take your seat upon the  womb of truth. Take your seat upon the womb of grain.684 V.22–23

Viśvasāman Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4
In verse 1 the poet Viśvasāman likely addresses himself. In doing so, he may be play ing on the significance of his name, which means “he to whom belongs every tune,”  for he calls on himself to chant to Agni. The fire is installed as the Hotar of the rite,  and like a Hotar he should be attentive. Therefore Viśvasāman asks that Agni be  attentive to his praise and to his words. The references to Agni as the “Hotar within  the clan” (vs. 1) and to the Atris (vs. 4) suggest that this short hymn was an address  to the clan fire of the Atris, and of course the fire of a clan of poets ought to be  especially attentive to the speech of poets and especially adorned by songs.
1. O Viśvasāman, like Atri chant forth to him of purifying flame,
who is to be invoked at the rites as the most delighting Hotar within  the clan.
2. Install Agni Jātavedas, the god and priest.
Let the sacrifice go forth in proper sequence today as that which best  encompasses the gods.
3. We mortals have brought to mind you of attentive mind, you a god, for help, begging for the help of you, the desirable one.
4. O Agni, be attentive to this (speech) of ours—here is our speech, o  strong one!
The Atris make you strong with their praise songs, o you of fair lips, o  lord of the household; the Atris beautify you with song.

Dyumna Viśvacarṣaṇi Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4
This hymn invokes the fire that grants wealth, especially a wealth of cattle (vs. 2),  which brings with it dominance over surrounding lands. At the same time the ability  of Agni to grant wealth and power also depends on the sacrificers who bring the  ritual grass (3a), who establish Agni as their Hotar (3c), and whose words confer  power on him (1d). The references to the tribes who pursue Agni (vs. 3) and to  Agni himself as the one “who belongs to all lands” (vs. 4) suggest that the fire of  this hymn either was or was at least compared to the common fire that united the  various Ārya peoples.
1. O Agni, bring here wealth that is overpowering through the power of  your brilliance
and that, with prizes at stake, will be powerful over the lands by means  of my mouth [=my speech].
2. O powerful Agni, bring here that wealth overpowering in battles,
for you are the real and infallible giver of the prize that brings cattle. 3. For, with their ritual grass twisted, all the tribes as one
pursue you as their cherished Hotar in your seats [=fire places] for the  sake of many desirable things.
4. For as always, that one who belongs to all lands acquires power against  evil intents.
O Agni, here in these dwellings shine richly for us, o blazing one, shine  brilliantly, o pure one.

The Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas: Bandhu (1), Subandhu (2) Śrutabandhu (3), and  Viprabandhu (4)
4 verses: dvipadā virāj
The Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn’s four verses to four poets, all belonging to  the family of the Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas. These four poets are brothers in the  Gaupāyana family according to an itihāsa (legend) that is supposed to underlie  X.57–60, although it is unlikely that these R̥gvedic hymns actually refer to this story.  According to the story the second brother, Subandhu, was killed and brought back  to life by the other three. In this hymn, the first and third verses are for protection,  while the second verse, the one attributed to Subandhu, is a more generic call for  wealth. The last verse simply asks for Agni’s favor without being clear what end his  favor should serve. In a general way the hymn thus fits the story of the rescue of  Subandhu, since the verses surrounding his verse concern the idea of rescue. But  such echoes may explain the attribution of the hymn rather than the hymn itself.
1. O Agni, be our nearest and our kind rescuer, providing (us) a shield. 2. Agni is good and famed for goods. Arrive here and give the most  brilliant wealth.
3. Be attentive to us, and hear our summons. Give us freedom from anyone  who wishes evil.
4. O strongest-blazing, shining (Agni), we now beg you for your favor for  (us, your) partners.

The Vasūyava Ātreyas
9 verses: anuṣṭubh, arranged in trcas ̥
The attribution of this hymn to the Vasūyavas is likely based on verse 9, in which the  poet calls himself and his people vasūyávaḥ “those seeking goods.” As Oldenberg
686 V.25
(1897) notes, the hymn is divided into three tr̥cas. This organization would explain  its position in the Ātreya Agni collection. A hymn of three tr̥cas can follow a hymn  of four verses in the proper sequence in which hymns with a fewer number of  either verses or strophes follow hymns with a greater number of verses or stro
phes. However, Oldenberg (1888: 188) also suggests that V.25–28 may be an added  supplement to the Agni collection.
In the first tr̥ca Agni is apparently first becoming present (vs. 2) and has begun  to shine (vs. 3). Then in the second (vss. 4–6) the presence of Agni explodes, and  the poet marks the force of Agni by constantly repeating his name at the beginning  of every hemistich except one (5cd). In the final tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet turns not so  much to the sight of Agni as the sound of Agni. His louder and louder crackling  is reflected in the words of the sacrifice and the other sounds of the sacrifice, nota
bly the sounds of the pressing stones that pound the soma, which are themselves  regularly connected to the chants and recitations of the rite. The danger of tr̥cas,  especially when the strophes are as thematically distinct as they are in this hymn, is  that the hymn itself may seem to break into blocks. This poet uses ring composi
tion to unify the poem and to underscore its ultimate purpose. In 1d he says that  Agni parṣati dviṣáḥ “will bring to safety from hatred,” and again in 9cd, at the end  of the hymn, that sá no víśvā áti dvíṣaḥ / párṣat “he will bring us to safety across all  hatreds.” While the two phrases obviously echo one another, note that the poet has  not quite repeated himself. Most especially his first assertion seems to be a general  one: Agni is the one who brings to safety. But in the last, Agni is the one who brings  us to safety, applying Agni’s more general power to himself and his people.
1. Here for you all I sing to the god Agni for his help. He is the one good  for us.
The son of (dawn’s) rays will give; the possessor of truth will bring to  safety from hatred.
2. For he is really present—the one whom even the ancients kindled, whom  even the gods—
he the very Hotar of gladdening tongue, who brings radiant goods
through his bright light.
3. By your best insight and most excellent favor toward us,
o Agni, shine on us riches by reason of our well-plaited words, o you  who are worthy to be chosen.
4. Agni is king among the gods and Agni among mortals when he enters  (among them).
Agni is the conveyor of oblations for us. Serve Agni with your insights. 5. Agni gives to the pious man an excellent son of very mighty fame and of  very mighty formulations,
one who cannot be overcome and who brings fame to his lord.
6. Agni gives the lord of settlements who prevails in battle with his men; Agni (gives) the fast-running charger, the unvanquished victor. 7. What best conveys (offerings), that is for Agni. Chant (your chant) aloft,  o you of far-radiant goods.
Like a buffalo-cow wealth (arises) from you; victory’s prizes arise
from you.
8. Your flames are brilliant: (they resound) as the pressing stone
resounds aloft,
and just like thunder from heaven your roar has arisen by itself.
9. Thus, seeking goods, we have celebrated Agni who acts with strength. He of strong resolve will bring us to safety across all hatreds, as if by  a boat.

The Vasūyava Ātreyas
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Like the preceding hymn, this hymn comprises three tr̥cas. It draws on repeated  pādas, especially although not exclusively in the final pādas of verses: 1c = VI.16.2c  and VIII.102.16c; 2c = VII.16.4b; 4c = V.20.3a, VIII.60.1b, and X.21.1b; 5c = I.12.4c  and VIII.44.14c; 7c = V.22.2b; and 9c = I.39.5d. Geldner provides a complete list of  the repetitions. As such, it is reminiscent of the assemblages that constitute the kin
dling verses in several priestly families (see V.28 below). The first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–3,  4–6) are a direct address to Agni to assume his role as the one who conveys obla tions to the gods and perfects the ritual. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet turns to  his fellow priests, telling them to install the fire, prepare the seat for the gods, and  perform the rites in order, and then in the final verse, with the fire now blazing and  the priests performing their roles, he invites various gods, perhaps representing the  All Gods, to take their seats.
1. O purifying Agni, with your radiance and with your gladdening
tongue, o god,
convey the gods hither and sacrifice.
2. O you with ghee-covered back, o you of shimmering radiance, we beg  you of sunlike appearance:
convey the gods hither to pursue (our oblations).
3. O poet, we would kindle you, the brilliant one whose oblations are worth  pursuing,
the lofty one in the rite, o Agni.
4. O Agni, come with all the gods for the giving of oblations.
We choose you as our Hotar.
5. Convey an abundance of heroes to the sacrificer pressing soma, o Agni! Sit here on our ritual grass along with the gods!
688 V.27
6. Being kindled, o thousand-conquering Agni, you prosper the (ritual)  foundations
as the praiseworthy messenger of the gods.
7. Install Agni Jātavedas, who conveys the oblations, the youngest (Agni), as god and priest.
8. Let the sacrifice go forth in proper sequence today as that which best  encompasses the gods.
Strew the sacred grass (for the gods) to sit.
9. Let the Maruts, the Aśvins, and Mitra and Varuṇa sit here upon this, let the gods with their whole clan.

Kings Tryaruṇa Traivr̥ṣṇa, Trasadasyu Paurukutsya, and Aśvamedha Bhārata, or  Atri Bhauma
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn consists of two tr̥cas, so it is in its proper place according to its length.  Nonetheless, Oldenberg (Noten and 1897) regards it as an addition to the original  collection.
The hymn is a dānastuti addressed to allied patrons or kings. The Anukramaṇī names three patrons, but, as Oldenberg (1897) and Geldner suggest, Tryaruṇa  might be a descendant of Trasadasyu and bear his name as an epithet (vs. 3). If so,  then the hymn addresses two men, Tryaruṇa (vss. 1–3 in triṣṭubh) and Aśvamedha  (vss. 4–6 in anuṣṭubh). In verse 4 Tryaruṇa commands Aśvamedha to reward the  poet, but it remains unclear just how the two are related.
The translation and interpretation of the hymn become difficult especially at  verse 3, which is open to a number of different constructions. We understand 3ab  to mean that the sacrificer desires Agni’s favor for the poet’s hymn. Why he should  desire this favor navamám “for the ninth time” is not stated, but there is a parallel in  VIII.24.23, which calls on the poet to praise daśamám “a tenth time.” In both verses  the numbers may simply indicate “many times.” Here in this hymn, however, it is  likely that navamám, especially because it follows náviṣṭhāya “for the newest,” either  means “anew” rather than “ninth” or puns on the two meanings. The “harnessed  chariot,” with which Tryaruṇa welcomes the poet’s song in 3cd, may be a gift to the  poet, or it may be the sacrifice itself, which elsewhere is represented as a chariot.
Verse 4 begins the second tr̥ca, a transition that is marked also by a change in  meter. But in contrast to the clear segmentation of the hymn shown by the tr̥ca form  and the meter, the syntax binds verse 4 with verse 3, since the opening relative clause  is coordinate with the relative clause in 3cd. This may reproduce the relationship  between Tryaruṇa and Aśvamedha, who are two individuals but who are in some  manner bound to one another. 1. The lord of settlements has readied for me two oxen together with an  ox-cart—he, the most illustrious lord, more (illustrious) than (any
other) generous patron.
Tryaruṇa, son of Trivr̥ṣan, is illustrious through his tens of thousands  (of cattle), o Agni Vaiśvānara.
2. To him who gives to me a hundred and twenty cattle and two harnessed  fallow bays, compliant to the chariot-pole—
to Tryaruṇa offer protection, o Agni Vaiśvānara, o you who are well  praised and grown strong.
3. In this way, o Agni, Trasadasyu [=Tryaruṇa] is desiring your favor for the  newest (hymn) for the ninth time—
Tryaruṇa, who welcomes with a harnessed (chariot) the many songs of  mine for (you), the one powerfully born;
4. (Tryaruṇa), who will declare thus to my patron Aśvamedha:
“Let him [=Aśvamedha] give to (the poet) questing for gain by his verse;  let him give to the one who seeks the truth, (questing for) wisdom.”
5. (Such are) the gifts of Aśvamedha, whose hundred gray bulls
excite me like soma juices with their three additions [=milk, curds,
barley].
6. O Indra and Agni, keep an abundance of heroes with Aśvamedha, the  giver of a hundred (cattle),
and (keep with him) dominion, lofty and unaging like the sun in heaven.

Viśvavārā Ātreyī
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 3, jagatī 2, anuṣṭubh 4, gāyatrī 5, 6, arranged in trcas ̥
The Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to a female poet, but her name is extracted from  viśvávārā “bringing all desirable things” in 1c, which describes the sacrificial ladle. One of the striking features of this hymn is its use of four different meters in  its six verses. As that metrical variation suggests, the hymn is not a unified com position but rather a collection of verses from the Atri tradition, brought together  as sāmidhenī verses to accompany the kindling of fire. There are similar com posite sāmidhenī hymns in the collections of the Viśvāmitras (III.27) and of the  Bharadvājas (VI.16). As Proferes (2003: 10) notes, these hymns are three of the four  hymns used by both the Śāṅkhāyana and Āśvalāyana traditions for the compilation  of the sāmidhenī verses used in the classical Vedic rites.
Even though the hymn is a compilation, the tr̥ca form does reflect its structure.  The first three verses urge Agni to show himself as he comes into flame. In 1cd the  description sounds as though it might refer to the dawn (in 1b), but at the end the  subject is revealed to be the ghee-filled ladle, or perhaps it is both the ghee-filled
690 V.29
ladle and the ghee-filled dawn that move forward, the first to the east, the second  toward the west. The second tr̥ca (4–6) begins with a praise of the fire in full blaze  and an invocation to him to take on the task of bringing the oblations to the gods.
1. Kindled, Agni has lifted his flame to heaven. Facing the dawn, he  radiates widely.
Forward she goes with our homage, bringing all desirable things,
summoning the gods with the oblation—she, the ghee-filled (ladle).
2. When you are being kindled, you rule over what is immortal. For  well-being you accompany him who prepares the oblation.
He acquires all material wealth whom you urge onward, and he sets his  hospitality in front, o Agni.
3. O Agni, show yourself off for the sake of great good fortune. Let your  brilliance be very high.
Let our united household be easy to control. Surmount the great powers  of those who act as our rivals.
4. I extol the glory of you, kindled and greatly exalted, o Agni.
You are the bull of brilliance. You are kindled in the rites.
5. When you are kindled, o Agni of poured offerings, sacrifice to the gods,  o you of good rites,
for you are the conveyor of oblations.
6. Pour an offering to Agni and seek his friendship as the rite goes forth. Choose him as the conveyor of oblations.

Gaurivīti Śāktya
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn consists primarily of a recital of Indra’s great deeds, with special atten tion to the Vr̥tra saga and the Maruts’ role in it (vss. 1–4, 6–9). Interspersed are  verses devoted to two much less understood myths, Indra’s conflict with the Sun in  an apparent chariot race (vss. 5, 9–10) and his journey with Kutsa to Uśanā’s house  and the defeat of Śuṣṇa (vs. 9), myths that often appear together and show narrative  connections. There are as well brief mentions of other exploits of Indra, including  the Vala myth (vs. 12). The story of the Sun’s chariot and the Kutsa/Uśanā complex  are particular preoccupations of the Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V, although the refer ences to them (Sun’s chariot V.31.11, Kutsa/Uśanā V.31.7–10) do not help to clarify  the details as much as we would like.
The poet several times (vss. 1, 3, 7) mentions Manu, the first Ārya man and sac rificer, in connection with the mythic past. This emphasis on Manu, the theoretical  ancestor of the current sacrificers, is presumably meant to associate those current sacrificers with the participants and supporters of Indra in his previous deeds, in  order to gain a portion of reflected glory. As often, the hymn sometimes narrates  the myths as if in present time (see esp. vss. 1, 6, 12, all three using the same verb  “they chant” [árcanti]). This again is a strategy serving the same purpose, here by  specifically identifying the present singers with both the Maruts and the Aṅgirases.
The hymn is also structured by recurrent soma-drinking phrases, each slightly  different, almost always in the second half of an even pāda (see 2b, 3b, 3d, 5b, 7d,  8b, 11d), a pattern that provides a sort of rhythmic theme-and-variations.
It ends with three verses (13–15) in which the poet refers globally to the amaz ing range of Indra’s deeds past and future, and in the final verse offers him his own  well-crafted poems. Only one word in this verse, vasūyúḥ “seeking goods,” out of  the whole hymn, hints that the poet would like something in return.
1. They uphold the three customs [=rituals of the soma-pressing day] at  Manu’s attendance on the gods and the three heavenly realms of light. The Maruts of refined skill chant to you. You are their wise seer, Indra. 2. When the Maruts chanted to him after he became exhilarated, to Indra  who had drunk of the pressed soma,
he took up the mace. When he (had) smashed the serpent, he released the  exuberant waters to flow.
3. And—you formulators, you Maruts—Indra should drink of this  well-pressed soma of mine,
for this is his oblation: he found the cows for Manu; Indra smashed the  serpent, having drunk of it.
4. After that he propped the two world-halves wide apart; even while  enwrapped, he set the wild beast to fearing.
Repeatedly taunting the gulper, Indra smashed the snorting Dānava back  and down.
5. Then according to your will, o bounteous one, all the gods conceded the  soma-drinking to you,
when you put the flying golden mares of the Sun behind, though they  were in front, in (the presence of) Etaśa.
6. When the bounteous one hews apart his [=Vr̥tra’s] nine and ninety coils  at one blow with his mace,
the Maruts chant to Indra at the seat (of conflict). With speech in
triṣṭubh meter he thrusts heaven (away from earth).
7. As a comrade for a comrade, Agni straightaway cooked three hundred  buffalo in accord with his [=Indra’s] will.
Indra drank the pressed soma of Manu, three lakes worth at one blow,  for the Vr̥tra-smashing.
8. When you the bounteous devoured the flesh of three hundred buffaloes  and drank three somian lakes,
all the gods called “Carry (the day)!” to Indra as (a gambler calls)
“Game!,” when he smashed the serpent.
692 V.30
9. When, Indra, (you and Kutsa) drove to the home of Uśanā with the  mighty, speeding horses,
as combatant you drove there on the same chariot with Kutsa, with the  gods. You combated Śuṣṇa.
10. You tore off the one wheel of the Sun for Kutsa; the other you made  into wide space for driving.
You crushed the Dasyus mouthless with your murderous weapon; you  wrenched those of slighting speech down into a woeful womb.
11. The praises of Gaurivīti strengthened you. You made Pipru subject to  Vaidathina.
R̥jiśvan brought you here for companionship, cooking cooked foods  (for you). You drank his soma.
12. The Navagvas, the Daśagvas [=Aṅgirases], having pressed soma, chant  to Indra with chants.
Just that cowpen with its covering [=Vala cave]—just that have the men,  having ritually labored, opened up.
13. How shall I, (though) knowing them, now encompass your heroic deeds  that you have done, o bounteous one,
and the new ones that you will do, strongest one? We will proclaim
these (deeds) of yours at the ceremonies.
14. Having done all these many (deeds), Indra, by your nature you cannot  be circumscribed in heroism.
As for those (deeds) you will do even now in your daring, possessor of  the mace—there exists no one to obstruct this power of yours.
15. O Indra, enjoy the sacred formulations being made, the new ones we  have made for you, strongest one.
Like garments, lovely and well made, like a chariot have I fashioned  them—I the clever artisan, seeking goods.
## 30 (384) Indra
Babhru Ātreya
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn follows a fairly straightforward chronological trajectory. The poet  begins by wondering where Indra is (vs. 1), locates him on the way to the sacrifice  (vs. 2), and promises the god to recite his deeds at the ceremony (vs. 3). This recital  occupies the middle of the hymn (vss. 4–10), ending (vs. 11) with a return to the  ritual setting, where Indra, pleased by the soma, bestows cows. This mythic model  provides a smooth transition to the last four verses (12–15), the poet’s dānastuti,  praising his patrons the Ruśamas and their king, R̥ṇaṃcaya (lit., “he who requites  his debts”), for their gift to him of four thousand cows, plus a piece of ritual equip ment, a pot. The poet names himself in verse 14. The recital of Indra’s deeds touches on the Vala myth (vs. 4), the Vr̥tra myth (vss.  5–6), and the defeat of Namuci (vss. 7–8). The intriguing mention of the Dāsa “who  made women his weapons” (vs. 9) is unfortunately more opaque; however, it may  be connected with an equally opaque verse, I.104.3. In our view both passages refer  to rivers controlled by the Ārya’s consistent, and perhaps indigenous, opponents,  thus serving as a barrier to Ārya progress. The words “river” and “stream” (dhénā)  are feminine in gender, and so these are the female “weapons” of 9a. Once Indra  has recognized that the “weapons” are mere (female) streams, he leads the charge  against the Dāsa foe. The cows captured in this raid may be referred to in verse 10,  the same cows that Indra distributes in verse 11.
1. Where is this hero? Who has seen Indra of the well-naved chariot  speeding with his two fallow bays,
the mace-bearer, who, seeking one who has pressed the soma, will come  to that home, when he is much invoked, with wealth, with help?
2. I spotted his track in secret; I followed the powerful track of the one who  laid it down, seeking him.
I asked the others, and they said to me, “We men might attain Indra,  since we have wakened (early).”
3. We shall now proclaim at the pressing the deeds that are yours, Indra,  which you will enjoy (hearing) from us.
He will learn who does not know, and he will hear who does know: “This  bounteous one is traveling here fully armed.”
4. You made your mind steadfast when you were just born, Indra; even  alone you pursue the many for battle.
You made even a stone flash like lightning through your vast power; you  found the pen of the ruddy cows.
5. When you were born far away in the farthest (realm), bearing a name  famous afar,
from then on even the gods feared Indra. He conquered all the waters,  those whose husband [=Vr̥tra] was a Dāsa.
6. Just for you do these friendly Maruts chant the chant, press the stalk. The serpent vaunting himself, lying on the waters—Indra will overcome  the tricky one with tricks.
7. You hewed apart those negligent by nature, stimulating giving, o  bounteous one, taking pleasure along with the cow,
at the time when you caused the head of the Dāsa Namuci to roll,
seeking an (open) way for Manu—
8. For you have made me your yokemate, Indra—just afterward stealing the  head of the Dāsa Namuci,
which was rolling, (like?) a whizzing stone, like the two world-halves  (that roll) forth like two wheels, for the Maruts.
9. Because the Dāsa made women his weapons, what can they do to me?  His armies lack strength.694 V.31
Since he [=Indra] distinguished both his [=the Dāsa’s?] streams,
therefore Indra advanced on the Dasyu to fight.
10. Together the cows then lowed on every side, since they were here, there,  and everywhere separated from their calves.
Along with his powerful (men) Indra drove them together, when the  well-pressed soma drinks exhilarated him.
11. When the soma drinks rinsed by Babhru exhilarated him, the bull set up  a bellowing among the (ritual) seats.
The stronghold-splitting Indra, having drunk of it, gave again of the  ruddy cows.
12. The Ruśamas have done this auspicious thing, o Agni, in giving four  thousand cows.
The proffered bounties of R̥ṇaṃcaya, most manly of men, we have
accepted.
13. The Ruśamas send me home well-ornamented with thousands of cows,  o Agni.
The sharp (soma-drinks, when) pressed, exhilarated Indra at the early  brightening of the night, at its final turn.
14. (When) that night brightened at its final turn, at (the hands of)
R̥ṇaṃcaya, king of the Ruśamas,
like a steed quick in competition, being driven [/anointed], Babhru won  four thousand (cows).
15. Four thousand bovine livestock have we accepted from the Ruśamas. Also the gharma pot, which was heated for the Pravargya rite, the one  made of copper, that too have we inspired poets taken.

Avasyu Ātreya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous Indra hymns in this maṇḍala, this hymn provides a survey  of Indra’s great deeds, with the ritual context for this recital made explicit  in verses 5–6 and Indra’s journey to the sacrifice sketched in verses 1–2. The  recital itself is fragmentary and mosaic-like, with glittering vignettes from  various myths juxtaposed unordered. This fragmented nature is enhanced by  abrupt switches between the past and the present/future (see, e.g., vss. 6, 11).  The stories of the chariot of the Sun (vs. 11)  and of Kutsa and Uśanā (vss.  7–10) encountered in V.29 recur here, vivid but enigmatic. The ritual context  returns in the final two verses, with Indra’s arrival at the sacrifice (12) and  prayers for Indra’s help (13). 1. Indra makes an easy slope for his chariot, the prize-seeking one, which  the bounteous one has mounted.
Like a herdsman separating the flocks of livestock, he keeps (his
chariot) separate (from the others). Invulnerable, he drives as the first  to seek winnings.
2. Run hither, you of the fallow bays; do not lose the track. You of tawny  [=golden] gifts, accompany us,
for there exists nothing better than you, Indra: you have provided even  those lacking the brideprice with wives.
3. When he was born as might from might, Indra displayed all his Indrian  powers.
He impelled forth the good milkers (who were) within the cave; he pried  apart the darkness, which was rolled up in a ball, with light.
4. The Anu people fashioned a chariot for your horse; Tvaṣṭar (fashioned)  the brilliant mace, o much invoked one.
The formulators, magnifying Indra with their chants, strengthened him  to smash the serpent.
5. When for you the bull, o Indra, the bulls and the pressing stones will  chant a chant, with Aditi in concord—
the (pressing stones like) wheel-rims which, (even) without horses,
without chariots, but impelled by Indra, rolled over the Dasyus—
6. I will proclaim your previous deeds, proclaim the current ones that you  have done, bounteous one,
when, potent one, you will pull apart both world-halves, winning the  waters, bright in drops, for Manu.
7. Just this now is your deed, wondrous poet: that smashing the serpent,  you measured out your strength there.
Even Śuṣṇa’s magic arts you enveloped; on your way to the ritual meal  you repelled the Dasyus.
8. You brought the waters, the good milkers, to rest for Yadu and Turvaśa,  (when you were their) transport, Indra.
You two drove to the strong one [=Uśanā]—that is, you conveyed
Kutsa—when the gods encountered you two along with Uśanā.
9. [Uśanā:] “O Indra and Kutsa, let the steeds convey you two, traveling  by chariot, right here close to our face [/lit. ear].
You two blow him [=Śuṣṇa?] out of the water, out of his seat; (by doing  this) you two will keep the dark shadows away from the heart of the  bounteous one.”
10. It was just this sage poet [=Indra?] who had gone, seeking help, to the  yoked horses of the Wind, so easy to yoke.
All the Maruts were your partners then, Indra; their sacred
formulations strengthened your power.
696 V.32
11. The very chariot of the Sun, (which is) in front, at the decisive turning  he will put behind, (though) it is speeding.
Etaśa [=the Sun’s horse] bore the wheel; he restores it. Putting (the
chariot?) in front (again?), he will gain our intention.
12. This Indra has come here to look about, o peoples, seeking a partner  who has pressed the soma.
The pressing stone, speaking, will be carried down to the altar—the  stone whose nimble (action) the Adhvaryus attend to.
13. Those who take pleasure [/are dear (to you)], they shall take pleasure  now [/shall be dear]. The mortals, o immortal one—let them not
encounter constraint.
Cherish the worshipful ones and place strength among these your
peoples, among whom may we be.
## 32 (386) Indra
Gātu Ātreya
12 verses: triṣṭubh
In contrast to the bricolage of the previous hymn, this hymn concentrates on a  single myth, the Vr̥tra battle, occupying verses 1–8 and providing one of the most  sustained accounts of this story outside of I.32. But this poet avoids using the stan dard formulae associated with that narrative, instead ringing changes on the nor mal phraseology (especially the áhann áhim formula: “you/he smashed the serpent,”  which does not appear as such in this hymn). Considerable attention is paid to  Indra’s opponent, but interestingly the word vr̥trá is never used. Instead he is identi fied several times as Dānava (descendant of Dānu, who is called Vr̥tra’s mother in  I.32.9, or a member of the demonic Dānu tribe) and once called śúṣṇa, usually the  name of a different foe of Indra (see, e.g., nearby V.29.9), but here probably used in  its etymological sense, “hisser.” But mostly he is nameless, a state emphasized by the  emphatic, repeated, verse-initial forms of t(i)yá- cid “that very one” (vss. 3, 4, 5, 6,  8), a sort of empty and open-ended deictic that attracts a series of shifting descrip tors of horror. The emphasis on darkness (vss. 4, 5, 6), fog (vs. 4), and emptiness (vs.  7) also suggests an indistinct enemy that lacks proper definition.
After this depiction of Indra’s great victory over the multifarious monster, it  comes as no surprise that in the next verses (9–11) Indra’s power is universally  acknowledged by cosmic forces and mortals alike. Verse 9 opens with the ques tion “who can obstruct him?”—using the verb varāte, belonging to the same root  and having the same semantics as the suppressed name Vr̥tra “obstruction.” The  question thus carries with it an implied conditional—“who can obstruct him if  Obstruction itself cannot?”—with the implicit answer obviously “no one.” The last  verse turns, as often, to the benefits Indra can bestow on the poet, ending with a perhaps teasing rhetorical question, paraphrasable as: “Do (other) poets complain  about your gifts?”
1. You violently split the wellspring; you reamed out its apertures. You  brought to peace the floods, which had been hard pressed.
When, Indra, you pried apart the great mountain, you set loose the  streams; you smashed down the Dānava.
2. You, o mace-bearer, sent speeding the wellsprings that had been hard  pressed through the seasons (in?) the udder of the mountain.
Having smashed the very serpent lying spread out for some distance,  strong Indra, you assumed your power.
3. With his powers Indra smashed away the weapon of that very one, the  great wild beast,
who was thinking himself unopposable even on his own. But then there  was born one more powerful than he.
4. That very one—drunk on his own power, belonging to them [=the  Dānavas], child of the fog, grown very strong, emerging from
darkness,
the Wrath of the Dānavas—(it was) the hisser [/Śuṣṇa] that the
mace-bearer smashed down with his mace, he who receives the
proffered bullish (soma) offering.
5. That very one (he smashed down), (so he became) sunk down in accord  with his [=Indra’s] intentions. He found just that vulnerable place of  him (who thought himself) invulnerable,
when at the proffering of the invigorating (soma) you consigned him  who sought battle to darkness, (as if) to a secure house, o you of good  dominion.
6. That very one, lying just so, horribly swollen, having grown strong in the  sunless darkness,
just him did the bull Indra, invigorated on the pressed (soma), smash  from above, after taunting him.
7. When Indra held up to the great Dānava his weapon, which was
unopposable might itself,
when at the proffering of the mace he outwitted him, he made him the  lowest of all creation.
8. The strong one [=Indra] mightily took that very one—the honey-drinker  lying on the flood, the insatiable cavity,
the footless devourer with slighting speech; with a great murderous
weapon he wrenched him down into a woeful womb.
9. Who can obstruct his tempestuousness, his power? Alone, unopposable,  he bears away riches.
Even these two goddesses [=the two world-halves] now bend (away) from  fear of his expansion, of Indra’s strength.
698 V.33
10. The heavenly hatchet [/the goddess Autonomous Power] bends down to  him; to Indra a way [/Gātu = poet’s name] yields itself, like an eager  (wife).
When he joins his whole strength with them, the settled peoples incline  themselves to the one of autonomous power.
11. I hear of you as born the sole master of settlements, belonging to the  five peoples, glorious among the peoples,
(while) my hopes have grabbed (always) for the newest Indra, calling on  him (every) evening and dawn.
12. For thus I hear of you as arranging the bounties in the proper season  and as giving them to inspired poets.
Do the formulators, your comrades, complain, who have deposited
their desire with you, Indra?
## 33 (387) Indra
Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The structure of this hymn is relatively straightforward. It begins (vs. 1) with  the poet’s praise of Indra, presented as an inducement to the god to come to his  sacrifice, followed (vss. 2–3) by the usual tropes of a “journey” hymn, includ ing the yoking of Indra’s horses. The poet recognizes that there are competing  sacrifices (vs. 4a), but continues to urge Indra to choose to come to his (vs. 5).  There follow two verses (6–7) asking for gifts from Indra. The hymn ends with  a three-verse dānastuti (8–10), praising the gift of horses from a number of dif ferent patrons.
1. I conjure up a great (praise) for the great, powerful one among superior  men, for Indra so very powerful—I who am not so powerful—
he who, praised among the people as battle-ready, takes note of the good  thought (directed) toward him at the prize-winning.
2. You, Indra, being conjured up by our chants, have fixed the yoking thong  for the fallow bays, you bull.
You will drive here just so, following your pleasure, bounteous one. You  will bring (good things); you will be victorious over the peoples of the  stranger.
3. These (horses) of yours (will) not (remain) unyoked because of us [i.e.,  because of our failure], lofty Indra, if it’s for lack of a (yoking)
formulation.
Mount on the chariot with mace in hand. You with the good horses will  hold your own rein, o god. 4. Just as there are many hymns that exist for you, Indra, and many  are (the deeds) you have done for the cow, when fighting over the
meadows,
(and many [the paths]?) you carved out also for the sun in your [/his]  own home, as bull you (have carved out) even the names of the Dāsa  in the contests.
5. We are yours, Indra—as are the superior men born as a troop
[=Maruts?] and the driving-chariots.
As a consummate warrior he [=Indra] should come here to us, o you  with the serpent’s hiss—dear, like Bhaga to be invoked at our forays  [/dear like a portion to be offered at our (ritual) presentations].
6. For, Indra, in you are strength to be nurtured and manly powers. As  prancing immortal,
give us dappled wealth, you winner of goods. I will start up the praise  for the gift of the powerfully bounteous stranger.
7. So, help us, Indra, with your help. Protect the singers, the bards, o  champion.
And please those giving the skin of the dear, well-pressed honey at the  winning of prizes.
8. And these gold-bedecked (horses) of my patron, Paurukutsya
Trasadasyu, when they are given—
let his ten white ones convey me. I am attended by the intentions of  Gairikṣita.
9. And (let) these (convey me)—the ruddy (horses) of Mārutāśva, the  bounty of his intentions at the giving of the distribution,
(when) Cyavatāna was giving a thousand of his own to me. Afterward  (the singer) sang as if to marvel (at the gift) of the stranger [=Indra]. 10. And (let) these (convey me)—the enjoyable (horses) of Dhvanya  Lakṣmaṇya, the very bright ones having being marshaled.
Through the greatness of his wealth the proffered (horses) have come,  like cows to the cowpen, (to the enclosure) of the seer Saṃvaraṇa.
## 34 (388) Indra
Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9
The first three verses of this hymn urge sacrificers to make offerings to Indra and  promise them a return on this investment of ritual energy, and the preoccupation  throughout most of the hymn is the contrast between the generous and the stingy  and their respective fates (see esp. vss. 5–7). There is a hostile and dangerous edge to
700 V.34
much of the rhetoric: the punishments Indra metes out to non-givers are described  with gusto.
But the most curious feature of the hymn is verse 4, where Indra, depicted as  the killer of the father, mother, and brother of an apparently blameless man, not  only feels no remorse (“he does not shrink from his offense”), but expects to receive  offerings from his victim. The word “offense” used here is a rare and charged one  (kílbiṣa): the uncompounded form is found only here in the R̥gveda, and the four  other (compounded) occurrences of it are in late hymns in Maṇḍala X. Our passage  here seems a foreshadowing of a theme in Indra mythology that becomes highly  developed in the middle Vedic period, that of Indra’s offenses or misdeeds, cata logued as a set of kilbiṣāṇi (see Jamison 1991: 64–68), with Indra as the figure of  a warrior run amuck. But the theme seems out of place in the context here, save  perhaps for Indra’s excessively aggressive behavior toward the stingy in other verses.  (The stingy deserve this treatment, however, in the ritual calculus of the R̥gveda; the  man violently deprived of his kin does not.)
The hymn ends with what appears to be a truncated dānastuti (vs. 9): the poet  praises his apparent patron Āgniveśi Śatri, but no gifts are mentioned.
1. Autonomous power, unaging, solar, immeasurable, speeds after him, the  wondrous, whose rival has not been born.
Press, cook for the one whose vehicle is the sacred formulation; set more  (offerings) out for the one praised by many.
2. He who filled his belly with soma, the bounteous one, drew exhilaration  from the honey, the stalk,
when Uśanā, possessing the great weapon, held the thousand-spiked  weapon (out to him), to smash the wild beast.
3. Whoever presses soma for him in the heat or whoever in the cold, he  certainly becomes heaven-bright.
The able one, the bounteous one who is partner to the poet (/Kavi
[Uśanā]), snatches off the extended (garment), resplendent on
his body.
4. The man whose father the able one has smashed, whose mother, whose  brother—he [=Indra] does not shrink (even) from him.
Rather, he actually pursues his offerings; the arranger, the distributor of  goods does not shrink from his offense.
5. He does not wish to grasp (the offerings) (only) by fives or tens. He  does not keep company with a man who doesn’t press (soma), even a  prosperous one.
He either despoils (him as he goes) along the way, or the tumultuous one  smashes (him). But he gives to the god-seeker a share in the pen full of  cattle.
6. Very energetic in the clash, affixing the wheel (to the chariot?), he is  antagonistic to the non-presser, but strengthener of the presser. Indra is the dominator of all, spreading fear; the Ārya leads the Dāsa as  he wishes.
7. He drives together the sustenance of the niggard, to steal it, but he shares  out liberal goods to the pious.
In a (place) of no exit there is held firmly each and every people that has  antagonized his power.
8. When the two wealthy peoples with all their troops (clashed) together,  Indra the bounteous pursued (them) in the (battles for) resplendent  cattle.
Since the shaker has made one of them his yokemate, he drives up for  himself the bovine (wealth) (of the other)—the tumultuous one along  with his warriors.
9. The thousand-winning Āgniveśi Śatri will I sing, the measure and the  beacon for the stranger, o Agni.
For him the waters will swell continuously; in him let there be lordly  power aggressive and ardent.
## 35 (389) Indra
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
8 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 8
A simple hymn calling on Indra for help, the word that provides the outer skeleton  of the hymn: forms of the root “help” (√av) as noun or verb are found in the first  three verses and the last two (7–8). The interior verses (4–6) simply provide conven tional praise of Indra’s powers.
1. Your resolve to help that best brings success, Indra, bring that here— the resolve that conquers the territories for us, a winner difficult to
surpass in the (contests for) prizes.
2. Whether you have four, Indra, or you have three, o champion,
or five settlements (for you to help)—bring this same help to us now. 3. We summon hither the help worthy to be chosen, the help of you, the  most bullish one,
for you were born with the speed of a bull, Indra, victorious with your  (forms of help) ready at hand.
4. For you are a bull; for benefit you were born; bullish is your power. Your daring mind has its own dominion; your masculine nature smites  entirely.
5. You, Indra, possessor of the stone—run down the mortal who acts  the foe,
chariot and all, you lord of power who possess a hundred resolves.
702 V.36
6. Just you, best smasher of obstacles, do the peoples, when they have  twisted their ritual grass,
call on for the winning of prizes—you the strong, foremost among the  many (peoples) [/in the many (battles)].
7. Our chariot, Indra—help it, the one difficult to surpass, driving in front  in the contests,
driving together (with you?) whenever the stakes (are set), seeking prizes. 8. Our chariot, Indra—come help it along with Plenitude.
We would establish desirable fame for ourselves in heaven, strongest one;  we will conceive a praise (poem) (to reach) to heaven.
## 36 (390) Indra
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3
Like the preceding hymn, attributed to the same poet, this one keeps its focus on  Indra, but is less predictable in its phraseology. The first four verses deploy a series  of similes characterizing Indra, the soma, and the singer(s). Verse 5 plays heav ily with the word “bull” (vŕ̥ṣan) for Indra and his accoutrements, a device that  returns more insistently in the first four verses of V.40. The final verse (6) is a short  dānastuti to the patron Śrutaratha (“[Having a] Famous Chariot”), whose name  may have inspired the wheel and chariot imagery of verse 3: the phrase “from the  chariot” in that verse is somewhat puzzling on the surface, but if it slyly expresses  the hope that the singer will become one “possessing many goods from (Famous)  Chariot,” it may be a prefiguring of the dānastuti.
1. He will come here—Indra, who will be attentive to the giving of the gift  of goods and riches.
Like a buffalo roaming the wasteplaces, thirsting, let him desirously  drink the milked plant.
2. Soma mounts your jaws, your lips, you champion, possessor of the  fallow bays, as the soma plant grows on the back of a mountain.
Like one driving his steeds, we all would cheer you on with hymns, o  much-invoked king.
3. Like a wheel set rolling my mind trembles with fear of neglect, o
much-invoked possessor of the stone.
Surely the singer will now praise you from the chariot, o
ever-strengthening bounteous one—(so he will become) one
possessing many goods?
4. This singer, like a pressing stone, raises his voice high to you, Indra,  panting after (you). With your left hand, bounteous possessor of the fallow bays, hold forth  wealth, and hold it forth right-handed: do not lose track.
5. Let bullish heaven strengthen you, the bull; as bull you travel with your  two bullish fallow bays.
As bull with a bullish chariot, well-lipped one, as bull with bullish will,  you of the mace, set us up in loot.
6. He who, possessing prizewinning mares, has allotted (to me) two  prizewinning chestnuts accompanied by three hundred (cows?),
to him, the youth, let the settled peoples together do homage, to
Śrutaratha, o Maruts, in friendship.
## 37 (391) Indra
Atri Bhauma
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Two verses devoted to the activities of the dawn sacrifice open the hymn; the last  two verses (4–5) describe the successes of the king whose sacrifice Indra attends,  with the king’s actions assimilated to Indra’s great deeds (Vala and Vr̥tra, both 4cd).  The middle verse (3) is a sort of riddle and serves, therefore, as a mild omphalos: the  bride in question may be Speech, as the beloved of Indra (as some have suggested),  or perhaps Dawn. The husband may be Indra, or the Sun. (We favor the Dawn/Sun  interpretation, which is in keeping with the dawn-ritual context.)
There are two pieces of onomastic verbal play that look outside the hymn  proper. In verse 3c the phrase “his chariot will seek fame” (śravasyād ráthaḥ) recalls  the name of the patron Śruta-ratha, whose praise ended the previous hymn (V.36.6).  And the phrase “with the radiance of the sun” (bhānúnā ...sū́ryasya) in the first  pāda of the hymn (1a), describing Agni, is actually the solution to the story of  Svar-bhānu (“[Having] the Sun’s Radiance”) told in V.40.5–9. It is especially appro
priate to find this answer given at the beginning of this hymn here, as it is the first in  a series of hymns attributed to Atri, among which is V.40.
1. He [=Agni] aligns himself with the radiance of the sun, being bepoured,  with ghee on his back, of lovely outlook.
The non-neglectful dawns will shine forth to him [=sacrificer] who says  “Let us press (soma) for Indra.”
2. With his fire kindled and his ritual grass spread, he will win; with his  pressing stones yoked and his soma pressed, he will sing;
whose pressing stones speak vigorously, he will go, as Adhvaryu, down  to the river with an oblation.
3. Here she goes, a bride seeking a husband who will take her home as  vigorous chief wife.704 V.38
His chariot will seek fame here and will sound loudly here; it will roll  itself for many thousand (leagues).
4. That king does not falter, by whom Indra drinks the sharp soma whose  comrades are cows.
He drives (the cows) here with his warriors, he smashes Vr̥tra; he
dwells peacefully, prospering the settled peoples, bearing the name
“Well-portioned.”
5. He will prosper in peace, and he will prevail at the hitching up (for  war); (when) the two opponents are clashing together, he will entirely  conquer;
he will become dear to the Sun, dear to Agni—the one who with pressed  soma will do ritual service to Indra.
## 38 (392) Indra
Atri Bhauma
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
Geldner, the most authoritative twentieth-century translator of the R̥gveda, pro nounced this hymn empty of content (“inhaltslos”). This judgment does not seem  entirely fair, but the hymn is characterized by a certain lack of syntactic coherence,  as well as an overabundance of elaborate vocatives addressed to Indra. It is not  clear who the second god is in verse 3, though he is possibly Varuṇa; otherwise the  hymn only makes reference to Indra.
The hymn is in some ways a twin to the following one, sharing vocabulary  and thematics, but the second hymn provides only limited help in interpreting  this one.
1. Extensive is the giving of your broad largesse, o Indra of a hundred  resolves.
So make ready to give to us brilliant things, you of good lordship who  govern all domains.
2. What praiseworthy thing you appropriate as your nourishment,
strongest Indra,
that spreads itself as having the longest fame, difficult to surpass, o you  of golden hue—
3. (As do) your tempests, which serve your will in profusion, o possessor of  the stone.
Both you gods rule over both heaven and earth to dominate them.
4. And (you rule) over this skill of yours, whatever it may be, for us, o  Vr̥tra-smasher.
Bring manly power here to us: you are manly minded toward us.
5. Now through these dominating forces of yours (may we be) in your  shelter.
May we be provided with a good herdsman, o Indra of a hundred
resolves; may we be provided with a good herdsman, o champion.
## 39 (393) Indra
Atri Bhauma
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
As was already noted, this hymn is paired with V.38, sharing some vocabulary and  themes, but this one is more coherent in both syntax and thought. The first three  verses urge Indra to give in abundance, while in the last two (4–5) the poet urges his  fellow Atris to praise the god.
1. What is given by you in profusion, bright Indra, possessor of the stone, that largesse bring here to us with both hands full, you finder of goods. 2. What you consider worthy to be chosen, that heaven-ruling thing bring  here, Indra.
Might we know you as the unbounded (ocean) for giving.
3. Your thought, famed and lofty, which is eager to give, should be realized. With it split apart even the strongholds for plunder to win, possessor of  the stone.
4. Most bounteous of bounteous ones, the king of the settled domains, Indra (do I call) nearby for you [=Atris?] to eulogize. He takes pleasure  in the hymns as well as the many (eulogies).
5. Just for him a poet’s speech, for Indra a solemn word worthy to be  pronounced;
for him whose vehicle is the sacred formulation the Atris strengthen their  hymns, the Atris beautify their hymns.
## 40 (394) Indra and the Myth of Svarbhānu [Anukramaṇı: Indra ̄ 1–4, Sūrya 5, Atri 6–9]
Atri Bhauma
9 verses: uṣṇih 1–3, triṣṭubh 4, anuṣṭubh 5, 9, triṣṭubh 6–8
This hymn falls into two parts. It opens with four verses praising Indra in his bull ish aspect, with hypnotic repetition of the word vŕ̥ṣan “bull.” The remainder (vss.  5–9) contains an allusive account of the myth of Svarbhānu, who “pierces the Sun  with darkness,” and the Sun’s rescue by the seer Atri, a myth much treated in middle  Vedic literature. For extensive discussion of the myth and this R̥gvedic version of it,  see Jamison (1991: Part II, pp. 131–303).
706 V.40
The myth makes sense once the identity of the mysterious enemy of the Sun is  solved: Svarbhānu, literally “he who possesses the radiance of the sun,” is actu ally the Sun’s earthly counterpart, the god Agni. He punished the Sun for the lat ter’s incestuous intercourse with his daughter (not mentioned in this hymn, but  frequently found elsewhere), but because of the importance of sunlight for the  maintenance of the world, the Sun had to be restored by the seer Atri (also the  supposed poet of this hymn) through ritual means. The physical manifestations of  the Sun’s punishment betray his attacker’s identity: “pierced with darkness” refers  to sunspots, dark spots on the sun as if burnt by fire, and the enveloping darkness  of smoke is depicted in verse 6.
Note that the Svarbhānu portion (5–9) is a perfect omphalos hymn. The two  outer verses (5, 9) are multiforms of each other and in a different meter from the  verses in between; the middle verse (7) is the only direct speech; the intermediate vss.  (6, 8) both mention Atri in the singular, both deal with the māyā́ (“magic spells”) of  Svarbhānu, and both have complementary vocabulary: diváḥ/diví, sū́ryam/sū́ryasya,  gūḷhám/aghukṣat, bráhmaṇā/brahmā́.
1. Drive hither. Drink the soma pressed with stones, you lord of soma— bullish Indra, with your bulls, best smasher of obstacles.
2. Bullish is the pressing stone, bullish the exhilarating drink, bullish this  pressed soma here.
Bullish Indra, with your bulls, best smasher of obstacles.
3. Bullish I call upon you, the bullish, o possessor of the mace, with your  bright help.
Bullish Indra, with your bulls, best smasher of Vr̥tra.
4. Possessor of the soma-dregs, possessor of the mace, the bull overcoming  the powerful, the tempestuous king, smasher of Vr̥tra, soma-drinker— having yoked them, he will come hither with his two fallow bays. Indra  will become exhilarated at the Midday Pressing.
5. When, o Sun, Svarbhānu Āsura pierced you with darkness,
like a befuddled man not knowing the territory did the living beings  perceive.
6. Then, o Indra, when you smashed down from heaven the circling magic  spells of Svarbhānu,
Atri with the fourth formulation found the sun, hidden by darkness  because of (an act) contrary to commandment.
7. [The Sun:] “O Atri, let him not, deceived by jealousy and fear, swallow  me, who am one of yours.
You are an ally whose bounty is real; do you and King Varuṇa help
me here.”
8. The possessor of the sacred formulation [=Atri], having yoked the  pressing stones, serving the gods with plain reverence, doing his
utmost, Atri placed the eye of the sun in heaven. He hid away the magic spells of  Svarbhānu.
9. Which sun Svarbhānu Āsura pierced with darkness,
that one the Atris found, for no others were able.
The following series of hymns to the All Gods / All the Gods (V.41–51) contains  some of the most complex and difficult poetry in the R̥gveda (along with some rest fully more straightforward hymns), including the hymn that Geldner called “the  hardest hymn in the R̥gveda” (“das schwierigste Lied des R̥V”), V.44. Although the  placement of this series within the Saṃhitā was dictated by the strict and mechani cal rules of numerical arrangement discussed before (see Intro. pp. 10–11), it is  sometimes difficult for us not to view this set of hymns as a type of omphalos in  the larger structure of the R̥gveda. They are found in more or less the middle of  Maṇḍala V (which has 87 hymns), which is more or less the middle maṇḍala of  the Family Books (II–VII—keeping in mind that, though V is preceded by three  maṇḍalas and followed by two, the preceding maṇḍalas are shorter: II–IV contain  163 hymns, VI–VII 179, remarkably close to equivalence). Just as the omphalos  verse in a hymn contains the enigma, the mysterious message of the hymn, so we  could view these All God hymns as the mystical center of the older R̥gveda.
## 41 (395) All Gods
Atri Bhauma
20 verses: triṣṭubh, except atijagatī 16–17, ekapadā virāj 20
This hymn is quite intricate on the verbal level, though in paraphrase and in  translation it may seem to lack interest. Every verse (but 17) names at least one  divinity—many verses have several—chosen from among both the most promi nent gods of the Vedic pantheon (e.g., Mitra and Varuṇa in vs. 1) and distinctly  marginal figures like Āptya (vs. 9). There does not seem to be any one dominant  god or set of gods: though the Maruts are mentioned more than any other gods  (vss. 2, 5, 11, 13, 16), there is little particularly Marutian vocabulary or imagery.  (It might be remembered, however, that the longest series of Marut hymns in the  R̥gveda, the Śyāvāśva hymns of remarkable poetic quality, immediately follow the  All God hymns in this maṇḍala [V.52–61]). The content of the hymn as a whole  seldom deviates from invitations to the sacrifice with promises of offerings, and  prayers for divine gifts in return. Verses 16–17 are in a different meter and seem to  be bringing the hymn to a close, especially 17, in which, as often, the poet makes  a meta-reference to the hymn just concluded. If this is so, verses 18–20 are an  afterthought.
The seemingly unordered series of gods who receive the honor of a verse (or part  thereof) may exemplify a covert theme of choice or alternatives, underlined by the
708 V.41
use of the simple conjunction “or” (vā) as the verbal “hero” of the beginning of the  hymn (vss. 1–3, returning at the end, vss. 15, 19).
Unfortunately other pieces of verbal play are essentially untranslatable, like  the unusual sequence of two monosyllables at the end of the first half-verse of  verse 1:... vā dé (“or...to be given”), which, scrambled, produces the target of the  hymn: devā(ḥ) “gods.”
1. Which one now, performing the truth for you two, Mitra and Varuṇa, is  to be given (a good thing) from great heaven or one stemming from
the earth
or (one) at the seat of truth [=ritual ground]—you two should protect  us—or which of you two (is ready) to give prizes to the sacrificer like  the prizes for one who wins cattle?
2. They—Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Āyu, Indra lord of the R̥bhus, and the  Maruts—shall take pleasure in us,
or (in those) who with reverences provide a well-plaited (hymn), a praise  for Rudra who gives rewards—(they, the gods) in joint enjoyment.
3. You two Aśvins, driving quickest on the flight of the wind, in the  flourishing of your chariotry, are to be summoned hither.
Or (you priests), present a thought to the lord of heaven [=Rudra], like  (soma) stalks to the worshipful.
4. The heavenly victor with Kaṇva as Hotar, (i.e.,) Trita from heaven, and  the Wind, and Agni in joint enjoyment,
Pūṣan, and all-nourishing Bhaga have come to the (ritual) presentation  like those with swiftest horses to a contest.
5. Present your wealth of yoked horses; for help in the quest for wealth a  visionary thought should be produced.
The Hotar [=Agni] is well disposed because of the ways of (the company  of) fire-priests, which are (also?) the ways of you powerful ones, o
Maruts.
6. Set Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot, in front; in front the god, the  inspired admirer, with your chants—
(you,) aiming (straight), serving the truth, (set in front) the creators of  plenty. Let them, (like?) good wives, create (plenty) here (in exchange)  for our visionary thought.
7. I hasten to the two young maidens of heaven with your praiseworthy  fortifying (hymns), with conspicuous chants.
Night and Dawn, like ones who know all, through the days convey the  sacrifice here for the mortal.
8. I chant for you to the men granting prosperity, to the Lord of the  Dwelling-Place, to Tvaṣṭar, as I give;
with reverences (I chant) to the trees, the plants, along with the rich Holy  Place, in the quest for wealth. 9. Let the mountains behave like family, to thrust out progeny for us— they who are like good heroes.
Āptya, admired, always worthy of our sacrifice, the manly one, will  strengthen our laud in preeminence.
10. I have praised the embryo of the terrestrial bull, (as) Trita (has praised)  the Child of the Waters with a well-twisted (hymn).
Agni is sung with fortifying (hymns) like (a horse) at running.
Flame-haired, he liquefies the trees.
11. How shall we speak to the great Rudrian (troop) [=Maruts]; what (shall  we say) to observant Bhaga, for wealth?
Let the waters and the plants help us, and Heaven, the woods, and the  mountains whose hair is trees.
12. Let him hear our hymns—the lord of nourishments; he [=Agni] is the  vigorous encircler, passing more quickly than a cloud.
Let them hear—the Waters, resplendent like the fortifications of a
mountain that encloses the offering ladles [=cows].
13. Just by our knowledge, o great ones [=Maruts], we shall say which are  your ways, wondrous ones, as we acquire what is choice.
And like birds, those of good essence [=Maruts] swoop down here
in pursuit with their fluttering to the mortal held by murderous
weapons.
14. I will call on the heavenly and earthly breeds and on the waters for the  good battler (/very bounteous one) [=Indra].
Let the days increase and the hymns tipped with gold; let the waters, the  conquered floods increase.
15. Step after step old age has been secured for me, either (by her) who is  the able Shielding Goddess or by the protectors.
Let the mother, the great Rasā, accompany us along with our patrons,  she with hands outstretched, with winnings outstretched.
16. How might we ritually serve with reverence those of good drops,  the Maruts traveling their ways, at the invitation—the Maruts of
advancing fame, at the invitation?
Let Ahi Budhnya not set us up to suffer harm. For us let there be
winnings at the distribution (of prizes).
17. In just these words now, for the sake of offspring along with cattle, the  mortal (seeks to) win you, o gods—the mortal (seeks to) win you
here, o gods.
Otherwise Dissolution might swallow the secure depository beneficial  to this body, my own old age.
18. Might we obtain that favor of yours, o gods, good ones, the nourishing  refreshment of the cow, through (this) recitation.
That gracious goddess of good drops [/gifts] should come toward us at  a run, for our welfare.
710 V.42
19. Let Iḍā, mother of the flock, greet us, or let Urvaśī, along with the  rivers.
Or Urvaśī Br̥haddivā, being sung, covering herself, (mother) of the
(ritual) presentation, mother of Āyu,
20. Of the nourishing prosperity [/of the prosperity of Ūrjavya]—let her  accompany us.

18 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 17
Like the last hymn, this one enumerates a number of different gods to whom we  direct our praise, beginning, as V.41 did, with Mitra and Varuṇa, and the concern,  as in that hymn, is generally the ritual exchange of mortal praise for immortal gifts.  Or such is the structure of the opening (vss. 1–6) and concluding (vss. 11–18) sec
tions of the hymn. In the middle (vss. 7–10) Br̥haspati (in vs. 10 with the Maruts)  is called upon to be generous to generous patrons but to unleash destructive power  against stingy patrons and non-sacrificers. As Hanns-Peter Schmidt has noted,  these hostile actions are uncharacteristic of Br̥haspati but typical of Indra, just  as the association of Indra with the sacred formulation in verse 4 would be more  expected of Br̥haspati than Indra. He therefore argues (1968:  84–86) that verses  4–10 form a unity in this hymn, with Br̥haspati serving as an epithet of Indra.
Although the gods in the enumerative verses are often named, some verses  are riddles, describing the god without naming him (1cd, 6, 13, 14) or naming  him only in the second half of the verse (3, 11). Such puzzles are common in All  God hymns.
At the end of the hymn (vss. 14–17) the poet expresses the hope that his praise  should reach in all directions, to all three worlds, creating wide space for him and  his companions (in the final single-pāda verse 17). (Verse 18 is adopted from Aśvin  hymns later in the maṇḍala [V.76.5, 77.5], perhaps to introduce the Aśvins, who are  otherwise unmentioned, into this All God hymn.)
1. May the most availing hymn now reach Varuṇa with its visionary power;  may it reach Mitra, Bhaga, Aditi.
Let him hear it—the lord whose womb is the dappled (cow/ghee), who  has five Hotars, whose path cannot be transgressed, who is joy itself  [=Aryaman].
2. May Aditi grab hold of my praise, like a mother the beloved son of  her heart.
The dear sacred formulation that has been established by the gods, that  is joy itself to Mitra and Varuṇa—may I (grab hold of it). 3. Rouse the best poet of poets. Wet him with honey, with ghee.
He—god Savitar—will propel to us the golden goods that have been  held forth and set out.
4. Through your thought, Indra, join us with cows, with patrons, with  well-being, o possessor of the fallow bays—
and with the sacred formulation established by the gods, with the favor  of the gods who are worthy of the sacrifice.
5. God Bhaga, Savitar, Share of Wealth [/Aṃśa], Indra, the complete  victor over Vr̥tra and riches,
the lord of the R̥bhus, Vāja [=a R̥bhu], and Plenitude—let the powerful  immortals aid us.
6. We will proclaim the deeds of the one accompanied by the Maruts  [=Indra], unopposable, victorious, unaging.
None previous to you, bounteous one, nor later, nor anyone at all right  now has achieved your manly power.
7. Praise the first conferring of treasure; (praise) Br̥haspati, the winner of  riches,
who, the most wealful for him who chants and praises, will come here,  with many goods, to the one who repeatedly invokes (him).
8. O Br̥haspati, the bounteous ones accompanied by your help, who are  invulnerable and possessing good heroes,
who are givers of horses or givers of cows, who are givers of garments,  the well-portioned ones [=patrons]—on them (confer) riches.
9. Dissipate the possessions of those who benefit by our hymns without giving. Those violating the commandments, grown strong at forward thrusting,  the haters of the sacred formulation—keep them away from the sun. 10. Whoever lauds the demons at the invitation to the gods, run him over,  Maruts, with your wheel-less (chariots).
Whoever will scorn the labor of the one who labors for you, he will  render his own desires empty when he sweats (at ritual labor).
11. Praise him, who has the good arrow and the good bow, who holds sway  over every healing remedy.
Sacrifice to Rudra for great benevolence; with acts of reverence offer  friendship to the god, the lord.
12. The masters of the house, the workmen who have good hands
[=R̥bhus?], the wives of the bull, the rivers fashioned for wide
extension,
Sarasvatī, Br̥haddivā, and Rākā—let the resplendent ones, showing
favor, create a wide realm (for us).
13. I present to the great one who grants good shelter [=Tvaṣṭar] wisdom  (in the form of) a hymn just newly being born,
to him who, bulging [?] in the belly of his daughter, changing his forms  [=Tvaṣṭar as father of Viśvarūpa?], made this (world? form?) for us.
712 V.43
14. May our lovely praise now reach to the thundering, bellowing lord of  refreshment [=Parjanya], o singer—
to him who, rich in clouds, rich in water, sets in motion the two
world-halves with his lightning, as he sprinkles them.
15. May this praise reach up to the Marutian troop, to the youthful sons  of Rudra.
Desire calls me to wealth with well-being. Praise the unruly ones with  dappled horses.
16. May this praise reach to earth, to the midspace, to the trees, to the  plants, for wealth.
Let every god be easy for me to invoke. Let Mother Earth not set us in  disfavor.
17. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods.
18. May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy  itself and provides good guidance.
Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here  all that brings good fortune.

Atri Bhauma
17 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 16
Like many All God hymns, this one enumerates in individual verses divinities deserv ing praise, and the emphasis is on the ritual and the gods’ presence at and participa tion in it. There is perhaps more detail about ritual performance than in many such  hymns (see, e.g., vss. 1, 3–7), and this focus on the ritual is observable in two other  features of the hymn. On the one hand, the god Agni dominates the last part of  the hymn (vss. 12–15), under the name/epithet Br̥haspati in verse 12, unnamed but  clearly identified by his characteristics in verse 13, called Āyu in verse 14, and finally  named in verse 15ab. Such concentration on deified ritual fire in an All God hymn is  somewhat surprising. Further, the middle verse of this hymn (excluding the repeated  verses at the end), verse 7, is directed not toward a god but a ritual implement, the  gharma pot, used in the Pravargya ritual and often the focus of priestly speculation.
1. Let the milk-cows, swift to their tasks, not neglectful, come close to us  here with their milk, their honey.
For great wealth, the inspired poet, the singer keeps invoking the seven  lofty (cows [=rivers?]), who are joy itself.
2. With lovely praise, with reverence Heaven and Earth are to be turned  hither—they who are not neglectful with regard to the prize-contest. The Father, the Mother who has honeyed speech and good hands—let  the two glorious ones aid us in every bout. 3. Adhvaryus—having made the honeyed (drinks), present the pure dear  (soma) to Vāyu.
Like the Hotar, drink first of this honey of ours, god; we have given it  to you for your exhilaration.
4. The ten fingers and the two arms hitch up the stone—the two arms with  good hands that are the laboring priests [/quellers] of soma.
The plant, well(-handled by) the fists, has milked out the sap of honey  that dwells on the mountain, shimmering and pure.
5. The soma has been pressed for you who have enjoyed (it)—for will and  skill, for lofty exhilaration.
Indra, bring nearby the two dear fallow bays, those amenable to the  chariot-pole at the yoking to your chariot, when you are being
invoked.
6. Hither to us, in agreement (with her), (bring) great Devotion [/Aramati],  lady goddess, on whom the oblation is bestowed with reverence,
the lofty knower of truth—for the exhilarating drink of honey, bring  her hither, Agni, along the paths the gods travel.
7. The one which the inspired poets anoint, like (the ritual grass) as they  spread it, heating it with fire like (the offering of the sacrificial
animal) with its omentum:
the truth-(sing)ing gharma (drink/pot) has been set here on the fire like  the dearest son on the lap of his father.
8. Let the great, lofty, most availing hymn come like a messenger to invoke  the Aśvins.
(O Aśvins,) joy itself, drive nearby on the same chariot; go to the
treasury (of honey) as if to the chariot-pole, like the axle-pin into the  wheel-nave.
9. I have shown forth an expression of reverence to the very strong,  powerful Pūṣan and to Vāyu,
who are impellers of thoughts by reason of their bounty and
treasure-givers of the prize in their own nature.
10. Convey all the Maruts according to their (individual) names, according  to their (individual) forms, o Jātavedas, when you are invoked.
The sacrifice, the hymns, and the lovely praise of the singer—all you  Maruts, all come (to these) with your help.
11. Hither to us from lofty heaven, from the mountain let Sarasvatī,  deserving the sacrifice, come to the sacrifice.
Let the goddess, having enjoyed our call, turning toward the ghee, listen  willingly to our capable speech.
12. Here on the seat make him sit—the ritual adept, dark-backed, lofty  Br̥haspati (as Agni).
Sitting on his womb, shining here in the house, golden-colored,
reddish—(him) may we serve.714 V.44
13. The enduring one belonging to lofty heaven, the bestower—let him  come with all his succors when he is invoked—
clothing himself in his wives, the plants, not neglectful, a bull with
tripartite horn, conferring vigor [=Agni].
14. In the highest, gleaming footstep of the mother of Āyu [=Urvaśī] the  admiring abundant [?] ones have come.
With their oblations bestowed with reverence, they groom the beloved  child [=Agni] in his dwelling place, like the Āyus.
15. Lofty vigor for lofty you, Agni, do those rivalrous (priestly) pairs, who  reach old age through their insight, pursue.
Let every god be easy for me to invoke. Let Mother Earth not set us in  disfavor.
16. May we come to be in broad unconstricted (space), o gods.
17. May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy  itself and provides good guidance.
Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here  all that brings good fortune.

Avatsāra Kāśyapa, etc.
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14–15
As noted above, Geldner considers this the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda (“das  schwierigste Lied des R̥V”), and a judgment very like this is shared by other schol ars (e.g., Oldenberg, who deems most of it “uncertain or hopeless” [“meist fraglich  oder hoffnungslos”]). Although in our opinion there are numerous contenders for  “hardest hymn” in the R̥gveda (X.106, for example, some of which appears to be
written in unbreakable code), this one is certainly near the top of any such list. The difficulties are found in every aspect of the hymn, beginning with the fact  that the divine subject(s) of the various verses of the heart of the hymn are never  identified. Then there are lexical problems:  a number of rare words or hapaxes;  morphological problems, including unusual inflectional and derivational morphol ogy; syntactic problems such as frequent lack of verbs, unclear referents, unclear  syntactic roles, and so on—not to mention a general lack of superficial coherence,  both between verses and within verses. For all these reasons, the translation given is  provisional in general and in many details.
Nonetheless, it is possible to form a hypothesis about what the hymn is “about,”  and this hypothesis allows one to interpret many of the ambiguities within this  framework. Our translation reflects this hypothesis, and in a number of places  bracketed identifications have been inserted to guide readers—though we have tried  to keep these to a minimum, to avoid too much clutter in the poetry itself, which despite its frequent lack of clarity possesses, in our opinion, both power and beauty,  and to allow readers to produce their own interpretations of the hymn. To be brief, the hypothesis with which we operate is that each verse is applicable  to both Agni and Soma, the two crucial deified ritual substances, and therefore  many of the verbal contortions are the result of attempting to produce phraseology  that is meaningful for each god simultaneously. (This hypothesis is adumbrated by  Geldner in his introduction to the hymn, where he suggests that some verses can be  read with intentional double reference to Agni and Soma, though he clearly does  not consider the whole hymn in this light.) The final two verses (14–15), in a differ ent meter and almost mechanically responsive to each other, mention both Soma  and Agni, and may be intended as an implicit answer to the riddle posed by the  rest of the hymn. In any case, if our hypothesis is correct, the poem is the forerun ner of the much later kāvya tours de force in which, for example, the plots of the  Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa are narrated at the same time.
The Soma/Agni simultaneity is especially prominent in the first part of the hymn.  Toward the middle of the hymn (starting around vs. 8) another theme emerges, that  of the poet learning his craft, seeking true speech. What unites the two themes is  the sense that poetic inspiration comes from the ritual itself and from the mysteries  of the identification of the two most important ritual substances, so that the poet  gains his verbal mastery as the sacrifice progresses. But it is also the case that the  sacrifice needs his poetry in order to be properly carried through, and so the poetic  skill the poet gains from his contemplation of the mysteries of the sacrifice is put to  use immediately in the next verses (9–11), and the result always desired by R̥gvedic  sacrificers, the epiphany of Indra on the sacrificial ground, is achieved in verse 12.  Because of his contribution to the success of the sacrifice, the poet is lauded in the  last verse (13) before the responsive solution to the riddle as the foundation of the  whole sacrifice. Thus, the hymn is both a static meditation on a central sacrificial  mystery and a roughly chronological progression through the sacrifice.
One of the enigmatic features of the hymn found throughout the hymn is the  regular presence of unidentified feminine plurals (vss. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11), espe cially intriguing in verse 7. Identifying the likely referent(s) for these feminines as  the hymn unfolds shows the developing complexity of the hymnic universe of dis course. In the earlier part of the hymn the feminines most probably refer, in the  realm of Agni, to the streams of ghee offered into Agni (and also perhaps to the plants  he burns)—while, in the realm of Soma, to the waters that swell the soma stalks  and to the cows’ milk mixed with the pressed soma. As the figure of the poet joins  the hymn, the feminines can have a third set of referents, the insights that provide  him with poetic inspiration and the words/songs that result from them. (All of the  underlying nouns in all three referential systems are feminine in gender and con ceptually female.) This complex web of reference is beautifully (or dauntingly) on  display in verse 11. In our reading of this verse all three sets of feminines are not  bound, that is, not in use, when the soma is being brought to the ritual and the sacri fice has not yet started. But when soma the plant is made into soma the exhilarating
716 V.44
drink, all three sets of feminines are hitched up: the poet’s words are recited, the  streams of milk approach the pressed soma, and the streams of ghee are poured  into the fire. The priests direct the various females to their appropriate goals, and at  the end of the ritual they are “unhitched.”
As an aside, we might mention what appears to be a sly joke, located in almost  the middle of the hymn (minus the final riddle-solving verses): in 6a, after five verses  of exhausting enigmas with many more to come, the poet says, “Just as he appears,  so is he said (to be)”—an assertion about the transparent clarity of the subject that  the frustrated audience may view with bitter irony. However, it is of course not  merely a joke, for the poet’s task is to find the hidden mystical truths of the universe  and express them in true words, in bráhman. No matter how superficially baffling,  the bráhman captures how “it really is,” and so the poet asserts here.
Although numerous puzzles remain in the hymn, we hope to have shown that  it is far from “hopeless.” It can be read as a consistent unity (though the unity we  see may not be the only possible one), and, as so often with complex hymns in the  R̥gveda, it is a meditation not only on the ritual but also on poetic craft.
1. Him—in the primordial way, in the earlier way, in every way, in this way  here—(him who is) preeminence (itself), who sits on the ritual grass
and finds the sun,
him facing toward (our) community will you milk out with song, the swift  one conquering (the cows? the waters?), among whom you grow strong. 2. Lovely to be seen for beauty are those (tips [of flame/soma streams]),  which are the sun of the lower (realm). (As the possessor) of (those)  tips who shines forth (even) for the one who doesn’t impel (largesse), you are a good herdsman, not for deceiving, o strong-willed one. Far  beyond the trickeries of magic your name was (set) in truth.
3. The steed does the oblation follow (and) its [=oblation’s] elements are  true; the Hotar who goes without harm brings might.
Always stretching out along the ritual grass, the bullish child, the
unaging youth is placed in the middle with his outgrowth.
4. These (hymns?) of yours, easy to yoke, (go) forth on their course to seek  the twinned sisters [= butter offerings/waters], strong through truth,  that (go) downward toward yonder one [=Agni/Soma],
with reins easy to control, directing everything. Krivi [=Agni/Soma/the  poet (<kavi)?] steals (their) names [=butter offerings/waters?] at their  precipitous fall.
5. Quivering with your powers of endurance (toward) the one covered  with little “twigs” that grasps (you) at the pressing [=firewood/sheep’s  fleece?], resounding among the clearly pregnant (females [=plants/
waters/cows]),
you beautify yourself at the recitations for the streams, o you with a  straight song. Wax strong over the wives, (you who are) alive in the
ceremony. 6. Just as he appears, so is he said (to be): They united (him) with his  effective shadow in the waters—
(him) who wins wideness for us—(wins) the great (earth), the broad  expanse, and lofty immovable might that brings good heroes.
7. (When) unwed, he pursues (women); once he has wives, he truly  out(strips) (all) contenders with a mind that seeks conflict—(as) the  sun, the sage poet.
He with his goods near at hand will vanquish the (sun’s) heat and will  win shelter for us, which protects (our) patrimony on all sides.
8. He [=poet] pursues the older sonority of the seers by means of (you  [=Agni/Soma]), the beacon of this arrangement [=sacrifice]. Among  which (females [=waters/cows/insights]) your name (is),
in whatever (place) it has been set, he will find it [=sonority of the seers]  through his industry. He who makes the journey by himself, he will
get it right.
9. The foremost of these (females) has stepped down into the ocean (of  soma). The pressing is not harmed into which she is guided.
Here the heart of the working poet [?] does not tremble, where the
thought is found that is his bond to the purified (soma/fire).
10. For he (has a bond) with the insights of the mental lordship of the  one deserving the sacrifice, who speaks just so and aims toward the
same goal.
With the delightful (poems) [/lusty (warriors)] of the stealthy one we  shall win the most expansive prize, to be brought to success only by  the wise.
11. (While still) a falcon, (soma) is unboundedness for these (females  [=poems/waters/cows]); (when it becomes) the exhilarating drink, it  is their girding—for the one deserving the sacrifice, provided with all  desirable things, master of artifice.
They [=priests] make (the females) set their goal to go to one after the  other (of Soma and Agni) in turn. They know (that) unharnessing
and drinking in rounds (are) at hand.
12. The one worthy of the sacrifice, always granting, has smashed away  hatreds. “Twisted” (here) by the arms [=activity (of you, the priests)],  finding (the praise) that is heard, he is surpassingly in partnership
with you.
He [=Indra] comes in response to both the choice ones [=Agni and
Soma], and he is radiant when he has a share in the troop [=Maruts]  with their (chariots?) that drive forth easily.
13. Bearing the pressed (soma) of the sacrificer, master of the settlements,  he [=poet] is the udder, the ladle of all visionary thoughts.
He bears the (two) milk-cows [=Heaven and Earth, or Agni and Soma];  the milk, full of sap, has been brought to perfection. The one who
recites following (his teacher), he learns, not the one who sleeps.
718 V.45
14. Who stays awake, him the verses desire; who stays awake, to him go the  melodies.
Who stays awake, to him does this Soma say: “I am at home in
fellowship with you.”
15. Agni stays awake: him the verses desire. Agni stays awake: to him go the  melodies.
Agni stays awake: to him does this Soma say, “I am at home in
fellowship with you.”

Sadāpr̥ṇa Ātreya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A lovely hymn, both narrating the opening of the Vala cave by the power of the  Aṅgirases’ poetic speech and welcoming the dawn of a new day and the sunrise on  that mythic model. The hymn begins (vss. 1–3) with a description of sunrise, with  no overt mention of the myth, though it clearly lurks in the background. The poet is  concerned to apply the mythic model to the current sacrificial situation. He initiates  the ritual in verse 4, and then in the two, paired, middle verses in the hymn (5–6),  an omphalos, he exhorts his priestly comrades to achieve the poetic vision (dhī́)  that has served others well in the past. The particular past he has in mind becomes  clear in the following two verses (7–8), which depict the opening of the Vala cave  and the Aṅgirases’ role in it. The next two verses first pray that the Sun will come up  (9) and then announce that he has arisen (10). The exhortations in verses 5–6 have  worked! In the last verse (11) the poet (addressing himself, as well as his priestly  colleagues) exults over this success: “the poetic vision that wins the sun,” the same  one that the Aṅgirases possessed, has now been acquired, and it will bring welfare  to the community. It is noteworthy that Indra, the usual hero of the Vala myth, is  not mentioned in connection with it (though he does make an appearance in vs. 4);  presumably the poet wishes to identify himself and his priestly comrades with the  chorus of Indra’s associates, the Aṅgirases, rather than with the god.
A brief grammatical digression is necessary here in order to show the particular  artfulness of this hymn. As noted, the first three verses already describe, in some  detail, the dawn and the sunrise, and so it might be thought that the sunrise in  verse 10 is an anticlimax. But a remarkable fact about the first three verses is that  the description of the sunrise there is couched almost entirely in the verb form  known as the injunctive, which has no overt marker of tense. Although its default  interpretation is past tense, it can be used also to depict “timeless” events. (Since  English lacks such a verbal category, we have used the present tense here.) The sun rise in verses 1–3 is both the mythic model of the Vala-Aṅgiras narrative and, more  important, the ideal sunrise to which the poet aspires. In contrast to the insistent injunctives in these verses, when today’s sunrise, the successful result of the sacri ficers’ and poet’s efforts, is depicted in verse 10, all four verb forms have the overt  marker of past tense, the so-called augment, making it clear that the sunrise there  has indeed (just) occurred. Another example of R̥gvedic poets’ sensitivity to gram matical categories and their ingenious deployment of them.
1. Through knowledge unloosing the stone of heaven with hymns—the  shining (beacons) of the approaching dawn come (out of it)—
he uncloses (the doors) to the enclosures: the Sun comes up. The god has  opened up the doors belonging to the sons of Manu.
2. The Sun unlooses his beauty like an ensign; the mother of the cows  [=Dawn], recognizing (the way), comes here from the pen.
The rivers (of light) have floods (broad and high) like plains, have  floods that chew (their banks). Heaven becomes firm like a
well-fixed pillar.
3. In response to this hymn here the womb of the mountain (gapes open)  for the primordial birth of the great ones [=dawns].
The mountain gapes open; heaven achieves success; desiring to win the  earth, they [=poets/Aṅgirases] exhaust themselves.
4. With well-spoken words pleasing to the gods, Indra and Agni are now to  be called upon by you for help,
for with solemn speeches sage poets of good sacrifice who desire to win  always sacrifice to the Maruts.
5. Come on now! Today let us become possessed of good poetic vision. Let  us send misfortune forth a wide way away.
Let us put hatreds aside in the distance; let us go forward to the
sacrificer.
6. Come on! Comrades, let us create (the same) poetic vision with which the  mother opened the enclosure of the cow,
with which Manu conquered Viśiśipra, with which the wandering
merchant reached the overflowing source (of goods?).
7. The (pressing) stone, guided by the hand, bellowed there, the stone along  with which the Navagvas sang for ten months.
Saramā, going after the truth, found the cows; the Aṅgiras made all  things real.
8. When all the Aṅgirases roared along with the cows at the brightening of  this great (dawn),
at the fountainhead of them [=cows], in the highest seat, Saramā found  the cows along the path of truth.
9. Let the Sun drive here with his seven horses to the tract of land
stretching widely at (the end of) his long course.
Let the quick falcon fly to the stalk and the youthful poet shine as he  goes among the cows.
720 V.46
10. The Sun has mounted the gleaming flood, now that he has yoked his  golden, straight-backed (horses).
Like a boat through the water the wise ones guided him; the waters,
giving heed, stood still nearby.
11. You have acquired the poetic vision that wins the sun in the waters, with  which the Navagvas passed ten months.
Through this vision may we be those who have gods as our herdsmen;  through this vision may we pass beyond constraint.

Pratikṣatra Ātreya
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 2, 8
Renou pronounces this hymn “banal,” and certainly the long enumeration of divin ities, listed with little or no characterization or action, does not engage the audience  in the same way that the intricacies of the previous All God hymns in this maṇḍala  do. However, there are two features of note in the hymn, and these features have, in  our view, a covert connection. The hymn ends with two verses praising the Wives  of the Gods in general and particular gods’ wives by title: Indrāṇī, Agnāyī (wife of  Agni), Aśvinī, Varuṇānī (vs. 8); the Wives (of the Gods) are also mentioned in verse  2, and other goddesses are also featured in the hymn: Sarasvatī (vs. 2), Aditi (vss. 3,  6), the Waters (vs. 3), the Rivers (vs. 6). The second feature is that the first verse is  very different from the rest—the invocation of divinities only begins in verse 2. In  verse 1 the 1st-person poet-sacrificer describes himself as hitched to a chariot-pole  and, despite the effort involved, does not wish to be released from this yoking.
Now it is certainly possible that the yoking image only refers to the poet-sacrificer’s  usual tasks at the sacrifice. However, in conjunction with the emphasis on the gods’  wives (pátnīḥ) later in the hymn, we suggest that what this hymn is ever so delicately  concerning itself with is an important and controversial innovation: the introduc
tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pátnī) as a necessary participant in the ritual. As has  been argued elsewhere (Jamison 2011, forthcoming a and b), though the Sacrificer’s  Wife is a fixture already in early middle Vedic ritual (see Jamison 1996a), there is  no evidence for her participation in early R̥gvedic ritual. The introduction of the  Sacrificer’s Wife in the middle to late R̥gveda (presumably beginning with only one  or a few priestly circles) seems to have been, understandably, controversial, and  though it is not referred to directly in the text, there are covert arguments, pro  and con, in a number of hymns. One of the important images of the new ritual  pairing of Sacrificer and Wife is that of a pair of draft-animals jointly yoked to a  chariot-pole (e.g., VIII.33.18, X.102.10), pulling the sacrifice together, though with  the husband maintaining a slight edge in strength and effort. It seems quite possible  that this image is found in verse 1: the male yoked to the pole, pulling a feminine referent (the chariot-pole, which is grammatically feminine, but also secondarily the  wife), and with no desire to return to the old state of affairs. The last word in this  verse, neṣati “he will lead,” reminds of the priestly title, Neṣṭar “Leader,” the priest  whose duty it is to lead the Sacrificer’s Wife around the sacrificial ground in later  śrauta ritual; he is already marginally represented in the R̥gveda as a leader of the  Wives of the Gods (see especially I.15.3).
If this scenario is correct—that verse 1 represents an argument in favor of the  new model of sacrifice including the Sacrificer’s Wife—then the lists of gods that  follow might be a form of insurance. Every possible divinity is called upon to wit ness and give tacit approval to the innovation. And the Wives of the Gods, who  provide the divine model for the Sacrificer’s Wife, are called on especially insistently  to come to the sacrifice and provide their help and support.
1. I, a knowing one, have yoked myself like a courser to the chariot-pole;  I draw it [/her=ritual wife], which [/who] furthers (the sacrifice?) while  seeking help.
I do not desire to be released from it [/her], nor to turn back here  again. The knowing one who goes in front will lead straight along  the paths.
2. O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, (All?) Gods, o Marutian troop and  Viṣṇu—provide!
Both of the Aśvins, Rudra, and the Wives (of the Gods), Pūṣan, Bhaga,  Sarasvatī shall enjoy themselves.
3. Indra and Agni, Mitra and Varuṇa, Aditi, the Sun, Earth, Heaven, the  Maruts, the Mountains, the Waters—
I call on (and on) Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, also on Fortune, Laud,  Savitar, for help.
4. And may Viṣṇu and Wind—the unfailing ones—the Treasure-Giver and  Soma create joy for us.
And may the R̥bhus and Aśvins, and Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan, consent to  wealth for us.
5. And may there come to us here this Marutian troop, dwelling in heaven,  worthy of the sacrifice, to sit on the ritual grass.
May Br̥haspati and Pūṣan provide to us shelter for defense, and Varuṇa,  Mitra, and Aryaman.
6. And may these mountains, receiving good praises, and the very bright  rivers be (there) for our protection.
May Bhaga, the apportioner, come here with capacity (and) help. Let  Aditi of broad extent hear my call.
7. The Wives of the Gods—let them willingly help us; let them help us to  propagate, to win prizes.
(You) who belong to the earth, (you) who (live) under the commandment  of the waters, you goddesses, receiving good invocations, give
shelter to us.
722 V.47
8. And let the ladies, the Wives of the Gods pursue (the offering)—Indra’s  wife, Agni’s wife, the Aśvins’ queen.
Let Rodasī and Varuṇa’s wife pay heed. Let the goddesses pursue (the  offering), which is the regular season for women.

Pratiratha Ātreya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Each verse in this short hymn presents a riddle: a description of a god or divine force  whose name is withheld till late in the verse (1, 2) or suppressed entirely (3–6). This is  not an uncommon tactic in All God hymns—a particularly deft example is VIII.29.  This hymn presents several twists on this device. First, the characterizations seem regu
larly intended to mislead. For example, verse 1 has a feminine subject, and given the  actions ascribed to her, the audience would expect the subject to be Dawn. But instead  it is (Poetic) Inspiration (manīṣā́), here identified as the mother of Dawn (presumably  because early-morning ritual poetry awakens Dawn and impels her to appear). Again,  the attributes of the subject in verse 2 suggest Agni’s flames, but the actual referent,  the last word of the verse, is “Paths.” Second, the riddles get harder as the hymn pro
gresses. As was already noted, in verses 1 and 2 the solution is given, but thereafter it is  not. In verse 3 the solution is fairly obvious by the end of the verse, but in verse 4 it is  less so. Verse 5 announces itself as an enigma, and it seems to have double application  to both the Sun and Agni. There is no agreed upon solution for verse 6.
Although this observation is unconnected to the riddle structure just discussed,  each verse (but 5) has a form of div/dyu “heaven” (mostly diváḥ) (vs. 5 has d(u)vé “two,” which is phonologically close). The final pāda of the hymn is an “homage to  Heaven.” Although this homage was not prepared thematically in the hymn, it was  prepared verbally, by the repetition of the stem in various syntactic and semantic  contexts.
1. Hitching up, she comes from heaven, she who is called the great mother  of the Daughter (of Heaven [=Dawn]), waking (men),
seeking to win, the youthful one, (coming) from the fathers, constantly  calling in the seat (of the sacrifice)—(she is) Inspiration.
2. The nimble ones, hastening at their work, having mounted the nave of  the immortal one,
the endless, broad ones encircle heaven and earth on all sides—(they are)  the Paths.
3. (He is) a bull, the sea, a reddish eagle (that) entered the womb of the  age-old father.
The dappled stone deposited in the middle of heaven strode across (the  sky); he protects the two ends of the airy realm: (the Sun). 4. Four bear him, affording rest; ten give the infant suck, for (him to) move. Threefold are his highest cows; they circle around the ends of heaven in a  single day: (Agni?).
5. Here is the wonder, the enigma, people: that the rivers move, but the  waters stay,
that two, other than his mother, bear him—the two were born hither and  yon but are twins, of the same lineage: (Sun and Agni).
6. They stretch out their insightful thoughts, their (ritual) labors (as warp)  for him; the mothers weave garments for their child.
The bulls, delighting in coupling, go to their wives along the path of  heaven.
7. Let this, o Mitra and Varuṇa, let this (hymn), o Agni, be luck and  lifetime for us; let it be recited here.
Might we obtain a fording place and firm standing. Homage to Heaven,  the lofty seat.

Pratibhānu Ātreya
5 verses: jagatī
Another enigmatic hymn, made more baffling (as in a number of All God hymns in  Maṇḍala V) by the lack of named referents for the descriptive phrases. There is cer tainly no consensus among scholars about these referents or about the purpose and  structure of the hymn; indeed, a number of scholars consider this a “fragment.” We  find this unlikely, however. The fact that the most difficult verse by far is the middle  one (3) suggests that this is an omphalos hymn, and moreover the final pāda (of vs.  5) is typical of a hymn ending.
In our opinion the hymn is appropriate to an early-morning ritual, and the two  main referents are Dawn (/Dawns) and Agni. It begins with a typical rhetorical ques tion: what poem to compose for the establishment of the ritual fire at dawn? The  second half of verse 1 and first half of verse 2 present striking images of dawn  (/dawns) breaking, ending verse 2 with a standard meditation on the aging that  every new day brings to mortals. This thought is continued in verse 3, though the  focus passes to Agni, who day after day at the ritual prepares the mace for Indra  when Indra is present at the sacrifice, while the recurrent dawns mark the passage of  time. Agni as the ritual fire remains the subject of the remainder of the hymn (vss.  4–5), with his identity becoming clearer and clearer.
1. What shall we compose for the self-ruling, self-glorious great one  [=Agni?] for his own dear establishment,
when the mistress of artifice [=Dawn?], choosing the waters in the dark  cloud of the variegated dusky realm, stretches them forth.724 V.49
2. They [=Dawns] have spread their hero-strengthening tracery along the  same course through the whole dusky realm.
A man devoted to the gods drives away the backward-facing (dawns)  ever behind (him), and lengthens (his life) with those in front.
3. Along with the pressing stones, through (the periods) of the day and  through the nights, he [=Agni?] sprinkles [=prepares] the best mace,  when the master of artifice [=Indra?] (is there)—
while into his own [=Agni’s] house (the Dawns?) proceed by the
hundred: rolling up the days, they unroll them (again).
4. I have looked upon this stream(ing) of his [=Agni], like (the swing) of an  axe; I have looked upon his face, for the enjoyment of his form,
when concurrently he establishes a treasure like a dwelling place
abounding in food for the clan whose cry is “carry (the day).”
5. The four-faced one stretches with his tongue out straight, wearing  pleasing (garb), putting the stranger in place (as) Varuna (does).
We do not know, because of our human state, that (source?) from which  Bhaga and Savitar will give what is choice.

Pratibha Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This hymn picks up where the previous hymn ended, with the gods Savitar  (“Impeller”) and Bhaga (“Fortune”) and their bounty to mortals. These two gods  are the topic of verses 1 and 2 here, and the first four (of five) verses concern the dis tribution of treasures to men, with a widening circle of gods responsible for these  gifts. The context (as vs. 3 makes especially clear) is the distribution of dakṣiṇās  (priestly gifts) at the early-morning ritual. Verse 5 asks for more general blessings  than just wealth, but in its references to the “formless void” and to “wide space,”  it also seems to depict dawn, which creates visible and articulated space from  formlessness.
1. I hasten toward god Savitar for you today, and toward Bhaga who  apportions the treasure of Āyu.
I would also turn hither you two superior men, who bring many
enjoyments—seeking companionship with you, o Aśvins, day
after day.
2. In response to the advance of the lord, as a knowing one offer friendship  to god Savitar with hymns.
A discerning one should call on (him) with reverence and on the
preeminent one who apportions the treasure of Āyu. 3. Traveling to those lacking gifts, (each god) distributes valuables—Pūṣan,  Bhaga, Aditi—at the dawning of the ruddy (Dawn).
Indra, Viṣṇu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni—the wondrous ones beget lucky days. 4. Then Savitar without assault is our defense, then the nurturing rivers  follow suit,
when, as Hotar of the ceremony, I call upon (them). May we be lords of  wealth, with prizes as our treasure.
5. Those who have presented such great reverence to the good ones, who  possess well-spoken speech for Mitra and Varuṇa,
let the formless void go away (from them); make a wider space (for
them). With the aid of Heaven and Earth may we rejoice.

Svastyātreya Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This little hymn is surprisingly beset by difficulties, especially of syntax, reference,  and meter. A particularly intricate set of syntactic constructions modulates from  the singular “everyman” of verse 1, through an indefinite plural 3rd person, also  representing men in general (“they” 2ab), to an identification of those indefinite  men with “us” (2cd)—all of whom desire wealth and the companionship of the  god “Leader,” identified by the later tradition with Savitar (whom we met in V.49),  though this identification is not necessary.
The scene shifts to the sacrifice in the next two verses (3–4), and the “we” of verse  2 becomes the “you” in verse 3, exhorted to do honor to the gods and their wives  as guests at the sacrifice. The identities remain off-balance, however: the verb used  for “honor” is one whose subject is usually a god and whose object a mortal, so  role reversal is implied. And the gods are not identified as “gods,” but rather called  “men”—using the word nŕ̥, which refers to especially elite, noble, or worthy men, and  is often elsewhere applied to gods. Verse 4 depicts the mythic model of the soma sacri fice, with Indra invigorated by soma to be a winner. This leads us back to god Leader  and prayers for wealth and well-being in response to our ritual offerings (vs. 5).
1. Every mortal would choose the companionship of the god Leader. Every one aims at wealth and would choose brilliance, in order to thrive. 2. They are yours, god Leader, as are the ones who (set out) to mimic them. As those—for they are to be infused (with good things)—may we be  accompanied by wealth, by (other) desirable accompaniments.
3. Therefore, (all of you,) show favor here to the superior men [=gods] as  our guests, also to their wives.
Let the repeller repel into the distance anything standing in the path and  (all) hatreds.
726 V.51
4. When the harnessed draft-animal will run, the beast seeking the wooden  cup [=soma],
the manly minded one [=Indra], with a dwelling full of heroes, (will) win  the floods, like wise (thoughts?).
5. This Lord of the Chariot is yours, god Leader. Luck (be) Wealth— luck (be) for wealth, luck for well-being! Let us conceive praise songs as  refreshment; let us conceive praise songs for the gods.

Svastyātreya Ātreya
15 verses: gāyatrī 1–4, uṣṇih 5–10, jagatī or triṣṭubh 11–13, anuṣṭubh 14–15
The last of the All God hymns in Maṇḍala V, this hymn is far too long (fifteen  verses) for the position it holds, after a series of five-verse hymns. It is also not  unified metrically. It likely originally consisted of separate hymns, verses 1–4, 5–7,  8–10, with 11–15 as a later addition.
Both in content and form, all the segments are simple, predictable, and closely  tied to the soma-drinking of various gods, especially those appropriate to the morn ing soma-pressing. This collection of strictly liturgical verses provides a curious  finale to the highly wrought, intellectually challenging, and deeply serious All God  hymns in this collection.
1. O Agni, to drink of the pressed (soma), come here with all your helpers, with the gods, for the giving of oblations.
2. (All of) you whose insights are truth, whose ordinances are real, come  here to the ceremony.
Drink with the tongue of Agni.
3. You comrade, inspired poet—come here with the inspired poets, the  early-traveling
gods, to drink the soma.
4. Here is the soma, pressed in the cup, poured around in the basin— the one dear to Indra, to Vāyu.
5. Vāyu, relishing (them), drive hither to pursue (the oblations), for the  giving of oblations.
Drink of the pressed stalk to your satisfaction.
6. Vāyu and Indra, you have the right to the drinking of these pressed  (soma drinks).
You flawless ones, relish them to your satisfaction.
7. The pressed soma drinks mixed with curds are for Indra and for Vāyu. Like rivers to the deep, they go to satisfaction.
8. Jointly with all the gods, jointly with the Aśvins, with Dawn,
drive hither, Agni. Take pleasure in the pressed soma, as (you did) at Atri’s. 9. Jointly with Mitra and Varuṇa, jointly with Soma, with Viṣṇu,
drive hither, Agni. Take pleasure in the pressed soma, as (you did) at  Atri’s.
10. Jointly with the Ādityas, with the Vasus, jointly with Indra, with Vāyu, drive hither, Agni. Take pleasure in the pressed soma, as (you did) at  Atri’s.
11. Well-being let the Aśvins, let Fortune mete out to us; well-being let the  goddess Aditi, let the unassailable ones.
Well-being let lord Pūṣan establish for us; well-being let Heaven and  Earth, with kind attention.
12. For well-being we shall call upon Vāyu, on Soma; well-being (let him  mete out) who is lord of creation.
On Br̥haspati with his whole flock (we shall call) for well-being. For  well-being let the Ādityas be there for us.
13. Let all the gods be there for us today, for well-being; let Vaiśvānara,  Vasu, Agni (be there) for well-being.
Let the gods, the R̥bhus give aid for (our) well-being. With well-being  let Rudra protect us from constraint.
14. Well-being, o Mitra and Varuṇa, well-being, o rich Path.
Well-being for us (let) Indra and Agni—well-being, o Aditi, make
for us.
15. With well-being we would follow along our path, like the Sun and  the Moon.
May we meet up with one who gives in return, who does not smite, with  one who knows.
Maṇḍala V contains the largest collection of Marut hymns in the R̥gveda,  V.52–61, plus V.87. The ten sequential hymns, 52–61, attributed to Śyāvāśva  Ātreya, are poetry of the highest order—inventive, exuberant, and beautifully  crafted—and they capture both aspects of the Maruts:  their social existence  as a sort of Männerbund, a group of young, handsome, high-spirited war
riors, and their naturalistic existence as personifications of the monsoon/thun derstorm—without losing sight of their divinity and the benefits they provide  to men.
## 52 (406) Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
17 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6, 16–17
As befits the first hymn in this Marut cycle, the poet Śyāvāśva addresses himself  with an exhortation to praise the Maruts in the first pāda of the first verse. He then
728 V.52
describes them in a general fashion and asserts their right to the sacrifice, in a short  ring-compositional introduction (vss. 1–5). (For the responsions of verses 1 and 5  as an example of “poetic repair,” see Jamison 2006.)
The next section of the hymn (vss. 6–13) depicts the Maruts as the gods of the  thunderstorm in a series of vivid images and also fancifully assigns individual  names to them (vss. 10–11)—the Maruts are otherwise undifferentiated—ending  with another exhortation to the poet to praise them (vs. 13cd). In the last few verses  (14–17) ritual honor is given to the Maruts, and they respond with gifts. The last  verse (17) resembles a dānastuti, but with the Maruts, rather than humans, as the  donors to the poet; they were already identified as “patrons” (sūrí) in the two pre
ceding verses (15–16).
The density of imagery throughout is remarkable; we will give just one example,  from verse 9. There the Maruts are said to “clothe themselves in wool in the Paruṣṇī River.” The “wool” must stand for foam, off-white and fluffy like newly shorn wool.  But the river foam is yet another metaphorical substitute for something else, namely  clouds, which the Maruts as storm gods would be clothed in—all of this conveyed  in an economical half-verse.
1. Śyāvāśva, chant forth boldly—along with the Maruts possessing chants, who rejoice in [/cheer on] undisguised fame according to their own
nature, those worthy of the sacrifice.
2. For they are comrades of steadfast strength—boldly.
Bold on their drive, by themselves they protect each and every one.
3. They, like streaming bulls, spring across the nights.
Then the Maruts’ might in heaven and earth we ponder.
4. Among the Maruts we would establish your praise and
sacrifice—boldly—
who all, through human (life)spans, protect the mortal from harm.
5. The deserving ones possessing good drops [/gifts], men who are not  half-strength,
to the Maruts of heaven chant forth—(chant) a sacrifice for those worthy  of the sacrifice.
6. (Arrived) here with brilliants, here with battle, the lofty men have  launched their spears.
Following them (came) the lightning flashes—following the Maruts like  giggling (girls). The radiance of heaven has arrived by itself.
7. Those who have grown strong as earthlings, who in the broad midspace, or in the precinct of the rivers, or in the seat of great heaven—
8. Exalt the Marut troop, of real strength, ingenious.
The men, streaming, hitch up by themselves for beauty.
9. And they clothe themselves in wool [=foam] in the Paruṣṇī (River)—they  (like) preening water-birds—
and with the wheel-rim of their chariots they split the stone with force. 10. “On the Path,” “Off the Path,” “Within the Path,” “Along the Path”— with these names they vaunt themselves to me at the bestrewing of the  sacrifice.
11. Then they vaunt themselves as “men (come) down”; then they vaunt  themselves as “teams”;
then as “those from afar.” Their bright forms are worthy to be seen.
12. Chanting in rhythm, seeking water, (like) light-weights they pranced to  the wellspring.
They (seemed indistinct) to me like who knows who, like thieves
(concealed), but the helpers (then) came to glitter in my sight.
13. Which lofty ones, whose spears are lightning flashes, are (also) sage  poets, ritual adepts—
to this Marut flock, o seer, do homage and bring it to a halt with song. 14. To the Marut flock, o seer, (approach) with a gift, as a maiden being  given (in marriage) (approaches) her ally [=spouse?].
Or from heaven do you, bold ones, praised with poetic thoughts, speed  with strength.
15. Now (a man) paying mind to them, (who approaches) to the gods as if  to udders,
he would keep company with a gift, through (the auspices of) the
patrons famed on the course [=Maruts] and by their unguents.
16. Those who proclaimed the cow to me on my seeking (their) lineage, the  patrons called Pr̥śni their mother,
then they called their father arrow-possessing Rudra—(they) the
skillful ones.
17. Seven upon seven the able ones gave me hundreds, one (hundred) each. At the Yamunā (River) a famous thing—I swept up bounty in cattle;  swept down bounty in horses.

A metrically complex hymn, though there is no reason to consider it a composite.  The internal groupings, mostly two-verse units, follow those suggested by Oldenberg  (1888: 106–8). The hymn mingles descriptions of and wishes for the Maruts’ jour ney here with descriptions of the storm and the desirable rain the Maruts bring,  and indeed the Maruts and the rains are sometimes identified, sometimes modulate  from one to the other.
730 V.53
The hymn opens (vss. 1–2), as often, with questions—what is the origin of  Maruts and where have they gone? The Maruts themselves answer, indirectly, in  verse 3, and demand praise, which is forthcoming in verse 4. The description of a  storm follows (vss. 5–7), and the Maruts are urged to come here with their rains  (vss. 8–11). The poet returns in verses 12–13 to the question raised at the begin
ning: to what sacrificer have the Maruts gone? The hope is of course that they have  come or will come to us, and the blessings we wish to receive are detailed in the final  verses (14–16.)
1. Who knows their birth? Or, who was previously in the graces of the  Maruts,
when they yoked their own spotted (female antelopes)?
2. Those mounted on their chariots—who heard (them)? How did
they drive?
Toward what good giver, (what) friend, did they flow along (as) friends,  (as) rains (flow) with their refreshments?
3. They say to me—those who drove hither through the days along with the  birds, in exuberance,
the men, unblemished young bloods: “When you see them here,
praise them!”
4. Who in their unguents, who in their axes have their own radiance—and  in their garlands, in their brilliants, in their spangles,
with splendor in their chariots, in their bows.
5. It is following your chariots (when they come) that I take my place for  delight, you Maruts of lively drops [/lively gifts],
(I delighting) like the heavens (following the waters) when they come  with their rain.
6. When the men of good drops [/gifts] have stirred the bucket of heaven  here for the one doing pious work,
they send the thunder(storm) surging out along the two world-halves;  along the wasteplaces come the rains.
7. The rivers, having bored with their gush through the dusky realm, have  flowed forth like milk-cows,
like horses that have streamed from the road at their unharnessing, when  the dappled females turn aside.
8. Drive hither, Maruts, from heaven, from the midspace, and from  nearby.
Do not stay away at a distance.
9. Let not the Rasā (River), the Anitabhā, the Kubhā, the Krumu, let not  the Sindhu bring you to a halt.
Let not the overflowing Sarayu hem you around. On us alone let your  favor be. 10. Your troop of chariots, the glittering Marut flock of newer (“hymns”  [=thunderclaps])
do the rains come following after.
11. Your every troop of these (chariots), every swarm, every flock, with  good chants
we would stride after, with poetic thoughts.
12. To what well-born one, who had given an oblation, have they driven  forth today
along this course—the Maruts?
13. —Along which (course) you convey the imperishable granular seed to  offspring and descendants.
Establish for us what we implore you for: generosity through our whole  lifetime and good fortune.
14. May we cross over beyond scorners through your blessings, having left  behind imperfection and hostilities.
When it rains, the waters are luck and lifetime; at dawn they are
medicine. May we be together with (them/you), o Maruts.
15. Well provided with gods and with heroes in every way will that
mortal be
whom you protect, o men, o Maruts. May we be those (mortals).
16. Praise the benefactors of the praiser on the journey of this (flock). They  will take pleasure as cows do in a pasture.
Invoke them as they go, like old comrades. With song sing (to) those  who desire it.

Śyāvāśva Ātreya
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14
One of the most intensely descriptive of the Marut hymns, with shifting images  of the violent thunderstorms and welcome rain that they provoke. There is no  particular progress or development in the hymn, just the succession of exuberant  descriptions. The last three verses (13–15) shift to prayers for the Maruts’ gifts  and help.
1. Forth—for the Marut troop with its own radiance I will anoint this  speech, for (the troop) shaking the mountains,
for (the troop) with the rhythm of the gharma pot, sacrificing on the  back of heaven, of heaven-bright fame—sing (forth) their great
manliness.
732 V.54
2. Forth, o Maruts, (go) your forceful, water-seeking, vigor-increasing,  horse-yoked, swirling (chariots?).
They join with lightning; Trita [/the third (heaven)] bellows. The waters  resound, swirling in their streambed.
3. With lightning as their might and stones as their missiles, the superior  men, the Maruts, turbulent as the wind, shaking the mountains, (though) just with a desire to give water, roll hailstones in an instant— (they) with thundering onslaught, violent, overpowering.
4. Through the nights, o Rudras, through the days, you skillful ones,  through the midspace, through the dusky realms, you shakers,
through the fields when you drive, like boats (through the water)— through (all these places) of difficult going, o Maruts, you never  suffer harm.
5. This is your heroism, your greatness, o Maruts: it stretches across a long  wagon-trek [=measure of distance], like the sun.
(You are) like antelopes on your journey, with ungraspable brilliance,  when you have overrun the mountain that does not give horses
[/gives non-horses (=cows?)].
6. When the heaving troop has flashed, o Maruts, you will plunder the tree  like a caterpillar, you (ritual) adepts.
Then in concert you will lead Proper Thinking [/Aramati] to us along  an easy way, like the eye (of the sun? of the traveler himself?)
(leading) the traveler.
7. He is not conquered, o Maruts, nor is he slain, nor does he fail, nor  waver, nor suffer harm,
nor do his riches give out, nor his help—the seer or the king whom you  will “sweeten.”
8. The Maruts have teams (of horses) like men who conquer in  roving bands; they have (water) skins [=clouds] like hospitable
(householders):
they swell the wellspring. When the strong ones have sounded, they  inundate the earth with the stalk of honey.
9. This earth slopes gently for the Maruts; heaven becomes gently sloping  for them when they go forth;
the paths of the midspace slope gently; gently slope the mountains of  lively drops.
10. While—you Maruts of equal gravity, you sunlike men, you men of  heaven—you become exhilarated when the sun has risen,
your horses certainly never slacken as they run. In a single day you  reach the far limit of this road.
11. On your shoulders spears, on your feet spangles; on your breasts  brilliants, o Maruts, on your chariot charms.
Lightning bolts with the flash of fire in your fists, golden (helmet-)lips  stretched out on your heads. 12. The vault whose brilliance is ungraspable for the stranger do you,  Maruts, shake for the gleaming fig [=rain].
The communities huddle together when (the Maruts) have grown
turbulent. The truth seekers sound an extended cry.
13. May we be the charioteers of the vigorous wealth given by you,  discriminating Maruts,
which does not stay away (from us), any more than Tiṣya [=Dog Star]  from heaven. By us enjoy (wealth) in thousands, Maruts.
14. You, Maruts, (aid) our wealth consisting of coveted heroes; you aid the  seer inspired in his melody.
You (establish) a charger and a prize for Bharata; you establish a king  with attentive hearing.
15. For this treasure I beseech you, you of immediate aid, by which we will  extend (our control) over men like the sun.
Take pleasure, Maruts, in this speech of mine, by whose enduring
power may we pass through a hundred winters.

10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
The first nine of the ten verses in this hymn end with a refrain, “as they drove in  beauty their chariots rolled along,” which sets the theme of the hymn. Rather than  focusing on the thunderstorm and its accompanying rain (mentioned only inciden tally in vs. 5), as in the last few Marut hymns, this one primarily concerns their  journey through the midspace. The hymn ends with a few verses (9–10) of invitation  to the sacrifice and prayers for benefits.
1. The Maruts, worshiped at the forefront of the sacrifice, with glinting  spears and brilliants on their breasts, assumed their lofty vigor.
They speed with their horses, swift but easy to control. – As they drove  in beauty their chariots rolled along.
2. You yourselves assumed your power, as you know (how). Loftily, you  great ones, widely do you reign [/shine forth].
And through the midspace they measured themselves with their
strength. – As they drove in beauty their chariots rolled along.
3. Born all at once, good in essence, grown all at once, just for splendor the  men increased even further,
shining forth like the rays of the sun. – As they drove in beauty their  chariots rolled along.
4. Your greatness is to be emulated, o Maruts; the sight of you is desirable  to see like the sighting of the sun.734 V.56
And establish us in immortality. – As they drove in beauty their
chariots rolled along.
5. You raise (water) from the sea, o Maruts; you make the rain rain, you  overflowing ones.
Your milk-cows do not wear out, you wondrous ones. – As they drove  in beauty their chariots rolled along.
6. When you have yoked your dappled (mares as) horses to the
chariot-poles and you have fastened on your golden cloaks,
all rival contenders do you disperse, o Maruts. – As they drove in
beauty their chariots rolled along.
7. Not the mountains, not the rivers obstruct you. Where you have set  your attention, Maruts, you go just to that.
And around heaven and earth you drive. – As they drove in beauty their  chariots rolled along.
8. What previously, Maruts, and what now—what is spoken and what is  recited,
of all that you become cognizant. – As they drove in beauty their
chariots rolled along.
9. Be merciful to us, Maruts; do not slay us. To us spread out ample  shelter.
Give study to our praise song, our fellowship. – As they drove in beauty  their chariots rolled along.
10. Do you lead us to a better (state), away from dire straits, Maruts, when  you are being hymned.
Enjoy our oblation-giving, you who deserve the sacrifice. May we be  lords of riches.

Śyāvāśva Ātreya
9 verses: brhat ̥ ī, except satobrhat ̥ ī 3, 7
Unlike the previous Marut hymns, this one introduces—and indeed begins with— other personnel besides the Maruts. The first word in the hymn is a vocative  addressed to the god Agni, and he (or perhaps the poet) is addressed elsewhere in  the hymn (vss. 2, 5). The Earth appears in verse 3 as a literally battered woman, a  remarkable image, and this female figure anticipates that of Rodasī, frequent com panion and consort of the Maruts, in verses 8–9.
The poet repeatedly calls the Maruts to come here: the forms “I call,” “we call,”  and “calls” frame and punctuate the hymn (vss. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9), while the invocation of  Agni at the beginning and the description of Agni in verse 7 establish the sacrifice as  the goal of their journey. But it is the verses describing the journey itself (especially  3–4) that are the most memorable part of this hymn. 1. O Agni—the vaunting flock, emblazoned with brilliants, with unguents, the clans of the Maruts I call down here today, even from the luminous  realm of heaven.
2. Just as you [=Agni? poet?] conceive with your heart, in the same way my  hopes have gone.
Those who will come closest to your calls, strengthen them of fearsome  appearance.
3. Like (a woman) with a generous (lover), Earth, beaten aside (by your  onslaught) [/sexually penetrated], being ecstatic, (seems to) recede
from us.
Like a bear is your strenuous onslaught, o Maruts, fearsome like a
headstrong ox.
4. Those who liquefy (the trees) with their strength, at will, like oxen averse  to the yoke,
even the reverberant stone, the mountain, the peak do they shake on  their journeys.
5. Rise up(, o Agni? poet?)—now with praises for these who have grown  strong together.
I call the (flock) of the Maruts, best of many, which no one can
precede—(call the flock) like a swarm of cows.
6. Yoke your reddish (mares) to your chariot; yoke the chestnuts to your  chariots.
Yoke the two nimble fallow bays to the chariot-pole, to pull—the two  best pullers to the chariot-pole, to pull.
7. And this reddish racehorse here [=Agni], powerfully noisy, has been set  here to be seen.
Let him not make you too long on your journeys, o Maruts: spur him  forth on the chariots.
8. The Marutian chariot, seeking fame, do we now call here,
on which there stands, bearing great delights, Rodasī in company with  the Maruts.
9. This troop of yours, beauty on the chariot, vibrant, inviting admiration  do I call here,
in which the noble, well-portioned (Rodasī) shows her greatness, the  generous one in company with the Maruts.
## 57 (411) Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7–8
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one introduces other personnel besides  the Maruts, though not ones tied specifically to the sacrifice. The hymn begins by
736 V.57
addressing the Maruts by their father’s name, “o Rudras,” a vocative that returns  in verse 7. Their mother Pr̥śni also figures in the hymn, in verses 2 and 3. The first  verse also describes them as “accompanied by Indra” (índravantaḥ). It is notable  how rarely Indra is mentioned in hymns dedicated to the Maruts, even though  they are his sidekicks and supporters from an Indraic point of view. In the whole  Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V this is the only appearance of Indra, and it is tellingly  phrased: Indra is himself treated as a sidekick, demoted into a possessive adjec
tive: “possessing/accompanied by Indra.” It is ordinarily the Maruts who have this  grammatically subordinated role:  the adjective marútvant (“possessing/accompa nied by the Maruts”) is very common and regularly modifies Indra.
In this hymn, then, the Maruts are defined first by their parentage and their  companion. The other elements that define them are their attributes, both physi cal and mental, lists of which are given in verses 2, 4, 5, and 6, constituting a  virtual iconography of the Maruts in verbal form. This listing modulates imper ceptibly into the beginning of verse 7, a list of goods possessed by the Maruts  that they have give to the singers, a subtle way of moving to the requests of the  final verses (7–8).
The vivid description characteristic of Marut hymns is not absent here. See espe cially verses 2–3, with the Maruts as the storm.
1. O Rudras—accompanied by Indra, of one accord, with your golden  chariots, come here for good faring.
Here is a poetic thought from us for you to yearn toward, like the
wellspring of heaven for a thirsty man seeking water.
2. You with your axes, your spears, your inspired thoughts, with your good  bows, your arrows, your quivers,
you possess good horses, good chariots, you whose mother is Pr̥śni.
Possessing good weapons, you drive in beauty, Maruts.
3. You shake heaven and the mountains for goods for the pious. The trees  duck down with fear at your journey.
You make the earth quake, you whose mother is Pr̥śni, when, o powerful  ones, you have yoked the dappled (mares) for beauty.
4. The Maruts—having the wind’s turbulence and a cloak of rain, quite  alike in appearance like twins, well-ornamented,
having tawny horses and ruddy horses, unblemished, projecting power,  wide like heaven in their greatness.
5. Possessed of many droplets [/banners], of unguents, of good drops,  whose appearance is turbulent, whose gifts are not withdrawn,
noble by birth, with brilliants on their breasts, chant(er)s of heaven, they  share an immortal name.
6. Spears are on your shoulders, Maruts; might, strength, power placed in  your arms.
Manly forces on your heads, weapons on your chariots. All splendor has  been emblazoned on your bodies. 7. Rich in cows, in horses, in chariots, in good heroes, in gold—(such)  largesse you have given to us, Maruts.
Make good our eulogy, Rudras. Might I have a share in your divine help. 8. – Hail, Maruts, superior men! Be merciful to us—o you of great bounty,  immortal, knowing the (immanent) truth,
hearing the realized (truth) [=poetic formulations], sage poets, youths,  belonging to the lofty mountains, loftily growing.

Śyāvāśva Ātreya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Another pleasing Marut hymn with the typical mixture of storm imagery (see esp.  vss. 6–7) and portrayal of a wild but beneficial Männerbund. In this latter capacity,  the Maruts are seen as the source of various earthly counterparts (vs. 4). Another  common theme, the lack of distinction among the various members of the band, is  also mentioned (vs. 5). As in V.56.3 a sexual relationship between the Maruts and  the Earth is depicted (vs. 7), though without the shock value of the earlier passage.
1. Now will I praise this (flock) full of power, their Marutian flock of newer  (hymns [=thunderclaps]),
those possessing swift horses who drive themselves impetuously and who  as self-rulers are masters of the immortal—
2. The turbulent, powerful flock with bangles on their hands, of boisterous  commandment, masters of artifice, granting wishes,
who are joy itself, immeasurable in their greatness. O poet, extol the  powerfully generous men.
3. Let the water-conveyors come here to you today, all the Maruts who  speed the rain.
This fire which is kindled here, o Maruts, enjoy it, you sage poets, youths. 4. You beget for the people a take-charge king, fashioned for distinction,  you who deserve the sacrifice.
From you comes the fist-fighter, quick with his arms, from you the one  of trusty horses and good heroes, o Maruts.
5. Just like wheel-spokes, there is no last one; like the days they keep  arising, not stingy with their mighty powers.
The sons of Pr̥śni, highest, wildest—the Maruts have equipped
themselves with their own poetic thought.
6. When you have driven forth with your dappled mares, your horses, with  your chariots with their firm wheel-rims, o Maruts,
the waters surge; the trees dissolve; let the ruddy bull, the Heaven,
roar down.
738 V.59
7. Even the Earth has spread herself at their journey. Like a husband an  embryo, they have implanted their own strength (in the earth).
Certainly they have yoked the winds as horses to their yoke-pole; they  have made their own sweat into rain—the Rudras.
8. – Hail, Maruts, superior men! Be merciful to us—o you of great bounty,  immortal, knowing the (immanent) truth,
hearing the realized (truth) [=poetic formulations], sage poets, youths,  belonging to the lofty mountains, loftily growing.

8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8
This hymn is constructed around a series of similes and metaphors, some of which  (see esp. 3a) push the boundaries of similarity and require a mental leap from the  audience, while in others (e.g., 3d) the near identity between the two entities com pared renders the simile-marking almost redundant. The hymn’s subject, as usual,  is the power of the Maruts on their travels, power manifested both as the storm  and as a warriors’ onslaught. The puzzles in this hymn begin with its opening: no  entirely satisfactory referent for the “scout” or “spy” of 1a has been found, though  many have been suggested.
1. Your scout has stridden forth, to give good faring. I will chant to heaven.  I proffer my truth [=hymn] to the earth.
They sprinkle the horses, passing through the dusky realm. They let their  own radiance slacken with floods (of rain).
2. In fear of their onslaught the Earth trembles. Like a loaded boat she  streams, going a wayward course.
They who, visible from afar, are conspicuous on their travels, the men  have taken their places amid the great rite of distribution.
3. (Your) horn, like (those) of cows, stands tallest for splendor; (your) eye is  like the sun in his surging through the dusky realm.
Like steeds of good quality, you are pleasing. Like young bloods, you are  conspicuous for splendor, o men.
4. Who can reach up to the great things of you great ones? Who to your  poetic skills, Maruts, who to your manly deeds?
You set the earth to quivering like a dustmote, when you press forward,  to give good faring.
5. Like reddish horses [=flames of fire] they are of the same lineage, like  champions in the vanguard, they have fought in advance.
Like very strong young bloods, the men have grown strong. They
confound the eye of the sun with their rains. 6. They, bursting forth with no oldest one, no youngest, no middle, have  grown forth in their greatness.
Noble by birth, having Pr̥śni as mother, young bloods of heaven—come  here to us.
7. They who, like birds in formation, have flown with their strength to the  ends of heaven from (heaven’s) lofty back—
their horses, as both (races [=human and divine]) know, have stirred  forth the spurting (waters) of the mountain.
8. Let heaven bellow, let Aditi (come) to pursue our (oblations). Let the  dawns, bright with drops, take their places together.
These have stirred the heavenly bucket hither—o seer—the Maruts,  (sons) of Rudra, being hymned.
## 60 (414) Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7–8
Like V.56, this hymn begins with an invocation of Agni, the ritual fire, who is also  conspicuously addressed along with the Maruts in each of the last three verses  (6–8). The prominence of Agni identifies the Maruts’ journey to and participation  in the sacrifice as the goal of the hymn. Their journey itself provokes the usual  cosmic reactions—fear and trembling (vss. 2–3)—and the dazzling beauty of the  Maruts also receives its usual expression (vs. 4). Verse 5 provides an almost domes
tic picture of their parentage. Notable also is the dicing imagery in verse 1.
1. I solemnly invoke helpful Agni with reverences. Seated in front, he will  pull out a perfect (“hand” of dice) for us.
I press forward as if with chariots seeking prizes. With respectful
circumambulation (of Agni) might I bring to fulfillment the praise of  the Maruts.
2. Those who have mounted on the famed dappled mares, on the well-naved  chariots—the Rudras, the Maruts—
even the trees duck down with fear of you, powerful ones. Even the earth  trembles, even the mountain.
3. Even the mountain, grown great, has fear; even the back of heaven  trembles at your roar.
When you are at play, o Maruts, equipped with spears, you run toward a  single goal like the waters.
4. Just like wooers coming from wealth, with golden (ornaments) they have  emblazoned their bodies through their own powers.
For splendor the very splendid ones, powerful on their chariots, all
together have furnished themselves marks of greatness on their bodies.
740 V.61
5. Without an oldest one, without a youngest, these brothers have grown  strong together for good fortune.
Their father (was) the youth, the skillful Rudra, and Pr̥śni their
good-milking (mother); day-bright (are the days) for the Maruts.
6. If you are in the highest heaven, o Maruts, or in the middle one, or if you  are in the lowest one, you of good fortune,
from there, o Rudras, or you now, o Agni, be cognizant of this oblation  of ours, when we will perform sacrifice.
7. O Maruts, affording all possessions, and Agni too—when you (Maruts)  drive yourselves from higher heaven along (its) backs,
exulting, boisterous—(all) you who have care for the stranger, establish a  thing of value for the sacrificer who presses soma.
8. O Agni, with the Maruts, the versifiers in their beauty, drink the soma,  you exulting along with those who are splendor in a flock,
along with the pure Āyus who set all in motion, o Vaiśvānara, along with  your age-old beacon.
## 61 (415) Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
19 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 5 and satobrhat ̥ ī 9
With its nineteen verses, this hymn is out of place by the normal rules of arrange ment of the saṃhitā. It also falls into several sections on thematic grounds (vss. 1–4,  5–10, 11–16, 17–19). However, at least the first half (1–10) displays the cleverness  and sly humor of Śyāvāśva, who names himself directly in verse 5 and punningly  in verse 9, and perhaps represents a jeu d’esprit of the poet, appended to the more  solemn Marut hymns that precede it. Note that Śyāvāśva names himself only in the  first of those hymns (V.52.1) and in this last one.
The Maruts are the clear subject of verses 1–4 and 11–16, and each of these sec tions is followed by a dānastuti, or verses culminating in a dānastuti: 10 and 17–19.  We therefore suggest that we are dealing here with two originally separate hymns,  1–10 and 11–19, and that the first at least bears clear marks of Śyāvāśva’s authorship.
Since the second of these is less interesting than the first, we will discuss it first  here. The six verses (11–16) treating the Maruts are fairly conventional. Verse 17  serves as a transition to the dānastuti, addressed, oddly, to the goddess Night, who  is urged to carry the poet’s hymns to his patron, called Dārbhya here, and Rathavīti  in the following two verses. Both parts of the latter name are punned upon: ratha
“chariot” in verse 17 (“like a charioteer”), -vīti “pursuit” in verse 18 in the verb form  (ápa) veti “go off track,” and he is praised for his generosity in general terms (19). The first hymn is a much less staid affair. The four opening verses to the Maruts  begin with questions about the Maruts and then in increasing detail about their horses and horse-tackle. And in verses 2c and 3b the Maruts are depicted as riding  horseback (one of the very few pieces of evidence for this activity in the R̥gveda); in  verse 2 the reference is unremarkable, but in verse 3 the men’s posture on the horse  reminds the poet of women spreading their thighs in sex (or possibly childbirth,  though this seems less likely). From this point on the hymn takes a sexually sug
gestive turn. In verse 4 the Maruts are sent off with “lucky women,” and we move  abruptly into the second section of the hymn.
That section ends with a real dānastuti verse (10) in praise of a patron named  Vaidadaśvi. We might expect the four preceding verses (5–9) to form part of the  dānastuti as well, and there are prominent dānastuti-like elements in them, but they  also subvert the dānastuti model or provide a counter model—not least because they  concern a woman and profess the unorthodox opinion that women can be superior  to men. Verse 5 introduces an unidentified woman who “gains” the sorts of things  poets usually receive in dānastutis, using the root for “gain” (san) that is standard in  such contexts. (The notion that a woman would be in such a position is so unusual  that most translators simply translate the word as if it means “give”—though a  woman who gives livestock is no more standard a figure than one who gains it.)  From the second half of the verse it is clear that she must be the favored consort  (perhaps even the “Favorite Wife” of later Vedic ritual) of Śyāvāśva’s patron. The  poet then seems to reflect (vss. 6–8) on the qualities of women in general, in contrast  to men, allowing that some women may actually be better than men, especially men  of bad character—and among those especially a stingy man (vss. 6, 8), who doesn’t  deserve to be called a man except in the technical matter of blood money (vs. 8). The  tone in these verses is colloquial and conversational. After this seeming digression,  with the subtle hint to his patron about the perils of stinginess, we return in verse 9  to a flesh-and-blood woman, who is working her wiles on the poet, who calls himself  “Dusky” (śyāva). The verse is an elaborate pun: on the one hand she is narrating the  course of a race, and the “two chestnuts” in the second half of the verse can be two  horses given to the poet, “straining forward” to win. But the tone is very intimate;  the “course” may be the progress of sexual intercourse between the girl and the poet,  and the second half of the verse, using the same verb (ví √yam “spread apart”) as in  the first sexually suggestive passage in verse 4, can describe the “spreading apart” of  two female body parts. The girl in verse 9 thus appears to be part of the “gift” that  Śyāvāśva received for his poem, and the complex set of double meanings in this verse  are certainly a worthy “praise of this gift.” Is the girl in this verse the same as the one  in verse 5? Śyāvāśva seems to imply this, but we will never know for sure.
1. Who are you, men, the fairest ones, who one by one have driven here from the farthest distance?
2. Where are your horses, where your reins? How have you been able? How  have you driven here?
(Where is) the seat on their back, the bridle at their nostrils?
742 V.61
3. (Where) the whip on their haunch? The men have spread apart their  thighs (on horseback),
like wives at the making of sons.
4. Go forth, heroes, you young bloods with lucky women,
so that you will be hot as fire.
5. She gains livestock in horses and cows and (livestock) consisting of a  hundred sheep—
the one who keeps plumping up her arm as a pillow for the hero praised  by Śyāvāśva.
6. Now a woman can be more reliable, better than a man
if he’s estranged from the gods, ungenerous—
7. While she pays attention to a famished man, or to a thirsting one, or to  one who has desires [/lust],
and sets her own mind upon the gods.
8. And some other guy, a niggard not deserving praise, (may be) called  a “man,”
but he is only equivalent (to a man) in the matter of wergeld.
9. But a young woman, having beguiled (me), whispered the course to me,  “Dusky” [=Śyāvāśva], face to face.
The two chestnuts spread apart [/strained forward] for the
much-rewarded one, for the inspired poet of lasting glory—
10. Whoever will give me a hundred milk-cows as Vaidadaśvi (did), (he is) like a victor in his munificence.
11. (The Maruts), who drive themselves with their swift horses, drinking the  exhilarating honey,
here they have acquired their fame.
12. With whose splendor they flash through the two world-halves on their  chariots, like the bright ornament in heaven above.
13. This youthful Marutian flock with its glittering chariot is not to be  scorned;
charging to beauty it is unrepulsable.
14. Who now knows about them, where the shakers are reaching elation, those born of truth, unblemished?
15. You, who seek admiration, are those who lead the mortal forth with an  insight right to the point,
are those who listen to his invocations on your journey.
16. You who care for the stranger—roll here to us desirable, greatly  shimmering goods,
you who deserve the sacrifice.
17. This praise of mine, o Night, carry off to Dārbhya,
(my) hymns (carry away) like a charioteer, o goddess. 18. And then speak for me thus to Rathavīti who has pressed the soma: “My desire does not go off track.”

set back among the mountains.
## 62 (416) Mitra and Varuṇa
Śrutavid Ātreya
9 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn calls on Mitra and Varuṇa for rain, as 3cd makes clear. Their ability  to send the rain is connected with their kingship, and the poet suggests that con nection in several images. The gods’ throne sits “within the libations” (vss. 5, 6),  which not only are the oblations made to them but also signify the rainwater. The  banner that increases through their commandment (vs. 5)  is the banner “of the  ruler” (cf. V.69.1), and here the rain is the emblem of their kingship. Their rule is  strong, supported by a thousand pillars (vs. 6), but the pillar of their throne is also  the lightning (vs. 7ab) that accompanies the rain, and its foundation is in land that  yields plants (vs. 7c).
Framing the rain, which is the subject of verses 2–7, is the sun (vss. 1, 8). The first  verse remains mysterious. The first hemistich places Mitra and Varuṇa’s “enduring  truth” in the night sky or in any case, in that place where “they,” most likely the  gods generally, unhitch Sūrya’s horses to let them pasture during the night. Yet even  before dawn the poet’s vision allows him to see “that One,” the sun, and together  with the sun, the hidden truth of the two gods. The sun may also be the “single  felly” mentioned in 2d, and if so, the verse looks forward the appearance of the sun  after the rain. After the invocations to the gods for rain, the sun returns to the poem  once again, this time visible to all at dawn and closely associated with the golden  throne of Mitra and Varuṇa.
1. Your enduring truth is hidden by truth, there where they unhitch the  horses of the sun.
Ten times a hundred [=rays of the sun?] stand together: I saw that One,  the most splendid of the lovely forms of the gods.
2. That is surely your greatness, Mitra and Varuṇa: while standing at rest,  they have given milk throughout the days.
You two swell all the pasture’s streams of milk. The single felly has
turned here after you two.
3. You upheld the earth and heaven, o you two kings, Mitra and Varuṇa, by  your great powers.
Make the plants grow! Swell the cows! Send the rain gushing down, o  you of lively waters!744 V.63
4. Let the horses in good harness convey you here. Let them with guided  reins come near to this place.
A cloak of ghee whirls along after you. From of old, rivers flow near. 5. Guarding (the commandment) that increases your famed, broad banner,  as if guarding the ritual grass with a yajus-recitation,
you sit upon the throne amid the libations, o Mitra and Varuṇa of firm  skill, receiving homage.
6. You are the two far-protectors with unbloodied hands for him who  performs rituals well, whom you two safeguard, Varuṇa, amid the
libations.
Never becoming angry, you two kings together bear a
thousand-pillared rule.
7. Metal cloaked in gold, its [=the throne’s] pillar flashes in heaven like a  horsewhip,
anchored in the good or fruitful land. We would win honey upon your  throne.
8. You two mount the throne possessing golden color at the break of dawn,  (the throne) possessing a metal pillar at the rising of the sun,
o Mitra and Varuṇa. From there you observe guiltlessness and guilt.
9. Your very stout, unbroken protection, which is not to be pierced, o you  herdsmen of the living world, bringing good waters—
with that help us, Mitra and Varuṇa. Seeking to win, may we be
victorious.

Arcanānas Ātreya
7 verses: jagatī
Like the previous hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa, this hymn is also a plea for monsoon  rains. It gives a vivid picture of the monsoons with their thunder and lightning (vss.  5, 6) and the coming of the rain (esp. vss. 1, 4). The poet uses sound repetition,  perhaps in imitation of echoing thunder or recurring lightning or perhaps simply  as a demonstration of his poetic ability:  2d...-vī ví caranti..., 3b... vícarṣanī,  3c citrébhir..., 4b carati citrám..., 5c ... citrā́ ví caranti..., 6b... citrā́m vadati  tvíṣī-..., and 7d...-vi cítryam.... Also across 3ab samrā́jā ugrā́ vr̥ṣabhā́ divás pátī,  pr̥thivyā́ mitrā́váruṇā vícarṣaṇī, the two lines have exactly the same metrical struc ture and repeated vowels in the same syllables.
The hymn several times refers to the māyā́, the “cunning” of Mitra and Varuṇa  (vss. 3, 4, 6, 7), which in its first and last attestations is described as the “cunning of  a lord (ásura)” (vss. 3, 7), thus connecting Mitra and Varuṇa’s ability to control the  rain by their cunning with their kingship. They are likewise twice called “sovereign kings” (samrā́j) (vss. 2, 3). The prefix sám- “together,” signifying their unifying rule,  contrasts with the repeated prefix ví- “apart,” which indicates the diverse things over  which they hold sovereignty. This theme is announced in 2ab, where they are called  samrā́jau over the world vidáthe “in its division.”
Also translated and discussed in Brereton (1981: 104–6).
1. O herdsmen of the truth, o you whose nature holds true, you two stand  upon your chariot in the most distant heaven.
For him whom you two help here, Mitra and Varuṇa, the rain swells rich  in honey from heaven.
2. As sovereign kings, you two of sunlike appearance rule over this living  world in its division, o Mitra and Varuṇa.
We implore the gift that is rain, that is immortality. Thunder ranges  through Heaven and Earth.
3. Sovereign kings, powerful bulls, and lords of heaven and of earth, Mitra  and Varuṇa, who know no boundaries—
you two approach the roar with shimmering clouds. You make heaven  rain by the cunning of a lord.
4. Mitra and Varuṇa, your cunning rests upon heaven. The sun, your light,  moves as a shimmering weapon.
You hide it in heaven by cloud and by rain. O Parjanya, the honeyed  drops are arising.
5. The Maruts harness their easy-running chariot for beauty, like a  champion on cattle raids, o Mitra and Varuṇa.
Thunder ranges through the shimmering air. O sovereign kings, sprinkle  us with milk from heaven.
6. O Mitra and Varuṇa, Parjanya speaks his refreshment-bringing word,  shimmering and shattering.
The Maruts clothe themselves in clouds by your cunning. Make heaven  rain, ruddy and spotless.
7. According to your nature, o Mitra and Varuṇa who perceive inspired  words, you two guard your commandments by the cunning of a lord. By truth you rule over the whole living world. You place the sun here in  heaven as your shimmering chariot.

Arcanānas Ātreya
7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 7
As often, the central verse of the hymn is its most enigmatic. The poet condenses  this verse so that a number of interpretations are possible, all of them applicable to
746 V.64
the situation. The word upamá, here translated “closest,” might also mean “best.”  Indeed, most translators choose the latter interpretation, but in the verses lead ing up to this one, the poet constantly emphasizes the intimacy of Mitra and  Varuṇa: In their arms they gather “the realm of solar glory” (vs. 1), which is likely  both the celestial realm and the realm of the sacrifice. They stretch forth their arms  to the sacrificers, who call on their affection (vs. 2). The sacrificers are accompanied  by the protection of Mitra, “who never does injury” (vs. 3). In verse 4 the poet  brings something close to the gods, although he does not state clearly what it is.  In the more obvious reading it might be the sacrificial offerings and the sacrificial  recitations. But it might also be gifts to the priests, or the inhabitants in the patrons’  dwellings, or the talent and learning that the priests bring to the ritual performance.  In short, it might be everything that is part of the sacrifice or even part of the lives  of the patrons and priests.
In the final verses this theme of the closeness of Mitra and Varuṇa to the sac rificers is expressed through a number of different strategies. The simile in 7cd is  particularly striking. It turns on two homophonous present stems dhāva, one of  which means “run” and the other “rinse, cleanse,” with the shift from one to the  other signaled by the change from “feet” to “hands.” This word play maintains the  sense of closeness of the sacrificers and the gods, since “cleanse” refers to a typical  priestly action, while “run” is the desired action of the gods. That theme continues  in verses 4 and 5, in which the poet invites Varuṇa and Mitra to the dwelling of  generous patrons, which is also the gods’ “seat” or “abode” (vs. 5). And verse 6a  begins yuváṃ naḥ “you two for us,” setting the 2nd- and 1st-person pronouns next  to one another.
1. With our verse we summon for you all Mitra and Varuṇa, who cares for  the stranger,
who, like corrals, have encompassed the realm of solar glory in their  two arms.
2. Let these two arms stretch forth with kind attention to him who chants, for again and again, in all places of the earth, I call on your benevolent  affection.
3. That I might now reach the way, I would travel by the path of Mitra. They go together with the protection of him [=Mitra] who is dear, who  never does injury.
4. Mitra and Varuṇa, with my verse I would set closest to you two
what is in the dwelling of generous patrons and what serves praise
singers to contend over.
5. O Mitra, (you) and Varuṇa—(come) here for us with your bright lights,  here into your seat,
into their own dwelling, (that) of the generous patrons, for your partners  to grow strong.
6. For us, among whom you two maintain your dominion (here) and aloft,  o Varuṇa— for us make wide space to win the prize for the sake of wealth and
well-being.
7. While (Dawn) with her shining cattle is breaking at the (sacrifice) under  divine dominion,
do you two worthy of the sacrifice run to me here by foot, as if
(cleansing by hand) soma pressed by priests with skilled hands, o you  two superior men, as you maintain Arcanānas.
## 65 (419) Mitra and Varuṇa
Rātahavya Ātreya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6
The poet begins by invoking himself as the “perceptive” poet (vss. 1–2), who then  speaks on behalf of the sacrificers (vs. 3). The basic theme of the hymn is the  request that Mitra and Varuṇa help create a peaceful dwelling place that is broad  and secure for people and animals during the period that the tribe is settled. While  the poet addresses both Mitra and Varuṇa, his principal address is to Mitra: Mitra  alone is mentioned in verse 4, in verse 5 Varuṇa appears only as the complement  of Mitra, and in verse 6 Varuṇa’s presence is merely implied in the dual personal  pronoun. Mitra is the god of alliances, and the reason for the focus on Mitra here  is that the poet particularly wants people to occupy their proper places (vs. 6) by  honoring their agreements with one another. The verb √yat “arrange” in this verse  is elsewhere associated with the action of Mitra, who governs peoples through the  pacts and alliances made among them.
The word mitrá can refer not only to the god Mitra but also to a mitrá, an ally,  and the poet makes use of this ambiguity in verse 4. The god Mitra wins a dwelling  free from threat or constraint through the power of divinely sanctioned alliances,  and therefore one who is a true ally, who embodies the principles of the god of alli
ances, also wins such a dwelling. The connection between the god Mitra and the  human ally is further suggested by verse 3, in which Mitra and Varuṇa are invoked  to give out the prizes of victory, and verse 4, in which the person in a parallel fash ion distributes offerings.
1. He who is perceptive has strong resolve. Let him speak among the gods  for us—
he whose songs beautiful Varuṇa or Mitra longs for.
2. Since these two are kings of most glorious luster and farthest fame, they are lords of the settlement, who grow through the truth and possess  the truth, among every people.
3. Imploring you for help, I address you two ancient ones together:
“Through your good perception, with your good horses, (race) toward  the prizes of victory to give them out.”
748 V.66
4. Mitra [/an ally] then wins a broad way for peaceful dwelling, even out of  narrow straits,
since the favor of triumphant Mitra belongs to him who distributes
offerings.
5. Blameless, helped by you, we would be completely within the most  extensive help
of Mitra, whose complement is Varuṇa.
6. The two of you, o Mitra, arrange this people and lead them together. Do not overlook the generous one nor us seers. Give us wide space under  your protection.
## 66 (420) Mitra and Varuṇa
Rātahavya Ātreya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn shows similarities to the preceding hymn, attributed to the same poet.  Note especially the first line, whose beginning, ā́ cikitāna sukrátū “Here are the two  of strong resolve, o perceptive mortal,” uses similar lexical elements as 65.1a yáś cikéta sá sukrátuḥ “He who is perceptive has strong resolve.” In V.65 the poet singles  out Mitra, especially in the last three verses of the hymn. Here the poet addresses  Varuṇa alone in the first verse and Mitra alone in the last. This strategy has the  effect of defining a beginning and ending to the hymn, but there are also thematic  reasons for this distribution of divine names as well. Verse 1 mentions the “truth”  (r̥tá), which is particularly associated with Varuṇa, who presides over the truth, and  in verse 6 the poet hopes that his people will take their places (yátemahi) under the  gods’ protection. The root √yat “arrange,” here in the middle voice in the sense of  “take one’s place,” is characteristically associated with Mitra’s task of “arranging”  peoples according to the alliances among them, as was noted in the introduction  to V.65.
Renou characterizes this hymn as a eulogy of poetic power and an r̥tá, and he  is right that these are central concerns of the poet. The power of the hymn is indi rectly suggested in verses 1–2. In verse 1 the hymn is “set in place” (dadhītá) in the  ritual, and this act finds a social and cosmological echo in the next verse, where the  rule of Mitra and Varuṇa “is set in place” (dhāyi) in the way that the sun is set in  place. That is to say, in terms of the verse sequence of the poem, the hymn appears  in the ritual and then the rule of the gods appears. In verses 3–4 there is an extended  description of the poet’s work that implicitly compares it to a raid. As they often  are in the R̥gveda, the “chariots” sought by the poet (vs. 4) may be hymns or even  sacrifices that journey to the gods. In verse 5 the gods perceive the hymn of the poet,  brought to them by the “beacon of the peoples.” While interpreters have variously identified this beacon, we believe that it is most likely Agni (cf. V.11.2), who trans ports hymns and offerings to the gods.
One of the poet’s strategies that makes this hymn interesting but difficult to  interpret is his use of indeterminate ellipsis (cf. vss. 1, 2, 3) and obscure reference  (esp. vs. 5). Verses 5–6 are the most intriguing example, because they form the cli max of the hymn. In 5ab the poet dramatically declares that he will enunciate the  “lofty truth,” but as is often the case, this lofty truth that he expresses in 5cd is an  abstruse one. By the double reference of yā́mabhiḥ to a poet’s entreaties and to river  courses, the words of the poet are compared to flowing streams. These streams flow  over Heaven and Earth, which expand for the poet in response. In this reading of  the hemistich, the masculine dual jrayasānaú “who extend” would be completed  by dyā́vā or the like, “Heaven and Earth.” This is suggested by the vocative pr̥thivi
in 5a, echoed by pr̥thú in c, for dyā́vā regularly appears alongside the nominative  pr̥thivī́, as in I.159.1, II.12.13, II.41.20, VI.11.1, VII.69.1, and VIII.72.9. But the  poet’s words carrying their entreaties also flow beyond to Mitra and Varuṇa, who  likewise become even greater through them. Verse 6 then is a phalaśruti, a “declara
tion of benefit,” expressing the expectation of the poet and his people that they will  live safely under the rule of Mitra and Varuṇa.
1. O perceptive mortal, here are the two gods of strong resolve who care for  the stranger.
It [=the hymn] should be set in place for Varuṇa, whose garment is the  truth, for his great pleasure.
2. Because these two together have achieved lordly dominion that is not  overturned,
so then, like the lovely sun, (their dominion) over the sons of Manu has  been set in place like their commandments.
3. (We search for) you two in our quest for chariots (and for) a broad  pasture-land for them.
With our praise songs we will boldly conceive the good praise of him by  whom the oblation is given,
4. Because then, you undeceivable ones, by the fortresses of your skill you perceive our verbal craft through the beacon of the peoples [=Agni],  o you of purified skill.
5. O Earth, this is their lofty truth in the seers’ quest for fame:
by (the seers’) entreaties they [=poetic streams] flow beyond the two  [=Heaven and Earth], who rightly extend widely,
6. So that—o Mitra, o you two quick-eyed ones—we and our patrons would take our places within your very extensive, much-protecting
sovereignty.

Yajata Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn emphasizes the multiplicity of the Ādityas, which the hymn connects  with their presence in multiple places and their lordship among different peoples  (vss. 2, 4). It invokes the Ādityas in the first verse and then Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman; in verse 2 just Varuṇa and Mitra, and then in verse 3 Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman once again. The climax comes in the last verse, which suggests that all  the forms of the Ādityas culminate in Mitra or Varuṇa—or, rather, in the two of  them together. We offer this interpretation tentatively since the key lines are 5ab. As  the parenthetical insertions in our translation indicate, it is not clear precisely how  these lines should be construed.
1. Yes indeed! It is just so, o god: the appointed place is worthy of the  sacrifice and lofty, o Ādityas,
o Varuṇa and Mitra, o Aryaman. You two have achieved the highest  lordship.
2. O Varuṇa and Mitra, when you two take your seat upon the golden womb, as maintainers of the separate peoples, offer your favor, o you caring for  the stranger.
3. Because all of them—Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman—know all things, they follow their commandments like tracks. They protect the mortal  from harm.
4. For they are real, touching the truth and truth-possessing among every  people;
they are those leading well, giving good drops [/gifts], and making a wide  space even from narrow straits.
5. Now which of you two, (which) of (all your) forms, o Mitra—or (is it)  Varuṇa?—is not praised?
Thus our thought hastens to you two; from the Atris a thought hastens.

The poet is intent on praising the expanse of Mitra and Varuṇa’s power: he says  they are of “great dominion” (vs. 1) and are “proclaimed among the gods” (vs. 2).  Then combining their power among both gods and humans, he calls them masters  over “earthly and heavenly” wealth and possessing “dominion among the gods” (vs.  3). The climax and purpose of this praise of their power on earth and in heaven is finally expressed in the last verse: they are lords of rains, which come from heaven  to earth.
1. Sing forth to Mitra and to Varuṇa with your inspiration and song. O you two of great dominion, lofty is our truth.
2. Sovereign kings, whose womb is covered with ghee, both Mitra

are gods proclaimed among the gods.
3. Show us your mastery over great wealth, earthly and heavenly.
Great is your dominion among the gods.

Urucakri Ātreya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
In the last half of the hymn the poet connects Mitra and Varuṇa to their mother  Aditi, the goddess who embodies guiltlessness. He invokes her for wealth, a con tinuing lineage, good fortune, and health (vs. 3). It is not clear, however, whether  it is she whom the poet invokes in 3d or whether it is the two gods. The object is  suppressed perhaps to create intentional ambiguity, since the gift that comes from  guiltlessness is also the gift from Mitra and Varuṇa. The connection between Aditi,  Mitra, and Varuṇa is confirmed in the last verse, which call them Ādityas, “sons of  Aditi.”
1. The three realms of light and the three heavens, the three airy spaces do  you two uphold, o Varuṇa and Mitra,
strengthening the emblem of your lordship, protecting your unaging  commandment.
2. O Varuṇa and Mitra, your milk-cows are filled with refreshments. Your  rivers give honey-rich milk.
Three brilliant bulls [=fires?] stand far and wide, the semen-givers of the  three holy places.
3. In the early morning, at midday, and at the rising of the sun, again and  again I call upon the goddess Aditi
for wealth in its entirety, o Mitra and Varuṇa. I invoke (her) for kith and  kin, for luck and life.
752 V.70–71
4. (You) two heavenly Ādityas, who are the upholders of the earthly space  and the realm of light—
o Mitra and Varuṇa, the immortal gods do not violate your enduring  commandments.
## 70 (424) Mitra and Varuṇa
Urucakri Ātreya
4 verses: gāyatrī
The most interesting question about this hymn is why Mitra and Varuṇa are here  called Rudras, and the most interesting verse is the mysterious final one. Rudra is a  healer but also a terrifying archer, and the purpose of the poet may be to make sure  that the vengeance of Mitra and Varuṇa, which is like the fury of Rudra, be turned  against his enemies. Mitra and Varuṇa should protect and rescue him and direct  their anger toward the Dasyus, not toward him (vs. 3).
This observation may help us understand the last verse, although its mean ing remains uncertain. As also in IV.3.13, we read the beginning of pāda a as mā́ akásya, rather than mā́ kásya with the Padapāṭha and most other interpreters. The  fear expressed in ab, then, is that the poet will be destroyed and thereby become a  nonentity. This fear is not only for the present, but also for the future. In pāda c the  poet asks that after death he not become a nobody, a nonentity, but that in heaven  his remains form a new body and that on earth his life continue in his lineage.
1. Since now there is help from you two, even in (its full) quantity and breadth, I have won the favor of you two, o Varuṇa and Mitra.
2. We would attain you two together, o you without deception, and your  refreshment for our nurture.
We would be such ones, o you two Rudras.
3. Protect us, Rudras, by your protections, and rescue us, since you are good  rescuers.
We in our own persons would overcome the Dasyus.
4. O you of undeceived will, may we in our own persons not endure  (becoming) the specter of a nobody,
neither in our remains nor in our lineage.

This and the following hymn are attributed to the same poet, and indeed have  similar purposes and deploy similar techniques. Both hymns are straightforward invitations to Mitra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and to drink the soma. In V.71  the poet emphasizes his invocation to the two gods by repeating their names at the  beginning of pāda b of each verse. The repetition is underlined by the fact that  the names are followed in each case by just a single word completing the line, a  word that has a different grammatical form and syntactic function in each verse.
1. Come here to us with might, o you caring for the stranger, o Varuṇa  and Mitra,
to this cherished rite.
2. Because you are kings of all, being masters, o attentive ones, o Varuṇa  and Mitra,
make our insights swell.

Bāhuvr̥kta Ātreya
3 verses: uṣṇih
In this hymn, which continues the themes and techniques of the preceding hymn, the  poet repeats a refrain that asks the gods to be present and to receive the soma offer ings. In verse 2 of this hymn he does not mention the names of the gods, as he does in  the first and third verses, but rather begins pāda a with vraténa “by your command ment” and ends pāda b with yātayájjanā “who arrange the peoples.” The word vratá is particularly associated with Varuṇa, both conceptually and etymologically, and  √yat “arrange” describes the function of Mitra. Instead of pairing the two names, the  poet has created a chiasmic pairing of the most characteristic functions of the gods.
1. Like Atri, we pour an offering to Mitra and Varuṇa with our songs. – Sit down upon the ritual grass to drink the soma.
2. By your commandment, you are those two who give peaceful dwellings  that endure, who arrange the peoples according to your foundation.
– Sit down upon the ritual grass to drink the soma.
3. Mitra and Varuṇa take pleasure in our sacrifice to their liking.
– Let them sit down upon the ritual grass to drink the soma.
## 73 (427) Aśvins
Paura Ātreya
10 verses: anuṣṭubh
The central theme of the hymn is the journey of the Aśvins:  their journey that  encompasses the whole world and their journey to the poet’s sacrifice. Geldner754 V.73
describes this hymn as strophic, consisting of five paired verses; this structure  expresses the thematic division of the hymn.
Verses 1–2 describe the Aśvins as moving somewhere, possibly near or possibly  far, but in any case the poet invites them to travel here to his sacrifice. Since the poet  has begun with a reference to journeys of the Aśvins, it is not surprising that he then  turns to a description of their wonderful chariot. According to the interpretation  we offer here, one wheel of that chariot is the sacrificial fire (vs. 3). Behind this sym
bolism is likely the recurrent representation of the sacrifice as a chariot, particularly  as the Aśvins’ chariot. The other wheel of their chariot is the sun (vs. 4). Running  on these two wheels the Aśvins both range over the whole world and are present at  the sacrifice.
Verses 5–6 are connected by the theme of heat, and as in the case of the two  wheels, one form of heat is cosmic, the other form ritual. In verse 5 Sūryā, the  daughter of the Sun, mounts the chariot of the Aśvins, which drives onward ahead  of the rising, burning sun. In verse 6 what is called gharmá “hot” is either the  Pravargya pot, in which the milk for the Aśvins is heated, or the hot milk itself.  While verse 5 refers primarily to the sun and verse 6 to the Pravargya rite, there is  also a secondary, implied reference to the ritual in verse 5 and to the sun in verse  6. The motif of Sūryā’s mounting the Aśvins’ chariot is always a courtship or wed ding image. Here in verse 5 she may be brought as bride to Soma (cf. X.85), who is,  of course, at the center of the rite.
Because the interpretation of 8ab is uncertain, the connection between verses  7–8 is less clear than in the other pairs of verses. In verse 7 the horse thunders as  he brings the Aśvins to the rite at the invitation of Atri, who may be not the Atri  of legend but his present or future descendant. In verse 8ab the subject is sup
pressed, and various interpreters have suggested various possibilities: the Aśvins’  honeyed whip (Geldner), the hymn (Sāyaṇa, Geldner, cf. VIII.6.43), a cow (Pirart  2001: 243–44, cf. II.16.8). It could even be the “thundering” of the lead horse from  the previous verse. We have left the identification unclear, although a reference to  the hymn (dhī́) in one way or another appears to us likely. The balance between the  Aśvins’ presence in the cosmos and in the rite is repeated in 8cd, which describes the  Aśvins’ journey across the seas and the ritual offerings made to them.
The concluding verses then restate the theme of the Aśvins’ journey throughout  the world and explicitly connect that journey to the ritual, since they compare the  hymns that bring the Aśvins to chariots.
1. Whether today you two are far distant, whether close by, o Aśvins, or whether—o you who bring many enjoyments many times—
(you are) in the midspace, come here.
2. Here are these two who appear most often, bringing their many
wondrous powers.
With longing for space, I beseech the pair who are not poor. I call upon  the two most powerful ones to give enjoyment. 3. You maintain at rest your chariot’s one wheel [=the sacrificial fire], the  marvel to be marveled at.
With the other (wheel) [=the sun?] you fly around the generations of  the descendants of Nahuṣa and the airy regions by your greatness.
4. And that is accomplished by this (chariot) of yours—(that act) of yours  which is praised throughout all (generations):
Born separately, faultless, you two together have come to kinship
with us.
5. When Sūryā mounts your ever swift-running chariot,
your ruddy birds keep its [=the sun’s] glowing heat from burning.
6. O you men, Atri will be attentive to you two with his good thought and  attention,
when he scurries toward your faultless hot(-vessel) with his mouth, o  Nāsatyas.
7. Your powerful lead horse is moving. Its thundering is heard on its  journeys,
o Aśvins, when Atri will turn it here along with your wondrous powers,  you men.
8. The one that swells with honey follows you two closely, o you
honey-seeking Rudras.
When you two will cross beyond the seas, they [=priests] bring cooked  foods to you.
9. It is really true, o Aśvins: they call you joy itself.
On their journey these two are the most often summoned on the
journey; here on their journey they are the most merciful.
10. Let these strengthening formulations for the Aśvins be most
luck-bringing—
these that we fashion like chariots. We have spoken lofty reverence.

Paura Ātreya
10 verses: anuṣṭubh
The hymn opens with the poet wondering where the Aśvins can be (vs. 1). Are they  with another people (vs. 2)? Or to whom are they traveling (vs. 3)? The poet wishes  them to come to Atri—as in the last hymn, the poet himself (vs. 1)—and to seek  out his poetic formulations (vs. 3), not those of others. Several verses later, the poet  returns once more to beg the Aśvins’ attention (vs. 6), to ask again whose inspired  poetry and sacrifices have attracted the Aśvins (vs. 7), and to urge them to come  to him (vss. 8–10). The last verse of the hymn echoes the first: verse 1 asks where
756 V.74
the Aśvins are (kū́ ṣṭhaḥ) and whether they will hear the poet (śravathaḥ); verse 10  addresses them wherever they are (kárhi cid) and anticipates that they will hear  him (śuśrūyā́tam). Also, in the first verse the poet addresses the Aśvins as manāvasū “whose goods are zeal”—that is, as those who bring vigor and passion to sacrifi cers—and vr̥ṣaṇvasū “whose goods are bull-like,” but in the last he speaks not of  goods that the Aśvins bring but rather of the “good benefits” (vásvīḥ ... bhújaḥ) the  Aśvins will receive, thus reversing the beneficiaries of the goods.
How the internal verses set within this frame are connected to the rest of the  hymn is not clear. They tell how the Aśvins rescued Paura from real or metaphorical  waters (vs. 4) and Cyavāna from old age and impotence (vs. 5). The story of Paura,  whom the Anukramaṇī identifies as the poet of the hymn, is told elliptically. There  is a cryptic etymological play on Paura’s name in 4ab that suggests that Paura had  lost the prosperity that was his by right, or at least by name, but that he was restored  to “muchness” by the Aśvins. Unfortunately, the meaning of paurá is not secure  and therefore neither is this interpretation. This word play on paurá is set within  a causal hí-clause, which normally would be dependent but here apparently is not,  and it is then followed by an incomplete dependent clause, which lacks both subject  and verb. The abstract dative gr̥bhītátātaye “for captivity” suggests supplying a verb  derived from √gr̥bh “capture”—“they capture him” or the like—but this interpreta tion is not at all secure. Is the fragmented syntax an icon of the desperate situation  that the Aśvins were able to redress?
1. Where in heaven are you today, o divine Aśvins whose goods are zeal? Will you hear this, o you whose goods are bull-like? Atri is trying to  win you.
2. Where are these two? Where are they famed—the Nāsatyas, the two gods  in heaven?
Among what people do you take your place? Which of you two is in  company with rivers?
3. To whom do you journey? To whom do you come? Toward whom do you  harness your chariot?
In whose formulations do you delight? We wish you to seek (ours).
4. For you two bring to life even Paura, who was swimming in the waters,  for the sake of “muchness” (paurá), o (you who are) “Muchness”
itself,
when him for captivity, like a lion in the track of deceit...
5. You remove the covering like a cloak from Cyavāna, who had
become old;
as a youth—since you two made him so again—he meets the desire of  his wife.
6. Because your praise singer is here and we have in our sights (to see) your  splendor,
now hear me and come with help, o you whose goods are prizewinners. 7. Which of the many mortals has won you two today for himself? Which inspired poet, o you conveyed by inspiration? Who with his
sacrifices, you whose goods are prizewinners?
8. Let your chariot, fastest traveling of chariots, travel here, Aśvins, even across the many (regions), as it seeks us—(it is) the praise song  among mortals here.
9. Let our celebration of you be our luck, o honey-seekers.
Like a pair of falcons fly this way with your birds, o discerning ones. 10. Aśvins, when you should hear this call anywhere,
good benefits are yours and nourishments nourish you.

Avasyu Ātreya
9 verses: paṅkti
Two themes dominate this hymn. One, announced at the beginning of the first verse, is  the chariot of the Aśvins, which conveys the gods to the sacrificial place. The other is  the call of the poet, the theme of the hymn’s refrain. The two are intimately connected,  since the purpose of the poet’s praise is to bring the Aśvins on their chariot to the sac
rificial ground. In verse 2 the poet imagines the chariot passing by the hymns of other  sacrificers that claim to win the Aśvins and continuing on toward his sacrifice. Because  the hymn is leading the Aśvins toward the poet, the voice of the poet rides on the chariot  (vs. 4), and the Aśvins’ horses are harnessed by the thought of the poet (vs. 6). In 7cd  the Aśvins are invoked to travel tiráś cid “even across,” but it is not clear across what.  Geldner (and others, see Pirart 2001: 290–92) suggests a haplology of *aryáḥ because  of the following aryayā́. In this interpretation, the line could mean “even across what  belongs to the stranger” or “even across the strangers” or the like. By contrast, we inter pret pāda c as a recollection of 2b and therefore supply the phrase “all those ‘I shall  win’-s.” But in either case the Aśvins are again asked not to be seduced by the hymns and  sacrifices of others, but to drive by them, heeding the poet’s summons to his sacrifice.
1. The most loved chariot—a bull and a vehicle for goods—
does your praise singer, the seer, attend upon with his praise, o Aśvins. – O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
2. Journey here, Aśvins, beyond and across all those “I shall win”-s. o you wondrous ones with golden tracks, with good favor, with the
Sindhu as your vehicle.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
3. Bringing treasures to us, Aśvins, come here, both of you,
o Rudras with golden tracks, whose goods are prizewinners, since you  are pleased.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
758 V.76
4. The musical (voice) of him having good rhythm is set upon your chariot,  o you whose goods are bull-like,
and your wild animal of marvelous form [=the sacrificial fire?], your lead  horse, creates nourishments.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
5. As vigorous charioteers of attentive mind hearing a summons,
with your birds (as your team) you run down unduplicitous Cyavāna. – O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
6. Men, let your horses harnessed by thought, frothing at the mouth, let your birds carry you here, together with your good favors, to drink  (soma), Aśvins.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
7. Aśvins, come here to this place. Nāsatyas, do not lose the track.
Even beyond (all those “I shall win”-s) in the search for your compatriot,  journey around your course, o undeceivable ones.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
8. In this sacrifice, o undeceivable lords of beauty, you attend to the singer seeking help as he sings—both of you, Aśvins.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.
9. Dawn with her glowing herds has appeared. Agni has been installed at  the right ritual moment.
The immortal chariot has been harnessed for you, o wondrous ones  whose goods are bull-like.
– O honey-rich ones, hear my summons.

Atri Bhauma
5 verses: triṣṭubh
In the later ritual the Hotar recites this hymn in the evening as the Adhvaryu and  his assistants fan the fire to heat the Pravargya vessel. Verse 1 refers directly to the  hot milk oblation offered to the Aśvins in the Pravargya ritual, but, as Houben  (2000: 10) observes, the hymn itself indicates the dawn as the time of its recitation.  Time is a central theme of the hymn: it is now that the Aśvins are praised (vs. 2),  and at present the oblation is extended to the Aśvins (vs. 3). The Aśvins should  respond to the praise and the offering because they come at all times, both day and  night (vss. 2, 3). Because of the present offering and the ever-presence of the Aśvins,  the poet hopes for the Aśvins’ “present help” (vs. 5).
Although perhaps not as strongly, the poet puts a similar emphasis on place.  The Aśvins should “journey here” (vs. 1, 3), where they are praised (vs. 2), for this  is their place, home, house, and dwelling (vs. 4). The result is that wealth and good  fortune will be here (vs. 5). 1. Agni shines toward the face of Dawn. The words of inspired poets,  traveling to the gods, have arisen.
Now, o you two charioteers, directed this way, journey here toward this  hot-(vessel) swelling (with milk), Aśvins.
2. The best who come, they do not compromise the (offering) prepared (for  them). Near and now the Aśvins are praised with songs here
as the best who come with help by day and at the evening mealtime, in  response to trouble and as the best luck for the pious man.
3. And journey here at the ingathering of cattle and at the early morning of  the day, at midday and at the rising of the sun, and
by day and at night with your most luck-bringing help. Does the drink  not right now stretch to the Aśvins?
4. For from of old this is your place, your home. This is your house, Aśvins,  this your dwelling.
Journey here to us from lofty heaven and mountain, here from the
waters, carrying refreshment and nourishment.
5. – May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy  itself and provides good guidance.
Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here all  that brings good fortune.

Atri Bhauma
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the preceding one, this hymn is attributed to Atri, and shares with it the same  meter and same final verse. The hymn refers to the Aśvins in the third person in every  verse except the central one (3), when the poet turns to the Aśvins and addresses  them directly, describing to them the chariot that brings them to his sacrifice. The  description of the chariot compares or even identifies this chariot with the sacrifice,  since “golden-skinned, honey-colored, ghee-backed, and carrying nourishments”  can easily describe the sacrificial fire.
The time of the Aśvins’ arrival is the particular concern of the poet. They  are the gods prātaryā́vaṇā “who journey in the early morning,” and the poet  insists that his hymn and offerings are given at the right time. They are not  given too early when it is still dark, for the evening is the wrong time to make  the offerings (vs. 2ab)—although whether it is the wrong time in general or the  wrong time for the Aśvins in particular is unsure. Likewise, unlike others he  does not make his offerings too late, after dawn has already broken (2cd). The  “ungenerous vulture” in 1cd is probably a sacrificer who gave too few offerings  too late.
760 V.78
1. Sacrifice to the first ones, the two who journey in the early morning.  They will drink before the ungenerous vulture [=rival sacrificer].
Since the Aśvins receive the sacrifice in the early morning, the poets  proclaim them as those who receive the first portion.
2. Sacrifice to them in the early morning, urge on the Aśvins: there is no  (sacrifice) in the evening, (when it is) displeasing for it to travel to the gods. And it is the other one, not us, who sacrifices when dawn has (already)  come: the earlier the sacrificer, the greater his gain.
3. Golden-skinned, honey-colored, ghee-backed, and carrying
nourishments, your chariot turns here,
swift as thought and fleet as the wind, by which you journey beyond all  difficult ways, o Aśvins.
4. Who has toiled most for the Nāsatyas and will give the most pleasing  (offering) at the distribution of food,
he carries his offspring across by his labors. He would ever pass beyond  those who do not raise their radiance on high.
5. – May we come together with the present help of the Aśvins, which is joy  itself and provides good guidance.
Here to us bring wealth and here heroes, you two immortals, and here all  that brings good fortune.

Saptavadhri Ātreya
9 verses: uṣṇih 1–3, triṣṭubh 4, anuṣṭubh 5–9
In the normal arrangement, hymns of more verses precede those of fewer verses, but  this hymn of nine verses follows hymns of five, a discrepancy that suggests that this  hymn is either a later addition to the collection or a composite, created of originally  separate hymns, or both. Formally and thematically it appears to be a composite. It  uses three different meters, unevenly divided among its verses. The first three verses,  which invite the Aśvins to the soma-pressing, are all in the same meter, begin with  an invocation to the Aśvins, and have a common refrain. They thus form a coherent  piece. The last three verses, likewise in the same meter, are an incantation to facilitate  childbirth at the proper time. Verse 7 apparently addresses the father of the child,  verse 8 the child himself, and verse 9 the Aśvins or whatever other powers might  help the childbirth. As Pirart (2001: 330–31) notes, this incantation has parallels at  Atharvaveda Śaunaka I.11.6 and Vājasaneyisaṃhitā Mādhyaṃdina VIII.28.
The middle three verses provide a transition from the invocation in verses 1–3  to the incantation in verses 7–9. Verse 4, which alone is in triṣṭubh meter, continues  to ask the Aśvins to come, but they are to come not to attend the soma rite but  to bring help, as they did when they rescued Atri. Atri’s situation, stuck within  the earth cleft and unable to come out, is compared to that of a woman in need, probably a woman in a difficult pregnancy whose child does not come out. Then  verses 5–6 likewise compare the situation of Saptavadhri. He too is stuck and needs  to be set free by the Aśvins, and his release is similarly compared to the opening of  the womb so that a child may be born. The details of Saptavadhri’s difficulty and  even Saptavadhri’s identity are unclear—he appears to be Atri in X.39.9 but else
where he is a different seer. According to Sāyaṇa he was trapped in small wooden  casket from which the Aśvins set him free, but this narrative is likely a commentarial  invention.
The entrapment of these seers, already compared in the telling to the situation  of a woman in labor, not only introduce the incantation in the last verses, but also  provide paradigmatic narratives for the birth of the child. As the Aśvins released  these seers, so they will release the child from the body of his mother.
1. O Aśvins, come here! O Nāsatyas, do not lose the track!
– Like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.
2. O Aśvins, like antelopes, like buffaloes searching after pasturage, like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.
3. O Aśvins, whose goods are prizewinners, take pleasure in our sacrifice to  your liking.
– Like wild geese, fly here to the soma-pressings.
4. As when Atri, sinking down into the earth cleft, called upon you again  and again, like a young woman in need (at childbirth),
now by the very speed of a falcon, come here, Aśvins, with your most  luck-bringing (help).
5. O tree, spread apart, like the womb of a woman about to give birth. Hear my call, Aśvins, and free Saptavadhri.
6. For the seer Saptavadhri, who is fearful and in need,
o Aśvins, you bend the tree together and apart by your cunning.
7. As the wind sways a lotus-pond in every direction,
so let your unborn child stir. Let him in his tenth month come out.
8. As the wind, as the forest, as the ocean stirs,
so you in your tenth month—descend together with the afterbirth.
9. Having lain for ten months within his mother, let the boy
come out, alive and unharmed—alive from his living mother.
## 79 (433) Dawn
Satyaśravas Ātreya
10 verses: paṅkti
A hymn with a remarkably unwavering focus on material gain. Since the priestly gifts  (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the dawn ritual, the goddess Dawn is often associated
762 V.79
with wealth and giving, but here very little attention is given to any other aspect of  the goddess. The tone is set by the increasingly monotonous refrain: “o well-born  lady, liberal with horses.” Several patrons are named in the first verses (1–3), and the  poet hopes that patrons in general will be the recipients of Dawn’s bounty, in order  for them to redistribute it to the poets (4–8).
The usual attention to Dawn’s beauty, her first appearance, her journey, her  cows, and so forth is entirely missing in this hymn, which does, however, con tain one striking image, in verse 9. Why a laggard Dawn would be compared  to a thief isn’t entirely clear, but it is quite possibly because thieves worked  at night.
1. Awaken us today for great wealth, o Dawn, as heaven-bright one,
just as you also awakened us at Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
2. You who dawned forth at Sunītha Śaucadratha’s, o Daughter of Heaven, dawn forth at the mightier Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
3. As one bringing goods hither, dawn forth for us today, o Daughter of  Heaven—
you who dawned forth at the mightier Satyaśravas Vāyya’s
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
4. The (oblation-)conveyors who greet you with praises, far-radiant one— those very splendid ones (will become) possessed of gifts and lovely  presents, through your bounties, o bounteous one
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
5. For whenever these throngs appear to you (fit) for the giving of bounties, eager, they surround those who give immoderate benefit [=patrons]
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
6. Upon them confer glory in heroes, bounteous Dawn—upon the patrons, who, bounteous (themselves), have granted us immoderate benefits
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
7. To them bring lofty brilliance and glory, o bounteous Dawn,
to the patrons who apportion to us benefits consisting of horses
and cows
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
8. And bring to us refreshments along with cows, o Daughter of Heaven, simultaneously with the rays of the sun, with his glittering,
gleaming beams
– o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
9. Dawn forth, Daughter of Heaven. Don’t keep dragging out your work  over a long time,
lest the sun scorch you with his beam as (he might) a swindling thief – o well-born lady, liberal with horses. 10. So much you ought to give, o Dawn, or more—
you who, as you dawn, far-radiant one, do not dwindle for the praisers – o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
## 80 (434) Dawn
Satyaśravas Ātreya
6 verses: triṣṭibh
Although this hymn is attributed to the same poet as V.79 by the Anukramaṇī, it is  entirely different in tone. Dawn’s association with wealth is mentioned in verse 3,  but the focus is first on her journey (vss. 1–3) and then, in the second half of this  brief hymn (vss. 4–6), on the beauty of her body as it is slowly revealed in the grow
ing light, in images of delicate sensuality.
Each verse but the first begins with the emphatic pronoun eṣā́ “she,” and there is  no doubt that “she” is all that matters in the hymn.
1. The lofty one whose course is brilliant, who is truthful through her truth,  whose breath is ruddy, who is widely radiant,
goddess Dawn who brings the sun here—in response to her do the
inspired poets awaken with their poetic thoughts.
2. She, worthy to be seen, awakening the people, making the paths easy to  travel, drives in the vanguard
with a lofty chariot, herself lofty, setting all in motion. Dawn extends her  light in the vanguard of the days.
3. She, after hitching up with her ruddy cows, without fail has produced her  wealth unremittingly.
Blazing paths for good passage, the goddess, praised by many, bringing  all valuables, radiates widely.
4. She, the dappled one, becomes doubly exalted as she reveals her body in  the east.
She follows along the path of truth, straight to the goal. Like one who  knows the way, she does not confound the directions.
5. She, like a beauty who knows her own body, has stood up erect like a  bather for us to see.
Thrusting away hatred and the shades of darkness, Dawn, the Daughter  of Heaven, has come here with her light.
6. She, the Daughter of Heaven, facing toward men, lets her breast spill  over like a fortunate young wife,
disclosing desirable things to the pious. The young woman has created  light once again, as before.764 V.81–82
## 81 (435) Savitar
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
5 verses: jagatī
The Anukramaṇī attributes both this and the next hymn, also to Savitar, to Śyāvāśva,  the poet of the Marut cycle in this maṇḍala, and indeed the poet names himself at  the end of the last verse (5). However, the subject of Savitar does not seem to have  inspired him to the same poetic heights as the Maruts did. The hymn depicts Savitar  as a power in the cosmos (especially vss. 2–5), but also as a poet and distributor of  benefits to mortals (1–2ab).
1. They hitch up their mind and they hitch up their insights—the inspired  poets attentive to the poetic inspiration of the lofty inspired poet.
He distributes the ritual offerings as the only one who knows the
patterns. Great is the encircling praise of Savitar.
2. The sage poet fastens all forms upon himself. He has impelled benefit to  the two-footed and the four-footed.
He has looked out across the firmament—Savitar worthy to be chosen.  He rules following the lead of Dawn.
3. Whose lead the others have followed: the gods (following) the might of  the god with their power;
who measured out the earthly (spaces)—he, the steed [/Etaśa], (also)  measured out the (heavenly) spaces with his greatness: god Savitar.
4. And you travel, Savitar, through the three luminous realms, and you are  at home with the rays of the sun.
And you encircle the night on both sides, and you become Mitra [/an  ally], o god, through your supports.
5. And you are master over impulsion, just you alone, and you become  Pūṣan through your journeys.
And you rule over all this world here. Śyāvāśva has achieved his praise  for you, Savitar.
## 82 (436) Savitar
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, arranged in trcas ̥
Structuring this hymn is an insistent pun on the name of Savitar (“the Impeller”)  derived from the root sū “impel”: there are eight separate verbal and nominal forms  of this root in the hymn. Savitar is also identified as the Apportioner (Bhaga), who  often elsewhere appears as a separate divinity though regularly associated with  Savitar, and what he is urged to impel is, for the most part, a good portion for us. 1. This we choose of Savitar’s: the sustenance of the god—
the Apportioner’s best vanquishing power, which best confers
wholeness—(that) would we acquire.
2. For of this Savitar here—his own very self-glorious self-sovereignty they do not confound in any way.
3. Because he, Savitar the Apportioner, will impel treasures to the pious, we beg him for the brilliant portion.
4. Today, god Savitar, you have impelled to us a good portion consisting of  offspring.
Impel away the bad dream.
5. All difficulties impel away, god Savitar.
What is beneficial, that impel here to us.
6. (If we are) without offense to Aditi, at the impulsion of god Savitar might we acquire all things of value.
7. With our hymns we choose today the one with all the gods in his charge,  the lord of settlements,
whose impulsion comes true: Savitar.
8. Who goes in front of both these two day-halves unremittingly
and with good intentions: god Savitar.
9. Who makes all these creatures hearken with his signal-call
and will impel (them) forth: Savitar.
## 83 (437) Parjanya
Atri Bhauma
10 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 5–8, 10, jagatī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 9
Parjanya (“Thunder”) is the subject of only three hymns in the R̥gveda. This lovely  hymn, much translated, is reminiscent of the Marut hymns in this maṇḍala, though  not ascribed to the same poet. (The Maruts are addressed here in vs. 6.) Vivid images  of the power of the thunderstorm are mingled with expressions of thanks for the  fructifying effects of the accompanying rains, depicted as sexual in nature. In the last  verse the poet describes all the good Parjanya has done, but gently urges him to desist.
1. Address the powerful one with these hymns. Praise Parjanya. With  reverence seek to entice him here.
The constantly roaring bull of lively drops deposits his semen as embryo  in the plants.
2. He smashes apart the trees and also smashes the demons. All creation  fears him who has the mighty weapon.
And (even) the blameless one shrinks from the one of bullish powers,  when Parjanya, thundering, smashes those who do ill.
766 V.84
3. Like a charioteer lashing out at his horses with a whip, he reveals his  rain-bearing messengers.
From afar the thunderings of the lion rise up, when Parjanya produces  his rain-bearing cloud.
4. The winds blow forth; the lightning bolts fly. The plants shoot up; the  sun swells.
Refreshment arises for all creation, when Parjanya aids the earth with  his semen.
5. At whose commandment the earth bobs up and down, at whose  commandment the hoofed (livestock) quivers,
at whose commandment the plants take on all forms—you, Parjanya— extend to us great shelter.
6. Grant us rain from heaven, o Maruts; make the streams of the bullish  stallion swell forth.
(Parjanya,) come nearby with this thundering, pouring down the waters  as the lord, our father.
7. Roar! Thunder! Set an embryo! Fly around with your water-bearing  chariot.
Drag the water-skin unleashed, facing downward. Let uplands and
lowlands become alike.
8. The great bucket—turn it up, pour it down. Let the brooks, unleashed,  flow forward.
Inundate Heaven and Earth with ghee. Let there be a good watering  hole for the prized cows.
9. When, o Parjanya, constantly roaring, thundering you smash those who  do ill,
all of this here, whatever is on the earth, rejoices in response.
10. You have rained rain: (now) hold it back. You have made the
wastelands able to be traversed.
You have begotten the plants for nourishment, and you have found
(this?) inspired thought for the creatures.
## 84 (438) Earth
Atri Bhauma
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This tiny hymn is attributed to the same poet as the preceding hymn to Parjanya  and complements that hymn. The poem is a sort of riddle: the first verse establishes  that Earth is the addressee, and in the next verse the address to a feminine being  (the word “earth” is feminine in gender and conceived of as female) continues. But  none of the characteristics mentioned in that verse seem particularly Earth-like. She is addressed as oscillating and silvery; she is associated with the nights; she “flings”  moisture. The riddle is—under what circumstances could Earth be so described?  The answer: under the darkness of the monsoon clouds, when thunder causes her  to shake (thus “oscillating”; see V.83.5) and she is “silvery” with rain, which she  “flings” in the forms of streams and rivulets down her slopes, mentioned in verse  1. This solution was adumbrated by Thieme (1964: 58) and is discussed further in  Jamison (2013).
If the audience doesn’t solve the riddle in verse 2, verse 3 provides the answer.
1. Yes indeed! (It is) just so: you bear the pressure of the mountains,  o Earth,
as you bring the ground to life with your greatness, o gently sloping  great one.
2. Praises sound in response to you, oscillating lady, through the nights, as you fling the swelling moisture forward like a (horse) neighing for a  prize, silvery one—
3. You who, steadfast yourself, keep fast the trees all across the earth by  your strength,
when the lightning bolts of the dark cloud and the rains from heaven  rain for you.
## 85 (439) Varuṇa
Atri Bhauma
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is often admired and translated because of its grand vision of Varuṇa  as a creator god (vss. 1–6) and as a god who forgives the faults of human beings  (vss. 7–8). But what is the connection between these two sides of Varuṇa? The poet  joins the two functions of Varuṇa formally by the repetition of the accented preverb  ví-, meaning “out,” “apart,” or the like. In fashioning the world and sustaining life,  Varuṇa “split apart” (ví ...jaghā́na, 1c), “stretched out” (ví ...tatāna, 2a), “soaks”  (vy ùnatti, 3d), and “measured out” (ví mamé, 5d). All this leads up to the plea that  Varuṇa “unbind” (ví ṣya, 8c) the wrongs that people commit. With their sense of  opening up and freeing, the verbal compounds with ví- create not only a verbal con nection between Varuṇa’s cosmogonic and redemptive acts, but a logical one as well.  On the cosmological plane Varuṇa spread out the world beneath the sun (vs. 1cd),  stretched out the midspace (vs. 2ab), and lets loose the rain (vss. 3–4) and the rivers  (vs. 6). Analogously, on the moral plane he loosens the fetters that people’s evildoing  would otherwise create (vs. 8). Thus the hymn is dominated by the name of Varuṇa,  which occurs in every verse except one (vs. 6) and the preverb ví-. Even where these do  not appear, the poet echoes váruṇa and ví- throughout the hymn by repeating words
768 V.85
containing -v- and, especially, beginning with v-, for example, váneṣu and vā́jam opening 2a and 2b, téna víśvasya and yávaṃ ná vr̥ṣṭír ví at the beginning of 3c and  3d, váruṇo váṣṭi in 4b, vasata and vīrā́ḥ in 4c and 4d, and so forth.
In all of this, verse 6 is anomalous, since it does not mention Varuṇa by name and  does not contain ví- or even a word beginning with v-. It is generally more difficult to  explain why something does not occur than why something does, but the position and  content of the verse suggest possible reasons for these omissions. First, the verse may  be marked, albeit by absence, because it is the transitional verse from the cosmologi
cal themes of the first part of the hymn to the redemptive one of the last two verses.  Second, the theme of the verse is the mystery of the god. Its center is the paradox in  6cd that the “sea”—whatever body of water is meant by that—never fills despite the  waters flooding into it. The opening line of the verse mentions Varuṇa’s māyā́, his  “cunning,” and calls him the kavítama, “the foremost sage poet,” the one who best  knows and best articulates what he knows. The poet may have suppressed overt men
tion of Varuṇa’s name to indicate the impenetrability of his power and mind.
1. Chant forth to the sovereign king a lofty and deep formulation, dear to  famed Varuṇa,
who, like a butcher an animal hide, split apart the earth to form an
underlayer for the sun.
2. He stretched out the midspace upon the trees, the prize of victory in the  steeds, the milk in the ruddy (cows);
Varuṇa placed resolve in hearts, fire in waters, the sun in heaven, and  soma on the stone.
3. Varuṇa has poured out the cask with its opening below upon the two  world-halves and the midspace.
By this he is king of the whole living world. Like rain the barley, he
soaks the land.
4. He soaks the land, the earth, and heaven. When Varuṇa wishes milk to  flow, then surely it does:
the mountains cloak themselves with the rain cloud; showing their
might, the heroes [=the Maruts?] let themselves loose.
5. I proclaim this great cunning of the lordly, famed Varuṇa,
who, standing in the midspace as if with a measuring rod, measured out  earth with the sun.
6. And now no one defies this great cunning of the foremost sage poet,  the god:
that the mottled streams, pouring out, do not fill the single sea
with water.
7. O Varuṇa, the offense that we have committed against any partner, be he  one by alliance or one by custom, or against a brother,
or against a neighbor—whether native or foreign—o Varuṇa,
loosen that. 8. If (we have cheated) as gamblers cheat in a dice game, whether overtly or  whether we are unaware,
unbind all these things (so they will be) like loose things, o god. Then  would we be dear to you, Varuṇa.
## 86 (440) Indra and Agni
Atri Bhauma
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except virāṭpūrvā 6
Although Agni and Indra separately receive the largest number of R̥gvedic hymns  of any of the gods, they have little to do with each other conceptually or ritu ally, and the relatively few hymns they share (eleven in all) tend either to be banal,  boiler-plate hymns without much content, or else ones favoring one or the other of  the gods. There are elements of both types in this hymn. On the one hand, Indra  and Agni are invoked as a pair through much of the hymn with fairly all-purpose  phraseology. On the other, the two exploits described (in 1cd and the very difficult  3cd, the middle of the hymn) are Indraic: the first a clear reference to the Vala myth,  though with Trita, not Indra, as hero; the second a reference to the Vr̥tra myth, with  some curious features, especially the unidentified wooden object.
1. Indra and Agni, the mortal whom you both help in the prize-contests, that one splits open even the fastnesses to (reach) their brilliant
(contents), as Trita (did) the voices (of the cows? of the rivers?).
2. You two who are difficult to surpass in battles, who are worthy of fame  at the prize-contests,
who sur(mount) the five domains—these two, Indra and Agni, we
invoke.
3. Vehement is the force of those two bounteous ones, sharp their missile. With the wooden (weapon?) in the hands of the Vr̥tra-smasher he
[=Vr̥tra-smashing Indra] goes questing (in his quest) for cattle.
4. In our quest for chariots we call upon you two, Indra and Agni,
the two lords of powerful generosity, the knowing ones who most long  for hymns.
5. The two, growing strong through the days, the two gods undeceptive to  the mortal,
just these two do I set in front, the two gods like portions for a steed,  though themselves deserving (portions).
6. Thus to Indra and Agni this forceful oblation [/invocation] has been  offered, like ghee purified by stones.
You two, fix lofty fame fast in the patrons, wealth in the singers—fix  refreshment in the singers.
770 V.87
## 87 (441) Maruts
Evayāmarut Ātreya
9 verses: atijagatī
This final hymn of Maṇḍala V is clearly an addition to the original collection, and  it is composed in an unusual lyric meter found only in this hymn and a few scat tered verses in the rest of the saṃhitā, consisting of five pādas arranged in two  half-verses: 12 12 / 12 8 8. (It is convenient here to place the final two pādas on  a separate verse line.) The end of the first hemistich of each verse is marked by  the unusual formation evayā́marut, which serves as an internal refrain, syntacti cally unconnected to the rest of the verse. This word is aberrantly formed, and  our translation reflects what we consider its intent, rather than a literal value. (The  Anukramaṇī names Evayāmarut as the poet of this hymn, but the name is obvi ously secondarily derived from the refrain. We would not be surprised if Śyāvāśva  was responsible for this playful Marut hymn.) Indeed, the syntax is lax in a number  of verses, which appear to be constructed of metrical phrases with internal syntac tic unity but loosely strung together.
In terms of content the most striking feature is the close association between the  god Viṣṇu and the Maruts. The Maruts are mentioned with Viṣṇu in other places  in the R̥gveda, but not in such a sustained fashion as here. The thematic connection  between them is not entirely clear, but Viṣṇu’s famous three strides from earth to  heaven, via the midspace, do remind us of the ever-journeying Maruts, who gener
ally inhabit the midspace but are found also both in heaven and on earth.
1. Let your thoughts go forth to mighty, mountain-born Viṣṇu,
accompanied by the Maruts—Maruts on the march—
to the troop worshiped at the beginning of the sacrifice, well-spangled, powerful, fortunate in their quest, of boisterous commandment, (who  are) strength (itself).
2. Who—(both) those produced by might and those self(-produced)— proclaim (their strength) with their know-how—Maruts on
the march—
with regard to your will—its strength, o Maruts, is not to be assailed; with regard to their giving, their might—that (strength) is like
unassailable mountains.
3. Who are heard from lofty heaven through a hymn [/on the mountain],  beautifully blazing, good in their essence—Maruts on the march—
in whose seat no meddler holds sway—
flashing out by themselves like fires—(the chariots?) of the boisterous  ones (go) forth streaming.
4. The wide-striding one [=Viṣṇu] has stridden forth from the great
common seat—Maruts on the march.
When from his own (seat) upon the (mountains’) backs he has hitched  up by himself the competitors of extensive might, he goes, growing strong with
kindness, with the superior men.
5. Vehement like your roar, the driving turbulent forceful bull [=Viṣṇu] sets  (the earth) atremble—Maruts on the march—
with whom the victorious self-luminous ones stretch out straight—
the golden ones possessing taut reins, good weapons, arrows.
6. Your might has no further shore, o you whose strength has grown. Let  your turbulent strength be of aid—Maruts on the march—
for, in the sight of all, you are firm-mounted (charioteers) in the
onslaught.
Deliver us from insult, (you who are) like blazing fires.
7. Let these Rudras, good battlers, like fires powerfully brilliant, be of aid— Maruts on the march.
Long and broad the earthly seat spreads out,
when at the drives of them, whose offenses are beyond harm, the troops  of great (Viṣṇu) ap(proach).
8. Without hatred, come on your way to us here, Maruts. Hear the call of  the singer—Maruts on the march.
O you of equal spirit, along with great Viṣṇu,
like charioteers with wondrous skill, keep hatreds far away in the
distance.
9. Come to our sacrifice, you worthy of the sacrifice, with its good labor.  Hear the call in undemonic (spirit)—Maruts on the march.
Like the most ancient mountains in distant heaven,
you, o discerning ones, should be difficult to restrain at an insult to this  one [=singer].

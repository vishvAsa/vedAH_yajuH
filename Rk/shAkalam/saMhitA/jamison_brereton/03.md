With a few exceptions, the hymns of Maṇḍala III belong to Viśvāmitra Gāthina  and other members of his family. Of the sixty-two hymns in the maṇḍala, the  Anukramaṇī states that Viśvāmitra himself composed all or parts of forty-six, along  with two others that might be his or that might belong to another poet (III.31, 38).  The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s  father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his  grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are  also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son  of Kata Vaiśvāmitra. Outside of III, a few verses (IX.67.13–15; X.137.5) and one  jointly composed hymn (X.167) are also attributed to Viśvāmitra. Likewise, other  Vaiśvāmitras appear among the composers of hymns in IX and X: Madhuchandas  (IX.1), Reṇu (IX.70, X.89), Aṣṭaka (X.104), and Pūraṇa (X.160). Among the  remaining poets of III mentioned by the Anukramaṇī are Devaśravas Bhārata and  Devavāta Bhārata, who, it says, together composed the Agni hymn, III.23. The  Anukramaṇī’s attribution may be drawn from the hymn itself, which mentions the  two. However, the Bhārata king Sudās was the patron of Viśvāmitra, and the inclu sion of a hymn ostensibly by two Bhāratas may reflect the close connection between  the clans of the poet and the king.
The Viśvāmitra collection is dominated by hymns to Agni (1–29) and to Indra  (30–53). It concludes with four hymns to the All Gods (54–57) and single hymns  to the Aśvins (58), Mitra (59), the R̥bhus (60), and Dawn (61). The hymn to Mitra  is the only hymn dedicated solely to this god in the R̥gveda and perhaps shows  a special affinity between Mitra and his partial namesake, Viśvāmitra. The last  hymn (62) is a collection of tr̥cas to six different deities or pairs of deities, including  some not otherwise represented in the maṇḍala. The hymn would not be especially  noteworthy, except that verse 10, dedicated to Savitar, is the Gāyatrī mantra, the  best-known verse in the R̥gveda.
Within the Agni series is a hymn (III.8) to the sacrificial post or posts, to which  sacrificial animals would have been tied. Also in this series is a hymn (III.12) to  the dual divinities, Indra and Agni. They are brought together here because Agni,  representing the sacrifice, and Indra, representing the warriors, jointly lead the clans’ victorious march across the rivers. Another unusual Agni hymn is III.26,  which follows the process of kindling the sacrificial fire and anticipates the later  Āgnimāruta śastra. In the Indra series, a historically and literarily significant  hymn is III.33, which addresses the Rivers, Viśvāmitra himself, and Indra, and  which the Anukramaṇī attributes to the Rivers and Viśvāmitra. The reason for the  Anukramaṇī’s attribution is that this hymn is a dialogue between Viśvāmitra and  the Vipāś and Śutudrī Rivers. The poet approaches the Rivers and asks them to  stop in order to allow the Bhāratas to cross. These two rivers are the modern Beas  and Sutlej, which are part of the Indus river complex, and crossing these rivers may  mark a raid, seasonal migration, or resettlement from the west toward the east. In  III.33, which likely marks a later period in the Bhāratas’ migration, they are in the  area of the Sarasvatī, Dr̥ṣadvatī, and Āpayā rivers, and although the identification  of these rivers is controversial, they probably place the Bhāratas in Kurukṣetra, east  of the Vipāś and Śutudrī. Also in the Indra series is a cosmogonic hymn, III.38,  which describes the origin of the material of creation and the division of that mate rial into names and forms. Like the even more famous X.129, the hymn compares  the creativity that founded the world to the creativity of the poet. The last hymn of  the Indra series and a supplement to it is III.53, which is a praise of Viśvāmitra and  his family and of King Sudās and the Bhāratas, whom they serve.
One of the distinctive characteristics of this maṇḍala is that its poets mark seven  of its Agni hymns (1, 5, 6, 7, 15, 22, and 23) and twelve of its Indra hymns (30, 31,  32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 43, 48, 49, and 50) with a final verse that identifies the hymn as  a Vaiśvāmitra creation. Other poetic families also have such signature verses, but the  Viśvāmitras have one for their Agni hymns and a different one for the Indra hymns.

1 (235) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
23 verses: triṣṭubh
In our interpretation, Agni opens the hymn with a declaration that the priests have  kindled him to carry the oblations. The poet and the priests then confirm that they  have indeed laid the fire to begin the rite. Implied in the first two verses is thus the  birth of the sacrificial fire, and the birth of Agni then becomes the central theme  of the hymn. The first part of the hymn (vss. 3–14) reflects not only on the birth of  the ritual fire, but also on Agni’s ultimate birth from the waters. Indeed, throughout  much of the first half of the hymn, the verses can be taken as describing either the  birth of the ritual fire or the ultimate birth of Agni or both. The poem thus merges  Agni’s original or ultimate birth among the waters and his birth here in the sacrifice  to the accompaniment of the priestly recitations. This poetic strategy complicates  the translation and interpretation of the hymn. For example, verse 4 refers to the  “seven young women,” who are also the mares who tend to Agni (4cd) and who

reappear again in verses 6 and 9. In verse 4 these seven women are likely the riv ers, as Geldner rightly notes, but in verse 6 they are identified, unexpectedly, as the  voices of the seven priests of the soma rite. Retrospectively, therefore, we can view  these women as both the rivers and the voices. Similarly in verse 11 the “kindred
sisters” might be the rivers, or they might again be the voices of the priests. The identity of Agni’s father also complicates the story of Agni’s birth. In verse  10 Agni gives rise to Agni, and therefore Agni is also his own father. But then who  is the father in verse 9? Geldner and Renou think that his father there is Heaven,  Heaven’s udder the raincloud, and therefore the fire here is lightning. More likely,  however, the reference is to the ritual fire. If so, then the father in verse 9 might  be the priest churning the fire, the udder his voice, and the udder’s “spurts and  streams” the words of the priest. Or, again in light of verse 10, the father might  be Agni, who nurtures himself through the “spurts and streams” of his spreading  flames. Or, just as in the case of the “seven young women,” the poet may intend  several of these possibilities.
As Geldner notes, from verse 15 the poet more unambiguously addresses the  ritual fire, though he does return to the theme of Agni’s births in verse 20. This time,  though, the reference may be not only to the ultimate origins of Agni but also and  primarily to the ritual fires of long ago and the ritual fire of the present.
### 1
[Agni:] “You have made me your draft-horse, who am mighty from  soma—(saying,) ‘Convey (the oblations), o Agni’—in order (for me)  to offer the sacrifice at the ritual distribution.”
[The poet:] “As you shine toward the gods—I harness the stone and
I labor, o Agni—take delight in your own body.”
### 2
[The priests:] “We have made the sacrifice turned to the east (in order to  begin). Let our song become strong.” (So saying) they befriend Agni  with kindling wood and with reverence.
From heaven they [=the gods?] have directed the ritual distributions of  the sages. They have sought the way for (Agni), even for the clever and  mighty one.
### 3
The wise (Agni) of refined skill created joy for himself—he who through  his birth is the close kin of heaven and of earth.
The gods found the lovely one within the waters; (they found) Agni in  the work of the sisters [=rivers or fingers of the priests].
### 4
The seven young women strengthened him of good fortune, who is white  as he comes to birth, red in his greatness.
(Those) mares came to him (newly born) as to a new-born colt. The gods  marveled at Agni at his birth.
### 5
Stretching through the airy realm with his blazing limbs, purifying his  resolve through the sage poets as his purifying filters,
clothing himself all around in flame, and being the life of the waters, he  measures out his splendors, lofty and never wanting. 6. He wandered toward them, who neither speak falsely nor can be  deceived, who are the young women of heaven, neither clothing
themselves nor naked.
Here the young women of long ago, who came from the same womb,  conceived their single embryo—they, the seven voices.
### 7
Strewn about and pressing together are his (flames) of all colors in the  womb of ghee and in the stream of the honeyed (soma juices).
Here have the swelling cows [=milk offerings] taken their stand. The  two mothers of wondrous (Agni) [=the two fire churning sticks?] are  the two great ones, the two united.
### 8
Being carried (as an embryo), o son of strength, you have flashed out,  assuming your wondrous forms that blaze and rage.
Streams of honey and ghee drip where the bull has grown strong
through our poetic craft.
### 9
At his birth, he found the udder even of his father. He let loose its  streams and spurts in every direction.
Him who moves in hiding from his kind companions [=the priests]— (though) he was not hidden from the young women of heaven—
### 10
(Him) who was the embryo of his father and begetter did he himself  carry. Alone, he suckled upon the many swelling females.
(Protect) his two kindred cowives for the blazing bull, protect the pair  [=the fire-churning sticks?] belonging to the sons of Manu for him.
### 11
The great one has grown strong in the broad and unrestricted (place).  The waters (go) to Agni, for glory gets the girls.
In the womb of truth lay the lord of the house, Agni, within the work  of the kindred sisters.
### 12
Like a burden-bearing foal [?], at the meeting place of the great (waters?),  the one desirable for a son to see and foaming with radiance,
the begetter who gave birth to the ruddy (cows of dawn), the embryo of  the waters, and the best of men is the young Agni.
### 13
The (fire-churning) Wood—she who brings good fortune—has given  birth to the lovely embryo of the waters and of the plants, to him of  various colors.
Since they have united in their thinking, even the gods befriend the
most admired and powerful one as soon as he is born.
### 14
Like blazing flashes of lightning, lofty radiant beams accompany Agni,  foaming with radiance,
as they yield as their milk the immortal (Agni), grown strong within his  own seat as if in hiding, within the unbounded container.
### 15
I call upon you, sacrificing with my offerings, and I call upon your  companionship and your favor with desire.
With the gods, give help in full measure to the singer, and guard us with  your faces that belong to the house.

### 16
As your dependents, o well-guiding Agni, receiving all riches
and thrusting ourselves forward with a fame that comes with good
seed, we would prevail over the godless battle-mongers.
### 17
Here have you come to be the beacon of the gods, o Agni, delighting  and knowing all poetic crafts.
As the lord of the household, you allowed mortals to settle down, and  as a charioteer bringing success, you journey following the gods.
### 18
The immortal king has taken his seat in the house of mortals, bringing  success to the ritual distributions.
His face covered in ghee, he flashed out widely—Agni knowing all
poetic crafts.
### 19
Come to us together with your kind companionship, hastening as the  great one together with your great help.
Make for us abundant wealth that brings us safely across, and a share  for us that brings beautiful speech and glory.
### 20
These your births of long ago, o Agni, and your present ones I shall  proclaim for the ancient one.
Great soma-pressings for the bull have been made here. Jātavedas has  been installed in one birth after another.
### 21
Having been installed in one birth after another, Jātavedas, the
inexhaustible, is kindled by the Viśvāmitras.
We would be within the good will of him who is worthy of the sacrifice,  even within his favorable benevolence.
### 22
O you endowed with strength, you of strong resolve, place this sacrifice  among the gods for us, giving (it to them).
Hold forth the lofty refreshing drinks for us, o Hotar. O Agni, win great  wealth by sacrifice.
### 23
– Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow,  succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.
There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let  this your favor be for us.

2 (236) Agni Vaiśvānara
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
15 verses: jagatī
The first verse announces the two themes of this hymn: the establishment of the fire in  the sacrifice and its connection with the words recited by the priests. The poet begins  by announcing that the priests are creating the dhiṣáṇā, the “Holy Place” for the fire.  The meaning and etymology of dhiṣáṇā are not transparent, but it is synchronically  associated with the root √dhā “place, establish”—allowing the reference to the Holy Place of fire to be carried through this hymn by the frequent use of derivatives of  √dhā (vss. 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 15, echoed in vs. 6 when √dhā is used not to describe the  placement of fire but the establishment of wealth for the sacrificers). The placement  of fire is also connected to the words of the priests. The chanters “bring together”  Agni as their Hotar (vs. 1); gods originally gave rise to Agni through their “insights”  (vs. 3); and Agni flourishes “through our good thoughts” (vs. 12). The close con
nection between the words of the sacrificial performers and the kindling of fire is  reflected in the poet’s description of Agni as a kaví, a sage poet (vss. 4, 7, 10). This hymn also explicitly describes or refers to the rites surrounding fire, some times connecting them with the character of the god Agni and often his role as  Vaiśvānara, the sun. In 4d, for example, the poet puns on rā́jantam, which can  describe Agni as both “ruling” (as it is translated there) and “shining” with his  heavenly flame as fire is kindled. In verse 9 the three kindling sticks may refer to the  three fires set to the west, south, and east that surround the sacrificial area, which  represents the earth. Thus Agni as the ritual fires around the sacrificial ground is  also Agni as the sun, which encircles the earth. And in verse 12, as Geldner rightly  remarks, the course of Agni is both the course of the sun and the paryagnikaraṇa,  the rite of carrying the fire around the sacrificial animal.
At the end of the hymn, having set the fire in place, the poet turns to the Fire to  beg for easy travel, for the prizes of victory in the sacrificial contest, and for wealth.
### 1
We give birth to the Holy Place for Vaiśvānara, who grows strong  through the truth, like purified ghee for Agni.
Once again, as an axe brings together a chariot, the chanters (bring  together) with their insight the Hotar [=Agni], (who was) also (the
Hotar) of Manu.
### 2
He made both world-halves shine through his birth. He became the son  to be invoked by his two parents [=Heaven and Earth?].
Agni is the conveyor of oblations, unaging and placed for delight,
difficult to deceive, the guest of the clans, rich in radiance.
### 3
In accordance with their will and upon the broad foundation of their skill  and power to surpass, the gods gave birth to Agni through their insights. I speak to the great one, shining with his radiance and his light, as one  who wants to win the prize (speaks) to his steed.
### 4
Wanting to win it, we choose the desirable, audacious, verse-worthy prize  of the delighting (Agni),
the gift of the Bhr̥gus, the fire-priest with a poet’s resolve—Agni
(himself), who rules with his heavenly flame.
### 5
With twisted ritual grass, the peoples have placed Agni in front, him who  brings fame as a prize, for the sake of his favor,
and with offering ladle extended, they (have placed) him, brightly
shining, belonging to all the gods, the Rudra of the sacrifices, bringing  success to the offerings of the (ritual) workers.

### 6
O you of pure flame, because our men with twisted ritual grass in the  sacrifices are all around your dwelling, o Hotar,
they are drawing near, seeking your company, your friendship, o Agni.  Establish wealth for them.
### 7
The great sun filled both world-halves, when the (ritual) workers  supported him when he was just born.
And he, the sage poet, is led around for the rite, like a steed, for the  winning of the prize, being placed for delight.
### 8
Revere him who gives the oblation, who makes the rites good. Befriend  the domestic Jātavedas.
The charioteer of the lofty truth who has no boundary, Agni has  become the one placed in front of the gods.
### 9
The deathless fire-priests purified three kindling sticks for the youthful,  earth-encircling Agni.
While they placed one of these as a benefit for the mortal, two also  went up to the wide world (of heaven) kindred (to the earth).
### 10
The refreshments of the sons of Manu [=the oblations of ghee] have  perfected him, the poet of the clans, the clanlord, to be sharp like  an axe.
He journeys to the heights and the depths, being ever active. He  supports his embryo among these living beings.
### 11
Since he understands how, the bull enlivens himself in his shimmering  bellies like a loudly roaring lion—
deathless Vaiśvānara of broad visage, who distributes goods and  treasures to the pious man.
### 12
As of old, Vaiśvānara mounted the vault of the sky, the back of heaven,  becoming joyful through our good thoughts.
As before, producing the winnings for the (human) race, being awake,  he goes around the same course.
### 13
The inspired one, possessing the truth, worthy of the sacrifice, and  worthy of hymns, the dwelling in heaven whom Mātariśvan
placed here—
him do we beseech, him whose path is shimmering, whose hair is tawny,  beautifully shining Agni, for a newer easy passage.
### 14
Like the blazing (sun) in its course, the vigorous one of sunlike  appearance, the beacon of heaven, standing within the realm of light  and awakening at dawn—
Agni, the unstoppable head of heaven, him do we beseech with our  reverence on high as our prizewinner horse.
### 15
The delighting Hotar, the blazing one free of duplicity, the lord of the  household, worthy of hymns and belonging to all lands,
like the shimmering chariot [=the sun?], lovely to see for his beautiful  form, the one placed by Manu, do we ever beseech for wealth.

3 (237) Agni Vaiśvānara
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: jagatī
In this hymn the poet stresses the dual role of Agni as fire and sun and therefore  as belonging to mortals and to gods. The movement between Agni as the sacrificial  fire and as the sun is announced in the first verse: Agni befriends the gods, and he  also maintains the integrity of the sacrifice for humans. Because he belongs to both  gods and mortals, Agni moves between the two world-halves, the sphere of the gods  in heaven and the place of mortals on earth—a theme repeated in verses 2, 4, 6,  and 10. Some of the more enigmatic aspects of this hymn may reflect the location  of Agni in both heaven and earth and the unity of Agni as sacrificial fire and as  the sun. In verse 8 Agni’s simultaneous connection to gods and mortals reaches a  climax, in which it is not clear which of the two is being talked about. Who or what  is being strengthened? Is it the gods, the kin of Manu, the sacrifice, or even Agni  himself? In verse 2 Agni’s “lofty dwelling place” could refer both to the place of the  sun in heaven or the place of the sacrificial fire.
A special mystery concerns the last verse of the hymn, verse 11. In 11b, following  the suggestion of Geldner, we have taken Agni as the subject, and Agni’s semen as  the suppressed object. The reference, he suggests, is the mystery and paradox of Agni  as his own father, which is also found in III.2. The image is an unusual one, but sev
eral elements of verse 11 suggest that it is Agni’s semen (rétas) that “flows on high.”  First, rétas is both present in pāda d and suggested by √rī “flow” in pāda b. Second,  that which is “flowing on high” in pādas ab results in Agni’s birth in cd. Finally, the  ellipsis of the object, which occurs between br̥hád / áriṇād, is solved in pāda d by  bhū́ri-retasā “having abundant semen,” which echoes br̥hád / áriṇād phonologically  and thereby suggests “semen” as the missing object. The mystery also brings back  the theme of the Agni as sun and as sacrificial fire, since the fire who is single and  who makes semen flow on high is likely the sun. In any case, that theme is restated in  the last lines, which identify the parents of Agni as both Heaven and Earth.
### 1
To honor Vaiśvānara of broad visage, our inspired words offer him  treasures so that he goes upon strong supports.
Since immortal Agni befriends the gods, therefore, from of old, he has  never corrupted the foundations (of the sacrifice).
### 2
The wondrous messenger journeys between the two world-halves. The  Hotar of Manu has taken his seat, placed to the fore.
He attends upon his lofty dwelling place throughout the days. Bringing  goods through his insight, Agni is urged on by the gods.
### 3
Beacon of the sacrifices, bringer of success to the ritual distribution— Agni do the inspired poets exalt with their thoughts.
In whom they have gathered their tasks and their songs, in him the
sacrificer desires to find favors.

### 4
The father of sacrifices and the lord of those perceiving the inspired  words, Agni is the measure and pattern for the chanters.
He has entered the two world-halves with their abundant forms. Dear  to many, the poet becomes joyful through his manifestations.
### 5
Shimmering Agni, whose chariot is shimmering and whose
commandments are golden, Vaiśvānara, who sits amid the waters
and finds the sun,
the one who sinks deep and moves swiftly, surrounded by his powers— him, ardent and very splendid, have the gods placed here.
### 6
Agni, who, together with the gods and with the kin of Manu, extends  the much-adorned sacrifice by his insight,
speeds between (the two worlds) as a charioteer by means of those
[=the gods and the kin of Manu] who bring the offerings to
success—he the lively houselord, who dispels curses.
### 7
O Agni, be awake to a lifetime rich with descendants (for us). Swell with  nourishment, and shine refreshments on us.
Quicken our vital powers and the (gods) on high, o you who are awake,  as the fire-priest of the gods. You are the one of strong resolve for
inspired words.
### 8
Clanlord, youthful guest, controller of insights, and fire-priest of the  chanters,
sign of the rites, and Jātavedas—him do our men ever proclaim with  reverence, (for him) to give strength by his spur.
### 9
The far-radiant god, the great delight, Agni with his chariot and  through his vast power has surrounded the settlements.
We would attend to the commandments of him who prospers
abundantly here in our house by means of our well-twisted hymns.
### 10
Vaiśvānara, I desire your manifestations, by which you became the one  who finds the sun, o far-gazing one.
As soon as you were born, you filled the living worlds and the two
world-halves. Agni, you surround all these in your own person.
### 11
By the wondrous powers of Vaiśvānara and by his good work, the  single poet [=Agni?] made it [=his semen?] flow on high.
Agni was born, exalting both his parents, Heaven and the Earth, who  have abundant semen.

4 (238) Āprı̄
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the ten Āprī litanies found in the R̥gveda. This is one of the eleven-verse  versions, with Tanūnāpāt in position 2 and no Narāśaṃsa. It is a trickier Āprī hymn than most, in that not all the key words are overtly expressed but are implied by  derivationally related (vs. 1) or phonologically similar (vs. 3) words or are simply  gapped (vs. 5). For example, rather than the usual past participle samíddha “kin dled” in the first verse, this hymn has the āmreḍita nominal samít-samid “kindling  stick after kindling stick.” In verse 3 iḷáḥ “of the milk libation” substitutes for the  usual īḍitá “solemnly invoked,” with similar phonology though they are etymo logically and semantically unrelated. In verse 5 the expected Divine Doors do not  appear but can be supplied with the feminine adjective pūrvī́ḥ “many.” As usual,  the key words (or their substitutes) are italicized in this translation. The final four  verses are identical to VII.2.8–11.
### 1
Kindling stick after kindling stick—become favorable to us. With flame  after flame, give the favor of the good one.
Convey here the gods, o god, for the sacrifice. As our companion,
favorable (to us), sacrifice to your companions, o Agni.
### 2
You to whom the gods—Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni—offer sacrifice three  times in a day, day after day,
make this sacrifice to be honey-filled for us, o Tanūnapāt, and, with its  womb of ghee, to give honor (to the gods).
### 3
The insight that fulfills all wishes goes forth to the Hotar [=Agni] of the  milk-libation in order to offer sacrifice first
and to celebrate the bull here with acts of reverence. When prompted, he  will sacrifice to the gods as the superior sacrificer.
### 4
High above has the path for you two been created in the rite. High above  have the flames advanced into the airy spaces,
or rather the Hotar has been seated at the navel of heaven. We strew the  ritual grass widely, providing an expanse for the gods.
### 5
Choosing in their mind the seven offices of the Hotar, driving everything  onward, they [=the gods] return in accordance with the truth.
They wander forth to this sacrifice through the many (Divine Doors),  which have excellent men [=the gods?] as their adornment and which  are born at the ritual distributions.
### 6
Becoming joyful here, Dawn and Night are close by, and they both smile,  though in body they have different forms,
so that Mitra will rejoice in us, and Varuṇa, and also Indra along with  the Maruts, through their great powers.
### 7
I direct the two foremost Divine Hotars downward. The seven (priests),  giving strength, become exhilarated by their own will.
Reciting the truth, they speak just the truth, reflecting upon their
commandments as the protectors of commandments.
### 8
Bhāratī along with the Bhāratīs, Iḷā along with the gods, Agni along with  the sons of Manu,
and Sarasvatī along with the Sārasvatas are near: let the three goddesses sit here on the ritual grass.474 III.5
### 9
O god Tvaṣṭar, unbind for us this flow of semen and what prospers,  granting (that)
from which a hero is born, fit for action and very skilled, who yokes up  the pressing stones and desires the gods.
### 10
O Lord of the Forest, send it [=the sacrificial animal] to the gods. Agni,  the Śamitar, will sweeten the offering.
And it is he, the more real Hotar [=Agni], who will offer sacrifice, since  he knows the births of the gods.
### 11
Journey near here, o Agni, as you are kindled, on the same chariot with  Indra and the swift gods.
Let Aditi of good sons sit on our ritual grass. Svāhā! Let the immortal  gods rejoice!

5 (239) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The address is to Agni as the fire kindled in the morning rites, whose appearance  anticipates that of the dawns and the sun. His advent inspires the recitations  of the priests and Agni himself grows stronger through those recitations and  through the rites, if Geldner has rightly identified “the many manifestations of  truth” in verse 2 as the acts of the sacrifice. The poet’s major theme, though, is  the identification of Agni with various deities whose functions intersect with  those of Agni. In verse 4 and briefly reprised toward the end of the hymn in  verse 9, Agni is Mitra, the god of alliances, because his kindling marks the  re-creation of the alliance between gods and mortals through the performance  of the sacrifice. Agni’s identification with the Adhvaryu, the priest in charge of  the action of the rite, follows from his role as Mitra. In 4d, however, the appella tive sense of mitrá “ally” comes to the fore, and Agni is not only part of the rite  and household, but the ally of the rivers and mountains, all the territories of the  earth. More unusually, in verse 4 he is also identified in his form as Jātavedas as  Varuṇa, the god of commandments. Neither Agni’s identification as Jātavedas  nor his authority to command are central to this hymn, so the introduction of  Varuṇa here is the result of Varuṇa’s close connection with Mitra, and Jātavedas,  although normally a name of Agni, is here semiautonomous from him, like  Tanūnapāt in the previous hymn.
Verses 5 and 6, occupying the mysterious middle of the hymn, are the most  difficult. Verse 5ab might continue from 4d, proclaiming that the highest limits of  the earth and even the sky are governed by Agni. Alternatively, the “summit’s tip”  could be the reach of the sacrificial fire and the track of the bird could be the track  of the sun. In the latter case the verses connect two forms of Agni as the sacrificial fire and as the sun. In verse 6 Agni is identified with another deity, R̥bhu or the  R̥bhu, the craftsman, who, like Agni, is also a priest. The “hide of the grain” is  puzzling, but as also in IV.7.7, it might refer to the ritual grass and the “track of  the bird” again to Agni as the sun, appearing during the kindling of the morning  sacrificial fire.
Verse 7 once more takes up the theme of the birth of Agni. His parents might be  Heaven and Earth, as Sāyaṇa and other interpreters suggest, or, more likely, the two  fire-churning sticks, which are Agni’s new parents with his every birth. Once Agni  is born, the plants—the kindling chips—nurture him and he becomes strong in the  lap of his parents. Then in verse 9 Agni, now flaring up, appears both in heaven as  the sun and in the sacrificial area, the navel of the earth, as the fire of the sacrifice.  The poem ends with one last identification: Agni is Mātariśvan, the fire-bringer, for  fire gives rise to fire.
### 1
In response to the dawns, the ever more visible Agni has awakened, the  inspired (priest), trail-blazer for the poets.
He of broad visage, kindled by those seeking the gods, as the draft-horse  (of the oblations), has opened the doors of darkness.
### 2
To be revered through recitations, Agni has grown still stronger through  the praises and songs of the praise singers.
Delighting in the many manifestations of truth, the messenger has flared  forth at the shining out of dawn.
### 3
Agni has been installed among the clans of the sons of Manu—the  embryo of the waters and Mitra bringing success through the truth.
Beloved and worthy of the sacrifice, he has mounted the back (of the  altar), and has become the inspired (priest) to be invoked by our
thoughts.
### 4
Agni becomes Mitra when he is kindled. As the Hotar, he is Mitra; as  Jātavedas, Varuṇa.
As the vigorous Adhvaryu and the lord of the household, he is Mitra,  the Mitra of the rivers and mountains.
### 5
He protects the summit’s [?] tip dear to him and the track of the bird.  The young one protects the course of the sun.
Agni protects the seven-headed (chant?) in the navel (of the sacrifice).  Towering, he protects the exhilarating (soma?) of the gods.
### 6
The R̥bhu [=Agni] created for himself the beloved name (of R̥bhu) to be  invoked, since he is the god who knows all the ritual patterns.
The hide of the grain and the track of the bird, (each) covered in ghee— just that does Agni guard, never lapsing.
### 7
Being eager, Agni has mounted the eager womb covered in ghee and  providing wide entry.
Shining, blazing, towering, pure—again and again he has made his
mother and father new.

### 8
As soon as he is born, he grows strong through the plants, when the  fruitful (plants) make him strong with ghee.
Like the waters appearing in beauty on their downward course, Agni  makes a wide path [?] in the lap of his parents [=the fire-churning
sticks].
### 9
Praised, the young one has flared up through his kindling, upon the  summit of heaven and the navel of earth.
To be invoked as Mitra and Mātariśvan, Agni as messenger will convey  the gods to the sacrifice.
### 10
Towering, Agni has propped up the vault of the sky through his  kindling, becoming the highest of the lights,
when Mātariśvan kindled him hiding from the Bhr̥gus, conveying the  oblation.
### 11
– Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow,  succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.
There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let  this your favor be for us.

6 (240) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
From its beginning, this hymn signals Agni’s dual roles as priest and ritual fire and  as fire on earth and fire among the gods. The first verse contains a sustained śleṣa,  a word, or in this case a gapped word, with a double sense. The gapped feminine  noun is probably the juhū́, the sacrificial ladle with which the butter offerings are  poured in the fire. But she can also be the tongue of the poet—not so incidentally,  another meaning of the word juhū́—or even the speech of the poets. If one of the  two latter, then dakṣiṇāvā́ṭ can mean not or not only “conveying to the right” but  also, as Geldner suggests, “conveying the priestly gift” (dakṣiṇā) to the Hotar Agni.  Similarly, in verse 2, the draft-horses are primarily the flames of Agni, but they can  also be the priests of the sacrifices.
From verse 3 the poet launches into his principal theme: the position of Agni  himself as the intermediary between gods and humans, himself a kind of divine  śleṣa, who is simultaneously a Hotar for humans and a Hotar for the gods. The  references to Heaven and Earth (vss. 3, 4) or to the “two world-halves” (vss. 5,  10) point toward his role as intermediary between earth and heaven. Similarly, in  verse 7 Agni appears as both the heavenly fire, the sun, and as the earthly fire of  the sacrifice. Reflecting his double manifestation, the first line of this verse could  mean that Agni shines either as the earthly fire “to heaven” or as the sun “from  heaven.” 1. O praise-poets, twisting around in your mind, lead forth the one [=the  sacrificial ladle] who is turned toward the gods, as you serve the gods; conveying (offerings) toward the right, the prizewinning mare goes to  the east, bringing the offering to Agni, (she who is) rich in ghee.
### 2
You filled the two world-halves as you were born, and now you, o you  who seek the first offerings, have surpassed
even the heaven and the earth by your greatness, o Agni. Let your
draft-horses with their seven tongues twist around.
### 3
Heaven and Earth and the (gods) worthy of the sacrifice set you down  as the Hotar for the house,
when the clans of the sons of Manu, serving the gods and bearing
pleasing oblations, summon your gleaming flame.
### 4
Taking pleasure, the great one is set down here in his enduring abode  between Heaven and Earth, the two great ones,
who are united cowives, unaging and indestructible, the two
nectar-yielding milk-cows of the wide-ranging (Agni).
### 5
Great are the commandments of you who are great, o Agni. Through  your will you extend throughout the two world-halves.
You became the messenger as you were born. You are the leader of the  different peoples, o bull.
### 6
Or place your own two long-maned (horses) of truth, sorrels bathed in  ghee, on the yoke-pole with the harness ropes.
Then convey all the gods here, o god. Perform good rites, Jātavedas.
### 7
Your shining rays shine here even to heaven; you become radiant along  with the many far-radiant dawns,
when, o Agni, the gods marvel at your busy burning at will among the  wood, (the burning) by the delightful Hotar.
### 8
Whether (they be) the gods who rejoice in the broad midspace or those  who are in the luminous realm of heaven,
or those who are helpers, easily invoked and belonging to the
sacrifice—their chariot horses guided themselves here, o Agni—
### 9
With these, o Agni, journey here near to us on the same chariot, or on a  different chariot, for your horses are wide-ranging.
Convey here the three and thirty gods along with their wives, in
accordance with your own will; make then rejoice!.
### 10
He is the Hotar, whose every sacrifice even the two broad world-halves  welcome in order to make it strong.
Turned eastward like two rites stand the two well-supported
(world-halves), the two truth-possessing (parents) of truth-begotten  (Agni), the two real ones.
### 11
– Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow,  succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.
There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let  this your favor be for us.

7 (241) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Geldner describes this as a deliberately obscure morning hymn. The poet creates  this obscurity by rarely directly identifying the objects concerned, but rather refer ring to them through metaphors, especially of mares and bulls. One reason the poet  chooses this approach may be because he is simultaneously describing and thus  interconnecting three realities relevant to the morning ritual: the priests and their  activity, the appearance of the sacrificial fire and thus of the god Agni, and the ris ing of the sun, which is another form of Agni.
Neither space nor certainty allows us to unpack all of the poet’s metaphors,  but the following brief discussion of a few can illustrate the complexity and pos sibilities of the poet’s imagery. Geldner suggests that the seven voices in verse 1  may be the seven rivers (as in III.1.6), but they might also be the voices of the  seven priests of the soma rite. Agni’s “mother and father” might be Earth and  Heaven—especially since his parents are probably Heaven and Earth in pāda  c. But they could also be the two fire-churning sticks, the aráṇis, in which case  mātárā might better be “the two mothers.” If the mātárā are both Earth and  Heaven and the churning sticks, then the poet may be deliberately exploiting the  paradox that Agni, the ritual fire, is the child of the churning sticks, and Agni,  perhaps as the sun, is the child of Heaven and Earth. In verse 2 Sāyaṇa among  others reasonably understands the mares to be the waters, but we suggest that  they might be, or again also be, Agni’s flames or rays of the sun. If we follow  these latter interpretations, then the “single cow” might be the sun, although this  identification is doubtful since the sun is not otherwise a cow or even female. The  choice of such an image for the sun, if it is such, might have been motivated by  the image of the flames as mares and milk-cows. Alternatively, Geldner thinks  the single cow is probably the sacrificial ladle, which is certainly possible. The  “seers,” who are the likely subject in verse 5 and who appear again in verse 7,  may be the saptarṣayaḥ “seven seers,” the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and  in both verses they may also be the seven priests of the soma rite. As Kiehnle  (1979:  83)  has observed, it is because they may be stars in verse 7 that vípra “inspired” can also have the more literal sense of “quivering,” that is, “twin kling.” Also in verse 7 the young bulls may be the flames of Agni (so Oldenberg)  or possibly the flames of the rising sun (Kiehnle).
### 1
Those (flames) that have gone forth from the wellspring of white-backed  (Agni) have entered his mother and father and the seven voices.
The encircling father and mother [=Heaven and Earth] travel in tandem;  the two stretch far and wide to display their long lifetime. 2. The mares [=the flames?] of the bull, the ruler of heaven [=the sun], are  milk-cows; he took his place upon these goddesses, who convey that  filled with honey.
The single cow travels her course around you, who dwell peacefully in  the seat of truth.
### 3
He mounted upon them that become easy to guide as their watchful  lord and as the wealth-finder of wealth.
The blue-backed (Agni), whose faces are manyfold, made them dwell  apart from the wellspring of the brushwood.
### 4
Nourishing the unaging son of Tvaṣṭar greatly, the carriers [=fingers of  the priests?] carry him [=the newborn fire], who stands fast.
Flaring out with his limbs in his abode, he entered the two world-halves  as if they were one woman.
### 5
They [=the seers?] know the benevolence of the flame-red bull, and they  find joy in the command of the copper-colored one—
they, the shining ones, shining from heaven and brightly shining, to  whose flock belong the milk-libation and the great song.
### 6
And by their knowledge, following his sound, they led their thunderous  (sound) to his father and mother, the great (parents) of great (Agni), when at night the young bull grew strong all around his (fire)place
along the domain of a singer.
### 7
With the five Adhvaryus, the seven inspired ones protect the dear  hidden track of the bird.
Turned forward, the young, unaging bulls [=flames?] become
exhilarated, for gods follow the commandments of the gods.
### 8
I direct the two foremost divine Hotars downward. The seven (priests),  giving strength, become exhilarated by their own will.
Reciting the truth, they speak just the truth, reflecting upon their
commandments as the protectors of commandments.
### 9
The many (mares) [=flames?] act like bulls for the great steed [=Agni  or the sun]; their reins [=rays of light] are easy to guide for the
shimmering bull.
O god and Hotar, as the most delighting and watchful, convey the great  gods and the two world-halves here to this place.
### 10
O Wealth—the dawns, owning the fortifying first offerings, receiving the  beautiful words, bearing lovely beacons, have dawned richly.
And now, o Agni, by the greatness of earth, for the sake of our great  (fortune), be favorable even to the (ritual) fault we have committed.

8 (242) Sacrificial Post(s)
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 3, 7
Though this hymn is found in the middle of the Agni collection, it is dedicated  to the Sacrificial Post (yūpa), to which the animal to be sacrificed is tied. It is not  entirely clear why it has been inserted here, though as an eleven-verse hymn con sisting mostly of triṣṭubhs it comes at the end of the triṣṭubh hymns to Agni and is  preceded by two likewise eleven-verse hymns.
The structure of the hymn has been illuminatingly discussed by Theodore Proferes  (2003b), who shows that not only does it fall into two separate parts devoted to the  single post (1–5) and multiple posts (6–10) respectively, as is already indicated by the  Anukramaṇī, but that the two halves are entirely parallel in phraseology and struc
ture. Originally there were probably two hymns, each appropriate to a different ritual  situation (one sacrificial animal versus several). They were put together and a final  benedictory verse was added (11), and then it was inserted into the Agni cycle.
The ritual action depicted in both parts is the erecting, anointing, and wrapping  of the posts; there is no mention of the sacrificial animal.
### 1
Those seeking the gods anoint you at the ceremony, o Lord of the Forest,  with heavenly honey.
When you will stand erect, after that establish material goods here—or  when you will dwell peacefully in the lap of this mother [=Earth].
### 2
Being propped in front of the kindled (fire), gaining the unaging
formulation that provides good heroes,
thrusting heedlessness to a distance from us, rise up for great good
fortune.
### 3
Rise up, Lord of the Forest, upon the height of the earth.
Being founded with a good founding, establish luster for the one whose  vehicle is the sacrifice.
### 4
As a youth, richly dressed, engirded, he has come here. He becomes more  splendid as he is being born.
Him do the insightful, very attentive poets lead upward, seeking the gods  with their mind.
### 5
Once born, he is born (again) on the brightest day of days, growing  strong at the encounter, at the rite.
The insightful, industrious ones purify (him) with inspired thought.  Beseeching the gods, the poet raises his voice.
### 6
Those of you whom the god-seeking men have fixed down, or, Lord of  the Forest, whom the axe has fashioned,
let those god(like) sacrificial posts, standing there, be disposed to place a  treasure consisting of offspring in us. 7. Those who, hewn, are on the earth, or have been fixed down in it, or  over whom the offering ladles have been outstretched,
let them pursue a thing of value for us among the gods, assuring
success to the cultivated lands.
### 8
The Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus of good guidance, Heaven and Earth, the  Broad One, the Midspace—
let the gods in concert help our sacrifice. Let them make the beacon of  the ceremony erect.
### 9
Like geese, taking their places in a row, wearing gleaming (garments)  the posts have come here to us.
Being led upward by the poets in front, the gods go into the fold of  the gods.
### 10
Just like the horns of horned beasts they appear—the posts, with their  knobs, (standing) on the earth.
Or listening attentively at the competing invocation by the cantors, let  (the gods) help us at the battle drives.
### 11
Lord of the Forest, grow forth with a hundred branches—with a  thousand branches may we grow forth—
you whom this axe here, on being sharpened, has led forth for great  good fortune.

9 (243) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The setting of the poem is the kindling of Agni in the very early morning (cf. vs. 7).  Thematically, the poet parallels the gods’ search for Agni and the human priests’  kindling of fire. The fire has disappeared into the waters or into the wood, which  has absorbed the waters. Therefore, it is in the waters that the “watchful and unde
ceiving ones,” either priests or gods, have found him. The double reference is par ticularly well expressed in verse 5. The first part of the verse alludes to the myth  of Agni’s flight from the gods and to the myth of Mātariśvan, who brings the fire  from heaven. But the final phrase devébhyo mathitám pári, here translated “stolen  from among the gods,” could also mean “churned from among the gods.” That is,  it likely refers to the priestly act of creating fire by friction as well as to the story of  Mātariśvan’s bringing fire.
### 1
As your companions, we mortals have chosen you, a god, to help— you, the Child of the Waters, sharing good fortune, shining brightly,  strongly advancing, faultless.

### 2
Since desiring the trees, you went to your mothers, the waters,
therefore your return is not to be ignored, o Agni, since, though being  far away, you have come to be here.
### 3
You have grown beyond the acrid (smoke), and so now you are
benevolent.
The ones [=priests or flames] go farther and farther forth; the
others [=other priests or flames] remain around—those in whose
companionship you rest.
### 4
Him who had gone beyond failures, beyond the ever-parched places— him did the watchful and undeceiving ones find resting in the waters like  a lion.
### 5
Agni, hidden thus, as if he had run away on his own—
him did Mātariśvan lead here from the far distance, stolen from among  the gods.
### 6
You are he whom mortals seized, o you who convey oblations to
the gods,
since you, son of Manu, guard all sacrifices according to your resolve,  youngest one.
### 7
This is auspicious—your wondrous skill appears good even to a
simple man—
that the herd sits together around you, o Agni, when you are kindled at  night’s boundary.
### 8
Pour an offering to him who makes the rite good, sharp (Agni) of  pure flame.
Obediently serve the swift messenger, the quick, the ancient one to be  summoned, the god.
### 9
Three hundred and three thousand, thirty and nine gods served Agni. They sprinkled him with ghee and they strewed ritual grass for him.  Then they seated him as their Hotar.

10 (244) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: uṣṇih
The hymn is in praise of Agni as he is kindled and installed as the Hotar in the rite.  Because the Hotar recites the hymns in the ritual and because this hymn emphasizes  Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet also connects ritual speech and Agni, in particular,  the speech that addresses him and that he can appreciate and inspire as the Hotar.  Again in accordance with Agni’s role as Hotar, the poet emphasizes Agni’s skill as  a priest and his ability to rectify any failures in the rite. In verse 7, which mentions  such failures, ví rājasi means both “shine in every direction” and “rule in every  direction.” Both, of course, would fit the context. Oldenberg suggests that this hymn (as well as the next two) may be organized  into tr̥cas. The extractions of triplets from these hymns in ritual performance and in  the Sāmaveda also speak in favor of tr̥cas, although not all tr̥cas in the later tradi tion correspond to tr̥cas in the original hymns. So, for example, as Oldenberg points  out, III.11.5, 7, 6 form a tr̥ca in the Sāmaveda, but they have a different order and  cross a tr̥ca boundary in the R̥gveda.
### 1
You, o Agni, the sovereign king over the peoples,
you a god do mortals of inspired thought kindle in the rite.
### 2
You do they summon as priest at the sacrifices and as Hotar, o Agni. Shine as the herdsman of truth in your own house.
### 3
He who will ritually serve you, o Jātavedas, with the kindling wood, he, o Agni, receives an abundance of heroes, and he prospers.
### 4
The beacon of the rites, Agni will come with the gods,
being anointed by the seven Hotars for the sake of him who brings the  offering.
### 5
Bring forward the first lofty speech for the Hotar, for Agni,
as if for a ritual master who brings the lights of inspirations.
### 6
Let our songs strengthen Agni—those from which he is born, worthy to  be hymned,
as the one lovely to see, for the great prize and for great wealth.
### 7
O Agni, as the best sacrificer in the rite, sacrifice to the gods for him  seeking the gods.
As the delighting Hotar, you rule in every direction beyond failures.
### 8
O pure one, shine upon us a brilliant abundance of heroes.
Be very near to the praise singers for their well-being.
### 9
Admiring, inspired poets, being awake, kindle you,
the conveyor of oblations, immortal and strength-increasing.

11 (245) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: gāyatrī
The theme of the hymn is Agni as the intermediary between gods and mortals. So  in verse 2, for example, he is a fire-priest like a human, but as a god he is immortal;  he is the messenger placed on earth with mortals for the delight of the gods. The  image of Agni as a chariot in verse 5 is unusual and striking, and because it is so  and because it is located in the hymn’s central verse, it dominates the hymn. It finds  echoes in the descriptions of Agni as the “conveyor” (vss. 2, 4), as “overpowering  all attacks” (vs. 6), and as piled high with “well-placed” ritual offerings and hymns  for the gods (vs. 8)—these are the likely “things” of Agni mentioned in the verse— and with “desirable things” for mortals (vs. 9). The image of the chariot is also484 III.12
reflected in the description of the sacrificer journeying to both “pleasing offerings”  and Agni’s “dwelling place” (vs. 7). Indeed, the vā́has, the sacrificer’s “vehicle” in  verse 7, is probably none other than Agni himself, who is described by the cognates  havya-váh and váhni.
### 1
Agni is the Hotar of the rite, who is placed to the fore, who is without  boundaries:
he knows the sacrifice in its proper order.
### 2
The conveyor of oblations, the immortal fire-priest, and the messenger  placed for delight,
Agni through insight assembles (the sacrifice).
### 3
Agni—through insight he becomes visible as the ancient beacon of the  sacrifice,
for his is a surpassing goal.
### 4
Agni, the son of strength famed of old, Jātavedas—
him the gods made their conveyor (of oblations).
### 5
The undeceivable leader of the clans of the sons of Manu is Agni, who is the swift chariot, ever new.
### 6
Who overpowers all attacks as the indestructible resolve of the gods, Agni is the best of those of mighty fame.
### 7
A ritually dedicated mortal attains through his vehicle the pleasing  offerings
and the dwelling place (of Agni), whose flames are pure.
### 8
Through our thoughts we would fully attain all the well-placed things  of Agni;
we inspired poets (would attain those) of Jātavedas.

O Agni, we shall gain all desirable things among the prizes of victory. In you the gods have placed them.

12 (246) Indra and Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina.
9 verses: gāyatrī
The poet invites Indra and Agni to drink the soma at the morning soma offering.  The two gods are not only invoked together, but the poet  also ascribes the acts  distinctive of each god to both. After invoking them in the 2nd person in the first  two verses, in the third verse he refers to them in the 3rd person and then, espe
cially in verses 4 and 6, tells of the great deeds that belong to both of them. In  verse 4 they are both “smashers of obstacles,” for while Indra is the “smasher of  obstacles” or “smasher of Vr̥tra,” Agni also burns his way through obstacles (e.g.,  VI.16.34). Indra is the god who famously breaks the fortifications of the Dāsas, but  in verse 6 Agni also destroys enemies’ fortifications, as in III.15.4. In verse 8 “cross
ing the waters” belongs to the two of them as well. As Geldner remarks, this last is probably a reference to a victorious march across rivers that is led by the sacrifice,  represented by Agni, and by warriors, represented by Indra.
### 1
Indra and Agni! Come to the pressed soma, to the cloud worthy to be  chosen, through our songs.
Urged on by our insight, drink of this.
### 2
Indra and Agni! The sacrifice of the singer goes (to you two) jointly,  being worthy of your attention.
By this (insight), drink this pressed soma.
### 3
I choose Indra and Agni, the two who appear as sage poets with the spur  of our sacrifice.
So let those two satisfy themselves here with the soma.
### 4
I invoke the streaming smashers of obstacles, ever-conquering, never  conquered
Indra and Agni, best winners of victory’s prize.
### 5
The singers with their recitations, knowing the (poetic) devices, chant  forth to you two.
Indra and Agni, I choose your refreshments.
### 6
Indra and Agni! You shook the ninety fortifications, lorded over by Dāsas, at one time with a single act.
### 7
Indra and Agni! From our (ritual) work our insights go forth toward (you) along the paths of truth.
### 8
Indra and Agni! Mighty are your abodes and your pleasing offerings. The crossing of the waters has been ordained for you two.

R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra
7 verses: anuṣṭubh
This is the first hymn of this collection attributed not to Viśvāmitra, but to his son,  R̥ṣabha. Its theme is Agni as the god who inspires the recitations of the priests. As  such, Agni possesses the truth that the hymns express (vs. 2), and he himself is both  an inspired poet (vs. 3) and the Hotar priest (vs. 5). As he is kindled, he becomes  increasingly bright and the hymn connects his visible brilliance with the brilliance  of mind he inspires (vss. 5–6) and finally even the brilliance of the gift he wins for  the sacrificers (vs. 7).
### 1
Chant forth for you all the loftiest (chant) to him, the god Agni.
He will come to us with the gods, and as the best sacrificer he will sit  here upon the ritual grass.

### 2
He possessing the truth, whose skill the two world-halves and (the gods’)  help follow—
him do those bringing offerings summon, him do those striving to win  (summon) for help.
### 3
As inspired poet, he is the controller of these (bringing offerings); he is  (the controller) of sacrifices. Because he is so,
befriend for yourselves Agni, who gives and gains bounty.
### 4
Let Agni extend to us shelters that best bring luck in order (for us) to  pursue (the gods)—
(shelters) from where he will shower here the goods in heaven and in the  waters for the sake of our settlements.
### 5
The shining one who has none before him, Agni, together with his good  insights,
do the verse-reciters kindle as their Hotar and as the clanlord of the clans. 6. And you will help us in our sacred formulation and in our recitations as  the best of those that invoke the gods.
Growing strong through the Maruts, flame up as our good luck, Agni,  since you best win thousands (of cattle).

And now give us the good that brings thousands, that brings offspring,  that brings prosperity,
and that brings a brilliant abundance of heroes, o Agni, that is highest  and never diminished.

14 (248) Agni
R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn describes and praises Agni as the master of the sacrifice. The first verse  announces this theme, describing Agni as the Hotar and the “real sacrificer and best of  sages.” In the first verse the poet also mentions Agni’s “chariot of lightning” by which  he speeds to the sacrifice, and he then returns to the image of the chariot in the last  verse. In that final verse, however, the “chariot” is, as often, the sacrifice itself. The last  verse, therefore, takes the role of Agni as priest and the description of Agni as having a  “chariot of lightning” in verse 1 and combines them in the image of chariot as sacrifice.
### 1
The delighting Hotar has taken his stand upon the ritual divisions: as the  real sacrificer and best of sages, he is the master of the rite.
Agni, the son of strength, with chariot of lightning and hair of flame,  has rested his countenance upon the earth.
### 2
It has been offered to you—take pleasure in (this) recitation of homage— to you, who perceive it, o you who possess truth and strength.
As one who knows, convey here the knowing (gods). Sit down in the middle  upon the ritual grass to help us, o you who are worthy of the sacrifice. 3. Let dawn and night, racing to the prize, run to you, o Agni, here along  the paths of the wind.
When (the priests) anoint him as the first with their (butter-)offerings,  those two stand in the house as if upon a chariot-box.

O Agni, possessor of strength, to you Mitra and Varuṇa and all the  Maruts chant of your favor,
so that you will stand upright with your flame, o son of strength,
spreading out the settlements, a sun (spreading out) men.
### 5
Since today we have given you your desire, having reverently approached  with hands outstretched,
sacrifice to the gods by means of your most sacrificially skillful mind,  being our inspired priest with faultless thought, o Agni.
### 6
Since from you, son of strength, a god’s many forms of help go outward,  and outward (also go) the prizes of victory,
give us real wealth consisting of thousands through your undeceiving  speech, Agni.
### 7
For you, o Skill with a poet’s purpose, are these things that we mortals, o  god, have done in the rite.
Be aware of everyone whose chariot [=sacrifice] is good. Sweeten
everything here, immortal Agni.

Utkīla Kātya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This and the next hymn are attributed to Utkīla Kātya, the grandson of Viśvāmitra.  The hymn describes the morning fire, who is the protector and guide of the sacri ficers. Some of the language in the hymn is evocative of Indra, although Indra is  never mentioned. A  possible oblique reference to Indra, however, might help us  understand verse 4, the central and most puzzling verse in the hymn. There Agni is  invoked as an “invincible bull” who conquers fortresses, a description that strongly  evokes Indra, since it is Indra (or twice Soma acting as Indra) who is áṣāḷha “invin cible,” and it is Indra who characteristically breaks open fortresses. This overlay of  the image of Indra onto Agni may explain some of the complications in the second  half of the verse. In cd Agni is surely the “leader of the sacrifice,” but then who is  the pāyú, the “protector” whom he also leads? If he is the leader of the sacrifice,  Agni himself should be its protector as well. For this reason Oldenberg suggested  emending the text so that “protector” is a subject parallel to “leader.” But if we  accept the text as transmitted and translate “leader of its protector” rather than  “leader and protector,” could Agni lead Agni? Possibly he could, if the first Agni  were the priest Agni and the second were Agni as the embodiment of Indra, as sug
gested in the first half of the verse. Or the poet may also be punning on pāyú, which

means “protector” here as elsewhere (cf. VII.37.8), but which formally and sec ondarily—though only secondarily—could be derived from √pā “drink” and mean  “drinker,” a natural description of soma-drinking Indra. In short, the appearance  of Agni could be or could mark the appearance of Indra.
### 1
Ever-blazing everywhere with your broad countenance, press against  hostilities, demons, and afflictions.
I would be under the shelter of the lofty one who gives good shelter,  under the guidance of easily invoked Agni.
### 2
You at the breaking of this dawn, you at the rising of the sun—become  our herdsman!
Take pleasure in my praise song as (you would) in your own birth, as in  your own lineage, o Agni, well born in your own body.
### 3
You, drawing the gaze of men—(be radiant) through many (dawns), o  bull. Flame-red, o Agni—be radiant amid dark (nights).
O good (Agni), lead us and take us across narrow straits. Make us, your  fire-priests, to have wealth, youngest one.
### 4
Shine, Agni, as the invincible bull having conquered all the fortresses and  their good possessions,
and as the leader of the sacrifice and of its foremost, lofty protector, o  Jātavedas of good guidance.
### 5
Your shelters are many and unbreakable, o singer [=Agni?]. As one very  wise, shining up to the gods,
like a winning chariot convey (us) to victory’s prize. Agni, (convey) us to  the well-supported world-halves.
### 6
O bull, swell and quicken for us victory’s prizes and the milk-yielding  world-halves, o Agni,
since you are aflame with good flame, o god with the gods. Let not a  mortal’s evil intent hem us in.
### 7
– Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow,  succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.
There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let this  your favor be for us.

Utkīla Kātya
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
The hymn consists of pragātha distichs of one br̥hatī verse and one satobr̥hatī verse. The metrics thus organize the verses into three pairs. Structurally, however,  the poet also emphasizes the unity of the hymn through ring composition: verse 1  refers to Agni as the master of saúbhaga “good fortune” and of rayí “wealth,” and  verse 6 to him as subhága “bearer of good fortune” and the agent of “wealth.” Once again, as in the preceding hymn, the description of Agni evokes Indra, espe cially in verse 1, which refers to Agni as the “master of the smashing of obsta cles,” and in verse 2, in which the poet calls on the troops of Indra, the Maruts,  to follow Agni.
### 1
This Agni is master of heroes in abundance and of great good  fortune.
He is master of wealth consisting in good descendants and cattle. He is  master of the smashing of obstacles.
### 2
Follow this one, you superior men, you Maruts, to strengthen him, in  whom are riches that grow strong with kindness,
that overcome those of evil intent in battles, and that every day swindle  his rival.
### 3
Sharpen us for a share of wealth with an abundance of heroes,
o generous Agni,
o you of mighty brilliance—(wealth) reaching the highest, bringing  offspring, free from affliction, and bursting forth.
### 4
Who creates and overwhelms all living beings, who creates friendship  here among the gods,
he takes his place here among the gods, here amid an abundance of  heroes, and here in the praise of men.
### 5
Agni, do not subject us to lack of thought nor to lack of heroes,
nor to lack of cattle, o son of strength, nor to scorn. Put hostilities away  from here.
### 6
Show a mastery over victory’s prize that brings offspring, o bearer of  good fortune, and that is lofty in the rite, o Agni.
Join us with greater wealth that is delight and brings glory, o you of  powerful brilliance.

Kata Vaiśvāmitra
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn invokes the present sacrificial fire, the present Agni, as the reappear ance of the ancient Hotar who performed the sacrifice. The hymn emphasizes  the centrality of Agni in the sacrifice by insistently using different derivatives of  √yaj “sacrifice” in four of its five verses: verse 1 has suyajñáḥ, yajáthāya; verse  2, ā́yajaḥ, yakṣi, yajñám; verse 3, yakṣi, yájamānāya; and verse 5, yájīyān, yajā.  Strikingly, verse 4 has no derivative of √yaj, but rather is the direct proclamation  of Agni’s becoming the intermediary between gods and mortals and the source  of life for both.

Verse 1 contains a pun, since aktúbhiḥ can mean both “with unguents” and “through  the nights.” Verse 3 is also complicated because the key word, ājā́nī, is a R̥gvedic hapax.  It could mean “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be genitive singular, which could yield either  “your three births belong to Dawn” or, less likely, “three are the births of Dawn.” Or  ājā́nī could mean “birth-giver” or “birth” and uṣásaḥ could be nominative plural, giv
ing “the three dawns are your births or birth-givers.” As Geldner points out, in favor  of “three dawns” is the fact that three dawns also appear in VIII.41.3. In none of the  possibilities is the interpretation of the half-verse transparent. In the last verse, how ever, there is a direct reference to the Agni of the past and the Agni of the present, so  perhaps verse 3 refers to Agnis of the past, present, and future.
### 1
Being kindled according to his first foundations, he who fulfills all wishes  is anointed with unguents—
he, the flame-haired, ghee-cloaked, purifying Agni, who makes the
sacrifice good—in order to sacrifice to the gods.
### 2
Just as you performed the sacrificial role of the Hotar of the Earth, o  Agni, and just as you observantly (performed that) of the Heaven,
Jātavedas,
so sacrifice to the gods with this offering. Like Manu, carry out this
sacrifice today.
### 3
Three lifetimes are yours, Jātavedas, and three dawns are your births,  o Agni.
By these (births) win the help of the gods by sacrifice as the knowing  one, and then become luck and life for the sacrificer.
### 4
Singing to Agni, the one beautifully shining, beautifully appearing, we  revere you who are to be invoked, Jātavedas.
You have the gods made the messenger, the spoked wheel (of flames), the  conveyor of oblations, and the navel of immortality.
### 5
The Hotar, the better sacrificer before you, o Agni, who once again will  take his seat and (be) the one who is good luck by his own will,
according to his foundations, carry forth the sacrifice, o you who are  observant, and set the rite in place for us in pursuit of the gods.

Kata Vaiśvāmitra
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This is a hymn in praise of the fire as it gains strength. The first two verses look  forward to the fire’s blaze, which should be directed against the enemies of the  sacrificers. The third and middle verse turns to the ritual acts that cause the fire to  increase—adding fuel to it, offering melted butter into it, and even pouring praise upon it. The last two verses then again describe the blazing fire, but this time the  increasing blaze is not turned against enemies but rather represents and effects the  increasing strength and wealth of the sacrificers.
### 1
Become benevolent toward us, Agni, at our reverent approach, bringing  success (to us), like a companion to his companion, like a father and  mother.
Since the dwelling places of the peoples have many deceptions, burn  against the hostilities turned against us.
### 2
Scorch our near enemies, Agni. Scorch the recitation of the distant,  ungenerous one.
And scorch the invisible ones as you become more visible, good (Agni).  Let your unaging, irrepressible (flames) spread out.
### 3
With kindling wood and ghee, o Agni, seeking, I pour an oblation for  endurance and strength.
Insofar as I am master by my ritual formulation, offering praise (by it),  (I pour) this divine insight in order to win hundreds.
### 4
(Flame) up with your flame, son of strength, when you are praised. Set  rising vigor upon those toiling;
(set) rich (vigor) upon the Viśvāmitras, o Agni, for their luck and life. We  have groomed your body many times.
### 5
Create wealth, o you who are good at winning the stakes—when kindled,  you become just that, o Agni;
(create) rich (vigor) in the house of the praise singer of good fortune.  You have acquired glossy forearms and wondrous forms.

Gāthin Kauśika
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This is the first of a small collection of hymns, III.19–22, attributed to Gāthin,  the son of Kuśika. According to the Sarvānukramaṇī, Gāthin was the father of  Viśvāmitra, although in III.33.5 Viśvāmitra calls himself a son of Kuśika.
In general, the hymn is similar to IV.6. See especially verse 2, which has many  of the same themes and much of the same vocabulary as IV.6.3. Its most obvi ous structural feature is the ring defined by 1a and 5a. One difference between  the two lines, however, is that the poet chooses Agni in verse 1, but the gods  anoint Agni in verse 5.  This change echoes the shifts throughout the hymn  between the priests and Agni. In verse 2ab first “I” perform a ritual offering to  Agni, and then in cd Agni performs a ritual act. Verse 3 begins as if it is still  describing Agni, especially if the gapped verb is sám √śri “provide” from 2d, but

by the end of the first line the subject needs to be read as the priest. In 3b the  action of both Agni and the priest is characterized as “striving.” In verse 4 the  people performing the ritual are “eager to sacrifice,” but it is Agni who “will  sacrifice.” This shifting between humans and the god Agni signifies the closing  gap between humans and the gods.
The hymn also contains two problematic ellipses. As mentioned above, 3a gaps  the verb, and although we have supplied “provide,” this is not the only possibility.  In verse 2 because of another ellipsis there is some ambiguity about the ritual act  that the “I” performs. By the end of the hemistich the reference to the sacrificial  ladle, the juhū́, is fairly clear, but initially what is sent to Agni could be vā́c “speech”  or suṣṭutí “good praise” (vs. 3) or the like, accompanied by offerings (e.g., X.188.2  prá...iyarmi suṣṭutím).
### 1
I choose Agni as the Hotar at the ritual meal—him, the clever poet,  knowing all, never fooled.
As the better sacrificer, he will sacrifice for us at the divine assembly. For  wealth and victory’s prize, he will win reward.
### 2
I send forth to you here, o Agni, (the ladle) filled with offerings,
beautifully bright, full of gifts, and covered with ghee.
Making respectful circumambulation before the divine assembly, being  chosen (as Hotar), he has provided the sacrifice with gifts and with
good (gods).
### 3
He (provides it) with very sharp thought when helped by you, and so  strive for good descendants for him who strives.
Agni, may we and our good praises be in an excess of wealth filled with  the best of men, (an excess) of the good.
### 4
Since the peoples eager to sacrifice have established in you [=the fire] the  many faces of (you) the god, Agni,
convey here the assembly of the gods, o youngest one, when you will  sacrifice to the multitude of gods today.
### 5
When the gods will anoint you as the Hotar at the ritual meal, seating  you for the sacrifice,
become our helper here, Agni. Set fame upon our persons.

20 (254) Agni and the All Gods
Gāthin Kauśika
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins by naming deities of the morning, although in the last verse the  poet brings all the gods into his invocation. As in the previous hymn, the poet  employs ring composition, a point that the Anukramaṇī underscores by assigning  the address in both the first verse and the last verse not to Agni but to the All Gods. Also once again, the poet varies the first and last verses. Every verse except the last  one begins with “Agni.” But in that last verse Dadhikrā is transposed in front of  Agni. It is difficult to see if the poet has a purpose in mind other than marking the  last verse through this shift.
However, fronting Dadhikrā, who is a deified horse, does underscore a return  to the equine imagery that opens the hymn. In verse 1 the poet not only mentions  the horse Dadhikrā and the two horsemen, the Aśvins, but he also calls the recit ing priest a váhni, a chariot-driver, whose horses may be his recitations, as Geldner  suggests. Then verse 2 refers to Agni’s vā́jinā, here translated “victorious charges.”  The meaning of the word is not certain, but it is in any case derived from vājín “racehorse” or “prizewinning horse.” Overt references to horses and racing then  subside until the last verse.
### 1
Agni, Dawn, the two Aśvins, Dadhikrā—with his recitations the  chariot-driver calls upon them at daybreak.
Let the gods of good light, bellowing all together toward the rite,
hear us.
### 2
Agni, three are your victorious charges, three your abodes. Three are  your tongues [=flames], o you who are born of truth, (and these three  are) many,
and three are your bodies [=the three sacrificial fires], won by the gods.  Never lapsing, protect our songs with these.
### 3
Agni, numerous are the names of you, the immortal one, o Jātavedas, o  god of independent will,
and, o you who propel everything, (yours are) the many wiles of the wily  (gods), which they have assembled in you, o you about whose kinship  people ask.
### 4
Agni is the leader of the heavenly settlements like Bhaga—he, the god  who drinks according to [/protects] the ritual sequence, who possesses  the truth.
The smasher of Vr̥tra from of old, having every possession, will take the  singer across all difficulties.
### 5
Dadhikrā, Agni, and the goddess Dawn; Br̥haspati and the god Savitar; the Aśvins, Mitra and Varuṇa, and Bhaga; the Vasus, Rudras, and
Ādityas—I call upon them here.

Gāthin Kauśika
5 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 4; anuṣṭubh 2–3; satobr̥hatī 5
Oldenberg judges this to be not so much a hymn as a collection of verses composed  in various meters. In his earlier translation of the Agni hymns, however, he does494 III.22
note that at least the last two verses “seem to form a distich of an irregular pragātha  type.” On the other hand, Geldner observes that TB III 6.7 includes the whole of  the hymn in the animal sacrifice among the stokīyā verses that accompany the drip ping fat from the vapā, the omentum, while it is being roasted, and Elizarenkova  (1995: 116) further proposes that the different meters of the verses reflect the irregu lar rhythm of the drops as they fall. Whether it originated as a verse collection or it  constitutes a unified composition, the hymn does center on the dripping fat of an  animal sacrifice. The hymn mentions médas “fat” in every verse but one, and even  puns on médas in verse 4 by referring to Agni as médhira “wise.”
### 1
Place this our sacrifice among the immortals. Take pleasure in these  oblations, Jātavedas.
Eat of the drops of fat and of ghee, o Agni, our Hotar, taking your seat  as the first.

Filled with ghee, drops of fat drip for you, o pure one.

As the best seer you are kindled. Become the helper of our sacrifice.

capable Agni.
Proclaimed by poets, you have come with your lofty radiance. Take
pleasure in the oblations, wise one.

22 (256) Purıs̄ya Agnis ̣
Gāthin Kauśika
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 4
Like the surrounding hymns, the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Gāthin,  although, as Geldner notes, TS V.2.3.3 names Viśvāmitra as the poet. Verse 5  is the frequent final verse in the Viśvāmitra hymns (cf. III.1.23, 5.11, 6.11, 7.11,  15.7, 23.5).
Both the Black and White Yajurvedic traditions employ the hymn in the  Agnicayana rite (TS IV.2.4.2, VS XII.47–50) at the consecration and laying of the  bricks of the fire altar. Geldner suggests that this application of the hymn may have  resulted from a misunderstanding of the phrase puriṣyā̀so agnáyaḥ in verse 4, here translated “the fires from their overflowing source,” but traditionally interpreted  in the context of the Agnicayana to mean “the fires of the mud” (cf. ŚB VI.3.2.9  pr̥thivyā́ḥ sadhásthād agníṃ purīṣyàm...ā́bhara “From the dwelling place of the  earth, bring the Agni Purīṣya”).
Hoffmann (1975: 50) cites verse 3 of this hymn as one of the few clear instances  of a heavenly ocean, and he is quite likely right. In verses 2–4, however, the image of  an ocean of waters is overlaid with that of an ocean of light. In verse 2 Agni’s luster  is “glittering, undulating radiance watching men,” a likely reference to the sun or  the brightness of the sky more generally. The “undulating sea” to which Agni goes  in verse 3, therefore, might not be a sea of waters, or rather, not only a sea of water,  but also a sea of light. In verse 4 both the fires and the waters cascade downward.  The fires could be in the waters, but they might also be light, which, like rain, pours  down from heaven.
### 1
Here is Agni, in whom the bellowing Indra has received the pressed soma  in his belly.
As (we praise) a steed, a team-horse, (that has won) the prize of a
thousand, you are praised, Jātavedas, since you are victorious.
### 2
O Agni, worthy to receive the sacrifice, your luster, which is in heaven  and on earth, which is here among the plants and the waters,
and by which you have stretched throughout the wide midspace—that is  glittering, undulating radiance watching men.
### 3
O Agni, you go there to the undulating sea of heaven—there you have  spoken to the gods, who are the holy ones—
to the waters, which, in the realm of light, are beyond the sun, and which  draw nearby beneath.
### 4
Let the fires from their overflowing source, along with the falling  torrents—
(all of them) great refreshments free of deception and free of disease— take pleasure in the sacrifice.
### 5
– Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow,  succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly.
There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let this  your favor be for us.

Devaśravas Bhārata and Devavāta Bhārata
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except satobr̥hatī 3
The Agni of this hymn is probably the tribal fire of the Bhāratas (Proferes 2007: 37),  which forms the ritual center of the Bhārata clans. This Agni governs the peoples (vs.

3)—likely the peoples of the tribe, as Proferes suggests—from a location, “earth’s most  desirable place” (vs. 4), among the three rivers. Various theories have been offered for  the identity of Devaśravas, who is addressed in verse 3, and Devavāta, to whom the  Agni of the Bhāratas belong. Surely Devavāta is or was the king of the Bhāratas, since  his is the Bhārata fire. Devaśravas could be a priest or poet, or he could have been a  Bhārata leader, perhaps an ally or successor of Devavāta. In any case, along with the  Agni of the Bhāratas himself, they are the focus of the hymn since they are named in  the central verse and this central verse is marked by a change in meter.
### 1
Churned out and well placed in his dwelling, the young poet, the leader  of the rite,
the unaging Agni amid the aging wood—Jātavedas has received
immortality here.
### 2
The two Bhāratas, Devaśravas and Devavāta, have richly churned the  very skillful Agni.
Agni, look upon (every one) separately with lofty wealth. Then become  the leader of our refreshments day after day.

Ten fingers have given birth to him, the ancient one, the dear one born  well among his mothers.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1
This is a brief, almost staccato hymn. Every verse begins with an invocation to  Agni, and most verses follow with an imperative, urging Agni to take his place on  the ritual ground and to grant the wishes of the poet and his people. The first three  verses refer either directly or indirectly to the brightening fire, which may find its  counterpart in the swiftness and brevity of the hymn.
### 1
O Agni, overwhelm in battles and cast away evil intents!
Hard to overcome but overcoming hostilities, establish luster for the one  whose vehicle is the sacrifice. 2. O Agni, you are kindled by the ghee-libation—you, the immortal one,  pursuing the gods as Hotar.
Take pleasure in our rite!

25 (259) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: virāj
As in the previous hymn, each verse begins with “Agni,” whom the poet addresses  in the beginning and the final two verses and who is the subject of verses 2 and  3. Actually verse 4 opens with a vā́yav índraś ca construction, which mixes a voca tive and a nominative, and so is a hybrid that may mark a transition between the  nominative of verse 3 and the vocative of verse 5. The hymn is also defined by ring
composition: sūnúḥ (1a) / sūno (5b) // viśvávedāḥ (1b) / jātavedaḥ (5b). The phrase in the last verse “home of the waters” is somewhat puzzling, so much  so that Geldner assumes an ellipsis of nápāt, which would yield a translation “O  Agni, (child) of the waters, you are kindled in the home....” or the like. But there  is little in the hymn itself to suggest such an ellipsis, nor does Sāyaṇa read one here.  Although it is not clear exactly what the “home of the waters” refers to—it might  simply be the firewood—the end of the verse suggests that Agni makes all homes or  abodes great, wherever he is kindled.
### 1
O Agni, you are the watchful son of heaven and of earth by the
continuity (of fires), providing all possessions.
Sacrifice to the gods here one by one, o attentive one.

since, much glittering through our acts of reverence, he is master through  the prizes of victory.

O Agni—you and Indra!—journey here to the sacrifice at the home of  the pious man pressing soma,
o you two gods who never disdain to drink the soma.

### 5
O Agni, you are kindled in the home of the waters, as our own, o son of  strength, o Jātavedas,

26 (260) Agni Vaiśvānara
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: jagatī 1–6, triṣṭubh 7–9, arranged in trcas ̥
The deities and attribution of the hymn are more complicated than indicated above.  The hymn comprises three tr̥cas: the first set of three verses is to Agni Vaiśvānara, the  second to the Maruts, and the third begins with Agni’s self-praise in verse 7 and then  continues with the poet’s description of Agni in verses 8–9. This is one way to regard  the hymn. Geldner offers another, quite plausible analysis. According to him, the first  tr̥ca contains verses to accompany the kindling of Agni. In the second the newly cre
ated Agni is fanned with the help of the Maruts. The third tr̥ca is entirely the speech  of Agni. It begins with the god’s praise of himself and then continues with the god’s  praise of the poet. Bergaigne argues that the Āgnimāruta śastra in the later ritual  consists of three major parts addressed to Vaiśvānara, the Maruts, and Jātavedas and  suggests that this hymn represents an old Āgnimāruta śastra. Oldenberg disagrees  with both Geldner and Bergaigne, holding that the hymn does not possess the kind  of unity that either asserts. In his translation of Agni hymns (1897), he describes the  three tr̥cas as “three independent hymns” because of the placement of the hymn in the  collection; that is, it has more verses than the preceding hymns, while in the normal  arrangement it should have the same number of verses or fewer.
Despite its placement in the collection and the change of meter, we believe that  Geldner and Bergaigne are correct in seeing a coherence to the hymn and find  Bergaigne’s suggestion that this is an early Āgnimāruta śastra an attractive one.
### 1
Having discerned with our mind Vaiśvānara, who conforms to what is  real and finds the sun, we Kuśikas, bringing offerings

The Maruts, with Agni’s splendor and belonging to all communities—we  beg for their powerful and mighty help—
are the noisy sons of Rudra, cloaked in rain, having the will to destroy  like lions but bringing good gifts.
### 6
We beg (the Maruts)—cohort upon cohort, band upon band—with  our good chants for the radiance of Agni and the power of the
Maruts,
with their dappled horses, with their unreceding generosity, the travelers  to the sacrifice, wise at the ritual distributions.
### 7
[Agni:] “I am Agni, Jātavedas by birth. My eye is ghee; the immortal one  [=soma] is in my mouth.
The chant of three parts, which is the measure of space, the
inexhaustible hot milk, and the offering—I am that by name.”
### 8
Since he [=Agni?] purified the chant with three purifying filters,
discovering understanding and light with his heart,
he made for himself the highest treasure by his own will, and then he  surveyed heaven and earth.
### 9
Lead him across—the inexhaustible well-spring of a hundred streams,  the father of words to be said, who understands inspiration,
and the joyful crackling in the lap of his parents—him who speaks what  is real, o you two world-halves.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The hymn comprises five tr̥cas, at least some of which show formal linkages that  connect a tr̥ca to the one following it. This is particularly obvious in the case  of the third (vss. 7–9) and fourth (vss. 10–12) tr̥cas, which are connected to the  fourth and fifth (vss. 13–15) respectively. The last verse of the third tr̥ca (9a,  c) describes Agni as váreṇyaḥ. . . dákṣasya pitáram “(the one) to be chosen, the  father of skill,” a characterization echoed by váreṇyaṃ dákṣasya in 10ab, the first  verse of the fourth tr̥ca. Likewise, the poet “summons” (īḷe) Agni at the end of  verse 12 and then describes him as īḷénya “to be summoned” in verse 13. A ring  formed by havíṣmant “bearing offerings” in the first and penultimate verses pro vides a unity to the whole hymn.

Even though this hymn is closely connected to the ritual, the precise application  of the verses is not clear. Bergaigne thinks that they are sāmidhenī (fire-kindling)  verses to be recited as the fire is kindled, and surely this is true of at least the last  tr̥ca, which repeats the verb sam √idh in each of its verses. Oldenberg agrees that  parts of this hymn are sāmidhenī verses, but suggests that verses 7–9, for example,  describe the agnipraṇayana, the procession of the fire to the uttaravedi in the classi
cal Vedic rite, and that 10–12 refer to the installation of the fire. The agnipraṇayana  and the deposition of the fire are closely conjoined rites.
### 1
Forth to you (go) the heaven-bound prizes, bearing offerings, by the  ghee-filled (ladle).
He [=Agni?] goes to the gods, seeking their favor.
### 2
With my song I summon Agni, recognizing inspired words, bringing  success to the sacrifice,
with his attentive listening and his emplaced (fires).
### 3
Agni, may we be able to guide the prizewinning (horses) of you, a god; may we cross beyond hatreds.
### 4
Being kindled in the rite, the purifying Agni to be summoned,
he with flaming hair—him do we beg.
### 5
Of broad visage, immortal, ghee-cloaked, receiving well-poured oblations, Agni is the oblation-carrier of the sacrifice.
### 6
With their sacrificial spoons held out, bringing the sacrifice with their  insight just so, they eagerly
put Agni here for help.
### 7
As the Hotar, the immortal god goes in front with his craft,
spurring on the ritual distributions.
### 8
The prizewinner is placed among the prizes. He is led forth in the rites as the inspired poet bringing success to the sacrifice.
### 9
Through insight the one to be chosen has been created. He has received  as the embryo of living beings
the father of skill through the continuity (of his fires).
### 10
I have installed you, the one to be chosen, (the father) of skill, o you  who are made with strength by the libation;
(I have installed) you, the bright shining fire-priest, o Agni.
### 11
Agni, guiding (his horses) and crossing the waters—at the harnessing of  the truth, the eager
inspired ones kindle him with the prizes of victory.
### 12
The child of nourishment, shining in the rite up to heaven,
having a poet’s purpose, Agni—him I summon.
### 13
As the one to be summoned, to be revered, visible throughout the  darkness,
the bull Agni is kindled. 14. The bull Agni is kindled, conveying the gods like a horse.
Bearing offerings, they summon him.
### 15
As bulls ourselves, o bull, may we kindle you, the bull,
shining aloft, o Agni.

28 (262) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
6 verses: gāyatrī 1, 2, 6; uṣṇih 3; triṣṭubh 4; jagatī 5
The hymn has three divisions that correspond to the offering of the puroḷāś, the  “sacrificial cake” in the three soma-pressings: verses 1–2 belong to the Morning  Pressing, verse 4 to the Midday Pressing, and verse 5 to the Third Pressing. The  hymn is metrically mixed in an arrangement corresponding to the later tradition  that assigns the gāyatrī meter to the first pressing, the triṣṭubh to the second, and  the jagatī to the third. In part because the hymn is so closely tied to a specific parts  of the liturgy, it likely represents a more advanced stage in the development of the  Vedic ritual than is found in most R̥gvedic hymns. In the classical rite there is an  offering of rice cakes—in the earlier period they were barley cakes—to Indra at  each of the three soma-pressings. After each cake offering, there is an additional  offering to Agni Sviṣṭakr̥t, and, as Oldenberg (1897: 301) points out, Āśvalāyana  Śrauta Sūtra V.4.6 prescribes III.28.1, 4, and 5 for these offerings, according to  the order of the soma-pressings. See also III.52, which also concerns the sacrificial  cakes offered to Indra offered in the three pressings.
The remaining two verses (3 and 6) cannot be so readily connected with the three  daily pressings. Verse 3 is not in any of the meters associated with the pressings, but  rather in the rare uṣṇih meter. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, but it is at the end of the hymn,  not at the beginning where we would have expected the “morning” verses to appear.  These are also the only two verses in which the description tiróahnya appears. The  term means “aged overnight,” or more literally, “having passed through the day.”  This word describes soma that is offered to the Aśvins in the early morning of the  day following the soma-pressing day. In the classical Atirātra or “overnight” soma  ritual, an offering of a puroḷāś accompanies this soma offering to the Aśvins, and  these offerings of soma and puroḷāś may also be followed by a sviṣṭakr̥t offering of  puroḷāś to Agni. These two verses thus likely refer to one or another of these final  offerings of an Atirātra rite. Indeed, according to ĀśvŚS V.6.25, verse 6 is the yājyā or “offering” verse of the sviṣṭakr̥t rite for exactly this final offering.
If the term tiróahnya helps locate the ritual context of verses 3 and 6, it also  poses an interpretive problem. Geldner and Renou both understand tiróahnya as an adjective describing the puroḷāś-cake. However, it is unlikely to be literally  true that the cake is “aged overnight.” Rather, as is the case in the classical rite, it  would have been prepared on the morning it was offered. Recognizing this problem,

Elizarenkova understood tiróahnya to mean the soma “aged overnight,” in accord  with the consistent usage of the term elsewhere. But soma is not mentioned in the  hymn, and neither verse gives any indication that tiróahnya describes something  other than the puroḷāś. Therefore, we think that tiróahnya describes the puroḷāś
but is not intended to describe it literally. Rather, it associates the puroḷāś with the  accompanying offering of the soma “aged overnight.”
In the classical Atirātra, the Āśvinaśastra, the recitation that accompanies  the final soma offering to the Aśvins, follows the form of Prātaranuvāka, the  early-morning litany, which opens the soma-pressing day (cf. Staal 1983 I: 683). The  two recitations thus create a ritual ring, in which the end recapitulates the begin
ning. In this hymn verse 3, although connected with the end of the rite, is located  immediately after the verses that mark the rite’s beginning, and thus it becomes an  icon of the conjunction of the beginning and end of the rite. This is reflected in its  meter as well. Like gāyatrī, the meter associated with the morning rite, the uṣṇih  meter of verse 3 consists of three pādas, but its final pāda has twelve syllables like  jagatī, the meter associated with the end of the rite. The metrical form thus com
bines the morning and evening liturgies. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, which again brings the  hymn metrically back to the beginning of the rite, although the verse is placed at  the end. For a more detailed discussion of this hymn, see Brereton (forthcoming b).
Another incongruous description appears in verse 5, which characterizes the rite  (adhvará) as “bearing treasure” (rátnavant) and “wakeful” (jā́gr̥vi). Especially the  latter is an adjective that often describes Agni (e.g., I.31.9, III.2.12) and Soma (e.g.,  IX.36.2, 44.3, 71.1). Here it is an epithet transferred from the sacrificial fire or from  the priests who have drunk the soma to the rite, which both Agni and the priests  wakefully maintain through the night. See also III.39.1, 2, in which the “thought”  of the poet is “wakeful.”
### 1
O Agni, enjoy our offering, our sacrificial cake, o Jātavedas,
at the Early Morning Pressing, o you who are rich through insight.
### 2
The sacrificial cake has been cooked, o Agni, or rather, perfected for you. Enjoy it, o youngest one.
### 3
O Agni, seek after the offered sacrificial cake “aged overnight.”
You are the son of strength, installed in the rite.
### 4
At the Midday Pressing, o poet Jātavedas, enjoy the sacrificial cake here. O Agni, the wise do not diminish the portion that belongs to you, the  youthful one, at the ritual distributions.
### 5
O Agni, since at the Third Pressing you will take pleasure in the
sacrificial cake offered you, o son of strength,
then (establish) the rite among the gods, amid their admiration; establish  it, bearing treasure and wakeful, among the immortals.
### 6
O Agni Jātavedas, becoming strong, enjoy the offering, the
sacrificial cake,
“aged overnight.”

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
16 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 10, 12; jagatī 6, 11, 14–15
This hymn was composed to accompany the creation of a new fire for the sacrifice.  This fire was created through friction using a fire drill that consisted of two pieces of  wood. The upper fire-churning stick was held vertically, with one end in a recessed  area in the lower piece of wood, which was horizontal. Wood chips were placed  around the recessed area on the lower plank. The upper stick was then rotated back  and forth, like a churn. In the later ritual this is done by wrapping a rope around the  upper stick and pulling on one side and then the other to make the stick rotate back  and forth. Eventually, enough heat was generated so that the wood chips caught fire.
This process of churning out the fire was regularly identified in the R̥gvedic  hymns with sexual intercourse, and this repeated image presents the upper  fire-churning stick as the father, with phallic overtones especially in verse 1, and the  lower fire-churning stick as the mother of fire. Another theme that runs throughout  the hymn, and again a common one in Agni hymns, is the idea that Agni is born as  a priest of the sacrifice, who carries the oblations (vss. 4, 7) and offers the sacrifice  (vs. 8) and who is a sage poet (vss. 5, 12) and a Hotar (vss. 8, 16) in the company of  the seven Hotars (vs. 14), the seven priests of the rite. The priests kindling Agni are  named in verse 15: they are the Kuśikas, whose knowledge and ability to formulate  the truth about Agni the hymn accentuates.
### 1
Here is the base for fire-churning; here is the readied begetting tool  [=upper fire-churning stick].
Bring here the clanlord’s lady [=lower fire-churning stick]. Let us churn  Agni in the ancient way.
### 2
As Jātavedas, who is placed within the two fire-churning sticks, like an  unborn child well placed within women with child,
Agni is to be summoned day after day by those awake, by the sons of  Manu bearing offerings.
### 3
Attentive, bear down upon her who is opened up [=the lower
fire-churning stick]. Impregnated on this day, she has given birth to  the bull.
With flame-red crests—his countenance is glowing—the son of the
libation has been born within the ritual pattern.
### 4
In the footprint of the libation and upon the navel of the earth, we would install you to convey our oblation, o Agni Jātavedas.
### 5
O men, churn out the unduplicitous poet, the discerning and immortal  one of beautiful face.
Beget the beacon of the sacrifice, the foremost one in front—Agni, the  very benevolent, o men.504 III.29
### 6
When they churn him with their arms, he shines out, like a prizewinning  horse, flame-red here in the wood.
Unstoppable, like the shimmering (chariot) of the Aśvins on its course  [=the sun?], he avoids the stones, burning the grasses.
### 7
As soon as he is born, Agni shines, becoming ever more visible—he,  the prizewinning horse, the inspired one praised by poets, the one  bringing good gifts,
whom the gods have established at the rites—the one to be summoned,  knowing all things, conveying oblations.
### 8
Sit attentive, Hotar, in your own broad place; make the sacrifice sit in  the womb of the well-performed (sacrifice).
Pursuing the gods, you will sacrifice to the gods with the offering. Agni,  place lofty vigor in the sacrificer.
### 9
Companions, create the smoky bull and without faltering go toward  victory’s prize.
Here is Agni, overwhelming in battles and rich in good heroes, by  whom the gods overwhelmed the Dasyus.
### 10
Here is your womb at its season, from which you shone at birth. Recognizing it, Agni, take your seat here, and then make our songs  strong.
### 11
He is called Tanūnapāt as the embryo belonging to the lord [=the upper  churning stick?]. He becomes Narāśaṃsa when he is born,
and Mātariśvan when he has assumed his measure in his mother. He  became the rush of the wind in leaping forth.
### 12
The poet is churned out by skillful churning and installed with skillful  installation.
O Agni, perform good rites. Sacrifice to the gods for him seeking  the gods.
### 13
Mortals have begotten the immortal one, who is no miscarriage,  overwhelming, hard-jawed.
Joined together, ten unwed sisters [=fingers] embrace the male just born. 14. From of old, bringing the seven Hotars, he has shone forth in the lap of  his mother when he blazed upon her udder.
Day after day, greatly delighting, he does not blink after he has been  born from the belly of the lord.
### 15
Fighting their enemies like the advance troops of Maruts, those  first-born of the formulation [=the Kuśikas] know everything.
The Kuśikas raised a formulation filled with brilliance. One by one,  each in his house, they kindled Agni.
### 16
Since we chose you here today while the sacrifice was proceeding, o  attentive Hotar—
you have steadfastly journeyed and you have steadfastly labored—as  the knowing one recognizing this, journey here to the soma.

30 (264) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
22 verses: triṣṭubh
This long hymn follows a familiar path. It begins with three verses expressing the  sacrificers’ hopes that Indra will appear at their sacrifice and their worries about his  continuing absence. There follow a number of verses (4–14) describing the powers  and deeds of Indra, past and present, including the defeats of Vr̥tra (8) and Vala  (10). This section ends with two verses (12–13) on the sun and dawn, showing that  Indra orders the cosmos both spatially and temporally. The riddling verse 14, with  the well-known paradox of the “cooked” milk contained within a “raw” cow, ends  this section of the hymn by seeming to identify the dawn as cow with other images  of plenty for which Indra is responsible; it picks up the cow imagery already found  in verse 10 concerning the release of the cows from the Vala cave. Moreover, since  sacrificial gifts are distributed at the dawn ritual, the mention of dawn sets the stage  for the requests for gifts at the end of the hymn.
The next part of the hymn (15–17) begins abruptly with an address to Indra  and a command to him:  he is exhorted to come to the aid of the poet and his  allies against enemies in violent battle. The final section (18–21) continues the direct  requests to Indra, but here for material goods to be distributed peaceably at the sac
rifice. The final verse (before the refrain) applies the model of the Vala victory to the  present, beseeching Indra to continue to break open cowpens and distribute cows. As often, the concerns of the whole hymn are subtly foreshadowed in the first  verse, which both establishes the sacrificers as beset by hostile forces and their sac rifice as a site for beneficial exchange with the god.
The hymn is characterized by a number of hapaxes and by affective morphology,  especially in the sections devoted to Indra’s opponents; the translations of some of  these words are provisional.
### 1
They desire you, your comrades in soma; they press the soma; they set  out pleasurable offerings.
They endure the taunting of the people, for, Indra, there is no sign
from you.
### 2
Even the farthest dusky realms are not at a distance for you. But drive  here with your two fallow bays, bay-horsed one.
It is for (you), the sturdy bull, that these pressings here were made and  the pressing stones yoked when the fire was being kindled.
### 3
Indra of good lips, bounteous, overwhelming, having a great troop,  powerfully ranging, mettlesome—
that which you, powerful one, established among mortals, even when  hard-pressed, where are these manly powers of yours now, bull?
### 4
For you, stirring the unstirrable, alone range about smashing obstacle  after obstacle.

It is following your commandment that heaven and earth and the  mountains stand like (pillars) implanted.
### 5
And, o you who are much invoked with acclamations, in fearlessness  you alone talked tough, since you are the obstacle-smasher.
Even these two world-halves without limits—when you grabbed them  together, bounteous Indra, it was just a handful for you.
### 6
(Come) forth along an easy slope with your two fallow bays; let your  mace come forth, pulverizing the rivals.
Smash those facing you, those following, those turned away. Make all  this come true; let it be accomplished.
### 7
To whatever mortal you have provided sustenance, he takes a portion of  the household goods, even what is not yet apportioned.
Auspicious is your benevolence and covered with ghee, much-invoked  Indra; your generosity provides a thousand gifts.
### 8
The one dwelling together with (his mother) Dānu, the handless vermin  did you utterly crush, much-invoked Indra.
With your powerful (mace), Indra, you smashed at the sneering footless  Vr̥tra, who was growing strong.
### 9
You set down in its seat the whole, great, limitless, vital earth, Indra. The bull propped up heaven and the midspace. Let the waters flow here,  propelled by you.
### 10
Vala, the enclosure of cattle, unquiet and fearful, opened up (even)  before being struck, o Indra.
He [=Indra] made the paths easy to travel, to drive out the cows. The  choir (of Aṅgirases) aided the much-invoked one, blowing (on their  instruments).
### 11
The one—Indra—filled the two—earth and heaven—the joint  repositories of goods.
And from the midspace, at their join [i.e., of heaven and earth], as  charioteer of refreshment (bring) us prizes in yoke together, o
champion.
### 12
The Sun does not confound the directions as they are directed, as they  are day after day propelled forth by him of the fallow bays.
When he has fully reached (the end) of the road, only after that does he  perform his unyoking of the horses. But that is his (way).
### 13
They desire to see, at the coming of Dawn from night, the great  glittering face of her who shines forth [=Dawn].
They all know when she has come with her greatness. Many are the  well-done deeds of Indra.
### 14
Great light was deposited in her udder. Herself raw, the cow roams  about carrying the cooked (milk).
Every sweetness was brought together in the ruddy one, when Indra  established her for nourishment. 15. Indra, stand fast! The (enemies’) “journey-buckets” [=chariots]  have come. Do your best for the sacrifice, for the singer, for your
comrades.
The mortals who use dirty tricks, those of evil ways, the cheaters
wearing quivers are to be smashed.
### 16
All around your battle-cry is heard by the closest foes. Smash your most  scorching missile down on them.
Cleave them below; break them apart; overwhelm them. Smash the
demonic force, bounteous one; make them subject to you.
### 17
Tear out the demonic power, root and all, Indra; cleave its middle;  shatter its top.
How far have you sent it scooting? Hurl your scorching lance at the  hater of the sacred formulation.
### 18
It is for our well-being and with your prize-seeking (horses), o leader,  that you will sit down to many great refreshments.
Might we be winners of lofty wealth. Let your portion, conferring
offspring, be in us, Indra.
### 19
Bring hither to us a brilliant portion, Indra. Might we deposit it amid  the surplus of your giving.
As if in the (sea-)basin, desire spreads out in us. Fulfill it, goods-lord  of goods.
### 20
Invigorate this desire with cows, with horses, with recompense in gold,  and you will (further) spread it out.
Seeking the sun, the inspired poets, the Kuśikas, have made with their  thoughts a (ritual) conveyance for you, for Indra.
### 21
Keep breaking open the cowpens for us, (break out) the cows, lord of  cows; let winnings and victory-prizes together come to us.
You are the ruler of heaven, you bull, whose blusterings are real. For us,  bounteous one, become a giver of cows.
### 22
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

31 (265) Indra
Kuśika Aiṣīrathi or Viśvāmitra Gāthina
22 verses: triṣṭubh
This dense and often puzzling hymn has given rise to much discussion. The heart  of the hymn (vss. 4–11 and passim throughout the rest of the hymn) provides one

of the fullest accounts in the R̥gveda of the Vala myth and especially of Indra and  the Aṅgirases as they besiege the Vala cave and seek to free the cows within by  means of song and ritual activity. Since the cows of the Vala myth are often used as  symbols of the dawns, the hymn also celebrates the coming of dawn and its ritual  manifestations, including the distribution of priestly gifts (dakṣiṇā), which occurs  at the early-morning ritual.
Perhaps the most striking part of the hymn, however, is found in the first three  verses, which are often taken as depicting the production of the ritual fire as an alle gory of cosmic incest. Although there are certainly hints of an incestuous liaison,  the relationships among the various kinship terms here are not at all clear, and in  our opinion the ritual references to the production of fire so dominate the picture  and distort the underlying sexual configurations that it is a mistake to seek too  literal a mythological reading. The translation of the first two verses, especially, is  provisional. Our identifications of the personae with various ritual elements differ  from those of other scholars (who also differ among themselves), but in our opinion  the ritual reference here is not to the initial production of ritual fire, but rather the  transformation, through removal to the east, of the undifferentiated ritual fire into  the new offering fire, an action well known from the later ritual literature, where  the new fire with its eastern hearth is called the Āhavanīya and the older one in the  west the Gārhapatya. If this particular ritual procedure was an innovation in the  R̥gveda or pre-R̥gveda, as we suspect, a mystical and riddling presentation of it like  this would not be surprising.
The connection between this opening description of the birth of Agni and the  following treatment of the Vala myth may not be superficially obvious, but it is the  theme of dawn that unites them: fire is kindled at dawn, and the release of the Vala  cows is regularly likened to the breaking of dawn.
It is notable that neither Indra nor the Aṅgirases are named for most of the recital  of the Vala myth, though they are referred to constantly. Indeed the plural Aṅgirases  is not found in the mythic section, only the singular (vs. 7) referring to Indra. Indra  is named, but not until verse 11, the exact center of the hymn (minus the refrain,  vs. 22) and the standard locus for mysteries and their solutions. However, various  epithets, associates, and exploits of Indra that uniquely identify him and that are  irrelevant to the Vala myth have foreshadowed this naming: Saramā, Indra’s dog, in  verse 6; his opponent Śuṣṇa in verse 8; and the Vr̥tra-smashing earlier in verse 11.  After the first naming of Indra in verse 11 the hymn broadens its view to include a  range of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, especially the separation of Heaven and Earth  and the smashing of Vr̥tra.
The hymn returns to the ritual here-and-now starting around verse 17, and the  theme of dawn, appropriate both to the fire-kindling verses 1–3 and the extensive  treatment of the Vala myth, prompts the requests for Indra’ liberality to be mani fested in the early-morning dakṣiṇā, with the dispensing of gifts compared to the  outpouring of cows from the opened Vala cave. 1. Instructing the (grand)daughter [=Āhavanīya?] of his daughter
[=Gārhapatya?], the (offering-)conveyor [=Agni] has come—he the
knowing one, ritually serving the visionary power of truth—
to where the father [=priest? Agni?], stretching out straight, has run  toward the outpouring of his daughter [=butter offering?] with
capable mind.
### 2
The son of her body [=Agni?] has not left behind his leavings for her  sister [=Gārhapatya?]. He has made the womb [=Āhavanīya?] a
repository for the winner.
When the mothers [=fingers] begot the (offering-)conveyor, one of the  two good workers [=fire-churning sticks] was the actor, the other was  the one assuring success.
### 3
Agni was begotten, quivering with his tongue [/by the offering-spoon,  trembling], to display the sons [=flames?] of the great ruddy one.
Great was the womb, great the birth of these here, great the growth of  the one with fallow bays [=Indra] through the sacrifices.
### 4
The victorious (clans [=Aṅgirases?]) escorted the contender [=Indra?].  They distinguished the great light from the darkness.
Recognizing him, the dawns rose up in response. He became the lone  lord [/husband] of the cows—Indra.
### 5
The insightful ones bored through to the (cows), though they were in  a stronghold. The seven inspired poets impelled (the cows?) with
advancing mind.
They found the whole path of truth. Himself knowing the way, he
[=Indra] entered among them [=cows] with homage.
### 6
When Saramā found the break in the rock, she made the great ancient  herd directed toward one goal.
Sure-footed, she led the vanguard of the cows [/syllables]. First
recognizing (them), she went to their bellowing.
### 7
The foremost inspired poet [=Indra] came, acting in partnership (with  the Aṅgirases). The rock brought the embryo to sweetness for the
good worker.
The young blood won, doing battle alongside the youths. Then he
became (an) Aṅgiras immediately upon singing.
### 8
The counterweight of every being, standing at the forefront, he knows all  the races; he smashes Śuṣṇa.
Following the track of heaven, seeking cows, chanting, the comrade  released us, his comrades, from calumny.
### 9
With cow-seeking mind, they sat down (to a ritual “Session”) with their  chants, making for themselves a way toward immortality.
Just this was their long Session, by which, for months, they sought to  win (the cows) through truth.

### 10
Surveying (the cows) en masse, they delighted in their own possession,  milking out the milk of the age-old semen.
Their cry heated the two worlds through. Amid (all) that was born they  set the outstanding one [=Indra?]; amid the cows they set heroes. 11. He was Vr̥tra-smasher with (the help of) those who were born (together)  [=Maruts], and he sent the ruddy (cows) surging upward with
oblations and with the chants (of the Aṅgirases)—he is Indra.
She of broad extent, bearing ghee-rich (milk) to him, milked out honey,  sweetness—the thoroughbred cow.
### 12
It was for the father that they performed a ritual Session, for him also  they prepared a seat, because the good workers surveyed the great,  turbulent (cowpen).
Propping apart with a prop the two begetters [=Heaven and Earth],  while sitting (the Session) they fixed upright the dazzling (seat).
### 13
When the great (Earth), the Holy Place, has set him to piercing— him who is grown strong in a single day, spread wide in the two  world-halves,
and in whom the flawless hymns are united—(then) all powers are  conceded to Indra.
### 14
Great is your comradeship—I long for it here, and for your powers.  Numerous teams [=our poetic thoughts] come here to the
Vr̥tra-smasher.
Great is the praise song. We have arrived at the favor of the patron  [=Indra]. For us, liberal one, become a protector of cows.
### 15
Great the dwelling place, abundant the gleaming (goods) that he  found; thereupon he assembled movable (goods [=livestock]) for his  comrades.
Indra along with the men, as shining one, begot at one blow the sun,  the dawn, the way, the fire.
### 16
Also the all-gleaming waters, spread wide, did this master of the house  send surging forth toward a single goal.
Through the days, through the nights, (the priests) impel the runners,  (the streams) of honey [=soma] being purified with poets as their  purifying filters.
### 17
The two black treasure-chambers [=Dawn and Night], deserving the  sacrifice, follow (each other) in succession through the magnanimity  of the Sun,
when your amiable, straight-flying comrades (gather) round about, to  twist your greatness (toward them), Indra.
### 18
Become lord of liberalities, you smasher of Vr̥tra, a bull of songs,  conferring vigor all the life long.
Come here to us with your friendly fellowship, a great one hastening  with great help. 19. Serving him with homage like the Aṅgirases, I make new (their hymn)  born of old, for the older one.
Run over the deceits, manifold and godless, and set us up to win the  sun, bounteous one.
### 20
The far-extended mists have just become clear; carry us across to the  edge of them, to well-being.
O Indra, as charioteer protect us from harm. Quickly, quickly make us  winners of cows.
### 21
The Vr̥tra-smasher, lord of cows, has put his cows on display. He has  come between the black (nights) (and bright days) with the ruddy
manifestations (of the cows [=dawns]).
And allotting the liberalities [=gifts] in accord with truth, he opened up  all the doors that are his own.
### 22
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

32 (266) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
17 verses: triṣṭubh
The ritual application of this hymn is announced in the first verse:  the Midday  Pressing of soma, which in some ritual circles, as here, Indra shares with the Marut  troop, his supporters in the Vr̥tra battle. Throughout the hymn invitations to drink  soma at this rite are interspersed with praises of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, espe
cially the slaying of Vr̥tra. In verses 9–10 Indra’s powers are ascribed to his origi nal drinking of soma immediately after birth, with the implicit suggestion that the  sacrificers’ current offering of soma will revitalize those powers for the sacrificers’  benefit.
For the most part the language of this hymn is straightforward and even a bit  monotonous, and there are a number of technical terms pertaining to the soma  sacrifice (see, e.g., the types of soma in vs. 2). There are, however, several studied  contrastive pairs (e.g., “vulnerable...invulnerable,” vs. 4; “goddesses...godless,” vs.  6; see also vss. 7, 11), as well as a few striking images, such as Indra “wearing the  earth on his other hip” (vs. 11) as an indication of his greatness.
### 1
O Indra, lord of soma, drink this soma here, the Midday Pressing, which  is dear to you.
Snuffling out your two lips, you bounteous possessor of the silvery drink,  having unhitched your two fallow bays, reach exhilaration here.

### 2
Mixed with cows [=milk], stirred (with meal), or pure, o Indra—drink  the soma. We have given it to you for your exhilaration.
Joined in pleasure with the formulation-making flock of Maruts, with  the Rudras, drench yourself (in it), to satiety.
### 3
They who increased your tempestuousness, who increased your power,  the Maruts, hymning your strength, Indra—
at the Midday Pressing, you with mace in hand, drink in a flock with  the Rudras, you of good lips.
### 4
It was they who became inspired at his honeyed (drink), Indra’s troop,  who were the Maruts,
impelled by whom he found the vulnerable place of Vr̥tra, who thought  himself invulnerable.
### 5
As by Manu, o Indra, enjoying the pressing, drink the soma for manly  power ever new.
Let yourself be turned hither by our sacrifices, you of the fallow bays.  Along with the hastening ones, you set to running the flooding
waters,
### 6
When you sent forth the waters, like steeds to run in a contest—having  smashed Vr̥tra,
who was lying still, with your moving weapon of death, o Indra, him  having surrounded the goddesses, godless himself.
### 7
Let us sacrifice to Indra, increased through homage, lofty and towering,  unaging and youthful,
whose greatness the two dear world-halves measured, but did not  measure up to the greatness of him worthy of the sacrifice.
### 8
Many are the well-done deeds of Indra. The All Gods do not violate  the commandments (of him),
who upholds earth and this heaven. Of wondrous power, he begot the  sun and the dawn.
### 9
Undeceptive one, this greatness of yours is truly real: because, just born,  you drank the soma,
not the heavens, Indra, nor the days, nor the months and years could  obstruct the strength of you, the powerful one.
### 10
You, Indra, just born, drank the soma for exhilaration in the highest  distant heaven.
After you had entered heaven and earth, then you became the first to  suckle the bard.
### 11
You smashed the serpent lying around the flood, displaying its  strength—you powerfully born, as more powerful (than he).
Heaven did not come close to your greatness then, when you wore the  earth on the other hip.
### 12
Since the sacrifice has become your strengthener, Indra, and the dear  ritual meal of pressed soma also, aid sacrifice upon sacrifice, being the one who deserves the sacrifice; the  sacrifice aided your mace in the serpent-smashing.
### 13
With the sacrifice as aid I (previously) brought Indra nearby with his  aid. May I turn him hither for newer favor,
him who was strengthened by previous praises, who by midmost ones  and by the present ones.
### 14
She labored when she begot me [=poet]—the Holy Place [=Earth? ritual  ground?]. I shall praise Indra before the decisive day,
so that at that time he (will) carry us across (to the far shore) of
constraint, as if with a boat. Both (sides) call upon him as he travels. 15. His (soma) tub is filled—hail! As a man pours out a bucket, I have  poured (for him) to drink.
And the dear soma drinks have together turned him here with
respectful circumambulation, to exhilarate Indra.
### 16
Not the deep river nor the surrounding peaks could obstruct you,  much-invoked one,
when impelled just so from your comrades, Indra, you broke into the  cattle enclosure though it was firmly fastened.
### 17
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

33 (267) Visvá ̄mitra and the Rivers
Viśvāmitra Gāthina / Rivers
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 13
Although this hymn is found in the Indra collection, the Anukramaṇī identifies  Indra as the dedicand only of verses 6–7, with the remainder divided between the  rivers (Nadyas: 1–3, 5, 9, 11–13) and the poet himself, Viśvāmitra (4, 8, 10). After  two opening verses describing the confluence of the Vipāś and Śutudrī rivers, this  justly famous poem consists of a dialogue between those rivers and Viśvāmitra,  who begs the rivers to stop in their course to allow the Bharata forces, under his  patron, King Sudās (not named here, but see III.53.9), to cross. They accede to his  request in return for his ensuring their future fame in his poetry, and the Bharatas  cross successfully, as is announced in verse 12—after which the rivers are urged  to refill themselves with water and flow again. That it is the poet who succeeds in  temporarily stopping the rivers is yet another example of the power of properly  formulated speech to control the physical world. The final verse (13), in a different  meter, may be a magic spell, exemplifying the continuing belief in the power of the  word by applying this legendary river crossing to a team in trouble at a ford.514 III.33
### 1
Forth from the lap of the mountains, eager, racing with each other like  two mares unloosed,
resplendent, licking each other like mother cows (their calves), the  Vipāś and Śutudrī (rivers) speed with their milk.
### 2
Impelled by Indra as you long to take part in the forward thrust, you  drive like two charioteers to the sea,
clashing together, swelling with your waves, the one of you merges into  the other—you resplendent ones.
### 3
[Viśvāmitra:] I have driven to the most motherly river [=Śutudrī]; we  have come to the broad, well-portioned Vipāś—
the two who are like mothers together licking their calf, proceeding  together along the same womb [=riverbed].
### 4
[Rivers:] So we are—swelling with milk, proceeding along our  god-made womb.
Our forward thrust, launched in a surge, is not to be obstructed.  Seeking what does the poet keep calling upon the rivers?
### 5
[Viśvāmitra:] Stop for my somian speech, truthful ones, for an instant,  in your travels.
My lofty inspired thought (has gone) forth to the river: seeking help,  have I, the son of Kuśika, called upon (you).
### 6
[Rivers:] Indra with the mace in his arms dug us channels: he smashed  away Vr̥tra [/the obstacle] surrounding the rivers.
God Savitar of the lovely hands led (us): at his forward thrust we  journey widely.
### 7
[Viśvāmitra:] This act of heroism is to be proclaimed ever anew, the  deed of Indra when he hewed apart the serpent.
He smashed apart the enclosures with his mace. The waters went  seeking a way to go.
### 8
[Rivers:] This speech, singer—do not forget it—so that later generations  will hear it from you.
Favor us in return in your hymns, bard: don’t put us down among men.  Homage to you.
### 9
[Viśvāmitra:] Listen well to the bard, sisters. He has driven to you from  afar with his wagon and chariot.
Bow down; become easy to cross, staying below his axle(s) with your  currents, you rivers.
### 10
[Rivers:] We will listen to your words, bard. You have driven from afar  with wagon and chariot.
I [=one river] will bow down to you like a young woman swollen (with  milk, to her infant), (while) I [=other river] will bend to you like a  maiden to her cavalier.
### 11
[Viśvāmitra:] When the Bharatas should really have crossed you  entirely—the horde seeking cattle, propelled, sped by Indra— then certainly your forward thrust, launched in a surge, will rush
(again). I wish for the favor of you who deserve the sacrifice.
### 12
[Viśvāmitra:] The cattle-seeking Bharatas have entirely crossed; the poet  has shared in the favor of the rivers.
Swell forth, nurturing, very generous; fill your bellies; drive quickly.
### 13
Let your wave push up the yoke-pins; o waters, let loose the
yoking cords.
Let the two inviolable (oxen), doing no ill, without offense, not come to  naught.

34 (268) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The emphasis in this hymn, as often in Indra hymns, is on Indra’s victories and the  gains he won not only for himself but also for gods and mortals. In several verses  (esp. 3 and 6) Indra’s sheer power, reinforced by his backup troops, is contrasted  with his control of clever tricks and artifice; both types of approach contribute to  his success.
The underlying theme of victory, expressed in a variety of ways earlier in the  hymn, becomes insistent in the numerous repetitions of the verb “win” (√san) in the  last three verses before the refrain (vss. 8–10), which contain eight forms of the verb  (including four forms of the perfect sasā́na in a single verse [9]); the root appears  previously in the hymn only in the root noun compound svar-sán “winning the sun”  in verse 4.
The poets’ role in spurring Indra to victory is mentioned several times at the  beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–2), but is otherwise backgrounded; the poets’ task in  the hymn is more to celebrate and praise (vss. 6, 7, 8) the god than to inspire him. In  fact, it is Indra who grants inspiration to the poets (vs. 5), an action that precedes  and makes possible their praises in verses 6–8.
One curious feature of the hymn is the presence of phraseology and imagery  characteristic of the god Agni in 3cd and of fire-priests in 4ab. The point of contact  is probably to be found in verse 4, where Indra is said to win the sun and make it  shine, and to find the light, since the kindling of the ritual fire at dawn is associated  with and often presented as the cause of the sunrise.
### 1
Indra, stronghold-splitter, overcame the Dāsa with his chants, finding  goods, fragmenting his rivals.
Spurred on by the sacred formulation, grown strong in his body, he of  abundant gifts filled both world-halves.

### 2
I rouse forth speech as a spur for you, the forceful combatant, exerting  myself for the immortal one.
Indra, you travel at the forefront of the peoples stemming from Manu  and of the divine clans.
### 3
Indra obstructed the obstacle [/Vr̥tra] through control of his troop  [=Maruts]; he beguiled (the wiles) of the wily ones through control  of forms.
He smashed the one whose shoulders were spread [=cobra]. Burning at  will in the woods, he brought to light the nourishing streams of the  nights.
### 4
Indra, winning the sun, begetting the days, conquered in the battles  along with the fire-priests, as superiority (itself).
He made shine for Manu the beacon of the days [=sun]; he found the  light for lofty joy.
### 5
Indra “got into” mighty thrusts, manfully assuming his many manly  (powers).
He made these insights perceptible to the singer; he extended this bright  hue of theirs [=insights].
### 6
They admire the great things of him, the great one: many are the  well-done deeds of Indra.
He utterly crushed the bent ones with his band; with his tricks (he  crushed) the Dasyus, (though) he had overwhelming strength.
### 7
Through combat Indra with his greatness created a wide realm for the  gods, he the master of settlements, filling the bordered domains. At the seat of Vivasvant [=ritual ground] these (deeds) of his do the  inspired poets, the sage poets sing with their hymns.
### 8
Him, victorious in every way, worthy to be chosen, granting victorious  might, having won the sun and the divine waters,
him, who won the earth and this heaven—Indra do they celebrate, those  who take joy in his insight.
### 9
He won the steeds and the sun he won; Indra won the cow of many  benefits,
and the benefit of gold he won. Having smashed the Dasyus, he aided  the Ārya hue.
### 10
Indra won the plants, the days; the trees he won, the midspace. He split Vala; he expelled the challengers. Then he became the subduer  of those who set their wills against him.
### 11
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

35 (269) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A simple hymn, entirely devoted to Indra’s journey to the sacrifice and his enjoy ment of it, mostly expressed in the imperative. The progress of the hymn is com pletely chronological, from the yoking of his pair of horses, through the journey,  during which Indra is exhorted to pass by other sacrificers (vs. 5), and finally the  arrival at the ritual ground, properly prepared, and the drinking of the soma. The  mention of the Maruts in verses 7 and 9 suggests that the Midday Pressing, devoted  to Indra and the Maruts jointly at least in Viśvāmitra circles, is the sacrifice in ques tion (see also, for example, III.32). There is also a rather charming concern for the  welfare of Indra’s horses (vss. 3, 7).
In the context of R̥gvedic poetry what is striking are the absent elements. There  is neither praise of the god honored nor any mention of his attributes or heroic  deeds. (The sole exception is 9b, with its unelaborated allusion to the Maruts’ role  in strengthening Indra and the alliance resulting therefrom.) Nor do we hear about  the purpose of Indra’s soma-drinking—rousing him to perform heroic deeds either  in the past or for our benefit now. Nor, despite the many imperatives, does the poet  ask for any gifts or for aid of any sort. It is an extraordinarily focused hymn, and  its apparent simplicity may result not from artlessness, but from careful pruning.
### 1
Mount the pair of fallow bays being yoked to the chariot. Drive, like the  wind, to our teams [=poetic thoughts].
You will drink the stalk when you have surged to us. Indra, hail! We have  given (it) to you for your exhilaration.
### 2
The nimble span, the pair of fallow bays I yoke to the yoke-poles of the  chariot for the much invoked one.
The two will bring Indra right here to this sacrifice assembled from every  side, as if at a run.
### 3
Lead near the two bullish (stallions), protecting them from the scorching  heat, and help them—you autonomous bull.
Let the two horses graze. Unhitch the two sorrels here. Every day eat  roasted grains of the same appearance.
### 4
With a sacred formulation I yoke for you the formulation-yoked pair of  fallow bays, your swift comrades in joint revelry.
O Indra, mounting the sturdy, well-naved chariot, thinking ahead,
knowing, drive up to the soma.
### 5
Let other sacrificers not stop your bullish, straight-backed fallow bays. Drive beyond them, each and every one. We will prepare properly for  you with pressed soma drinks.

### 6
Yours is this soma here. Come here, nearby. Well-disposed, drink of it  each time anew.
At just this sacrifice, having sat down on the ritual grass, put just this  drop into your belly, Indra.
### 7
The ritual grass has been strewn for you, the soma pressed, o Indra.  The roasted grains have been prepared for your fallow bays to eat.
To the bull of many talents who is accustomed to it, to you
accompanied by the Maruts are the oblations given.
### 8
This (soma) have the men, the mountains, and the waters jointly with  the cows made honeyed for you.
Having come here along your own paths, well-disposed, drink of it,
lofty one, thinking ahead, knowing.
### 9
The Maruts to whom you gave a share in soma, who strengthened you  and became your flock—
joined in pleasure with them, eagerly desirous, drink the soma with the  tongue of Agni, Indra.
### 10
Indra, drink of the pressed (soma) just by your own power or take a  drink with the tongue of Agni, o you who deserve the sacrifice.
Either from the hand of the Adhvaryu or from the oblation of the
Hotar enjoy the offered sacrifice, able one.
### 11

Viśvāmitra Gāthina (1–9, 11) and Ghora Āṅgirasa (10)
11 verses: triṣṭubh
In contrast to the pared-down aesthetic of the immediately preceding hymn, this  one, entirely devoted to Indra’s drinking of soma, presents a series of extreme  images and striking turns of phrase. The emphasis is on Indra’s sheer size and capa ciousness when he drinks soma, and liquid images predominate: he is conceived of  both as a vast container for liquid (vs. 4) and as the liquid itself (vss. 6, 8). These  images of Indra’s vastness are deftly used as measures of his capacity to give to his  human worshipers (e.g., vss. 5, 9, 10).
### 1
Set this offering here to be won, being ever newly united with help. At every pressing he is strengthened by strengthenings, he who has
become well famed through great deeds. 2. From olden days the soma drinks are known to Indra, because of which  he, the craftsman, has bullish joints and extensive power.
Grasp at (the drinks) being offered; Indra, drink of the bull, rinsed
by bulls.
### 3
Drink, become strong. Yours are the pressed soma drinks, Indra—the  first ones and these here.
Just as you drank the previous soma drinks, Indra, so take a drink
today, as the one to be admired anew.
### 4
A great ample tankard at the (ritual) enclosure, he is master of powerful  capacity, daring power.
The earth never encompasses him, when the soma drinks have
exhilarated the one with the fallow bays.
### 5
Great, powerful, he is strengthened for the heroic deed. The bull has  been perfected through poetic insight.
Indra is the apportioner. His cows are givers of prizes. His gift-cows  propagate in abundance.
### 6
When the rivers set forth like a shot, their waters went to the sea like  (two) charioteers.
But Indra is wider even than that seat [=sea], when soma, the milked  plant, fills him.
### 7
The rivers, uniting with the sea, are carrying well-pressed soma  to Indra,
(while) those who possess hands [=human priests] milk the plant with  (the tools) they use for carrying [=those same hands]; they purify it
in a stream of honey with purifying filters.
### 8
His cheeks are like lakes holding soma; he entirely encompasses many  pressings.
When Indra devoured the first foods, having smashed Vr̥tra he chose  the soma.
### 9
Bring it here. Let no one contain it. For we know you as the goods-lord  of goods.
Indra, the great giving that is yours—offer it to us, o possessor of the  fallow bays.
### 10
Offer us (a portion) of abundant, all-desirable wealth, o bounteous  Indra of the silvery drink.
Provide a hundred autumns for us to live; (provide) for us ever new
heroes, o Indra of the lips.

37 (271) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 11
This is a good example of a hymn driven almost entirely by rhetoric. The organizing  principle of the hymn is the careful stationing of an accented form of the name indra ́ at the beginning of the third pāda (after the hemistich break) in eight of the first nine  verses. The middle verse of this sequence (vs. 5) instead has indra ́ at the beginning  of the verse, and this slight deviation from pattern marks an unemphatic omphalos.  As often in R̥gvedic hymnic composition, a pattern set through most of the hymn is  both broken and advanced at the end. Verse 10 seems at first to announce the epiph
any of the god, which has been desired throughout the hymn; the name of the god  has been demoted to unaccented second position, after the annunciatory augmented  aorist, the only past tense form in a hymn full of imperatives and presents: “you  have come, Indra.” The poet has tricked us, however: Indra has come not to us but  to fame. The final verse (11) is in a different meter, often a sign of an extra-hymnic  verse, but it also emphatically renews the call for Indra’s epiphany and therefore pro
vides a fitting end to the rest. The name indra ́ opens the final pāda (11d). The “content” of the hymn is relatively conventional and clearly subordinate to  the rhetorical structure, but the light texture and balance of the phrases surround ing the all-important repeated name are quite pleasing.
### 1
For Vr̥tra-smashing capacity and for victory in battle—
Indra—we turn you hither.
### 2
Let the cantors make your mind inclined our way—
Indra of a hundred resolves—and your eye as well.
### 3
We implore your names with all our songs—

We magnify (him) through the hundred embodiments of the

Be victorious when the prize (is set). We implore you,

38 (272) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina or Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
A dense and difficult, but rewarding, hymn. Although the hymn is found in the  midst of the Maṇḍala III Indra hymns and is assigned to Indra by the Anukramaṇī,  the name Indra is not found in the hymn (save in the appended Viśvāmitra refrain),  and indeed it is not at all clear that there are any references to Indra in the hymn.  Not surprisingly the hymn has given rise to much discussion.
Any interpretation of its contents and intent will necessarily be speculative,  and the richness and multivalence of the images should not be reduced to a single  and simple paraphrase. Nonetheless, we will attempt a sketch here. It is regularly  remarked that the hymn is cosmogonic. In fact, it seems to concern two creations: the  Ur-creation of undifferentiated material and the subsequent establishment of indi
vidual name and form. As usual in ancient India, creation is conceived of as an act  of division and individuation, rather than of assemblage. This second, and more  interesting, creation was carried out by the equivalent of poets, and the current poet  of this hymn identifies himself and his activities with the authors of this second  creation and seeks their model for his own poetic work. The large number of neu
ter pronouns of unclear reference throughout the hymn seem to be a grammatical  reflection of the undifferentiated material of the first creation, and the poet seems  almost to be inviting us to participate in the second creation by ourselves assigning  them name and form.
The poem begins with three verses in the poet’s own voice, concerning the older  generations of poets and the poetic tradition. In verse 1 he sounds both tremulous  and self-assured, mindful of the tradition he belongs to but also proud of his own  insight. In the second verse, addressing himself (as so often) in the 2nd person, he  exhorts himself to seek models from the earlier poets, and introduces the notion  that they “crafted heaven for themselves,” a reference to the second creation. The  third verse fleshes out this statement, in describing just how the older poets set  about this creation. Most important is the final pāda, in which they “put apart” the  two worlds—the primal act of separation that makes life possible.
Verse 4 moves abruptly to a new subject, or rather to an older one. A previously  unmentioned figure is introduced obliquely, and though he is explicitly credited

with a “name” in pāda c, it is not at all clear what that name is—possibly Viśvarūpa  “possessing all forms” of pāda d. In verse 5 it appears that this bull is responsible  for the Ur-creation preceding the separation just described. The lack of differentia tion in the Ur-creation may be signaled by the androgyny of its source—“the bull  gave birth.” The same verse also introduces two unnamed kings, “sons/descendants  of heaven.” This epithet in the dual usually refers to the Aśvins, but this identifica tion seems unlikely here. Other suggested pairs are Mitra and Varuṇa (Grassmann,  Geldner) or Indra and Varuṇa (Sāyaṇa, Renou, Oberlies); either pairing is perhaps  possible, but the fact that the poet forebears to name them suggests that a precise  identification may run counter to the poet’s intentions. It might also be noted that  the only identifiable dual entities in the hymn are the two world-halves (vss. 3, 8,  probably 9), and in verse 8 they “set  all in motion.” It therefore seems possible  that in this hymn the “two descendants of heaven” could in fact be the two worlds,  which have dominion over (vs. 5) and tend to (vs. 6) the “(cosmic) division,” both  as products of the primal separation in the second creation and producers of the  further individuation occurring in that second creation: note the increasing num
bers in verse 6ab.
In verse 7a we return to the androgynous Ur-creator, now explicitly identified as  both bull and cow; the rest of the verse introduces the second creation characterized  by “names” and “form.” The creators here are “masters of artifice,” poets perhaps.  Verse 8 essentially repeats verse 7, as is signaled by the identical opening phrase, but  this time it is the current poet himself (who made a brief reappearance in vs. 6cd),  who by his praise hymn is responsible for movement in the world (i.e., the second  creation) contrasted to the static golden emblem (8b) arising from the first creation.  The poet thus implicitly identifies himself with the masters of artifice, the poets, in  verse 7. In the final verse (aside from the refrain) both the unnamed dual pairing,  quite possibly the two worlds, and the masters of artifice return to bear witness to  the creative actions of the poet himself, who through his powerful tongue seems to  control the individuated forms. We have thus returned to the issues raised in verse  1, but with the poet having successfully assumed his vocation and commanded the  respect of his predecessors in the creative act.
### 1
Like a craftsman I ponder my inspiration. Bending like a prizewinning  steed amenable to the chariot-pole,
touching now on my own dear things, now on distant ones, I seek sage  poets to see (these) whole—(though) I (too) have wisdom.

Ask also the powerful generations of the poets: they as good workers,  holding their minds firm, crafted heaven for themselves.
These are the precedents for you, which keep growing stronger.
Sought by mind they have now come (to rest) on its [=mind’s] firm
foundation.
### 3
And, in depositing their own secret (tracks/names) in safety just here,  they ornamented the two world-halves for their dominion. (When) they fully measured (them) with their measures, they held fast  the two broad (worlds). They have put apart the two great ones,
which were fitted together, to give (us) nourishment.
### 4
As he was mounting they all tended to him. Donning beauties, he  roams about with his own light.
Great is that name of the bull, the lord. Possessing all forms
[/Viśvarūpa], he mounted the immortal (things/worlds).
### 5
The earlier older bull gave birth. Here are his many proliferating riches. You two sons of heaven, with your insights you established your
dominion over the (cosmic) division, you kings, from olden days.
### 6
O kings, you two tended to the three, to the many, to all the seats in the  (cosmic) division.
Having come here with my mind, I saw even the wind-haired
Gandharvas under your commandment.
### 7
This [=undifferentiated creation] was just his—(he who is both) bull  (and) milk-cow; (then) with (individual) names they meted out the
“fellowship of the cow” [=the joint creation of bull and milk-cow].
Donning one lordly power after another, the masters of artifice
parceled out (individual) form in it.
### 8
This [=creation] was just his, the impeller’s, (it was) nothing of mine— the golden emblem that he fixed firm.
But it is through (my) good praise hymn that the two world-halves set  everything in motion here. He has swaddled the generations, like a
young woman her children.
### 9
You two assure success to (that creation) of the age-old great one, (the  creation) that is the divine blessing. May you two enfold us.
All masters of artifice look upon the deeds of him whose tongue is a  herdsman, who surmounts the various forms.
### 10
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

39 (273) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins (vss. 1–3) with a charming image of poetic thought as a lovely  young woman, beautifully arrayed, seeking Indra as her husband and giving birth  to twins, who perhaps are two types of ritual speech. The subject changes in verse  4, moving to the mythic past and one of Indra’s great deeds: opening the Vala cave524 III.39
and releasing the cows (of dawn) and by extension the sun (vss. 4–6). The implicit  connection between the verses concerning poetic speech and those treating the Vala  myth is not expressed, but would be well known to the audience: Indra and his help ers the Aṅgirases (here under the names Navagvas and Daśagvas “nine-cowed” and  “ten-cowed”) used the power of properly formulated speech to open the cave. This  is the mythic model for the poet’s use of ritual speech to secure light and safety for  the sacrificer and the sacrifice (vss. 7–8).
### 1
Thought goes toward Indra as her husband, curling herself out of my  heart, crafted as praise,
she who is wakeful when recited at the rite. Indra—what is born for you,  know that.
### 2
Being born of old from heaven itself, wakeful when being recited at the rite, clothing herself in auspicious, silvery garments, this one right here in us  is the ancient-born, ancestral hymnic vision.
### 3
She, as bearer of twins, bore her twins [=R̥c and Sāman?] just here. In  soaring, (she) has mounted the tip of the tongue.
The pair, once born, accompany the wondrous forms (of Agni)—the two,  smashing the darkness, have come here to the base of scorching (Agni). 4. There is no one among mortals who scorns them: our fathers, who were  battlers for cows.
Indra with his great force (emptied out) the fastnesses for them, he with  his wondrous power emptied out the cowpens.
### 5
When the comrade with his comrades the Navagvas, the warriors, from  their crouch followed after the cows—
this is the real truth—Indra with the ten Daśagvas found the sun, which  was dwelling in darkness.
### 6
Indra found the concentrated honey in the ruddy one, found the footed  and the hooved in the “bend of the cow.”
What was placed in hiding, fit to be hidden, hidden in the waters he took  in his right hand—he of right generous gifts.
### 7
He should choose light, distinguishing it from darkness. May we be at a  distance from difficulty in a close encounter.
Indra, you drinker of soma, increased by soma, enjoy these hymns of the  bard, the latest of many.
### 8
Light for the sacrifice should suffuse the two world-halves. May we be at  a distance from abundant difficulty,
for also in abundance are those who grant good passage to the mightily  thrusting mortal, o good ones.
### 9
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,

9 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn hardly deviates from the theme of Indra’s soma-drinking, a  concentration that is reflected in the repetitive elements: the vocative índra (gener ally verse- or pāda-initial) in seven of the nine verses (1–6, 9) and the collocation  “pressed soma” in four verses (1–2, 4–5) and split over another two (6/7). Note also  the conjoined expressions “nearby and afar” (vs. 8) and “afar and nearby” (vs. 9),  together forming a “magic square.”
### 1
Indra! We invoke you as bull when the soma is pressed.
Drink of the honey, of the stalk.
### 2
Indra! Enjoy the pressed soma that finds the will, you much-praised one. Drink it, drench yourself in it—the ever satisfying (soma).
### 3
Indra! Further our sacrifice, with its emplaced (fires?), along with all  the gods,
o you who are praised as clanlord.
### 4
Indra! These pressed soma drinks of yours go forth, o master of  settlements,
to your dwelling place—the glimmering drops.
### 5
Put into your belly the pressed soma worthy to be chosen, Indra.
Yours are the heaven-ruling drops.
### 6
O you longing for songs, drink our pressed (soma). With streams of  honey are you anointed.
Indra! Just by you is glory given.
### 7
The imperishable heavenly effusions of the wooden (vessel) attend  on Indra.
Having drunk of the soma, he is grown strong.
### 8
From nearby come here to us, and from afar, Vr̥tra-smasher.
Enjoy these songs of ours.

If you are invoked between the far and the nearby,
Indra, come here from there.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: gāyatrī
An elementary hymn, focused entirely on the ritual and on Indra’s journey to it and  participation in it. In this it is reminiscent of III.35, though in a different meter, and

like that hymn this one entirely lacks praise of the god, reference to his past deeds,  and prayers for his gifts and aid.
### 1
You, Indra, when you are called to drink our soma,
drive here toward me with your pair of fallow bays, o possessor of the  (pressing) stone.
### 2
Our Hotar was seated at his season; the ritual grass has been strewn in  due order.
The pressing stones were yoked in the early morning.
### 3
Here are the sacred formulations being made, o you whose vehicle is the  formulation. Sit on the ritual grass;
seek after the offering cake, o champion.
### 4
Take pleasure in our pressings, in these praises, o Vr̥tra-smasher,
in hymns, o Indra who longs for songs.
### 5
Thoughts lick the broad, soma-drinking lord of strength,
Indra—like mothers a calf.
### 6
Find exhilaration from the stalk, then, to show great generosity with  your own person.
You will not put your praiser to scorn.
### 7
Offering our oblations, we sing, seeking you, o Indra,
and you are seeking us, you good one.
### 8
Do not unharness at a distance from us; drive nearby, you who are dear  to your fallow bays.
O autonomous Indra, become exhilarated here.
### 9
Let the two hairy(-maned horses) convey you nearby in a well-naved  chariot, Indra,
the two with ghee on their backs—(for you) to sit on the ritual grass.

Another straightforward hymn centered on the soma-drinking, very similar to the  immediately preceding III.41.
### 1
Come up to our pressed soma mixed with milk, Indra,
you who, with your pair of fallow bays, are seeking us.
### 2
Come, Indra, to the exhilarating drink, stationed on the ritual grass,  pressed by stones.
Will you now indeed sate yourself on it?
### 3
To Indra have my songs gone just so, sent from here,
to turn him hither for soma-drinking. 4. Indra we call here for soma-drinking with praises,
with hymns. Will he indeed come hither?
### 5
Indra! Here are the pressed soma-drinks. Put them
into your belly, o you of a hundred resolves, you rich in prizewinners. 6. Because we know you as one winning the stakes, as one daring in  prize-contests, you sage,
therefore we beg for your favor.
### 7
Drink this (soma) of ours mixed with milk and mixed with grain, Indra, having come here to the (soma) pressed by the bullish (stones).
### 8
Just to you, Indra, in my own house, do I impel the soma for drinking. Let it find pleasure in your heart.
### 9
You, Indra, do we call to drink the pressed drink, as of old—
we, the Kuśikas, seeking your favor.

43 (277) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Although this hymn, like the two immediately preceding it (41, 42), focuses on  Indra’s journey to and presence at the soma sacrifice, its texture is richer and its  rhetoric more shapely. (It is also in the longer triṣṭubh meter, rather than the gāyatrī of the previous two.) The first four verses insistently establish the journey motif  with the opening “Here—drive” (ā́... yāhi, vss. 1–3) / “Here ...” (ā́, vs. 4), along  with an abundance of adverbs meaning “here, nearby, up close.” Verse 5 consists  of four rhetorical questions, each introduced by the interrogative particle kuvíd,  implicitly begging Indra’s intervention on the singer’s behalf. The initial “Here ...”  and the journey motif return in verse 6; verse 7, the last before the refrain, invites  Indra, presumably finally arrived, to drink the soma, inserting brief mentions of  two well-known myths, the falcon’s stealing of soma and Indra’s opening of Vala.  As is common in these journey hymns, Indra’s horses have a prominent part in the  hymn (see esp. vs. 6, but also vss. 1–4).
### 1
Here—drive right up nearby, stationed on the chariot seat. Just yours is  the soma-drinking from olden days.
Your two dear comrades—unharness them at the ritual grass. These  oblation-bearers are calling you.
### 2
Here—drive across the many settled domains—here, across the prayers  of the stranger, right up to us, with your two fallow bays,
for these thoughts, crafted as praise, are calling you, Indra, taking
pleasure in your fellowship.

### 3
Here—drive swiftly to our sacrifice, which has grown strong with  reverence, o god Indra, together with your fallow bays,
for I keep calling you with my thoughts, (offering) a delightful dish of  ghee, to the joint revelry of the honey drinks.
### 4
Here—if these bullish fallow bays will convey you, the two well-limbed  comrades amenable to the chariot-pole—
taking pleasure in the pressing accompanied by the roasted grain, will  Indra, as our comrade, hear the tributes of his comrade?
### 5
Will you indeed make me your herdsman of the people; will you indeed  (make me) king, you bounteous possessor of the silvery drink?
Will you indeed (make) me a seer, (for) I have drunk of the pressed
drink; will you indeed do your best for immortal goods for me?
### 6
Here—let the lofty fallow bays, on being yoked, joint revelers, convey  you nearby, Indra,
(the horses) that once again stretch forth the doorposts of heaven, the  well-curried dumb (beasts) of the bull [=Indra].
### 7
Indra, drink of the bullish (soma), rinsed by the bulls [=priests], which  the falcon brought here to you, who wanted it,
in whose exhilaration you rouse the communities, in whose exhilaration  you opened up the cowpens.
### 8
– For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: br̥hatī
The major trick of this short hymn is the extended pun between the words hári “gold-colored” (also used regularly for Indra’s “fallow bay” horses) and harya “enjoy,” a pun exploited elsewhere. (For a far more elaborate example, see X.96.)  For the purposes of this hymn, we have rendered the former as “golden,” even in  reference to the horses, and the latter as “gladden(ing),” in an attempt to sketch the  pun in English. In the last verse the poet slyly turns the golden mace of verse 4 into  silver, a move that would surely have caught the attention of the audience.
### 1
Let this be gladdening to you—the soma pressed here by the golden  (stones).
Rejoicing, Indra, come here to us along with your golden (horses).
Mount the golden chariot. 2. Being glad, you made the dawn beam; being glad, you made the
sun shine.
Knowing, observant, you wax strong over all the beauties, o Indra of the  golden horses.
### 3
Heaven with its golden nourishment, Earth with its golden form  did Indra
hold firm, (and there was) abundant feeding of the two golden ones  [=Heaven and Earth], between which the golden one [=Sun] wanders. 4. Once born, the golden bull radiates through the whole luminous realm. Having golden horses, he takes the golden weapon, the golden mace into  his two arms.
### 5
Indra (uncovered) the silvery mace glad (in its work), decked out with  gleaming (flames?),
uncovered the soma pressed with golden stones; he drove out the cows  with the golden ones.

5 verses: br̥hatī
The hymn begins by inviting Indra to “drive here,” as is familiar from the previous  “journey” hymns in this Indra cycle (e.g., III.41, 42, 43), but it soon turns to a series  of striking and elaborate similes and metaphorical identifications glorifying Indra  and his gifts. The middle verse (3) contains four separate similes and so, as often,  represents the concentrated essence of the hymn.
### 1
Drive here, Indra, with your gladdening fallow bays, whose hair is (like)  peacocks’.
Let no one hold you down, as men using snares do a bird. Go across  them, as if across wasteland.
### 2
Gnawer of Vr̥tra, breaker of Vala, splitter of strongholds, driver of  waters,
mounter of the chariot, caller of the two fallow bays—Indra is the one  who breaks apart even the fastnesses.
### 3
Your resolve, deep like pools—you foster it, like cows.
As milk-cows with a good herdsman reach pasturage, as brooks reach a  lake, (so your resolves) have reached fulfillment.
### 4
Bring here to us thrusting wealth, like a share to the one who
acknowledges it.
As a man with a crook shakes a tree for ripe fruit, o Indra, shake (us)  goods that will get (us) across.

Most of the hymn is devoted to generic praise of Indra, and especially of his immense  proportions (see the nicely balanced rhetoric of the middle verse 3). The last verse and  a half (4cd, 5) turn to the ritual situation, the early-morning soma-pressing for Indra.
### 1
Of you, the fighter, the bull, the sovereign king, the strong youth,  stalwart, ardent,
of the unaging bearer of the mace—great are the manly deeds of you, o  Indra, famous and great.
### 2
You are great, you buffalo, with your bullish powers—winning the spoils,  you strong one, overwhelming the others.
As sole king of all creation, cause the peoples to fight and to dwell in peace. 3. He projects in his dimensions, while shining; he projects on all sides,  unopposable by the gods;
Indra projects with his greatness beyond heaven, beyond earth;
projects beyond the great broad atmosphere—he who possesses the
silvery drink.
### 4
Him—broad, deep, over(whelmingly) strong (even) at birth,
encompassing all, a well of thoughts—
Indra—do the pressed soma drinks enter early in the day, like streams  the sea.

This ritually focused hymn is appropriate to the Midday Pressing, where Indra  drinks soma in company with the Maruts. Both Indra and the Maruts are  named in every verse, and all but the final verse contain an imperative of the verb “drink.” The Maruts’ role in strengthening Indra for his various exploits is  treated in verses 3–4.
### 1
Accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, as a bull drink the soma after your  wont, for joy, for exhilaration.
Pour the wave of honey into your belly. You are the king of the pressed  drinks from olden days.
### 2
In joint enjoyment, Indra, in joint throng with the Maruts, drink the  soma, o champion, as Vr̥tra-smasher and knowing one.
Smash the rivals, push away the despisers. Then make fearlessness for us  on all sides.
### 3
And, seasonable drinker, according to the (right, ritual) seasons take a  drink of the soma pressed by us, o Indra, with the gods [=Maruts] as  your comrades,
the Maruts to whom you gave a share (in the soma), who stood by
you: you smashed Vr̥tra; they established strength for you.
### 4
Those who strengthened you at the serpent-smashing, bounteous one,  who in the fight with Śambara, who at the quest for cattle, o you of  the fallow bays,
who as inspired poets applaud you now—o Indra, drink soma in joint  throng with the Maruts.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: triṣṭubh
In this short hymn (four verses, without the refrain) we are given a tantalizing  glimpse of Indra’s infancy and what appears to be his youthful rivalry with and  outsmarting and overcoming of his father, here as sometimes elsewhere identified  with Tvaṣṭar; in these activities he is seemingly abetted by his mother. In this primal  scene she offers Indra soma just after his birth, and he, having drunk it, defeats his  father and steals the soma. Unfortunately this brief sketch is the fullest and clearest  expression of this mythological background. See also IV.18.
### 1
Immediately on his birth the young bull showed favor to the ritual  offering of the pressed stalk.
Drink—at pleasure, however your (pleasure) is—the first of the somian  sap-mixture that brings success.

### 2
When you were born, on that day in desire for it [=soma] you drank the  mountain-abiding beestings of the plant.
Your mother, the young woman who gave you birth, poured it around  for you in the house of your great father for the first time.
### 3
On approaching his mother, he called for food; he looked upon the sharp  soma as his udder.
Clever, he took care to keep away the others; of manifold countenances,  he performed great things himself.
### 4
Strong, overcoming the powerful, of overwhelming strength—he made  his body as he wished.
Having overwhelmed Tvaṣṭar at his birth, Indra, having stolen the soma,  drank it in the cups.

The first word of this hymn, śáṃsā “I will proclaim” (or possibly 2nd sg. imperative  “proclaim!”), sets the tone for the rest, which consists entirely of descriptive glori fication (save for the refrain). There are no direct requests, though the praise of his  victorious power and of his control of goods implicitly invites the god to exert the  same for the singer and his community.
### 1
I will proclaim great Indra, toward whom all the soma-drinking
communities have directed their desire,
the very resolute one, fashioned for distinction, whom the two Holy Places  [=Heaven and Earth] and the gods begot as the bane of obstacles.
### 2
The most manly sovereign king, mounted on fallow bays, whom now as  before no one overcomes in battles,
who along with his warriors is strongest through our fortifying (hymns).  He in his broad expansion curtailed the lifetime of the Dasyu.
### 3
Victorious in battles like an overtaking steed, traversing the two
world-halves, streaming abundance.
Like Bhaga at the decisive moment, he is to be invoked with thoughts;  like a father, he is dear, easy to invoke, conferring vigor.

As supporter of heaven, of the dusky realm, he is inquired after; erect  like a chariot, he is (like) Vāyu teamed with goods. Illuminator of the nights, generator of the sun, he distributes the share,  like the Holy Place [=ritual ground] the prize.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This brief “journey” hymn signals its application to the Midday Pressing by the  adjective “accompanied by the Maruts” ending the first half-verse; the usual men tion of Indra’s horses in journey hymns is also found. In addition to the refrain (vs.  5), verse 4 is also a repetition, of the near final verse of the first Indra hymn in this  maṇḍala (III.30.20). Since III.50 is the final hymn in the regular sequence of Indra  hymns in III (III.51 is a collection of tr̥cas in various meters; III.52–53 are similarly  various), the double repetition seems to act as a ring-compositional device to mark  the end of the Indra cycle.
### 1
At “Svāhā!” let Indra drink, to whom the soma belongs. On coming here,  bulging, bullish, accompanied by the Maruts,
let him, though (already) of broad extent, become filled with these foods.  Might the oblation bring to fulfillment the desire of his body.
### 2
I yoke for you these two obliging (horses) for speed, whose obedience you  favored from olden days.
Here should the fallow bays deposit you, you of good lips. Drink of this  pleasing well-pressed (soma).
### 3
While being hymned, (the horses? priests?) have established (the soma)  desirous of mixture with cows [=milk], to nourish Indra, the deliverer,  for preeminence.
Becoming invigorated once having drunk the soma, you of the silvery  drink, drive together cows in quantity for us.
### 4
Invigorate this desire with cows, with horses, with recompense in gold,  and you will (further) spread it out.
Seeking the sun, the inspired poets, the Kuśikas, have made with their  thoughts a (ritual) conveyance for you, for Indra.

51 (285) Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
12 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–9, gāyatrī 10–12, arranged in trcas ̥
The hymn falls into four sets of tr̥cas, in three different meters. Since the hymn  follows one of five verses, each tr̥ca should originally have been a single hymn,  to conform to the normal patterns of arrangement within maṇḍalas. However,  even if it did consist originally of four separate hymns, the evidence of larger  ring composition discussed with regard to III.50 makes it likely that III.51 was  an addition to the original Indra collection, which would once have ended with  III.50.
The first two tr̥cas consist of standard tropes of praise for Indra, with an empha sis on the songs and singers that express this praise. There are no strong indications  of unity within the tr̥cas. The third tr̥ca is devoted to Indra’s drinking of soma in  company with the Maruts and is thus appropriate to the Midday Pressing, like  several other Indra hymns in this maṇḍala (III.32, 35, 47, 50). The final tr̥ca is even  more insistently focused on Indra’s soma-drinking.
### 1
The bounteous supporter of the settled domains, worthy of hymns—to  Indra have the lofty songs roared—
the much-invoked one, having grown strong through well-turned
(hymns), immortal, awakening every day.
### 2
The superior man with a hundred resolves, a flood of powers—my songs  approach Indra from all sides—
winning spoils, splitting strongholds, swift at crossing the waters,
attending to the ordinances, attending closely, finding the sun.
### 3
The singer seeks admiration from him who distributes goods: Indra gives  a friendly reception to his faultless rhythms,
for at the seat of Vivasvant [=ritual ground] he finds pleasure. Praise  him, victorious in every way, the smasher of hostility.
### 4
You [=Indra], the most manly of men—you [=singers], recite to the hero  forcefully with songs, with hymns.
Possessing many magical powers, he compacts himself together for
might. Reverence is his. From olden days he alone is lord.
### 5
Many are the tributes to him among mortals; many goods does the  earth bear (for him).
For Indra the heavens, the plants, and the waters guard their wealth,  and the lively (streams) and woods.
### 6
For you the sacred formulations, for you the songs altogether have been  established, o Indra of the fallow bays. Enjoy them!
Become a friend of help right now; o comrade, o good one, establish  vigor for the singers. 7. O Indra along with the Maruts, drink the soma here, as you drank of  the pressed (soma) beside Śāryāta.
With your guidance, in your shelter, o champion, the wise poets of
good sacrifices seek their win.
### 8
Eagerly desirous, here drink the soma pressed by us, o Indra, with the  Maruts as your comrades—
as when all the gods busied themselves around you, just born, for great  plunder, o much-invoked one.
### 9
At the crossing of the waters, o Maruts, he is a friend. They, who give  favors, have applauded Indra.
Together with them let the Vr̥tra-gnawer drink the pressed soma in the  very seat of the pious worshiper.
### 10
Because this pressed (drink) is right here at hand with its strength, o  lord of benefits,
drink of it, o you who long for song.
### 11
Which(ever soma drink) will suit your nature, halt yourself at that pressing. Let it exhilarate you, who deserve the soma.

8 verses: gāyatrī 1–4; triṣṭubh 5, 7–8; jagatī 6
This hymn is also an addition to the Indra collection. Entirely parallel to III.28 (a  hymn to Agni), it concerns the offering of a sacrificial cake at each pressing of the  soma sacrifice, with each pressing characterized by a different meter. The Morning  Pressing is the subject of verses 1–4; the Midday Pressing (amply represented in  other hymns of this cycle: see the introduction to III.51) merits only one verse (5),  and the Third Pressing is likewise mentioned only once (vs. 6). The remaining two  verses appear to have a more general application.
### 1
(The soma) accompanied by roasted grain, by gruel, by cakes,
by hymns—
Indra, enjoy (this soma) of ours early in the morning.
### 2
The cooked offering cake—enjoy it, Indra, and welcome it.
To you do the oblations flow.
### 3
Our offering cake you shall eat, and you shall take pleasure in
our songs,
as a bride-seeking man does a maiden.

At the Third Pressing, our roasted grains, our offering cake bepoured  (with ghee)—grant them to yourself, much-praised one.

We made gruel for you who are accompanied by Pūṣan, roasted grains  for you of the fallow bay horses, accompanied by your fallow bays.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 10, 16; anuṣṭubh 12, 20, 22; gāyatrī 13; br̥hatī 18
This sprawling hymn, a supplement to the Indra collection, consists of at least  six different sections in five different meters. There is little or no connection  among the parts, which were probably originally independent. However, the  whole seems intended to glorify the poet Viśvāmitra and his family, the Kuśikas,  as well as his patron, King Sudās, and the Bharatas. Moreover, several of the  different parts have clear reminiscences of other hymns in the Indra cycle of this  maṇḍala, and so the hymn serves as a sort of summary of the themes of this  Indra collection.
The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–6) is the most conventional part, with its  invitation to Indra to come to our ritual with gifts and to drink the soma. The most  interesting feature is the mention of the pleasures of wife and home (vss. 4–6) and  the envoi to Indra in verse 6, urging him to go home after consuming the soma  at our sacrifice. (See also I.82.5–6.) This dismissal seems appropriate to the final  hymn of the Indra collection and may in part account for this little hymn being  appended here. The next section (vss. 7–14) is subtly soldered to the first:  the final word  of verse 6 is dákṣiṇāvat “accompanied by priestly gifts,” while the first phrase  of verse 7 is imé bhojā́ḥ “these benefactors”—the word bhojá is used through out the hymn devoted to the dakṣiṇā (X.106) to refer to the bestowers of the  priestly gifts. The whole of this second section concerns the relationship of the  poet Viśvāmitra and his family with his patron, King Sudās and his people, the  Bharatas, via the mediation of Indra, whose powers the poet can command for  the sake of Sudās and his subjects because of his poetic gifts. There are several  reminiscences of previous Indra hymns in III. Verse 7, with the patrons com
pared to the Aṅgirases, recalls the extensive treatment of the Aṅgirases in III.31.  Verse 9 gives a synopsis of III.33, in which Viśvāmitra stops the rivers flowing so  Sudās and his troops can cross; the name Sudās is mentioned in this story only  here. Viśvāmitra’s family, the Kuśikas, are found here in verses 9–11; in III.33.5  he calls himself “the son of Kuśika,” and a repeated verse containing the plural  of the name serves as a ring-compositional marker for the whole of the Indra  cycle of Maṇḍala III (III.30.20 = III.50.4), as discussed in the introduction to  the latter hymn. This section ends with a slighting mention of a rival and appar ently non-sacrificing group, whom Indra is urged to subjugate to Sudās and the  Bharatas.
The next two verses (15–16) are the most mysterious in the hymn; they both  concern a female figure identified as sasarparī́, the formation and etymology of  which is unclear and which may either be a proper name or an attributive charac terizing adjective. (Our translation, “the squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī,”  is a portmanteau containing both adjectives evoked by the phonology and mor phology of the word and the proper name; we consider it a multiple semi-pun.)  The Anukramaṇī assigns these two verses to Vāc [=“speech”] Sasarparī, and some  scholars consider that the figure the embodiment of the Kuśikas’ verbal art. In any  case she seems to be responsible for the fame of the people she aids.
The next four verses (17–20) appear to have no connection with the rest of the  hymn. They are prayers to deflect various possible catastrophes that might befall a  team of oxen and the vehicle they pull on a journey, and wish for safe return. This  section reads as if it were a continuation of or expansion on the Zauberspruch at  the end of III.33 against potential difficulties afflicting a team and its wagon at  a ford.
The final four verses (21–24) are very difficult to interpret. They have tradition ally been taken as the expression of the implacable hostility between Viśvāmitra  and Vasiṣṭha, which is a staple of later texts (e.g., the Mahābhārata). But there  is no whiff of this personal hostility in the R̥gveda, in our opinion, and there is  certainly no mention of Vasiṣṭha, direct or indirect, in the verses here. There is,  however, hostility: verse 21 calls on Indra to help us defeat our enemy, and the next  few verses express in colorful images the impotence of the enemy’s actions and  weapons. The most puzzling verse is the final one, where the Bharatas, the people

of Sudās, celebrated in verse 12, appear to be presented in an unflattering light. We  have no explanation for this.
### 1
O Indra and “Mountain” [=Indra’s mace?], with a lofty chariot convey  hither precious nourishments, providing good heroes.
Pursue the oblations at our ceremonies, o gods. Become strengthened by  our hymns, becoming exhilarated on the refreshing drink.
### 2
Stay just so, bounteous one; don’t go away. I will sacrifice to you from the  well-pressed soma.
I grasp your hem like a son his father’s—Indra, powerful one—with the  sweetest hymn.
### 3
Let us both recite, Adhvaryu: sing in response to me. Let us both make a  vehicle enjoyable to Indra.
Sit right here on the ritual grass of the sacrificer. And then the hymn will  be recited to Indra.
### 4
Just the wife is the home; she is the womb. Let your yoked fallow bays  convey you to it.
Whenever we will press soma, Agni the messenger will run to you.
### 5
Drive yon, bounteous one, and drive hither. Brother Indra, in both places  there is a goal for you,
where there is a resting place for your lofty chariot and unhitching for  your prizewinning donkey.
### 6
You have drunk the soma; drive forth home, Indra: your lovely wife, a  great delight, is in your house,
where there is a resting place for your lofty chariot and unhitching
accompanied by (priestly) gifts for your prizewinner.
### 7
These benefactors, the Aṅgirases in different form, sons of heaven,  heroes of the Lord,
giving bounties to Viśvāmitra at the Pressing of a Thousand, lengthen  their own lifetime.
### 8
Form after form the bounteous one assumes, wrapping his own body in  tricks,
when three times a day he has come here from heaven in an instant,
drinking out of turn by (the power of) his own (magic) spells, (though)  he possesses the truth.
### 9
The great seer—god-begotten, god-sped, (though) possessing a man’s  sight—stayed the river in flood.
When Viśvāmitra conveyed Sudās (across the rivers), Indra made
friends with the Kuśikas.
### 10
Like geese, you make a signaling call with the pressing stones,
becoming exhilarated on hymns at the ceremony when (the soma) is  pressed. You inspired seers who have the sight of men, along with the gods
drink the somian honey, you Kuśikas.
### 11
Come forth, Kuśikas; make yourselves known. Release the horse of  Sudās, to (gain) wealth.
The king will smash the obstacle to the east, to the west, to the north.  Then he will sacrifice on the best part of the earth.
### 12
I who have praised both these two world-halves here and Indra— Viśvāmitra’s sacred formulation here guards the Bharata people.
### 13
The Viśvāmitras have given the formulation to Indra who bears  the mace.
He will make us well rewarded.
### 14
What do the cows do for you among the Kīkaṭas? They do not milk out  the milk mixture; they do not heat the gharma[=hot]-drink.
Bring here to us the possessions of Pramaganda. Make the descendant  of Nīcāśākha subject to us, bounteous one.
### 15
The squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī, given by the Jamadagnis,  banishing neglect, has bellowed loftily.
(She like) the Daughter of the Sun has stretched (their [=the
Jamadagnis’]) fame, immortal and unaging, to the gods.
### 16
The squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī swiftly brought fame to  them among the communities of the five peoples,
having taken on new life (like Dawn, though) in her winglessness, she  whom the Palastis and Jamadagnis gave me.
### 17
Let the two oxen be steadfast, the axle firm; let the chariot-pole not be  torn off, nor the yoke be broken off.
Let Indra keep the two pātalyas [=pieces of chariot?] from breaking.  You with indestructible wheel-rims, escort us.
### 18
Put power in our bodies, power in our draft-oxen, Indra—
power for our kith and kin to live, for you are the giver of power.
### 19
Engird yourself in the hardwood of the acacia tree; place strength in the  śiṃśapā(-wood) in its recoil.
O Axle, you who are firm and were made firm, stay firm. Don’t make us  leave off from this journey.
### 20
Let this Lord of the Forest [=tree] here not leave us behind and not  cause us harm.
(Let there be) well-being all the way to the houses, to the unharnessing,  to the unhitching.
### 21
Indra, with your manifold means of help, which are the best possible  ones, quicken us today, bounteous champion.
Whoever hates us, let him fall low. Whomever we hate, let breath
leave him.

### 22
(Though) he heats his axe all the way through, it’s just a śimbala flower  he hacks off.
The ukhā-pot, (though) boiling, boiling over, just throws off foam,
o Indra.
### 23
There is no notice taken of his missile, you people. They lead a lump,  thinking it a beast.
(But) they are not making a non-prizewinner race with a prizewinner,  nor leading a donkey before the horses.
### 24
Are these the sons of Bharata, Indra? They take note of the non-meal,  not the meal.
They spur the alien horse, not their own. At the contest they lead
around the one whose prize is (just) a bowstring.

Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya
22 verses: triṣṭubh
This first hymn to the All Gods in this maṇḍala is something of a hybrid, combining  two standard approaches to All God hymns. On the one hand, the second half of  the hymn (starting with vs. 11) treats these deities as a list, granting a verse each to a  number of gods and mentioning their familiar characteristics. This part is relatively  straightforward.
The first half, especially verses 2–9, is ostensibly devoted to Heaven and  Earth, but, though it begins as a conventional praise of those paired deities,  as often in All God hymns the divinity provides a point of departure for spec ulation on the nature of things and unanswered questions about cosmic mat ters; see especially the questions in verse 5, at the middle of this self-contained  hymn-within-a-hymn. The emphasis on truth and reality and on the discovery of  Heaven and Earth (for both themes see vss. 3–4), in combination with the uncer tain questions, suggests that the point is that we only gradually and imperfectly  discover the real dimensions and nature of the cosmos. The style in this portion  is enigmatic, intense, and rhetorically intricate, especially in the climactic verse 9,  where Heaven as the divine begetter, and perhaps the single principle, and heaven  as a place, the home of the gods to which we also aspire, seem to be referred to  simultaneously. This double reference is aided by the ambiguity of the first verb  in the verse, ádhy emi, which can mean either “I go upon” or “I study.” Verse 10  clearly closes off that part of the hymn and makes the transition to the second  part and its list of favored gods.
The hymn begins with a verse to Agni and ends with a verse and a half to him,  thus providing a larger ring around the two very different halves. 1. This fortifying (hymn) here have they presented to the great one
belonging to the rite, who is to be reverently invoked repeatedly time  after time.
Let him listen to us with his faces belonging to the house; let
inexhaustible Agni listen with (his faces) belonging to heaven.
### 2
I will recite a great (hymn) to great Heaven and to Earth. My desire,  seeking, knowing the way, goes (to those two),
at the praise of whom the gods, seeking service at the rites, become
exhilarated in company with them.
### 3
Let your truth be real, you two world-halves. Come to the fore for our  great welfare.
Here is homage to Heaven and to Earth, o Agni. I render service with a  pleasurable offering; I beg for a treasure.
### 4
For also the ancient ones, speaking what is real, found you two, you  truthful world-halves.
Also the superior men at the clash, at the contest of champions, extolled  you two, o (Heaven and) Earth, as they kept discovering you.
### 5
Who knows for certain? Who will here proclaim (it)? What is the pathway  that leads to the gods?
Their lowest seats are visible, (but those) that are amid the highest
hidden commandments... ?
### 6
The sage poet, (though) having a man’s sight, has looked upon them: the  two [=Heaven and Earth], separated but becoming exhilarated
(together) in the womb of truth.
The two have made a seat each for herself as a bird does, (though) being  united by a joint purpose.
### 7
Jointly but kept apart, with their ends at a distance, they have taken their  stand in a fixed place, wakeful.
And (though) they are sisters and young women, they are called
opposing names.
### 8
All these races do the two contain. (Though) supporting the great gods,  they do not waver.
The One is master of all: the moving and the fixed, the walking and the  flying, of various sorts, variously born.
### 9
From afar I tread upon the ancient (path) of old [/study the ancient One of  old]: that is our relationship to the great father [=Heaven?], the begetter, where [=in heaven?] the gods, as admirers, in their own ways took their  stand within (it) on their (own) broad separate path.
### 10
This praise here I proclaim, you two world-halves. The tender-hearted  ones having Agni as their tongue will hear it—
the youthful sovereign kings, Mitra, Varuṇa, the Ādityas, sage poets,  extending far and wide.

### 11
Savitar of the golden hands and the lovely tongue, being master at the  rite three times a day—
and (when), Savitar, you have set your signal-call among the gods, then  impel wholeness to us.
### 12
Of good action, of good hands, of good aid, truthful—let God Tvaṣṭar  establish these things for us for help.
In company with Pūṣan, o R̥bhus, make yourselves exhilarated.  With pressing stones raised, you have fashioned the
ceremony.
### 13
The Maruts with lighting as their chariot, brandishing spears, the  young bloods of heaven, born of truth, irrepressible,
and Sarasvatī—those worthy of the sacrifice will listen. Confer wealth  along with heroes, you powerful ones.
### 14
The recitations, the chants have gone to Viṣṇu of many wonders as if on  a journey of victorious Bhaga—
(Viṣṇu) the wide-striding humped (bull), who has many (women). The  young mothers-to-be are not neglectful.
### 15
Indra, being master by virtue of all his heroic powers, filled both  world-halves with his greatness,
stronghold-splitter, Vr̥tra-smasher, possessor of a bold host.  Having massed it together, bring to us here an abundance of  livestock.
### 16
The Nāsatyas, asked about our kinship, are my fathers. Our cherished  name is our common birth with the Aśvins.
Because you are wealth-givers of wealth to us, you keep watch over  giving with unstinting (gifts), as undeceivable ones.
### 17
Great is this cherished name of yours, o poets [=R̥bhus], that you all  become “gods” to Indra.
You are partner with the dear R̥bhus, much-invoked one. (All of you,)  fashion this insight here for us to win.
### 18
Aryaman, Aditi, (all those) worthy of our sacrifice—the
commandments of Varuṇa cannot be cheated—
(all of you,) keep us from coming to childlessness. Let our course be  full of offspring and livestock.
### 19
The messenger of the gods, impelled forth in many forms—let him  pronounce us blameless in our entirety.
Let Earth, Heaven, and the Waters hear us, and the Sun with the  heavenly bodies, and the broad midspace.
### 20
Let the bullish mountains with stable dwelling places hear us, as they  become exhilarated on the refreshing drink.
Let Aditi with the Ādityas hear us. Let the Maruts extend to us  beneficial shelter. 21. Let our path be always easy to travel, abounding in food. Gods, saturate  the plants with honey.
(Let there be) a share in your fellowship for me, Agni. You should not  be neglectful. Might I reach the seat of wealth consisting in much
livestock.
### 22
Sweeten our oblations, illuminate our refreshments entirely. Mete out  full measures of fame in our direction.
Conquer all our rivals in combat, Agni. Through all the days, shine  benevolently on us.

Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya
22 verses: triṣṭubh
The most obvious feature of this hymn is the refrain found in every verse: “great  is the one and only lordship of the gods,” notable for its emphasis on unity  (ékam “one and only” is the final word of each verse) and for the juxtaposition  and implied identity of asura(tvám) “lord(ship)” and devā́nām “gods,” given  that in later Vedic the Asuras and the Devas are locked in eternal enmity. This  familiar Vedic mystery of simultaneous unity and diversity is further exempli
fied by the references to numerous gods (generally unnamed, but usually recog nizable), especially in the second part of the hymn, in the manner of many All  God hymns.
However, the hymn has a more structured trajectory than most All God list  hymns. The first part of the hymn treats the mystery of the birth of Agni; once  Agni has been definitively born, Indra comes to the sacrifice as is usual. After  three verses situating the action at a re-creation of the primordial early-morning  sacrifice and introducing the poet (vss. 1–3), the hymn turns to a mystical  description of fire dispersed in many places and hidden in the plants (4–5), and  of its parents, the two kindling sticks (4–7), then of fire as it catches after the  kindling (8–9) and sends its smoke and flames toward heaven (9–10). The kin dling of Agni then takes on both a cosmic and a ritual dimension, as Night and  Dawn and then the Dawns alone are identified as the mother(s) of the infant  Agni, reflecting, of course, the kindling of the ritual fire at daybreak (11–16).  Soon after (17–18) Indra puts in an appearance, coming to the early-morning  sacrifice.
Not all the referents are clear in these riddling verses, and in some verses several  referents probably lurk beneath the enigmatic phraseology. For example, verse 17  serves as a transition verse between the fire-kindling verses and the appearance of  Indra. The bull here could be Agni himself, or Soma (much of the vocabulary is544 III.55
somian), or a prefiguring of Indra. Commentators differ in their identifications,  and those given in brackets here are sometimes provisional.
### 1
Then when the ancient dawns dawned forth, in the track of the cow a  great imperishable (syllable) was born [/was discerned],
which tends to the commandments of the gods: great is the one and only  lordship of the gods.
### 2
Let not the gods deflect us here, nor the ancient Fathers who know the  track [/word], o Agni.
Between the two seats of the two age-old ones [=Heaven and Earth] is  your beacon. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods.
### 3
My desires fly apart in many directions, but with my (ritual) labor  I illuminate ancient things.
When Agni has been kindled might we speak only truth: “Great is the  one and only lordship of the gods.”
### 4
The common king has been dispersed in many places; he lies in his  resting places [=hearths], (spread out) for some distance along the
(fire-)logs.
Another bears the calf; the mother rests peacefully [=the two
fire-churning sticks]. – Great is the one and only lordship of
the gods.
### 5
He is dwelling in the older (plants), growing up through the later ones,  within the tender ones (even) when they are just born.
Having (him) within, (though) unimpregnated they give birth to (him).  – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods.
### 6
He who was lying down far away—now he who has two mothers roams  without a binding (rope), their only calf.
These are the commandments of Mitra and Varuṇa: Great is the one and  only lordship of the gods.
### 7
The one with two mothers is the Hotar, the sovereign king at the
rites. The top (of him) roams along (the logs), while his base rests
peacefully.
Those who speak delightful (speech) proffer delightful (things). – Great  is the one and only lordship of the gods.
### 8
His every approach appears right in your face, like that of a champion  battling up close.
The thought acts as go-between to the tribute of the cow [=ghee as
oblation]. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods.
### 9
The gray messenger [=smoke] keeps bearing down on them
[=hearths? plants?]. The great one acts the go-between through the
luminous realm.
Bearing wondrous forms, he looks out upon us. – Great is the one and  only lordship of the gods. 10. Viṣṇu, the cow-protector, protects the highest pen, establishing his own  dear, immortal domains.
Agni knows all these worlds. – Great is the one and only lordship of  the gods.
### 11
The twins [=Night and Dawn] have assumed wondrous forms, each one  for herself. One of them shines; the other is black;
the dusky one and the ruddy one are sisters. – Great is the one and only  lordship of the gods.
### 12
Where the mother and the daughter [also =Night and Dawn], the two  sap-yielding milk-cows, give suck jointly,
I reverently invoke the two within the seat of truth. – Great is the one  and only lordship of the gods.
### 13
Licking the calf [=Agni] of another [=firestick/Night], she [=oblation/ Dawn] lows: in what form has the milk-cow deposited her udder?
Iḍā [/Refreshment] has swelled with the milk of truth. – Great is the one  and only lordship of the gods.
### 14
At her feet she of many shapes [=Dawn] clothes herself in wondrous  forms. She stands erect, constantly licking the (calf) three
lambing-seasons old.
I roam through the seat of truth as a knowing one. – Great is the one  and only lordship of the gods.
### 15
Like two footprints set down within the wondrous one [=Agni? ritual  ground?], the one of the two is hidden, the other visible [=Night
and Dawn].
Their pathway has a single goal, (but goes) separately. – Great is the  one and only lordship of the gods.
### 16
Let the milk-cows [=Dawns? plants crackling as they burn?] be noisy,  those which are without young (yet) sap-yielding, unfailing, not
milked out,
becoming young ever anew. – Great is the one and only lordship of  the gods.
### 17
Though the bull goes about roaring within the one (herd of) cows, he  deposits his seed in the other herd.
For he is the earth-protector; he is the apportioner; he is king. – Great  is the one and only lordship of the gods.
### 18
The hero’s abundance of horses we will proclaim just now, o people.  The gods know of it.
Yoked sixfold, five after five they convey (Indra) hither. – Great is the  one and only lordship of the gods.
### 19
God Tvaṣṭar, the impeller providing all forms, flourishes; he has  begotten offspring in great quantity,
and all these creatures here are his. – Great is the one and only lordship  of the gods.

### 20
He [=Indra?] has raised up together the two great bowls (to be) united.  Both of them are crammed with his goods.
The hero is famed for finding goods. – Great is the one and only
lordship of the gods.
### 21
And he who suckles all of us [=Agni] dwells peacefully on this earth  here, like a king with established alliances,
stationed in front like heroes stationed for protection. – Great is the one  and only lordship of the gods.
### 22
The plants and the waters offer tribute to you; the earth bears wealth  for you, Indra.
May we be your comrades, sharing in the valuables. – Great is the one  and only lordship of the gods.

Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Another enigmatic and mystical All God hymn, with its mysteries, as so often,  couched in numerological terms, primarily as threes or multiples of three. In the  earlier parts of the hymn these numbers seem to refer to cosmic entities—perhaps,  for example, the three heavens and three earths making up the six in verse 2—and  to cosmic creation, though the details are far from clear. But the number three takes  a strongly ritual turn beginning with verse 5, referring to three daily rites, that is, to  the three pressings of the soma sacrifice. Thus the poet implicitly identifies ritual  structure with cosmic structure.
### 1
Neither the tricky ones nor the clever transgress these: steadfast are the  foremost commandments of the god.
Neither the two world-halves without deceit nor the mountains standing  fast are to be bowed down by knowing wiles.
### 2
Six burdens does the One, unmoving, bear. The cows have approached  the highest truth.
Three great females stand below, as steeds: two were deposited in hiding;  one has become visible.
### 3
The bull of all forms [=Tvaṣṭar?] has three groins and three udders, with  offspring in great quantity;
having three faces, he is master [/husband], possessing great force. The  bull is the inseminator of each and every female.
### 4
In a flash the trail-blazer for these (waters) has awakened—I have  invoked the dear name of the Ādityas—
Even the heavenly waters came to a stop for him. Proceeding in separate  directions, they bent around him. 5. Three times three are the seats of the poets, o rivers, and the sovereign  king at the rites [/in the (cosmic) divisions] [=Agni] has three mothers. Three are the truthful watery maidens, who act the master at the rite  three times a day.
### 6
Three times a day, every day, o Savitar, impel valuables to us, three  times daily.
Threefold riches and goods impel here. O Bhaga, o Protector, o Holy  Place, position (them) for winning.
### 7
Three times a day Savitar keeps impelling (and?) the two kings, Mitra  and Varuṇa, of good hands.
Even the waters, even the two broad world-halves beg for his treasure,  for Savitar to impel it.
### 8
Threefold are the highest realms of light, difficult to reach; (there?) rule/ shine three heroes of the Lord.
Truthful, vigorous, difficult to deceive—three times a day let the gods be  at the rite.

This hymn depicts the beginning of the morning ritual, with the recitation of praise  poetry, the yoking of the pressing stones, and the kindling of the fire. The poet puts  himself at the center of this activity, opening the hymn with a vivid image depicting  his own inspiration as an untethered cow producing abundantly.
### 1
He who has sifted through has found my inspired thought—a milk-cow,  roaming for some distance without a cowherd,
who just in a single day has given milk in abundance from her wellspring.  So Indra and Agni (and other gods) are admirers of her—
### 2
As are Indra and Pūṣan, the two bulls with dexterous hands. The (cows  [=poems]), well treated, give unfailing milk like that of Heaven.
When all the gods take pleasure in her, might I reach your benevolence  there, o good ones.
### 3
The sisters who seek the potency of the bull [=Agni], they recognize their  embryo in him and do homage.
The milk-cows, bellowing, proceed powerfully toward their child who  bears wondrous forms.
### 4
I invite the two well-fixed world-halves, as I yoke the pressing stones at  the ceremony with my inspired thought.
These (Dawns? flames?) of yours here, abounding in valuables for Manu,  stand erect, visible and worthy of the sacrifice.

### 5
Your tongue, honeyed, very wise, wide spreading, which is proclaimed  (even) among the gods, o Agni,
with it make all those worthy of the sacrifice sit here for our help and  make them drink the honeyed (drinks).

What of yours will swell inexhaustible and shimmering like the stream of  a mountain, god Agni,
that solicitude grant to us and your grace destined for all people, good  Jātavedas.

Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins on a note of mystery, since the identities of the milk-cow, the  “age-old (semen),” and the son of the priestly gift are unclear. The latter half  of verse 1 describes the early morning, and therefore our view is that the first  half does as well. We take the cow as the Dawn, whose milk is light, or pos
sibly the hymn sung at dawn, and this milk arises from the semen (see III.31.10  for the ellipsis) that is the fire of Agni or the sun or, less likely, soma. Agni, the  son of the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gift that may be actually or metaphorically a  cow, is a “go-between,” either as a messenger who encourages the morning or  as one who goes between heaven and earth. Intricacy then replaces mystery in  the second verse. In 2c, asmát, “because of us” or “from us,” may be construed  with “awaken” or perhaps secondarily with “away”—“We have put the poetic  inspiration of the miser away (from us).” In 2d cakr̥ma “we have put” should be  construed twice with two preverbs and, as Geldner has pointed out, ā́ “here” can  be construed with the two verbs it stands between.
The remainder of the hymn is neither as mysterious nor as intricate as these  opening verses. It becomes a plea for the Aśvins to appear at the early-morning  soma-pressing, riding in their chariot, which is the sound of the hymns that carry  the Aśvins to the sacrificial site.
In verse 6 Jahnāvī probably refers to the “wife of Jahnu,” who is the father or  ancestor of Viśvāmitra according to the Brāhmaṇas, although others have taken  it as the name of the clan of Jahnu (Geldner) or as a name of the Ganges (Pirart  2001: 91). If the former, perhaps the poet reminds the Aśvins of the wealth that was  with his family in the past in his wish to renew this friendship with them and their  support for him.
### 1
The milk-cow [=Dawn?] is yielding the desirable milk of the age-old  (semen); the son [=Agni] of the priestly gift acts as go-between.
She whose course is beautiful carries brightness here; the praise song of  Dawn has awakened the Aśvins. 2. In good harness, the ritual offerings—they come to be high above!— carry you two like parents back here by the truth.
Awaken because of us! We have put the poetic inspiration of the miser  away (from us) and put here the help of you two. Travel here this way. 3. With your well-harnessed horses and smooth-rolling chariot, wondrous  ones, hear this signal call of the pressing stone.
Is it not true that the inspired poets born long ago have said that you are  the first to respond to trouble, Aśvins?
### 4
Turn your thought here, come here somehow in your usual way—all  peoples call upon the Aśvins—
for like allies they [=the priests] have given this honey, foaming with cows  [=milk], to you at the beginning of the reddening (dawn).
### 5
Even across many airy spaces, Aśvins, the song (travels) among the  peoples, generous ones.
Travel here along the paths leading to the gods. Wondrous ones, these  stores of honey belong to you two.
### 6
Your home is old, your companionship benevolent, and yours the wealth  at (the house of) the wife of Jahnu, you men.
Creating once again your benevolent companionship for ourselves, now  united together, we would find exhilaration through the honey.
### 7
O well-skilled Aśvins, youthful ones, together with the Wind and along  with your teams,
drink the day-old soma, taking pleasure and never faltering, o Nāsatyas  who bring good gifts.
### 8
O Aśvins, ample refreshments have sped around you two, aligning  themselves with the songs and never faltering.
Your chariot, born of truth and hastened by pressing stones, travels  around heaven and earth in a day.
### 9
O Aśvins, the soma that is yours, the best of honeyed pressings—drink it  and come to our house!
Your chariot, again and again creating many a beautiful form, is the first  to come to the appointed place of the soma-offerer.

59 (293) Mitra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: triṣṭubh 1–5, gāyatrī 6–9
Mitra is usually invoked along with Varuṇa; this is the only hymn in the R̥gveda  to Mitra alone. Here he is addressed as the god of alliances who “organizes” the  peoples (vss. 1, 5), that is, who oversees the agreements, treaties, marriages, and  other forms of alliance by which people assume relationships with one another.  Just as the human king must abide by and protect such relationships, so Mitra as a

divine king provides divine sanction for them. The first verse underscores the  nature of Mitra and plays on the appellative sense of mitrá “alliance.” It means  both that the god of alliances arranges people when he is addressed and that an  alliance arranges people when it is pronounced. This hymn marks the birth of an  alliance, figured in verse 4 as the birth of Mitra himself at this time and in this  place. The hymn does not say what kind of alliance has been born, but one possi
bility, suggested especially in the final two verses, is that it is the reciprocal alliance  between gods and humans established through the sacrifice. In this alliance humans  empower the gods through their praises and offerings, and the gods are expected to  reciprocate by prospering humans.
This hymn has been the subject of a close study by Thieme (1957: 38–59).
### 1
Mitra arranges the peoples when (Alliance) is declared. Mitra upholds  earth and heaven.
Mitra watches over the nations with unblinking eye. To Mitra offer an  offering of ghee.
### 2
He who strives according to your commandment, o Mitra—let that  mortal, bringing pleasing offerings, be at the fore, o Āditya.
Helped by you, he is not crushed, nor is he conquered. No distress
reaches him from near nor from afar.
### 3
Free from disease, being invigorated through libation, with knees firm on  the earth’s expanse,
abiding under the commandment of the Āditya, we would be in Mitra’s  good favor.
### 4
Here Mitra, to be revered and very kind, has been born as a king of  excellent dominion and a ritual adept.
We would be in the good favor of him, who is worthy of the sacrifice,  and in his propitious benevolence.
### 5
The great Āditya is to be approached with reverence—he who arranges  the peoples, who is very kind to the one singing praise.
For him the most wonderful, for Mitra, offer this pleasing offering into  the fire.
### 6
The help of the god Mitra, who maintains the separate territories,  brings gain;
his brilliance holds bright renown.
### 7
Wide-ranging Mitra, who surmounts heaven through his greatness and earth through his renown—
### 8
To Mitra with his power to dominate do the five peoples submit;
he bears all the gods.
### 9
Among the gods and the Āyus, for the person who has plaited the  ritual grass,
Mitra has created refreshments that carry his desirable commandments.

60 (294) R̥bhus and Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
7 verses: jagatī
The hymn announces that the present priests have recovered the skills of the R̥bhus  by which, although born as human “children of Manu” (vs. 3), they attained divin ity (vs. 2), immortality (vs. 3), and, like the gods, a share of the sacrifice (vs. 1). The  “form” that the R̥bhus adopt in verse 1 may be the divine form they have earned. In  verses 4–6 the poet turns to Indra and asks him to come to the soma-pressing along  with the R̥bhus, now fully divine, and to drink the soma in the company of the  R̥bhus. Because Indra and the R̥bhus are traveling by chariot, the poet deploys the  imagery of prizewinning racehorses throughout these last verses. He even calls the  R̥bhus themselves “prizewinners” in verse 7, though this metaphor is anticipated  by vā́javant in verses 5 and 6. “Vāja” is the name of one of the R̥bhus, so on one  level this means that Vāja is in the company of the other R̥bhus, but it also means  that the R̥bhus, since they ride in Indra’s chariot, are or will be accompanied by the  prize of victory.
### 1
In one place and another, by their thought and family relationship, by  their knowledge, o men, the fire-priests have arrived at these things:
the craft by which, o sons of Sudhanvan, you have attained a sacrificial  share, rapidly adopting a (different) form;
### 2
The ability by which you carved the cups; the insight by which you made  the cow to flow (milk) from the hide;
the thought by which you fashioned the two fallow bays—by (all) that, o  R̥bhus, you fully attained divinity.
### 3
The R̥bhus attained the companionship of Indra. The artisans, the  children of Manu, raced.
The sons of Sudhanvan rose to immortality by applying themselves to  their labors, ritually acting well by good ritual action.
### 4
You travel on the same chariot with Indra when the soma is pressed, and  then you become joined with the splendor of your wishes.
Your good ritual acts are not to be equaled, o chanters, sons of
Sudhanvan, R̥bhus, nor your heroic deeds.
### 5
O Indra, together with the R̥bhus bringing the Prize of Victory [=Vāja],  drench yourself in the soma pressed and sprinkled in the hands (of the  priests).
Urged on by insight, o generous one, become exhilarated in the
house of the pious one together with the sons of Sudhanvan, those  superior men.
### 6
O Indra, along with the R̥bhus bringing the Prize of Victory [=Vāja],  become exhilarated here at this soma-pressing of ours, along with
your ability, o much-praised one.

These pastures [=soma rites?] have offered themselves to you according  to the commandment of the gods and the (ritual) foundations
of Manu.
### 7
O Indra, together with the R̥bhus, with the prizewinners, racing to the  prize, travel here to the ritually right praise of the singer
with your hundred invigorating intentions for Āyu, since you have a  thousand stratagems at the rite’s invocation.

61 (295) Dawn
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The only hymn dedicated to Dawn in Maṇḍala III, it combines the usual themes: the  beauty of the young goddess, her relation to the morning ritual and the ritual fire,  and her role as giver of rich goods because of the distribution of priestly gifts at the  Morning Pressing. Note that halfway through the hymn (beginning with vs. 4), the  direct 2nd-person address to Dawn changes to 3rd-person description. This change  may mirror the development of the ritual: first the poet coaxes Dawn to appear,  and when his pleas have been successful (the vocatives of the first verses are in part  replaced by aorists and perfects of the immediate past), he turns his attention to the  ritual her appearance has set in motion.
### 1
O Dawn, prize-giver with a rich prize, bounteous—as a discerning one  enjoy the praise of the singer.
O goddess, as a young woman from of old, as Plenitude you proceed  according to your commandment, you who bring all valuables.
### 2
O goddess Dawn, as immortal one radiate widely, possessing a gleaming  chariot, arousing liberalities.
Let your horses, easy to control, convey you hither—you of golden color,  they who have broad flanks.
### 3
O Dawn, facing all beings, you stand erect as the beacon of the
immortal one.
As you make your progress to the same goal (as the older dawns), roll  yourself hither like a wheel, you newer one.
### 4
Like one letting the reins go slack [?], bounteous Dawn drives, mistress of  good pasture.
Generating the sun, she of good portion and wondrous power stretches  all the way to the end of heaven and of earth.
### 5
To the goddess Dawn, radiating widely, proffer your well-twisted (hymn)  with reverence.
The honey-bringer has propped her leading edge upward in heaven. She  of delightful aspect has shone forth through the shining realms. 6. The truthful (daughter) of Heaven has been awakened by our chants  [/been perceived with her rays]. The wealthy lady has brightly mounted  the two world-halves.
Agni, you go begging Dawn for valuable property as she comes hither,  radiating widely.
### 7
Driving (the cows) of the Dawns on the foundation of truth, the bull  [=Sun?] has entered the two great world-halves.
Great is the magic power of Mitra and Varuṇa. As the shimmering
(Dawn) has spread her radiance, it [=magic power] is spread widely in  many places.

62 (296) Various Gods
Viśvāmitra Gāthina (1–15); Viśvāmitra or Jamadagni (16–18)
18 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, gāyatrī 4–18, arranged in trcas ̥
This, the last hymn in the maṇḍala, consists of eighteen verses, which should put  it out of sequence. However, it falls naturally into tr̥cas, and probably originally  consisted of six three-verse hymns dedicated severally to Indra and Varuṇa (1–3),  Br̥haspati (4–6), Pūṣan (7–9), Savitar (10–12), Soma (13–15), and Mitra and Varuṇa  (16–18).
In general the tr̥cas are relatively straightforward, even banal, but the first verse of  the first tr̥ca is rhetorically dense and striking in imagery. It seems to suggest that our  hymns, though they appear to be frenetically active, have lost their effectiveness, and  therefore Indra and Varuṇa have ceased to act on behalf of their humans praisers and  worshipers. It may not be entirely fanciful to conjecture that the simple, even simplis
tic, style of the remaining tr̥cas is an attempt to replace the “whirlwinds” of verbal  art (of which there is much in Maṇḍala III) with a meeker and less ostentatious style. The most notable feature of this hymn is the fact that the first verse of the  fourth tr̥ca, dedicated to Savitar (vs. 10), is the famous “Gāyatrī mantra,” with  which orthodox Hindus begin their morning worship even today. In the context  of R̥gvedic poetry, it must be said that the contents and form of this verse are not  particularly striking. As was just suggested, this may in fact be its point.
### 1
These (hymns) here for you two, (though) they are considered
whirlwinds, have become ones that cannot be (successfully)
brandished (even?) by one devoted to you two.
Where is this glory of yours, Indra and Varuṇa, with which you are wont  to carry the gear for your comrades?
### 2
This (man) here, latest of many, seeking wealth, keeps calling on you two  time after time for help.
Indra and Varuṇa, in concert with the Maruts, with Heaven and with  Earth, listen to my call.554 III.62
### 3
May there be goods for us, o Indra and Varuṇa; wealth in hale heroes  for us, o Maruts.
Let the Shielding Goddesses aid us with their shelters; (let) Hotrā Bhāratī (help) us with her priestly gifts.
### 4
Br̥haspati belonging to the All Gods, enjoy our oblations.
Grant treasures to the pious man.
### 5
To blazing Br̥haspati give reverence with recitations at the ceremonies— his unbowed power I desire—
### 6
To the bull of the settled domains, having all forms, undeceivable, Br̥haspati worthy to be chosen.
### 7
Here is a lovely praise hymn, utterly new, for you, Pūṣan, glowing god. It is recited by us to you.
### 8
Enjoy this hymn of mine—help our insight that seeks the prize— like a bride-seeking (man) a maiden.
### 9
He who looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole, that one, Pūṣan will become our helper.
### 10
Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights.
### 11
Seeking the prize, we beg for the generosity of Bhaga,
along with the plenitude of god Savitar.
### 12
To god Savitar do the men, the inspired poets, give reverence with  sacrifices and well-twisted hymns,
when impelled by insight.
### 13
Soma proceeds, finding the way; he goes to a rendezvous with the gods, to sit in the womb of truth.
### 14
Soma—for us, for the two-footed, and for the four-footed livestock, he will make refreshments that bring no disease.
### 15
Increasing our lifetime, overcoming hostilities,
Soma has sat on the seat.
### 16
Mitra and Varuṇa, sprinkle our pastureland with ghee,
the realms with honey, you of good resolve.
### 17
Widely proclaimed, increasing through reverence, you rule by the  greatness of your skill
through the longest (spaces? times?), you of blazing commandments. 18. Being hymned by Jamadagni, sit in the womb of truth.
Drink the soma, you two increasing through truth.

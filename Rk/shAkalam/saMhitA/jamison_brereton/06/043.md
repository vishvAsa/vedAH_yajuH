Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: uṣṇih
A simple hymn, in which the refrain (pāda c of each verse) offers Indra soma to  drink, and the first half of each verse consists of a definitional relative clause refer ring to Indra’s deeds in his soma-exhilaration. As often, the pattern set in the rest  of the hymn is modified but not entirely broken in the final verse: verses 1–3 contain  the syntagm yásya...máda- “(in) whose exhilaration,” while the final verse substi tutes the participle mandāná “finding exhilaration” for the etymologically related  noun máda, and also inserts a part of the soma plant, its stalk, on which the relative  pronoun is dependent.

In whose exhilaration you subdued Śambara for Divodāsa—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 02
Whose sharp-pressed exhilaration, whose middle and end, you guard— here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 03
In whose exhilaration you set loose from the rock the cows fixed firm  within—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 04
Finding exhilaration in whose stalk, you acquire the capacity for  generosity—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!

Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Another invitation to Indra to drink the soma. The usual “drive” theme is also  present (vss. 1, 4, 5), but backgrounded. The emphasis is on the attractions of the  particular soma offered. Only in the last pāda of the last verse does the poet ask  Indra for something in return.
## 01
Free of anger, drive here to the sacrifice. For you do the pressed soma  drops purify themselves.
Like cows toward their own home, o mace-bearer, come here, Indra, as  the first of those worthy of the sacrifice.
## 02
Your throat, which is well-fashioned, which is the widest, with which you  are always drinking the wave of honey,
take a drink with it. The Adhvaryu has set (the soma) forth for you. Let  your mace turn itself to the pursuit of cows, Indra.
## 03
This drop, the soma, a bull of all colors, has been brought to perfection  for bullish Indra.
Drink it, o powerful master of bays, (chariot-)mounter—this of which  you are master from of old, which is your food. 4. Pressed soma is better than unpressed, Indra, and this (soma) here is  even better, for the discriminating to enjoy.
Drive here to this sacrifice, you overcomer. Through it fulfill all your  powers.
## 05
We are calling you, Indra: drive nearby. The soma will be fit for
your body.
O you of a hundred resolves, bring yourself to exhilaration on the
pressed (drinks). Further us in battles and among the clans.

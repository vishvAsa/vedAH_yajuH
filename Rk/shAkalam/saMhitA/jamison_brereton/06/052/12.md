O Agni, Hotar, perform this ceremony as sacrifice for us according to  its patterns,
as one who attends to the divine folk. 13. All you gods, hear this call of mine—you who are in the midspace or  you who are in heaven,
you who have Agni as your tongue or you who are the means of
sacrifice. Having sat on this ritual grass here, bring yourselves to
exhilaration.

In its exhilaration, knowing many shapes, Indra smashed unopposable  obstacles.
Pour forth for him the honeyed soma, for the belipped hero to drink. 15. Let Indra be the one who drinks the pressed soma, who smashes the  obstacle [/Vr̥tra] with his mace in his exhilaration,
who goes to the sacrifice, even from far away, who is the good helper of  insights, providing nourishment to the bard.

Rudra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4
This brief hymn primarily begs Rudra to restrain his characteristic power to do  harm, though it also mentions in passing his healing and helpful gifts (vss. 3–4).
## 01
Bring these songs to Rudra, whose bow is taut and whose arrow is swift,  to the god of independent power,
to the unvanquishable, vanquishing adept whose weapons are sharp. Let  him hear us.
## 02
For in consequence of his dwelling place he takes cognizance of the  earthly race and, in consequence of his universal rule, of the heavenly. Providing help, proceed toward our doors that provide help (in return).  Bring no affliction to our children, Rudra.
## 03
The missile of yours, which, shot downward from heaven, circles around  the earth—let it avoid us.
A thousand are your remedies, o you who are our familiar. Do no harm  to our offspring and descendants.
## 04
Do not smite us, Rudra. Do not deliver us up. Let us not be in the toils  of you in your anger.
Give us a share in the ritual grass and in the praise of the living. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings.

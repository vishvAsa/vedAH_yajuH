Agni
Gr̥tsamada
6 verses: gāyatrī
A simple hymn in many ways, but with a small twist. The mention of the seer and  poet Atri in verse 5 is surprising: Atri is the poet of the Vth Maṇḍala and is oth erwise not found in II. However, in the immediately preceding verse the appar ently innocent simile “like the sun with its radiance” (svàr ṇá bhānúnā) encodes a  reference to a famous myth in which Atri rescues the sun from a supposed demon  Svarbhānu. As I have argued (Jamison 1991: 264–67), Svarbhānu is actually Agni,  and therefore this little hymn makes sly reference to the myth of the Sun, wounded  by Agni (because of the Sun’s incest with his own daughter) and healed by Atri. 1. As a prize-seeker (praises) his chariots, now praise the yoke(d teams)  of Agni,
the most glorious one, who grants rewards,

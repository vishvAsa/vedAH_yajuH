The IXth Maṇḍala is the only major grouping in the R̥gveda devoted to a single ritual  procedure. It consists of 114 hymns dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, “self-purifying  Soma.” It treats the deified ritual substance, the exhilarating drink soma, whose  preparation and offering are the focus of the most important Vedic ritual, the soma  sacrifice, but it treats that substance at only a single episode in the whole elaborate  sacrifice, the time when the soma juice, which has already been pressed, is poured  across the sheep’s fleece that serves to “purify” it—that is, to remove the vegetable  detritus still present in the liquid—before it is first diluted with water, then mixed  with milk, and poured into the offering vessels. (For more detailed treatment of  the ritual procedures involved see, e.g., Geldner’s introduction to this maṇḍala and  Oberlies 1999.)
There are no other hymns to Soma Pavamāna in the R̥gveda and only a few  to Soma in his other aspects (I.91, VIII.48, VIII.79, X.25, as well as a few dedi cated to Soma and another god [e.g., Soma and Rudra I.43, Agni and Soma  I.93]). Judging from this absence, as well as from the data provided by the poets  named by the Anukramaṇī, it is clear that many of the hymns in the maṇḍala  were extracted from the original bardic collections and assembled in this liturgi cally oriented collection, while other hymns in the maṇḍala were composed by  younger poets. The beginnings of the construction of a pan-Ārya sacrificial sys tem, superseding the separate and competing clan rites—a construction that led  to the middle Vedic śrauta ritual system—can be discerned in various composite  hymns, especially IX.67.
It is little short of remarkable that the R̥gvedic bards could take this ritual  snapshot, consisting of what seems like extremely unpromising material, and make  it into high poetry not once, but 114 times, and even the most devoted Vedicist  approaches this maṇḍala with some trepidation and with fear of the ennui to  be induced by endless repetition of a few ritual tropes. What is truly surprising  is that the poets for the most part managed to create an extraordinary variety  of approaches to this limited theme, and, for readers interested in how the tra
ditional poets of antiquity used all their ingenuity and poetic resources to trick  out and ring changes on an invariant topic, the IXth Maṇḍala serves as a sort of  laboratory to observe these skills in action. The hymns in the latter part of the1234 IX
maṇḍala in trimeter meter especially display this richness of approach, but even  the sixty-seven hymns in the short (24 syllables per verse) gāyatrī meter are very  different from each other.
One of the ways in which the poets imbue this ritual moment with gravity  beyond the simple facts of the procedure is by animatizing all the elements  deployed in the procedure and making them actors, rather than inert things  acted upon. The soma juice is configured as Soma, king and god, making a  royal progress across the filter to his rendezvous with the gods. Or he is a pow
erful charging bull, or a swift racehorse, or a bird in flight. The fleece filter is  a ewe; the milk is regularly conceived of as a herd of cows, eager to mate with  the bull Soma. These ritual elements are also given cosmic dimensions. Soma is  a pillar between heaven and earth; the sheep’s fleece is the whole surface of the  earth or of heaven; the waters for dilution are a vast sea into which the waves  of soma empty themselves; the milk in its gleaming brightness is the sun or the  day-lit sky. Once they have assumed these other poetic identities, the elements  of the ritual then participate in still other metaphors and images that stretch  those identities further. And the identities shift constantly within even brief  hymns. In short, although it may be difficult to love the Soma Maṇḍala, it pro vides an almost ideal lesson in how to construct traditional poetry. However, in  order to appreciate the artistry and the distance between the real subject and  its ennobling verbal treatment, it is necessary to keep the physical facts of the  ritual always in view; we have emphasized these regularly in the introductions  to the individual hymns. For a close study of the imagery, form, and composi tion of the soma hymns, see Oberlies (1999).
The maṇḍala is organized by meter, with the majority of the hymns in the  dimeter gāyatrī meter (IX.1–67), followed by smaller collections of trimeter— jagatī (68–86) and triṣṭubh (87–97)—then anuṣṭubh (98–101), uṣṇih (102–106),  pragātha structures (107–108), ending with miscellaneous meters (109–114).  Within each metrical group the hymns are arranged by length, from longest to  shortest. Although the gāyatrī, jagatī, and triṣṭubh collections end with some  very long hymns, these “hymns” can easily be deconstructed into smaller hymns  containing the correct number of verses. For example, the jagatī group ends  with two apparently nonconforming hymns. After a long series of five-verse  hymns (IX.75–84) we find IX.85 at twelve verses and IX.86 at forty-eight. But  IX.85 can be broken down into three four-verse hymns and IX.86 into sixteen  tr̥cas (three-verse groupings). The longest hymn in the R̥gveda is the final hymn  of the triṣṭubh group, IX.97 with fifty-eight verses, divisible into tr̥cas (with a  final, extra verse).
Gāyatrı Hymns: 1–67 ̄ IX.1 (713) Soma Pavamāna
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
The poet to whom the Anukramaṇī ascribes this hymn has the same name as the  poet of the first collection of hymns in the R̥gveda: Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra is  the author named for I.1–11 (and a descendant, Jetar Mādhuchandasa, for I.12). It  is possible that in the absence of a known author the Anukramaṇī simply borrowed  the name for this first hymn; in fact, the first four hymns of the IXth Maṇḍala are  attributed to the first four authors of Maṇḍala I.  On the other hand, the Soma  Pavamāna hymns of the first four poets of Maṇḍala I may have been selected to  begin the Soma Maṇḍala in order to provide an ordered framework.
The command “purify yourself” (pávasva) is the first word of the second pāda of  this hymn and sets the theme for the entire maṇḍala: “self-purifying” soma. This first  verse also introduces the necessary complement to this self-purifying soma, namely  the consumer of soma par excellence, Indra. Thus the verse encapsulates in its sim
plicity the endlessly repeated and often monotonous concerns of the maṇḍala. The  second verse alludes to the technical details of soma’s preparation, another topic  that will preoccupy the hymns to follow. Soma’s powers to benefit men and gods  directly are the subject of verses 3–5, while his power to stimulate Indra to do the  same, an indirect benefit for both populations, closes the hymn (vs. 10).
Verses 6–9 contain more idiosyncratic material, a catalogue of female beings  who aid in the preparation of soma. True, both the fingers that perform the press ing, metaphorically described in verses 7–8, and the cows that provide the milk to  mix with soma (vs. 9) are common denizens of soma hymns, but the Daughter of  the Sun is not: she otherwise appears in the IXth Maṇḍala only almost at the end,  in IX.113.3. It is unclear what her role is here; perhaps she signals the Morning  Pressing. Moreover, the “skin pipe” blown by the maidens in verse 8 is somewhat  puzzling; on the basis of other passages (I.117.21 and VII.89.2) it appears to be  a musical instrument, but how this image is meant to apply to soma (perhaps the  stalk?) and how the fingers can also “blow” is not clear.
In short, most of this hymn is familiar, not to say clichéd, material in soma  hymns, but as usual there are small deviations and striking images that challenge  our notion that the soma hymns, particularly those in gāyatrī meter, are an undif ferentiated mass of repetitive phrases.
### 1
Purify yourself in the sweetest, most exhilarating stream, Soma,
when you are pressed for Indra to drink.
### 2
Demon-smasher, common to all domains, he has reached his seat upon  the metal-hammered womb,
upon his sitting place, by means of the wooden (vessel).
### 3
Become the best establisher of the wide realm, most munificent, best  smasher of obstacles.
Deliver (to us) the bounty of the liberal ones.
1236 IX.2
### 4
Rush to the pursuit of the great gods with your stalk,
to the prize of victory and to fame.
### 5
Toward you do we proceed; this is just our goal every day.
O drop, in you are our hopes.
### 6
The Daughter of the Sun purifies your circling soma
with the fleece-filter in unfailing measure.
### 7
Him do the delicate ones grasp at the clash—the ten maidens [=fingers], the sisters—on the decisive day.
### 8
Him do the unwed girls impel, as they blow the skin bagpipe,
him, the threefold wild honey.
### 9
And him do the inviolable milk-cows prepare, as their child,
the soma, for Indra to drink.
### 10
In the raptures of just this (soma) Indra the champion keeps smashing  all obstacles
and bestows bounties.

Medhātithi Kāṇva
10 verses: gāyatrī
Medhātithi Kāṇva is the named poet of several hymns in the first half of Maṇḍala  VIII (2–3, 32), with its predominantly Kāṇva authorship—but more to the point  also of the second division of Maṇḍala I (I.12–23). So, just as the first hymn of IX  is ascribed to the poet of the first hymns of Maṇḍala I, the second hymn of IX is  said to have been composed by the poet of the second collection in I.
The hymn begins with the signature command “purify yourself” (pávasva), and  the first word of the second pāda belongs to the same root: pavítram, the “means  of purifying,” that is, the filter. The first verses in general follow the steps in the  preparation of soma after the pressing proper: the filtering of the pressed soma  (vs. 1), into a vessel (vs. 2) with water (vss. 3–4), followed by the mixing with milk  (vs. 4). This process is summarized in grandiose and cosmic terms in the following  two verses (5–6), with the verbal accompaniment, the hymns and prayers, intro
duced in verses 7–8. Verse 9 echoes the earlier part of the hymn, particularly verse  3, and the poet ends (vs. 10) with a description of all of Soma’s winnings, which  can be interpreted as a covert request for Soma to provide us with these items.
There is nothing particularly noteworthy or out of the ordinary in this hymn,  which could be taken as a prototypical Soma hymn.
### 1
Purify yourself across the filter at speed, Soma, pursuing the gods. As a bull, enter Indra, o drop.
### 2
Coil yourself toward great enjoyment, o drop, as the most
heaven-bright bull. Sit steadfast on your womb.
### 3
The stream of the pressed one, of the ritual adept, has milked out its  own dear honey.
Very resolute, he has clothed himself in the waters.
### 4
The great waters, the rivers, rush after you, the great one,
when you will clothe yourself with the cows.
### 5
The sea has been groomed in the waters—the prop and buttress of heaven, the soma in the filter, seeking us.
### 6
The tawny bull has bellowed; the great one, lovely to see like an ally, shines along with the sun.
### 7
O drop, the industrious songs are constantly groomed by your power, the songs by which you are (in turn) beautified for exhilaration.
### 8
We implore you, who make wide space, for ardent exhilaration.
To you belong great praise songs.
### 9
For us, o drop, while seeking Indra, purify yourself in a stream
of honey,
like rain-bearing Parjanya.
### 10
O drop, you are cow-winning, man-winning, horse-winning, and  prize-winning.
You are the ancient embodiment of the sacrifice.

Śunaḥśepa Ājiīgarti
10 verses: gāyatrī
Following the pattern set by IX.1–2, the Anukramaṇī gives as the poet of  this hymn the author of the third collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I  (24–30),  Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti, also the protagonist of the famous Aitareya Brāhmaṇa story  of father/son sacrifice (AiB VII.13–18), related during the Rājasūya, the Royal  Consecration.
The hymn is verbally unified by the “this (one)” (eṣá), which begins every verse.  It is thematically unified by its focus on only one step of the preparation, the filter ing through sheep’s wool that is the self-purification proper. A form of the verb  “purify oneself” appears in seven of the ten verses (and “filter” derived from the  same root in an eighth; only vss. 1 and 6 lack such a form). The poet provides vari ety with a range of images, from the bird of verse 1 to the chariot rider in verse 5,  and as is common he conflates, and equates, the ritual and cosmic spheres. So, for  example, the filter across which the soma moves is both a tangle of wool (vs. 2) and  the vast spaces of heaven and the atmosphere (vs. 7).
### 1
This god, the immortal, flies like a bird on the wing
toward the wooden cups to take his seat.
1238 IX.4
### 2
This god, created by poetic inspiration, streaks across the tangles (of  sheep’s wool)
purifying himself, impossible to deceive.
### 3
This god, the tawny one, purifying himself,
is groomed for the prize by the admiring (poets) who pursue the truth. 4. This one, like a champion traveling with his warriors,
strives to win all desirable things, while he purifies himself.
### 5
This god rides on a chariot; while he purifies himself, he shows his favor and makes manifest his noise.
### 6
This one, praised by the inspired poets, the god, plunges through the  waters,
establishing treasures for the pious man.
### 7
This one streaks through heaven, across the airy spaces in his stream, whinnying again and again as he purifies himself.
### 8
This one has now run through heaven, across the airy spaces, and  cannot be recaptured—
good at the rite as he purifies himself.
### 9
This one, pressed in the way of his ancient birth, the god pressed  for gods,
the tawny one, rushes into the filter.
### 10
And this one here, he of much authority, giving birth to refreshing  drinks while he is being born,
purifies himself in a stream when he is pressed.

Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
10 verses: gāyatrī
Once again, the poet of this fourth hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala is also the author  of the fourth collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I (I.31–35), as well as another Soma  hymn, IX.69.
The thematic constriction of the soma hymns is even narrower than usual in this  hymn. A third of each verse is occupied by the self-contained refrain (pāda c: áthā no vásyasas kr̥dhi “then make us better off”), and many of the verses consist of  short imperative clauses. There are local repetitions as well: the initial “win!” (sánā)  of verses 1–3, the repeated pāda about resolve and help in verses 5b–6a, and the  initial “rush” (abhy àrṣa) of verses 7–8. Only two verses (6, 9) lack an imperative,  and the former contains an optative in similar usage.
These conscious formal limits of the hymn are obviously its point: content is  secondary. One might note, however, that the sun’s light is especially desired (vss.  2, 5, 6). 1. Win, Soma, and conquer great fame, self-purifying one.
– Then make us better off.
### 2
Win light, win the sun, and all the gifts of good fortune, Soma.
– Then make us better off.
### 3
Win skill and resolve. Soma, strike away the scorners.
– Then make us better off.
### 4
Purifiers, purify soma for Indra to drink.
– Then make us better off.
### 5
Give us a share in the sun through your resolve and your help.
– Then make us better off.
### 6
Through your resolve and your help might we see the sun for a
long time.
– Then make us better off.
### 7
Rush, well-armed Soma, toward double-lofty wealth.
– Then make us better off.
### 8
Rush toward wealth, as the unbudgeable victor in battles.
– Then make us better off.
### 9
They have increased you with sacrifices at your expansion,
self-purifying one.
– Then make us better off.
### 10
Bring us glittering wealth in horses, o drop, through our whole lifetime. – Then make us better off.
The pattern of matches between the order of poets in the Maṇḍala I and that of  IX is broken by IX.5. The next twenty hymns (IX.5–24) are attributed to Asita  Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa, poets not otherwise found in the Anukramaṇī list  of R̥gvedic poets, though there are other poets with the patronymic Kāśyapa, as  well as Kaśyapa Mārīca, to whom a number of hymns, including several in IX, are  attributed.

5 (717) Āprı̄
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
11 verses: gāyatrī 1–7, anuṣṭubh 8–11
An interesting hybrid: the poet has taken the strict patterning of the Āprī hymns of  the animal sacrifice, in which each verse contains a key word or phrase (italicized  in translation) and the verses appear in the same order, and adapted it to the Soma  Pavamāna genre. The same key words are found in the same order, but they are  no longer directly addressed to or descriptive of a series of different divinities and  divinized ritual elements. Instead Soma is sometimes identified with the divinity
1240 IX.6
of the original Āprī verse (vss. 2, 7), or characterized by the epithet used for that  divinity (vss. 1, 3), or, most often, he manipulates the divinized element (vss. 4, 5,  10) or associates with the Āprī divinity at the sacrifice (vss. 6, 8, 9, 11). Each verse  contains a form of pávamāna “self-purifying” to anchor the Āprī structure to the  soma context.
### 1
Enkindled, the self-purifying lord shines forth in every direction,
giving pleasure, the ever-roaring bull.
### 2
As Tanūnapāt, the self-purifying one, sharpening his horns, rushes through the midspace, ever-shining.
### 3
Worthy to be invoked, the self-purifying one, heaven-bright wealth,  shines forth
with his streams of honey, with his strength.
### 4
The tawny self-purifying one, strewing the ritual grass toward the east  with his strength,
speeds as a god to the gods.
### 5
With their frames the golden Divine Doors open up aloft,
well praised by the self-purifying one.
### 6
The self-purifying one acts the bull to the two handsomely adorned  females, lofty and great,
Night and Dawn, like two (women) lovely to see.
### 7
Both gods who have the gaze of men, the two Divine Hotars, do  I summon—
the self-purifying one and Indra the bull.
### 8
Bhāratī, Sarasvatī, and Iḍā the great, the three goddesses of beautiful  ornaments,
will come here to this sacrifice of ours for the self-purifying one.
### 9
Tvaṣṭar, the first-born herdsman who journeys in advance, do
I summon here.
The drop is Indra, the tawny bull; the self-purifying one is Prajāpati.
### 10
O self-purifying one, with your honeyed stream anoint the Lord of the  Forest,
the tawny one with a thousand branches, blazing, golden.
### 11
All you gods, come here to the svāhā-cry of the self-purifying one: Vāyu, Br̥haspati, the Sun, Agni, and Indra, all of one accord.

6 (718) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Soma’s journey—to the gods, to Indra, and to us, as well as to the state of exhila ration and to material rewards—is the primary subject of this hymn. In the last two verses (8–9) Soma’s association with poetry and with the exercise of poetic  skill is mentioned. The last statement, that Soma takes to himself hymns, though  they are hidden, is not entirely clear, but it may refer to his ability to stimulate  poetic inspiration, and to cause poets to create new hymns from deep within  themselves.
Noteworthy is also the pun in verse 2, where the drop (índu) is urged to flow as  “Indra.” The phonological similarity between these two words is often exploited  elsewhere, indeed in the immediately preceding hymn (IX.5.9).
### 1
O Soma, as bull purify yourself in a gladdening stream as you seek  the gods,
as you seek us, in the sheep’s fleece.
### 2
Toward this exhilarating exhilaration, o drop, flow as “Indra”—
and toward prizewinning chargers.
### 3
Toward this ancient exhilaration rush into the filter as you are being  pressed,
and toward victory’s prize and fame.
### 4
In succession, the droplets, the drops, have run like waters down  a slope.
Being purified, they have reached Indra.
### 5
Whom the ten maidens groom like a prizewinning steed,
him playing in the wood(en vessel), beyond the sheep [=fleece],
### 6
That bullish sap—merge it with the cows, for exhilaration, for the gods’  pursuit—
the pressed soma for the taking.
### 7
The god for the god—pressed, he purifies himself in a stream
for Indra,
when he [=Indra] swells his milk.
### 8
The embodiment of the sacrifice, the pressed soma, having been pressed,  purifies himself at speed.
He protects the age-old poetic skill.
### 9
In just this way, as you are being purified and seeking Indra, for him to  pursue exhilaration, you most exhilarating one,
you make the hymns, though hidden, your own.

7 (719) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
The word “soma” does not appear at all in this hymn, and the epithet “self-purify ing” (pávamāna) only once, in verse 5 (a finite verb form from the same root is found  in vs. 8). Verses 1 and 8 have a similar structure, especially in their final pādas, and
1242 IX.8
form a ring, with the last verse (9) addressed not to soma but to the world-halves  and seemingly extra-hymnic. The two middle verses (4–5) contain the meat of the  hymn: Soma is depicted both as a poet (as in the previous hymn, IX.6.8–9) and a  successful king and warrior. The rest of the hymn (vss. 1–3, 6–8) depicts the usual  journey of the soma around the fleece filter and into the wooden vessel in which  he mixes with water. The final two verses of the hymn proper (7–8) name several  of the divine recipients of soma; those in verse 7 are especially associated with the  Morning Pressing.
### 1
The drops have surged along the path of truth, upon its foundation—the  very splendid ones,
recognizing its route.
### 2
Forth (goes) the stream, the forefront of the honey; it plunges through  the great waters,
to be extolled as the oblation among oblations.
### 3
Forth (he goes) as the forefront of speech, his yokemate; the bull has  roared down into the wood(en vessel),
toward his seat: he is the real rite.
### 4
When the poet, clothing himself in his poetic skills and manly powers,  rushes around (the fleece),
the racehorse strives to win the sun.
### 5
The self-purifying one sits over his opponents, like a king over the clans, when the ritual adepts set him in motion.
### 6
(Having circled) around the sheep’s fleece, the dear tawny one sits in the  wood(en vessels);
husky-voiced, he is eager to prevail with his thought.
### 7
He goes with his exhilaration to Vāyu, Indra, and the Aśvins,
with the joy that is in accord with his ordinances.
### 8
The waves of honey attract here through their purification Mitra and  Varuṇa, and Bhaga,
recognizing them through its powers.
### 9
You two World-Halves, for us to win the prize of honey, conquer wealth, conquer fame and goods.

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Although this hymn is, of course, dedicated to self-purifying Soma, the process is  repeatedly described in the passive (“being purified,” vss. 2, 3, 6) rather than in the  usual reflexive construction. However, this grammatical peculiarity does not seem  to deprive Soma of agency: he (or his juices) are urged to increase Indra’s power (vs. 1), provide us with power (vss. 2, 8), cause Indra to be generous to us (vs. 3) and  provide us with mortal patrons as well (vs. 7), remove hostilities (vs. 7), and cause  the rain to fall (vs. 8), among other things.
The middle verses (4–6) concern the preparation of soma; as usual, the materials  used in the preparation are animatized (vss. 5–6): the “ewes” are the fleece filter, the  “cows” and “cattle” the milk-mixture.
The first three verses reunite the group of gods to whom Soma went in the previ ous hymn (IX.7.7): Vāyu and the Aśvins (vs. 2) and Indra (vss. 1, 3), the principal  deities of the Morning Pressing.
### 1
These soma juices have flowed toward Indra’s own desire,
increasing his heroic power.
### 2
Being purified, finding a seat in the cups, going to Vāyu and the  Aśvins,
let them confer good heroic power on us.
### 3
O Soma, rouse the heart of Indra to generosity, as you are being purified to take your seat on the womb of truth.
### 4
Ten fingers groom you; seven insightful thoughts propel you.
Inspired poets have cheered you on.
### 5
For the gods, for their exhilaration, you who are surging through  the ewes
do we clothe with cows.
### 6
Being purified in the tubs, he, tawny and ruddy,
has wrapped himself in garments of cattle.
### 7
Attract bounteous patrons for us through your purification. Strike away  all hatreds.
O drop, enter your comrade.
### 8
Stream rain from heaven and heavenly brilliance from the earth.
Confer strength in battles on us, Soma.
### 9
Might we have a share in you, drawing the gaze of men, drunk by Indra,  finding the sun—
and a share in offspring and refreshment.

9 (721) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Unlike the relatively straightforward preceding hymns, this one is full of puz zles and ambiguities, with the implements and process of soma purification  compared to cosmic entities and actions. Some of the puzzles are illuminated  by the next hymn, IX.10, which is in some ways a more straightforward twin  to this one. This one also appears to be an omphalos hymn, with an inner ring1244 IX.9
defined by numerological repetition in verses 4 and 6, around the omphalos  verse 5.
On the ritual level, the soma is pressed between or in his two granddaughters  (vs. 1): most likely the hands of the priest, on the basis of IX.10.2; after his journey  (vss. 1–2), accompanied by hymns he is united with the waters (vss. 4–5), who make  him their eye. He is called upon to give aid to the ritual and to the hymn (vss. 7–8).
This synopsis leaves a number of questions unanswered. Who, for example, are  his two mothers in verse 3? Are they the same as his two female kinsmen in verse  1? Since R̥gvedic poets delight in paradoxical kinship relationships, this is certainly  possible. If so, they could be both the ritual implement (hands) and Heaven and  Earth, and in this latter cosmic manifestation their son Soma, who makes them  shine in verse 3, could be identified with the sun—an identification that is supported  by the “single eye” of verse 4. Again under a cosmic interpretation the rivers of  verse 4 can be not only the waters with which soma mixes in his ritual preparation,  but also the heavenly streams (and indeed real rivers).
The referents in the middle verses 4–6 are especially floating and uncertain: both  the insights and the rivers of verse 4 are feminine in gender. The agent of verse 5  (the omphalos verse) is feminine plural, and so could be either insights or rivers or  both, and “the great” is also left unspecified. In verse 6 we encounter “the seven”  again, which can either be the seven insights of verse 4 (which we also met in the  preceding hymn, IX.8.4) or the rivers, since the canonical number of rivers is seven.  This series of puzzles is capped by the final pāda of verse 6, with the impossible  word krívi, which seems here to refer to Soma. The goddesses whom he satisfies  could, again, be either the rivers or the insights (or perhaps even just goddesses).
The final three verses (7–9), with their requests, cause little difficulty, by contrast. Although the mysteries of the hymn remain largely unsolved, we can note a the matic strain that provides some unity: the issue of light and darkness. The Soma/
Sun of verse 3 lights up his mothers; he may also be the Sun in verse 4. In verse 7  we call upon Soma to help us combat darkness and in verse 8 to light up the lights.  The last word of the hymn (vs. 9) is “sun” (svàḥ). It seems that in this hymn Soma  is both identified with the Sun and seen as a force that can win and keep the light  that Vedic people so craved and worried about. This focus on the sun is also found  in the next hymn, IX.10.
### 1
The poet of heaven makes the circuit of his own vital powers, when  propelled between his two granddaughters
as he is being pressed—he who has a poet’s purpose.
### 2
You, delightful to the praiseworthy dwelling place, to the race without  deceit [=gods]—
rush ever forward in your most pleasing pursuit (of them).

He, their blazing son, made his two mothers shine—he just born and  they just born,
he the great and they the great, increasing through truth. 4. Propelled by seven insightful thoughts, he quickened the rivers without  deceit,

They installed the youth as dominating and indestructible for the great; they installed the drop, Indra, under your commandment.

The immortal draft-horse looks upon the seven as he draws.

Help us in our ritual arrangements, o male. The shades of darkness must  be fought, Soma.
You shall keep smiting them, o you who are being purified.

Now make the paths for our newer and newer hymn reach their goal. Make the lights light up as of old.

Self-purifying one, bestow great fame, the cow, and the horse along with  heroes.

10 (722) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn, which shares a number of themes with IX.9, begins with three verses  heavy with similes, quickly sketching the pressing, filtering, and mixing of the soma  juices. After a verse (4)  with no poetic figuration, the second part of the hymn  switches to metaphor, and especially to metaphors of and identifications with the  sun, as in IX.9. The spreading of the soma juices across the sheep’s fleece is likened  to suns and their rays (vs. 5). The “lone one” in verse 7 is probably both the soma  crossing the filter and the sun crossing heaven. Soma’s eye is first tied to the sun (vs.  8), and then the sun implicitly becomes his eye (vs. 9). In addition, the “portion” of  Vivasvant (“the one shining forth”) and of Dawn in verse 5 probably refers to the  radiance of these divinities, obtained by the soma juices, which are then transformed  into suns.
Other metaphors involve the poets and sacrificers: the doors of poetry (vs. 6), the  seven siblings of the priests (vs. 7), who are no doubt the seven inspired thoughts of  previous hymns (IX.9.4, 6; IX.8.4). This latter metaphor of kinship then provides  our own kinship relationship to Soma himself (vs. 8). One image remains somewhat  obscure: in verse 9 the “track of heaven” is said to have been placed in hiding by the  Adhvaryus. This must be a specific ritual reference, with the track of heaven being  likened to Soma’s own tracks—perhaps when Soma disappears into the fleece when  the Adhvaryu priests are first pressing him.
1246 IX.11
### 1
While being pressed, the soma juices, resounding like chariots, seeking  fame like chargers,
have marched forth for wealth.
### 2
Being propelled like chariots, they have run between the two hands (of  the priest).
Their takings are like those of decisive victors.
### 3
Like kings by encomia, the soma juices are anointed with cows,
like the sacrifice by its seven ordainers.
### 4
While resounding [/being pressed] for exhilaration with might and song,  the drops,
pressed, rush around in a stream.
### 5
Having obtained (the portion) of Vivasvant, begetting the portion  of Dawn,
the suns stretch out across the fine (fleece).
### 6
The ancient bards thrust open the doors of poetic thoughts—
the Āyus for the raging of the bull.
### 7
They sit all together, the Hotars with their seven siblings,
guiding the track of the lone one safely across.
### 8
He has bound his navel to our navel, as also his eye to the sun.
He has yielded progeny to the poet as milk.
### 9
Over his own dear (tracks) and the track of heaven, which was placed in  hiding by the Adhvaryus,
he looks with the eye of the sun.

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Much of this hymn consists of exhortations to the priests to perform their parts of  the soma preparation, interspersed with addresses to Soma to purify himself for  our benefit. Unlike the last few hymns attributed to the same poet, the language and  syntax present no difficulties, and there is almost no imagery or verbal figuration. It  is a no-nonsense production.
### 1
Sing to him, men, to the self-purifying drop,
as he seeks to attain the gods.
### 2
The Atharvan-priests have now mixed your milk with honey—
mixed the god for the god in seeking the gods.
### 3
Purify yourself as weal for our cow, weal for our people, weal for our  charger,
weal for our plants, o king. 4. Now, to the self-powerful brown one, to the ruddy one who touches  heaven,
to Soma, chant a song.
### 5
Purify the soma pressed with stones set in motion by the hands.
Rinse the honey in honey.
### 6
Just with homage approach it. Just with curds mix it.
Place the drop in Indra.
### 7
As the limitless smiter of foes, o Soma, purify yourself as weal for  our cow,
acting for the gods according to their desire.
### 8
You are poured around, Soma, for Indra to drink, for his exhilaration— perceiving thoughts as master of thought.
### 9
Self-purifying Soma, give us wealth and an abundance of heroes,
o drop, along with Indra as our yokemate.

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Although entirely focused on the process of soma preparation, this hymn displays  the common rhetorical inflation of this process by associating it with cosmic ele ments. Thus, for example, in verse 4 Soma is both “in the navel of heaven” and “in  the sheep’s fleece”—both referring to the filter; the “surface of the sea” in verse 6  is either the soma itself collected in the vessel or the water with which it mixes; the  “dear tracks of heaven” in verse 8 are the meanderings of soma through the fleece  filter (see also IX.10.9). The buffalo-cow in verse 3 is probably the hide on which the  pressing apparatus is set. Only in the last verse (9) does the poet make any requests  of the god.
### 1
The soma juices have surged, the drops pressed in the seat of truth, most honeyed for Indra.
### 2
The inspired poets have roared—like mother cows to their calf—
to Indra, to drink the soma.
### 3
Arousing exhilaration, attentive to poetic inspiration, he dwells in his  seat, in the wave of the river:
Soma is set upon the buffalo-cow.
### 4
In the navel of heaven, he, wide-gazing, shows his greatness in the sheep’s  fleece:
Soma, who is a poet with good purpose.
### 5
The soma that is in the tubs, that is placed within the filter,
that does the drop embrace.
1248 IX.13
### 6
The drop sends forth his speech upon the surface of the sea,
quickening the cask dripping with honey.
### 7
The lord of the forest who has praise as his own, yielding the juice of  insights within (the filter),
propelling the human generations,
### 8
Being himself propelled, Soma rushes toward the dear tracks of heaven, the sage poet, with the stream of an inspired poet.
### 9
Self-purifying one, secure wealth of a thousand lusters
close at hand to us, o drop.

9 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse, with its mention of Vāyu and Indra, identifies this as the first soma offering of the day. Otherwise the hymn is a confection of clichés familiar from  many other soma hymns.
### 1
As he is being purified, Soma rushes in a thousand streams beyond the  sheep [=fleece]
to his encounter with Vāyu and Indra.
### 2
You who are seeking help, sing forth to the self-purifying inspired poet, who has been pressed to pursue the gods.
### 3
The thousand-faceted soma juices purify themselves to win the prize, being hymned to pursue the gods.
### 4
And for us to win the prize, by purifying yourself (bring) lofty
refreshments
and a heaven-bright abundance of heroes, o drop.
### 5
By purifying themselves, let them bring thousandfold wealth and an  abundance of heroes for us—
the divine drops being pressed.
### 6
Like racehorses being driven on by their drivers, they have surged to win  the prize—
swift across the sheep’s fleece.
### 7
Bellowing like cows to their calf, the drops rush.
They have run between the hands (of the priest).
### 8
Pleasing to Indra, exhilarating, constantly roaring—o self-purifying one, strike away all hatreds.
### 9
Striking away the non-givers, purifying yourselves, looking like the sun, sit on the womb of truth. IX.14 (726) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
8 verses: gāyatrī
The poet of this hymn seems to be practicing his figurative language, presenting us in  nonsequential verses with several different versions of the same step in the prepara tion of soma. This is especially clear in his depiction of the manual manipulation of  soma: in verse 2 the hands are called “troops of five kinsmen,” in verse 5 the same  fingers are “the granddaughters of Vivasvant” (here the prototype sacrificer), and  in verse 7 a standard word for “fingers” finally makes its appearance. Similarly he  gives two quite similar expressions for the mixing with milk, both using the image  of clothing (vss. 3, 5), and in verse 6 there is a glancing reference to Soma’s desire  for cows.
The episodic structure of the hymn also seems reflected in the shifting tenses of  the verbs. In particular, the past tense of verse 3ab seems to follow directly from  verse 1, with the presents of verses 2 and 3c in alternation.
### 1
The poet flowed around and forth, set upon the swell of the river,
bringing the decisive action for which many are eager.
### 2
When the troops of five kinsmen [=hands], eager to work,
prepare the steadfast one with a hymn—
### 3
After that, all the gods found exhilaration in the juice of him, the  tempestuous one—
when he clothes himself with cows.
### 4
Spilling over, he runs out, leaving behind the stems that belong to  his body.
In this place here he slams together with his yokemate [=Indra].
### 5
He who, like a handsome youth, has been groomed by the
granddaughters of Vivasvant [=fingers],
making the cows like a garment,
### 6
With a yen for cows, he goes crossways along the fine prop [=fleece]. He raises the call that he knows as his own.
### 7
The fingers have come together to him, grooming the lord of
refreshment.
They have grasped the back of the prizewinning horse.
### 8
Ever embracing all good things, heavenly and earthly, o Soma,
seeking us, make your journey.

8 verses: gāyatrī
A simple device provides formal unity to this hymn: the form “this one” that begins  every verse. In the first six verses it is the nominative subject (eṣá), in the last two  (vss. 7–8) the accusative object (etám), so that there is some progression and devel opment, even while the referent remains constant.
Except for verse 2, the focus is entirely on Soma’s journey across the fleece and  into the cup, where both the waters (vs. 5) and the milk (vs. 6) await him. (The men tion of grasses in vs. 6 is unclear.)
### 1
This one drives with insight along the fine (fleece), a champion with his  swift chariots,
going to his encounter with Indra.
### 2
This one exercises his insight on many things for the divine assemblage on high, where the immortals have their seats.
### 3
This one, propelled, is led through and within (the filter) along the path of beauty, when the fervent thrust him on.
### 4
This one, the bull of the herd, sharpens his horns, ever shaking them, deploying his manly powers with his might.
### 5
This one, a prizewinning horse, speeds with his beautiful bright shoots, becoming the lord of the rivers.
### 6
This one, having journeyed along the “articulation” (of the fleece) toward  the “plodding goods” [=cows],
goes down into the grasses.
### 7
This one worthy of grooming do the Āyus groom in the wooden cups, when he has produced great refreshments.
### 8
This one here the ten fingers and the seven insights groom,
the most exhilarating one possessing good weapons.

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
8 verses: gāyatrī
This little hymn presents several difficulties of interpretation, even though like  many hymns in this series it does not deviate from the ritual scene, especially the fil tering of the pressed juice, and it is built around a limited verbal lexicon, especially  the phonological near mirror images √sr̥j “surge” and √r̥ṣ “rush.” In verse 1 Soma  is implicitly identified with Etaśa, the sun’s horse, and in verse 7 he swells “like the  back of heaven.” But otherwise cosmic references and comparisons are absent, and the soma again and again runs across the filter (vss. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) and joins with  the waters (vss. 2–3) and the milk (vss. 2 and 6), to furnish Indra’s drink (vss. 3, 5). The most problematic form is the hapax ánapta in verse 3, about which there is  no scholarly agreement. We have very tentatively connected it with naptī́ “grand daughter,” a very rare word that nonetheless appears twice in this poet’s collection  (IX.9.1, 14.5), used of the preparers of soma or their equipment.
### 1
The pressers pro(pel) your sap in their arms, for ardent exhilaration. Etaśa charges like a surge (of waters).
### 2
With resolve we accompany the charioteer of skill, who clothes himself  in waters along with his stalk,
the winner of cows, among the fine (tufts of fleece).
### 3
Send the soma surging into the filter, the one difficult to overtake in the  waters (even) without the granddaughters(’ preparation) [?].
Purify him for Indra to drink.
### 4
With attention Soma rushes forth into the filter of the one being purified; with resolve he has taken his seat.
### 5
Forth to you, Indra, the drops, the soma juices, have surged with
homage—
for the great taking of the decisive victor.
### 6
Being purified within the sheep’s shape, rushing toward all that is glorious, like a champion he stands among the cattle.
### 7
Having swelled like the back of heaven, the stream of the pressed  ritual adept
rushes at will into the filter.
### 8
You, Soma, (sending forth speech) attentive to poetic inspiration, being  purified in your full measure among the Āyus,
run through the sheep’s fleece.

A straightforward hymn: the soma juices flow quickly on their journey through the  filter into the vessels and thence to Indra and the gods, a journey compared to that  of the sun. The role of speech in the soma sacrifice is also emphasized, with soma  both inspiring speech and being strengthened by it.
### 1
Like rivers along a downward slope, smashing obstacles, turbulent, the swift soma juices have been sent surging.
### 2
As they are pressed, the drops, the soma juices, like rains to the earth, have flowed to Indra.
1252 IX.18
### 3
The exhilarating drink of exhilaration, the soma, rushes into the filter  beyond the waves,
smashing aside the demons, seeking the gods.

He runs into the tubs; he is poured around into the filter.
He grows strong through the hymns at the sacrifices.
### 5
You blaze beyond the three luminous realms like the (sun) ascending to  heaven, o Soma.
Sending forth (speech), you have spurred it on, like the sun.
### 6
The inspired poets, the bards, have roared to him at the head of the  sacrifice,
keeping the dear one in their sight.

The men, the inspired poets, seeking help, groom you, the prizewinning  horse,

7 verses: gāyatrī
The most salient feature of this hymn is its pāda-length refrain, promising health  and wholeness. The beginning (vs. 1) and end (vs. 7) of the hymn record the ritual  moment, the purification in the filter. The intermediate verses, especially 4–6,  ascribe human and then cosmic powers to the ritual substance. Verses 4–6 are  also syntactically unresolved, as they consist of three parallel relative clauses in  the ab pādas, couched in the 3rd person, interrupted by the refrain addressing  Soma in the 2nd person in the c pāda. The 3rd-person main clause that brings  closure to this structure is found in the final verse, 7ab.
It is noteworthy that the word “soma” is found only in the first verse.
### 1
Mountain-dwelling Soma, being pressed, has flowed around in the filter. – You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 2. You are the inspired one, you the sage poet, the honey that is born from  the stalk.
– You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 3. All the gods, joined in fellowship, have attained the drinking of you. – You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 4. He who holds all desirable good things in his two hands—
– You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 5. Who will yield milk like these two great world-halves, the two mothers  together—
– You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 6. Who on the same day rushes around both worlds with the prizes of  victory—
– You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration. 7. He, tempestuous in the tubs, kept roaring while being purified.
– You are the one who confers wholeness in the raptures of exhilaration.

This hymn contains fewer direct ritual references than recent hymns. The focus is  instead on the exchange relation between Soma and his praisers: hymns for goods,  an exchange that is seen as, literally, fecund. Our insights and the words they pro duce are depicted as females waiting to be impregnated (vs. 5) and made to swell (vs.  2), as they call to the bullish Soma for his semen (vs. 4). The impregnated thoughts  will give birth not only to inspired poetry, but also to the material goods that this  poetry will win, as verses 1 and 6 make clear. The final two verses (6–7) also call for  Soma’s help in besting rivals.
### 1
O Soma, what bright good thing, heavenly or earthly, is worthy of hymns, bring that here to us as you are being purified.
### 2
For you two, o Soma, you and Indra, are lords of the sun, lords of cattle. Showing your mastery, make our insights swell.
### 3
The bull, being purified among the Āyus, thundering upon the
ritual grass,
although being a fallow bay horse, has sat down on his womb.
### 4
Our insightful words have bellowed over the seed of the bull,
the mothers (over that) of the calf, their son.
### 5
Will he indeed set an embryo for those females yearning for a bull, as he  is being purified—
for those who give the gleaming milk?
### 6
Seek to win over those who stand aside, but set fear among our rivals. Self-purifying one, find wealth.

Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one is less concerned with the details of  the ritual (though they are not absent: the fleece filter, vss. 1, 7; the water and the  cups, vs. 6) than with the ritual economy, where, for example, our thought helps  purify Soma (vs. 3) and he in return finds wealth for the poets, singers, and patrons.  Although most of the phraseology is standard for soma hymns, the image in verse  5 of Soma entering the songs seems to be a deliberate reversal of passages in which  the songs themselves enter a god, and seems also to imitate and vary the numerous  passages in which Soma enters Indra.
### 1
Forth the poet rushes, through the sheep’s fleece, to pursue the gods, having prevailed over all opponents.
### 2
For he sends to the singers a prize of cattle
in thousands, as he purifies himself.
### 3
With your attention you embrace all things; you purify yourself with our  poetic thought.
Soma, you will find fame for us.
### 4
Rush toward lofty glory, toward enduring wealth for our generous  patrons.
Bring refreshment here to the praisers.
### 5
You well keep commandments like a king. You have entered the songs,  o Soma,
while being purified, o unerring draft-horse.

That draft-horse, difficult to overtake in the waters, being groomed in  (the priest’s) hands,

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāsyapa
7 verses: gāyatrī
For most of its length this hymn is a conventional depiction of the flowing of the  soma drops and of the benefits that attend it. Verses 5 and 6, however, which are  constructed in parallel, introduce twists of imagery. Addressed to the soma drops,  the verses urge them to instruct the ungenerous man—presumably a patron who does not distribute the appropriate priestly gifts at the soma sacrifice. In verse 6 the  drops are commanded to set their own will to this task, as a craftsman sets a new  chariot part, probably a wheel. In verse 5 they are meant to set “the tawny tracker”  in an unspecified being or thing (“in this one”); although the referents for both have  been variously identified, we believe that the tawny tracker is Soma himself, and  Indra, already mentioned in verse 1, is the desired location.
### 1
These are running for Indra, these drops, the ardent soma juices,
bringing exhilaration and finding the sun,
### 2
Warding off attackers, finding wide space for the presser,
by themselves creating vitality for the praiser.
### 3
Moving playfully at will toward one and the same seat,
the drops have flowed in various ways into the swell of the river.
### 4
These self-purifying ones have obtained all things of value,
when propelled like the team on a chariot.
### 5
O drops, set the tawny tracker [=Soma himself] here in him [=Indra], to  instruct (the man)
who does not give to us.
### 6
Like a craftsman [/R̥bhu] a new chariot (wheel), set your will to
instruct (him).
Purify yourselves to gleaming with your flood.

The hymn begins with the conventional image of the soma juices racing forward (vs.  1), but their journey soon becomes both cosmic and mystical. Their rush is com pared to cosmic forces in verse 2, and in verses 4–5 they travel through the cosmos  itself. But the poet reaches even further conceptually: he equates this cosmic jour ney with a ritual one. In matched expressions in verses 3 and 5 the juices pervade  not only the cosmic spaces (vs. 5) but also our “insights” (vs. 3), that is, the thoughts  that produce ritual poetry. And in verse 6 they reach a higher place than the cosmic
space, namely the sacrifice itself, symbolized, as often, by the stretched thread. In the final verse (7) this journey theme is abruptly abandoned, and the disjunc tion between this verse and what precedes is also conveyed by the switch from plural  (“soma juices”) to singular (“Soma”), and from 3rd-person reference to 2nd. It also  contains an implicit equation of Soma with (the unmentioned) Saramā, Indra’s dog
1256 IX.23
who reacquired for him the cows stolen by the Paṇis (see esp. X.108)—an equation  seemingly unmotivated by what precedes. (The Paṇis are mentioned only one other  time in the IXth Maṇḍala [IX.11.2].) Perhaps the cosmic journey of Soma reminded  the poet of Saramā’s long trek. The stretched thread of the sacrifice ends the hymn,  and brings it back to the ritual scene.
### 1
These swift soma juices have been propelled forward like prizewinning  chariots,
surges (of them) sent surging—
### 2
These, (surging) wide like the winds, like the rains of Parjanya,
(surging) at will like the flickerings of fire.
### 3
These purified soma juices, mixed with curds, attentive to poetic
inspiration,
have pervaded our insights with inspiration.
### 4
These immortal ones, once groomed, have not flagged in their flowing, as they seek to reach the paths through the airy space.
### 5
These, going forth widely, have pervaded the backs of the two
world-halves,
and this highest airy space.
### 6
They have reached the highest thread being stretched, along the inclines, and this one that is to be higher still.

You, Soma, secured from the Paṇis the good things of cattle.
You have roared toward the stretched thread.

Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
7 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn begins very like the last one, with the rushing of the soma juices, but  goes in a different direction. Verse 2 introduces the Āyus, men both of the past (so  vs. 2, also IX.10.6) and of the present, who are regularly credited with the prepara tion of the soma in the IXth Maṇḍala and by this very poet (IX.10.6, 15.7, 16.8,  19.3). But surprisingly in verse 4 the Āyus are identified with the soma juices, a  rhetorical strategy that must result from the fact that in this verse the juices purify  themselves into the exhilarating drink; in other words they prepare themselves and  therefore behave like the Āyus who prepare the soma.
In the last three verses (5–7) Soma’s relationship to Indra becomes the focus: in  verse 5 the rushing soma acquires the power of Indra as its essence, and in verses  6 and 7 this power is transferred to Indra, to perform his heroic deeds, both in the  past and in the present. Verse 7 thus harkens back to the ancient Āyus and their  newer path in verse 2. 1. The swift soma juices have surged forth in a stream of honey, of
exhilaration,
toward all our poems.
### 2
The ancient Āyus have marched along a newer track.
They have begotten the sun, for it to shine.
### 3
Bring here to us, self-purifying one, the patrimony of the impious stranger. Produce refreshments along with progeny.
### 4
The soma juices, the Āyus, purify themselves into the exhilarating drink  of exhilaration,
(going) toward the cask dripping with honey.
### 5
The soma rushes steadily, acquiring Indrian strength as its essence, affording good heroes, protecting against imprecations.
### 6
You purify yourself for Indra, o Soma, and for the gods as their shared  exhilaration.
O drop, you strive to win the prize.

Having drunk of it, of its exhilarating drinks, Indra smashed the
unopposable obstacles,
and he shall smash them now.

This hymn is the last attributed to Asita or Devala Kāśyapa, and yet again the hymn  begins with the running forth of the soma juices. It is an unremarkable hymn, but  covers the major topics, though not in strict chronological order:  the grooming  in water (vs. 1), the mixture with milk (vs. 2), the filtering (vss. 3, 5). That soma is  Indra’s drink is repeatedly emphasized (vss. 2, 3, 5, and under the qualifier “con
queror of territories,” a word regularly applied to Indra, vs. 4). Soma himself is  given the most characteristic of Indra’s epithets—“obstacle-smasher”—in the  superlative in verse 6.
### 1
The soma juices have run forth, the self-purifying drops.
Brought to readiness, they have been groomed in the waters.
### 2
The cows have run toward them, like waters going along a slope.
Becoming purified, they have reached Indra.

You run forth, self-purifying Soma, for Indra to drink.
Held by men, you are led through (the filter).

Bringing exhilaration to superior men, o Soma, purify yourself for the  one who conquers the territories,

6 verses: gāyatrī
This is the only hymn in the R̥gveda attributed to this poet, though his patronymic  connects him to Agastya, the poet of a number of hymns in the late Ist Maṇḍala  (I.165–91)—including the dialogue hymn I.165, in which Agastya mediates between  Indra and the Maruts, who demand a share of the soma sacrifice. This connection  may account for the mention of the Maruts in verse 1 as recipients of soma, along  with Vāyu: the Maruts are quite scarce in the Soma Maṇḍala.
The hymn is otherwise unremarkable, though one might note the insistent iden tification of Soma as a kaví (“poet,” vss. 3, 5, 6).
### 1
Purify yourself, as the one who brings skill to realization, for the gods to  drink, o tawny one,
the exhilarating drink for the Maruts and for Vāyu.
### 2
Self-purifying one, sped by insight, ever roaring toward your womb, enter Vāyu according to the (ritual) statute.
### 3
The bull becomes beautiful together with the gods, the dear poet in  his womb,
the smasher of obstacles, best pursuer of the gods.
### 4
Entering into all forms, becoming purified, the delightful one journeys to where the immortals have their seats.
### 5
Ruddy Soma, giving birth to songs, purifies himself, attended by the Āyus, going to Indra with a poet’s purpose.
### 6
Purify yourself in a stream in the filter, you most exhilarating poet, to sit in the womb of chant.

Idhmavāha Dārḍhacyuta
6 verses: gāyatrī
Attributed to a descendant of the poet of the previous hymn, based on his patronymic,  this hymn contains nothing novel in terms of content, but it is tightly structured. All verses but the last begin with “that one, him” (tám) referring to the Soma, while the  last begins with a 2nd-person variant on this, “you” (táṃ tvā), literally “that you.”  The last four verses (3–6) all contain a 3rd plural “they impell(ed)” (ahyan, hinvanti built to the same root √hi), and the compounds of 3c and 5c “...to/of many” (bhū́ri)  phonologically echo the word for “arms” (bhuríjor) in the middle verse (4a).
### 1
Him have the inspired poets groomed—the prizewinner in the lap  of Aditi,
through the fine (fleece) and with insight.
### 2
Him have the cows lowed toward, the imperishable one of a thousand  streams,
the drop, supporter of heaven.
### 3
Him, the ritual adept, have they impelled through their wisdom—the one  purifying himself in heaven,
steadfast, giving nurture to many.
### 4
Him have they impelled between the two arms with the insight of  Vivasvant, him who is also clad in it,
the undeceivable lord of speech.
### 5
Him do the siblings [=fingers] impel with the stones on the back (of the  filter)—the tawny one,
delightful, drawing the gaze of many.
### 6
You, self-purifying one, grown strong through song [/on the mountain],  do the ritual adepts impel
as exhilaration for Indra, o drop.

Nrmedha ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Though attributed to a different poet and a different poetic lineage, this hymn,  like the last one (IX.26), is unified by a repeated initial pronoun in every verse, in  this case “this one, he” (eṣá) referring to Soma. Again, the content is conventional,  though there is emphasis on Soma’s victories and acquisitions (vss. 1, 2, 3, 4) and  his successful competition with the sun (vss. 2, 5). The cosmic aspect of Soma is  thus raised but not insisted upon.
### 1
This one, the much-praised poet, spills over into the filter,
striking away failures, while being purified.
### 2
This one, winning the sun, is poured all around for Indra and Vāyu in the filter, the one who brings skill to realization.
### 3
This one is led through (the filter) by men—the head of heaven, the bull,  the pressed
soma in the wooden (vessels), acquiring [/knowing] all.
1260 IX.28–29
### 4
This one, purifying himself, has roared, seeking cows, seeking gold— the drop, winning completely, not to be laid low.
### 5
This one races with the sun while purifying himself in heaven—
in the filter he is the exhilarating drink of exhilaration.
### 6
This one, the tempestuous tawny bull, has flowed in the midspace,
toward Indra—the drop as it is becoming purified.

Priyamedha Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Attributed to another Āṅgirasa, whose given name is similar to the poet of the last  hymn (IX.27), this follows the same pattern, with initial “he, that one” (eṣá) opening  every verse. Otherwise it is constructed of the usual clichés, though the rhetoric is  nicely balanced.
### 1
This one, the prizewinner propelled by men, all-knowing as the lord  of mind,
runs through the sheep’s fleece.
### 2
This one has flowed into the filter, the soma pressed for the gods,
entering all their domains.
### 3
This one, an immortal god, beautifies himself in his womb,
the smasher of obstacles, best pursuer of the gods.
### 4
This one, the ever-roaring bull, held by the ten siblings [=fingers],
runs to the wooden cups.
### 5
This one, self-purifying, boundless, made the sun shine,
as the all-knowing one (knowing) all the domains.
### 6
This one, tempestuous, undeceivable Soma, rushes while being purified, pursuing the gods, smashing those who utter evil.

Nrmedha ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Another short and conventional hymn, with a focus on winning goods and con quering enemies (esp. vss. 3–5). It is attributed to the same poet as IX.27.
### 1
His streams have flowed forth, those of the pressed bull, who with his  strength
attends upon the gods in sequence. 2. The ritual adepts groom the team—the bards singing with their song the one born as the light worthy of hymns.
### 3
These things are easy to conquer for you as you become purified, o Soma  providing outstanding goods.
Increase the sea that is worthy of hymns.
### 4
Winning all good things, purify yourself in a stream, Soma.
Drive hostilities to a single end.
### 5
Protect us well from the non-giver, from the mere sound of any such a one, when we have become free of insult.
### 6
O drop, in purifying yourself in a stream attract earthly and heavenly  wealth.
Bring here your brilliant tempestuous force.

30 (742) Soma Pavamāna
Bindu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn is very like the opening verse of IX.29, and it is con structed of the usual building blocks of soma hymns, particularly those in gāyatrī meter. It clusters especially closely with the three hymns that precede it: these four  hymns (IX.27–30) are all attributed to poets with the patronymic Āṅgirasa, and all  four contain at least one form of śúṣma “tempestuous force” or śuṣmín “tempestu ous” (IX.27.6; 28.6; 29.6; 30.1, 3), mostly in the final verse. This word thus seems  to be the signature of this little group of poets. (The word does not pattern closely  with other Āṅgirasa poets, even in the IXth Maṇḍala.)
### 1
His streams have flowed forth, those of the tempestuous one, into the  filter at will.
While becoming purified, he sends out his speech.
### 2
The drop, being impelled by the pressers, being groomed, ever roaring, raises a call appropriate to Indra.
### 3
Attract for us tempestuous force that can overcome men, much-craved  force consisting of heroes,
when you purify yourself in a stream, o Soma.
### 4
Soma, purifying himself in a stream, has flowed forth, beyond (the filter), to the wooden cups to take his seat.
### 5
They impel you, the most honeyed tawny one, in the waters with their  stones,
for Indra to drink, o drop.
### 6
Press the most honeyed soma for Indra who bears the mace,
the dear, exhilarating one for his warrior band.
1262 IX.31–32
## 31 
31 (743) Soma Pavamāna
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Another unremarkable gāyatrī hymn. Parallel constructions and phraseol ogy (e.g., the fronted “for you” [túbhyam] in vss. 3, 5, the fronted “be/become”  [bhávā] of vss. 2, 4) give a sense of unity. Unlike many soma hymns, where the  finale delivers the soma to Indra (e.g., the final verses of nearby hymns such as  IX.23.6–7, 26.6, 27.6, 30.6), here it is “we” who declare our desire for his pres ence and partnership (vs. 6).
The poet, Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, is also the composer of a soma hymn in the first  maṇḍala, I.91, and verse 4 in this hymn is identical to I.91.16, which occurs in a  triad of ritually connected verses.
### 1
The self-purifying soma juices have marched forth rich in purpose. They make wealth manifest.
### 2
Become the increaser of brilliance from heaven and from earth, o drop; become the lord of prizes.
### 3
For you rush the favoring winds, for you the rivers.
O Soma, they increase your greatness.
### 4
Swell here, and let bullish power come together for you from all
sides, Soma.
Be at the gathering for the prize.
### 5
For you, o brown one, the cows have yielded imperishable ghee
and milk
upon the highest back.
### 6
You—who have good weapons, who are really present, o lord of
creation—
we want your fellowship, o drop.
## 32 
32 (744) Soma Pavamāna
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Although this hymn begins with the almost ubiquitous journeying forth of the  soma juices (see, e.g., the first verses of IX.10, 17, 20, 24, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 41, 44,  all beginning, like this, with prá “forth” followed by a verb of motion somewhere in  the verse), it breaks the pattern of the recent collections of Soma clichés, especially  with the cascade of similes in verses 3–5. This expert handling of the constricted  form of gāyatrī soma hymns may lend credence to the Anukramaṇī’s attribution to  Śyāvāśva Ātreya, the ingenious poet of the Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V. 1. The soma juices, arousing exhilaration, pressed at the rite, have
marched forth
for the fame of our benefactor.
### 2
Then the maidens of Trita [=fingers] impel him, the tawny one, with the  stones,
the drop for Indra to drink.
### 3
Then, just as (the lead) wild goose (sets) its flock (to honking), he has  made the thought of everyone bellow.
Like a steed he is anointed [/driven together] with the cows.
### 4
O Soma, looking down on both (worlds?), like a great wild bird launched  in flight you rush,
settling down on the womb of truth.
### 5
The cows have lowed to him, like a young woman to her dear lover. He has gone to (them?) as to a contest that has been set.
### 6
Destine brilliant glory for us, both for our benefactors and for me— wisdom and fame as our winnings.
## 33 
33 (745) Soma Pavamāna
Trita Āptya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Once again the hymn begins with the soma flowing forth. There is, however, less  emphasis on the physical process of purification, and more on the sounds that  accompany it: verse 4 introduces three voices, which may be the three types of ritual  speech, the r̥c, yajus, and sāman familiar from later śrauta ritual, or may refer to the  priestly formulations (5a), the bellowing of the cows (4b), and the roar of the rush
ing soma itself (4c). The theme continues in verse 5, which also highlights “truth,”  found in verse 2 as well.
The hymn is bookended by watery references: the simile of the waves of water  in verse 1 returns in the final verse (6) as the seas of wealth that soma will produce  for us.
### 1
Forth go the soma juices, attentive to poetic inspiration, like waves of the  waters,
to the wooden (cups) like buffaloes to the woods.
### 2
To the wooden cups they have flowed, brown and gleaming, in a stream  of truth,
to the prize of cows.
### 3
Pressed for Indra and Vāyu, for Varuṇa and the Maruts,
for Viṣṇu, the soma juices rush.
### 4
The three voices rise up, the milk-cows bellow,
and the tawny one goes ever roaring.1264 IX.34
### 5
The sacred formulations, youthfully exuberant mothers of truth, have  lowed to him.
They keep grooming the child of heaven.
### 6
Four seas of wealth for us, Soma, from every direction,
in the thousands—bring these in purifying yourself.
## 34 
34 (746) Soma Pavamāna
Trita Āptya
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn begins with the usual rushing forth of the soma, but achieves an unusual  ring, since in the last verse (6)  it is the songs that rush (using the same verb,  arṣa(n)ti) to him. What lies between is, for the most part, unremarkable. Verse 2  lists the recipients of the soma, a longer list than usual (and a verse almost identical  to vs. 3 in the previous hymn, IX.33), and verses 3–4 concern the preparation of  the drink. However, verse 5 is difficult: the Maruts milk for themselves (or yield as  their milk) the oblation in the direction of “the upper surface of truth.” Although  in the context of the hymn, soma should be the product of milking (see vs. 3), the  liquid the Maruts ordinarily milk is rain. Moreover, “the upper surface of truth”  is a puzzling phrase, which occurs elsewhere only in the mystical and baffling Vena  hymn (X.123.2). Since the latter hymn seems to concern the mystical identification  between soma and the sun, it is likely that here too we have double reference, with  the ritual substance soma assimilated to the cosmic fecundator, the rain, and “the  upper surface of truth” referring both to the soma filter and to heaven (or the res ervoir of rain in heaven).
### 1
Being pressed, being impelled, the drop rushes forth in its full measure in  a stream,
shattering the fastnesses by its might.
### 2
Pressed for Indra and Vāyu, for Varuṇa and the Maruts,
for Viṣṇu, the soma rushes.
### 3
The bull controlled by bulls, the soma, do they press with stones.
They milk out its milk with their skill.
### 4
It becomes the one for Trita to groom; it becomes the drink of
exhilaration for Indra.
The tawny one is anointed with the forms (of milk).
### 5
They whose mother is Pr̥śni [=Maruts] milk for themselves the cherished  oblation dearest to them
toward the upper surface of truth.

These unswerving songs, flowing together, rush to him.
Bellowing, he has made the milk-cows bellow.

6 verses: gāyatrī
Soma as the source and support of wealth and as ally in conflict is the theme of this  hymn, which is characterized by pleasing etymological figures (e.g., vss. 3, 4, 6) and  variant repetitions (e.g., vss. 2 + 5).
### 1
Bringing broad wealth for us, o self-purifying one, purify yourself in  a stream
with which you will find the light for us.
### 2
You drop who set the sea to swaying, who set all in motion, purify  yourself
as the supporter of our wealth with your strength.
### 3
With you as hero, you possessor of heroes, might we overcome those who  give battle.
Stream toward us what is choice.
### 4
The drop sends forth (its speech), the prizewinning seer seeking to win  the prize,
finding his commandments to be his weapons.
### 5
Him who sets speech to swaying do we clothe with songs as he is being  purified—
Soma, the herdsmaster of the people.

Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn begins with a noble image of Soma as a racehorse racing to the finish,  and the second verse contains another equine comparison, though with a more  lowly type of horse. This theme is abandoned until the final verse (6), when Soma  goes seeking horses for the worshipers. The hymn is otherwise a fairly standard  soma hymn, though one might note that the connection of soma with light made in  the previous hymn (attributed to the same poet), IX.35.1, is also found here in verse  3. Also, every verse but the last contains a form derived from the root pū “purify,”  always pāda-initial.
1266 IX.37
### 1
He has been let loose like a chariot-horse into the filter, pressed into the  two cups.
The prizewinner has stepped upon the finish-line.

As wakeful draft-horse, o Soma, purify yourself, pursuing the gods,  beyond (the filter),
toward the cask dripping with honey.
### 3
O age-old self-purifying one, make the lights shine forth for us;
impel us toward will, toward skill.

Being beautified by those who seek truth, being groomed in the
two hands,

All goods for the pious man—heavenly, earthly, and those of the

37 (749) Soma Pavamāna
Rahūgaṇa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Several overt devices provide unity to this hymn: each verse begins with sá “he,”  and each verse but 4 contains a verb of motion (“rush, run, flow”) expressing the  journey of the soma through the filter and into the cups for Indra. In addition to  the mundane details of the preparation, however, the hymn makes cosmic claims for  the ritual actions. The sheep’s fleece of verse 3 also stands for “the luminous realms  of heaven”; in verse 5 Soma finds a wide realm, usually a symbol of freedom and  the acquisition of territory.
Verse 4, the pause on the journey, has been much discussed, and its various  phrases, “on the back of Trita,” “along with (his) relatives,” also given cosmic ref erents (though there is no scholarly agreement on just what they are). We are of  the opinion, however, that it primarily concerns the ritual preparation: the “back  of Trita” is the filter and the “relatives” (jāmí) are, as usual in a soma context, the  fingers of the officiant, namely Trita (see “Trita’s maidens,” the fingers, in the next  hymn, IX.38.2). It is this ritual preparation that allows the cosmic act of Soma,  making the sun shine (at the Morning Pressing), in that same verse (4).
### 1
He, the bullish soma, pressed for drinking, rushes into the filter,
smashing aside the demons, seeking the gods.
### 2
He, the tawny one, wide-gazing, rushes steadily into the filter,
continually neighing toward his womb. 3. He, the prizewinner, self-purifying, runs through the luminous realms of  heaven,
through the sheep’s fleece, as demon-smasher.
### 4
He, purifying himself on the back of Trita along with Trita’s kin
[=fingers],
has made the sun shine.
### 5
He, the Vr̥tra-smasher, the bull, finding the wide realm when pressed,  undeceivable—
Soma has flowed as if to a prize.
### 6
He, the god impelled by the poet, runs to the wooden cups—
the drop with his munificence for Indra.

Like the previous hymn, attributed to the same poet, this hymn is unified by the  repetition of a pronominal phrase at the beginning of every verse (eṣá syá “this  very one,” except for vs. 2, which has only the first pronoun). It, too, concerns  Soma’s journey through the filter (especially the first and last verses, 1 and 6) and  his manipulation by the officiant’s fingers (vss. 2, 3). The hymn is enlivened by meta
phors and similes, particularly those of verse 4.
### 1
This very one, a bull, a chariot, rushes through the sheep’s fleece,
going to the thousandfold prize.
### 2
This tawny one do the maidens of Trita [=fingers] impel with the stones, the drop for Indra to drink.
### 3
This very one do the ten tawny ones keep grooming, hard at work, those by whom he is beautified for exhilaration.
### 4
This very one settles among the human clans like a falcon (on a nest), going like a swain to a maiden.

Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn is structured as a ring of sorts: it begins and ends with quoted direct  speech, uttered by unidentified speakers but most likely priests. In verse 1 Soma  makes his journey through the filter to the place on the ritual ground where the  gods await their oblation. When he arrives there in verse 6, the priests order him to  take his seat. In between, Soma’s journey involves travel in both ritual and cosmic  space (see esp. vss. 2, 4).
### 1
You of lofty thought, swiftly rush around through your dear domain, to where they will say “(here are) the gods.”
### 2
Preparing what was not fully prepared, arranging the refreshments for  the people,
stream the rain from heaven all about.
### 3
Pressed, he goes into the filter, taking on vibrancy with his strength, gazing widely, producing wide illumination.
### 4
Here he is—the one with a rapid course who has flowed widely from  heaven into the filter,

Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn begins with a martial theme that is not developed in what follows. Instead,  beginning with verse 3, the focus is on the wealth that Soma will bring us, and the  repetition of vocabulary in these four verses induces a sense of claustrophobia,  with the same elements recycled: “o Soma,” “o drop,” “purifying,” “bring us,” and  “wealth.” Although claustrophobia is to some extent endemic to the IXth Maṇḍala,  most hymns make some attempt to vary the lexicon and phraseology.
### 1
Becoming purified, the limitless one has attacked all the scorners.
They [=poets] beautify the inspired poet with their inspired thoughts. 2. The ruddy one has mounted to the womb; the bull, when pressed, will go  to Indra.
He sits in the steadfast seat. 3. Now for us, o drop, for us all all around, o Soma, attract great wealth in thousands, in purifying yourself.
### 4
O self-purifying Soma, o drop, bring all brilliant things hither;

Medhyātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn and the next two (IX.41–43) are attributed to Medhyātithi Kāṇva,  the poet of several hymns in Maṇḍala VIII (VIII.1, 3, 33), who names himself  in IX.43.3. This hymn begins strikingly, with an incomplete sentence describing  the stampede of a wild mob, against the “black skin,” presumably the Dasyu  referred to in verse 2. The constituents of the mob are not identified, but are  presumably the soma juices, here mobilized against the non-Ārya enemy. The  second verse rewrites this scene more tranquilly, though with the victory over  the Dasyu more explicit. But the violence of Soma’s purificatory journey returns  in verse 3.
The second half of the hymn is more conventional, though with Soma’s cosmic  associations clear in the last two verses (5–6).
### 1
Those who strode forth like cattle—frenzied, turbulent, unruly,
smashing away the black skin [=Dasyus]—
### 2
We will bring to mind the easy passage (of Soma), beyond the snare  difficult to navigate [=the curly fleece filter],
we having overcome the Dasyu who follows no commandment.
### 3
A roar like that of rain is heard—the roar of the self-purifying
tempestuous one.
Lightning flashes roam in heaven.
### 4
O drop, in purifying yourself attract great refreshment and wealth in  cattle, in gold,
in horses, and in prizes, when you are pressed.
### 5
Purify yourself, limitless one. Fill the two great world-halves
as Dawn does, as the sun does with its rays.

O Soma, flow for us in a protecting stream all around on all sides, like (the heavenly river) Rasā, along the upper surface (of the filter).

Medhyātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
The double affiliation of Soma with the ritual and cosmic realms leads off the  hymn: in verse 1 he performs major cosmogonic deeds while participating in his  ritual preparation, mixing with milk and being washed in water. This twofold theme  continues through the hymn, as, for example, in verse 4 where Soma begets the gods  while being poured in the filter. The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a wish for the same  material benefits found in the preceding hymn, IX.41.4.
### 1
Begetting the luminous realms of heaven, begetting the sun in the waters, clothing himself in cows, in the waters—the tawny one—
### 2
He, by means of an age-old thought, a god from among the gods,
purifies himself in a stream, when pressed.
### 3
For the ever-increasing victor [=Indra] to win the prize, they purify  themselves—
the thousand-faceted soma juices.
### 4
Milking out his age-old milk, he is poured around into the filter.
Roaring, he has begotten the gods.
### 5
Toward all desirable things, toward the gods who become strong through truth. Soma rushes while he is being purified.

In this last hymn attributed to Medhyātithi, he is at particular pains to draw atten tion to the importance of the poet’s role in the preparation of the soma. Not only  does he name himself in verse 3, but the first three verses emphasize the clothing  (vs. 1), beautification (vs. 2), and adornment (vs. 3) of Soma with hymns. In the  final verse (6) he asks for a proper recompense for the poet (that is, himself) who  produces these hymns.
### 1
The one who is groomed like a steed with cows [=milk], for exhilaration,  the delightful one—
him do we clothe with hymns.
### 2
Him do all our hymns, seeking aid, beautify in the ancient way—

Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The poet of the next three hymns (IX.44–46) seems to owe his Anukramaṇī identifi cation to the word ayā́sya “irrepressible” in the first verse of this first hymn, where it  is applied to Soma. Insofar as there is a theme in this hymn, it is Soma’s relation to  the gods (vss. 1, 3, 5) and his intermediary role between the gods and us, especially  us poets (vss. 2, 5).
### 1
O drop, you rush forth for our great extension, like (a river) bearing a wave, irrepressible, toward the gods.
### 2
Soma is impelled in the distance, delighted by the thought, impelled by  the insight
of the inspired poet—(Soma himself) a sage poet—in a stream.

Purify yourself for us, seeking prizes, making the dear ceremony your own. The one with the ritual grass [=priest] seeks to lure (you) here.
### 5
He whose heroes are poets, growing ever stronger for Bhaga, for Vāyu— Soma will guide us to the gods.

You who find the will, who best find the way—in order to give us goods today, win the prize and lofty praise.

45 (757) Soma Pavamāna
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn is defined by a thematic ring: Soma has his gaze on men in verse 1 and in  the final verse (6) he gazes out on the reward he gives to his human praiser. Soma,
1272 IX.46
as usual, goes on his purificatory journey through the filter (vss. 1–2) and is mixed  with milk (vs. 3), but unlike many of the recent soma hymns, this one also focuses  on the stage beyond the filter, with striking images in verses 4 and 5.
### 1
Having your gaze on men, purify yourself for exhilaration, for the  pursuit of the gods,
o drop, and for Indra to drink.
### 2
Rush on your mission for us—you spill out for Indra—
rush to the gods for us, your comrades, at will.
### 3
And we anoint you, the ruddy one, with cows for exhilaration.
Open up the doors for wealth for us.
### 4
He has stepped beyond the filter, like a prize-seeking (horse) the
chariot-pole on its course.
The drop plays the lord among the gods.
### 5
His comrades cried out in unison to him as he was playing in the
wood(en vessel), beyond the sheep [=fleece].
To the drop the roars have roared.
### 6
Purify yourself in that stream in which, once drunk, you will gaze out upon an abundance of heroes for your praiser, o drop.

46 (758) Soma Pavamāna
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn surveys some familiar themes, particularly the role of the fingers in prepar ing the soma (vss. 4, 6), though it is perhaps noteworthy that the filter, so prominent in  many soma hymns, is not explicitly present here. In contrast, some qualities of soma  known from elsewhere that are rarely or never mentioned in the IXth Maṇḍala make  their appearance—in particular his source in the mountains (vs. 1) and in verse 4 the  technical distinction between “pure” (that is, unmixed) soma (śukrá) and soma with  grain stirred in (manthín, a word otherwise only found once elsewhere in the R̥gveda  [III.32.2]). (In the later śrauta ritual, cups of śukra and manthin soma form both a  ritual and a grammatical pair, in the dual dvandva compound śukrā-manthinau, here  found in discontinuous form.) The gods Vāyu (vs. 2) and Indra (vss. 3, 6), recipients  of the first soma oblations at the Morning Pressing, are named. Verse 2 contains a  striking image of the soma drops adorned like a girl for marriage.
### 1
They have been released to pursue the gods, like steeds that get results, flowing, grown strong in the mountains.
### 2
The drops, adorned like a maiden with her patrimony,
the soma drinks have been released to Vāyu. 3. These soma juices, the drops, dispensing delight when pressed in the cup, strengthen Indra along with the (ritual) activities.
### 4
Rinse it, you (fingers) of good hands; grasp the two (soma drinks), the  stirred and the pure.
Mix the exhilarating one with cows.
### 5
Purify yourself, you winner of stakes, as provider of great bounty and as pathfinder for us, o Soma.
### 6
The ten fingers groom this one worth grooming, the self-purifying exhilarating drink of exhilaration for Indra.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
The next three hymns (IX.47–49) are attributed to Kavi Bhārgava, to whom the  Anukramaṇī also credits the five Jagatī hymns IX.75–79. The Soma of this hymn is  distinctly militant, using the power he has acquired (vs. 1) to destroy the Dasyus (vs.  2) and win spoils, as Indra’s very mace (vss. 3, 5). But the same Soma is both a poet  (vs. 4) and a recipient of poetry (vs. 3), who facilitates the human poet’s acquisition  of treasure from his patron (vs. 4).
### 1
Through this good ritual performance Soma has waxed strong even over  the great ones.
Becoming exhilarated, he up and acts the bull.
### 2
His deeds done and to be done, crushing the Dasyus, are conspicuous, and the bold one exacts recompense for debts.
### 3
Then Soma, the sap destined for Indra, becomes a mace winning
thousands,
when a hymn is born for him.
### 4
Himself a sage poet, he seeks a treasure for the inspired poet at (the  hands of) the distributor,
as he keeps grooming his insightful thoughts.

Desirous of winning riches, as of winning chargers at prize-contests, you are among those who are victorious in the raids.1274 IX. 48–49

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
The poet begins his hymn with a request for benefit, though a rather generic one (vs.  1). The militant theme of the previous hymn is visible in verse 2, while the story of  the falcon’s theft of Soma from heaven, a myth not prominent elsewhere in Maṇḍala  IX, is the subject of verses 3–4. Unlike most of the gāyatrī soma hymns, this one  contains no explicit reference to the preparation of the soma, with only a glancing  mention of the “impelling” of soma in the final verse (5), a term generally used in IX  of the push that starts the soma on its purificatory journey through the filter.
### 1
You who bear your manly powers among the seats of great heaven we implore for something dear through this good ritual performance— 2. You who have encoiled the bold and are worthy of hymns, having very  great commandments, exhilarating,
eager to break a hundred strongholds.
### 3
From there, from heaven, the unfaltering falcon brought
you, the king, to wealth, o strong-willed one.
### 4
It was for everyone to see the sun that the bird brought you as one (to be)  held in common,
the herdsman of truth, crossing through the airy realm.

And now, being impelled, he has acquired more eminent greatness,  appropriate to Indra,
as the limitless creator of superiority.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
Each verse of this hymn contains a form (two in vs. 3)  of the root pū “purify,”  all verbs except for the “filter” word (pavítram) in verse 4; the three middle verses  (3–5) also all contain the instrumental dhā́rayā “in a stream.” The hymn thus has  a tight lexical structure, and the content is similarly limited, to wishes for rain as  refreshment and nourishment (vss. 1, 3–4) and for increase in cattle (vs. 3). The first  four verses contain imperatives addressed to Soma, the last verse a 3rd-person past  tense, suggesting that the wishes expressed have been fulfilled.
### 1
Purify yourself, bringing rain to us, a wave of waters from heaven,
lofty refreshments free from disease.
### 2
Purify yourself in that stream by which the people’s cows
will come here, right up to our house.
### 3
Purify yourself in a stream as ghee, you who best pursue the gods at the  sacrifices;
for us bring rain through purification.

The next three hymns (IX.50–52) are attributed to the same poet, who is not otherwise  found in the R̥gveda. This hymn has a distinct focus on sound, that of Soma as he is  being prepared (vs. 1), of (probably) the officiating priests (vs. 3), and of the ritual  chant (vs. 4). A potential pun in verse 2 suggests that the priestly voices there are both  competing with each other and seeking the sacrificial reward. Verse 5 contains another  potential pun, with the same word (aktú) meaning both “ointments” and “nights.”
### 1
Your snortings rise up like the roar of the wave of a river.
Spur on the wheel-rim of the music.
### 2
At your stimulus there rise up three voices ready for combat [/seeking  bounty],
when you go onto the back of the sheep.
### 3
On the sheep’s fleece with stones they drive the dear tawny one around, purifying himself, dripping with honey.
### 4
Purify yourself in a stream in the filter, you most exhilarating poet, to sit in the womb of chant.

Purify yourself, most exhilarating one, being anointed with cows as  ointments [/through the nights],
o drop, for Indra to drink.

Ucathya Āṅgirasa
5 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn sets Soma in relation both to the humans involved in his prepa ration, namely the Adhvaryu priest (vs. 1) and the praiser (vs. 4), and to the gods  who consume him, Indra (vss. 1–2), the gods in general, and the Maruts (vs. 3).  The entry into the filter, mentioned in verses 1 and 5, provides an elementary ring.
1276 IX.52
### 1
O Adhvaryu, send the soma, pressed by stones, surging into the filter. Purify it for Indra to drink.
### 2
The highest beestings of heaven, the most honeyed soma—
press it for Indra who bears the mace.
### 3
Of your stalk, of your honey, o drop, do these gods eat;
of you, the self-purifying one, do the Maruts.
### 4
For you, Soma, are strengthening when you are pressed for fervent  exhilaration,
to help the praiser, you bull.
### 5
O wide-gazing one, pressed in a stream, rush into the filter
to the prize of victory and to fame.
## 52 
52 (764) Soma Pavamāna
Ucathya Āṅgirasa
5 verses: gāyatrī
Unlike the very straightforward preceding hymn (IX.51) attributed to the same  poet, this one is full of tricks, especially in the middle verse (3), which can thus  be viewed as an omphalos. The contents of the first two verses are conventional  enough—the entry of Soma into the filter—but they contain several instances of  phonological and morphological play, as do the final two verses (4–5). These cannot  be conveyed in translation.
Verse 3, characterized by the repetition of the verb īṅkhaya (“push, shove”) of highly  marked formation, has a slangy and disparaging tone. Its object is generally interpreted,  in our opinion correctly, as a reference to an ungenerous rich man, perhaps the poet’s  patron. He is compared to a pot, no doubt both because he is full of goods and because  of his stodgy demeanor, and the soma drop is urged to prod this miser into giving.
Two matching compounds, sanád-rayiḥ “gaining wealth” (vs. 1)  and  maṃhayád-rayiḥ “readying wealth” (vs. 5), provide a thematic and grammatical ring.
### 1
Heaven-ruling, gaining wealth, bringing a prize to us with your stalk, being pressed, rush around into the filter.
### 2
Along your age-old routes, around onto the sheep’s fleece, the dear one drives, a thousand streams in extent.
### 3
The one who is like a pot, give him a shove; give a shove to the one who  doesn’t give on his own, o drop.
Give him a shove with your strokes, you striker.
### 4
(Strike) down the bluster of those people, o much-invoked drop,
of anyone who takes aim at us.
### 5
With a hundred forms of help for us, o drop, or with a thousand
gleaming (soma drinks),
purify yourself, readying wealth.
## 53 
53 (765) Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verse: gāyatrī
The next eight hymns (IX.53–60) are attributed to the same poet as V.44, a hymn  to the All Gods often declared to be the hardest hymn in the R̥gveda. Although  these brief soma hymns have some interesting features, they lack the mind-boggling  verbal pyrotechnics of that hymn.
On the other hand, the organizing principle of V.44 is the double application of  each verse to two different divinities, Agni and Soma, with a lexicon ambiguous  enough to allow both interpretations. Something of the same thing is visible in this  hymn, in which each verse but the last (4) invites the audience to supply a refer
ent different from the one meant. The first verse deploys clear Indraic vocabulary,  particularly the vocative “possessor of the stone,” though Soma can, and should,  be its subject. The first two-thirds of the second verse (2ab) suggest either Indra or  Soma as referent, until the 1st singular verb form “I will praise” that opens the last  pāda establishes the 1st-person speaker as the referent. Again, the third verse opens  like a verse to Varuṇa or another Āditya, and only the “self-purifying” that begins  the second pāda ties it to Soma. It is only the last verse that contains unmistakable  somian vocabulary and which, in its final pāda, clarifies the roles of the drop (índu)  and Indra.
### 1
Your blasts have arisen, splitting the demonic power, you possessor of  the stone.
Push aside the challengers all around
### 2
With this (insightful thought), slamming down with strength when  chariots clash and a prize is set,
I will praise with fearless heart.
### 3
The commandments of this self-purifying one cannot be ventured  against by one of bad insight.
Break the one who battles you.
### 4
Into the rivers they impel him who arouses exhilaration, the tawny one  who seeks the prize,
the drop exhilarating to Indra.

Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
Like the last hymn, this one withholds unambiguous identification until the end  of the hymn, while employing suggestive vocabulary in the earlier verses. However,  unlike the last hymn, the poet does not try to mislead the audience into supplying
1278 IX.55
the “wrong” referent. Rather, the hymn is structured as a series of explicit riddles: a  form of the pronoun ayám “this one” opens each of the first three verses (and also  2b), and what is predicated of “this one” fits, or can fit, the Soma paradigm. The  explicit solution to the riddle is given in the last pāda of verse 3, with the name  Soma prominently situated. And the final verse brings the drop (índu) and Indra  together in the same way as IX.53.4.
### 1
In accord with the age-old brilliance of this one, they have milked the  gleaming, immoderate
milk from the seer who wins thousands.
### 2
This one is a sight like the sun; this one runs to the lakes,
along the seven slopes, to heaven.

This one, being purified, stands above all beings
like the Sun-god: he is Soma.

The first three verses of the hymn are unified by a reference to the stalk (ándhas) of  the soma plant, although the role of the stalk is somewhat vague. Verse 1 is notable  for its mention of agriculture, though again the relevance is not entirely clear. The  martial Soma is on display in verse 4.
### 1
Stream around to us grain upon grain, fruiting upon fruiting with your stalk, o Soma, and all the gifts of good fortune.
### 2
O drop, just as there is praise of you (now), just as (the honey) has been  born from your stalk,
(so) sit down on the dear ritual grass.
### 3
And as cow-finder for us, horse-finder, purify yourself, Soma, with your stalk through the days soonest to come.

Who conquers and is not conquered, who smashes his rival on just  confronting him—
as such a one, purify yourself, o winner of thousands.

The first three verses of this simple hymn describe Soma’s journey in the filter (vs.  1), as the liquid separates into multiple streams in the channels of the fleece (vs. 2),  and his preparation by the fingers (vs. 3). The fourth verse then requests protection  for ourselves and our men, while urging the soma to flow for its divine recipients.
### 1
Swift Soma, as lofty truth, rushes about in the filter,
smashing apart the demons, seeking the gods,
### 2
When Soma rushes toward the prize, as a hundred hardworking streams, entering fellowship with Indra.
### 3
The ten young women have cried out to you, like a maiden to her lover. You are groomed, o Soma, for winning.

In this little hymn, Soma is explicitly or implicitly compared to rain (vs. 1), a war rior (vs. 2), a law-abiding king or his subject (vs. 3), and a falcon in its nest (vs. 3).  The ambiguity of the term “keeping his commandments well, having good com mandments” in verse 3 allows the description to apply either to the imposer of the  commandments, the king, or to those who abide by them, the vassals. The final  verse (4) is, as so often, the locus of our requests.
### 1
Your streams go forth inexhaustible, like rains from heaven,
to the thousandfold prize.
### 2
Toward the dear (products of) poetic skill, observing all does he rush, the tawny one brandishing his weapons.
### 3
Constantly being groomed by the Āyus, keeping his commandments like  a vassal (or) a king,

Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
A curious little hymn or hymn-fragment. All four verses have a pāda-length refrain,  which is entirely applicable to Soma, and the hymn begins with this same refrain.  The first verse is clearly a soma verse throughout, but verse 2 is more appropriate to  Dawn and verses 3 and 4 appear to be an abbreviated dānastuti. The patrons named  in verse 3 are identified as protegés of the Aśvins in I.112.23 (though with the first in  slightly different form); middle Vedic literature also has a confused tradition about  these same personages.
### 1
In crossing, the invigorating one runs, the stream of the pressed stalk. – In crossing, the invigorating one runs.
### 2
The ruddy goddess knows of the goods, of the help of the mortal. – In crossing, the invigorating one runs.

At (the hands of) Dhvasra and Puruṣanti we take thousands.

Each of the four verses contains at least one form of “purify oneself/self-purifying,”  with three such imperatives in verse 2. That verse seems to contain a trio of elemental  substances, which are also connected with the ritual: waters, plants, and, in our interpre tation, the hearths as holy places, representative of fire. Soma as finder of good things  for us provides a thematic ring for the hymn; in verse 1 he finds the material and psy chological goods men desire, while in verse 4 he has raised the stakes to the cosmic level.
### 1
Purify yourself, Soma, as cow-winner, horse-winner, all-winner,
joy-winner.
Bring here a treasure consisting of offspring.
### 2
Purify yourself undeceivable for the waters; purify yourself for the plants; purify yourself for the Holy Places.

4 verses: gāyatrī
A satisfyingly tight structure knits together this little hymn. The first and last verses  contain the epithet “boundless” (vícarṣaṇi) providing a faint ring. More salient is  the chaining from verse to verse: a significant portion of the final pāda of one verse  opens the next verse.
The hymn also has extra-hymnic structural echoes: its final pāda is identical to  the final pāda of the first verse of the preceding hymn (IX.59.1), ascribed to the  same poet, save for “semen” in place of “treasure.”
### 1
Sing forth with a song to the boundless self-purifying one,
the drop with a thousand eyes.

You, possessing a thousand eyes and bringing a thousand presents, they have purified across the fleece.

Amahīyu Āṅgirasa
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The first sixty hymns of the Soma Maṇḍala, all in gāyatrī meter, are arranged in the  normal order of descending number of verses, starting with hymns of ten verses  and ending with those of four. (The only exception is the Āprī hymn, IX.5, which  has eleven.) But the gāyatrī sequence ends with six thirty-verse hymns (IX.61–66),  followed by one with thirty-two verses (IX.67)—all arranged in tr̥cas (the final two  verses in IX.67 are supplements) and each attributed to a different poet or group  of poets—before the jagatī group begins. It is probably not an accident that these  groupings of tr̥cas come at the end of the gāyatrī sequence, since, as agglomerations  of three-verse sequences, they logically follow the four-verse hymns.
In this particular hymn there is little evidence of unity either within tr̥cas or between  them: the standard topics of soma hymns—the details of preparation (e.g., vss. 4–5)  and the gods for whom he’s prepared (e.g., vss. 8–9), the cosmic connections of Soma  (e.g., vss. 10, 16, 18), and the largesse and aid we ask him for (e.g., vss. 3, 23–24)—
are strung together in no apparent order. There is a discernible tendency, however, to  emphasize Soma’s role in combating hostile forces, either directly or by strengthening  someone else to do so, especially Indra. The hymn begins with two verses mention ing some of Indra’s exploits performed under the influence of Soma, though without
1282 IX.61
naming Indra, and the theme of Soma the smiter and aggressive warrior returns  toward the end of the hymn and dominates the last two tr̥cas (vss. 19–20, 22, 24–30).

30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Though long, this hymn remains focused on the familiar details of the preparation  of the soma, often ennobled by establishing cosmic parallels. The journey across1284 IX.62
the fleece is especially prominent, and the soma is frequently likened to a fast horse.  One verse, 17, is more specific than the usual generic treatments: here the soma is  a horse yoked to the chariot of the sacrifice, which has three backs and three seats,  presumably the three pressings and the three fires, by the visionary thoughts of the  seven seers. It is also notable how often Soma is called a poet or connected with  poetry in the second part of this hymn (vss. 13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 30). In the final verse  he is in fact called “the entruthed poet” or “the poet (who is) truth (itself),” a power
ful expression of his relationship to creative speech.
Though some of the tr̥cas display internal formal unity (e.g., vss. 19–21 begin ning with ā́), most do not. The poet to whom the hymn is attributed names himself  in verse 24.

This bull following his bullish commandments, purifying himself,  smashing malediction,
will provide goods for the pious. 12. In purifying yourself bring wealth in thousands of cows and of horses, much gleaming, much craved.
### 13
This one here is poured in circles, being continually groomed by  the Āyus,

Possessing a thousand forms of help, a hundred bounties, measurer of  the airy realm, poet—

Born on a mountain [/begotten by a hymn], praised here, the drop is  placed for Indra,

They yoke him to the three-backed, three-seated chariot, to drive, yoking him by means of the seven visionary thoughts of the seven seers. 18. O pressers, impel the swift one to drive for the prize—the winner of spoils, the tawny prize-seeker.
### 19
Pressed, entering the tub, rushing to all that is glorious,
he stands among the cows like a champion.

You rush to pursue bovine (goods) and manly powers, while being  purified.

### 27
For you, o poet, do these worlds here take their stand, for your

for you do the rivers rush.

Self-purifying Soma, the entruthed poet, has sat in the filter,

63 (775) Soma Pavamāna
Nidhruvi Kāśyapa
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Like the last hymn, this one is much concerned with the ritual preparation of soma,  but it sketches a larger conceptual world in which this preparation takes place. On the  one hand, the purification is seen as a process of Ārya-ization (vs. 5), and the spaces  that Soma traverses, for example the filter, become “Ārya domains” (vs. 14). The waters  that Soma crosses (vss. 5, 21) and the rivers in which he is groomed (vs. 17) are both  the ritual waters in which the soma plant is rinsed and rehydrated and, metaphorically,  the frontier rivers the Āryas crossed in expanding their realms. (See also the mentions  of finding or making “wide space” in the two preceding hymns [IX.61.12; 62.3, 9].)
On the other hand, Soma is compared to and identified with the Sun (espe cially in the third tr̥ca, vss. 7–9, also vs. 13), and his journey across the filter is also  metaphorically the Sun’s daily journey across the heaven. Since the ritual activity  happens on earth, at the hands of Manu (vss. 7–8), the first sacrificer and the cul tural ancestor of the Ārya, even the rising of the Sun is thus implicitly attributed  to human agency.
The hymn is, of course, also full of requests for material goods of all sorts, and,  especially toward the end, for Soma to smite all manner of enemies and hostile  forces (vss. 24, 26, 28–29; also 5).
Although the hymn does not seem tightly structured, some tr̥cas show formal  unity (e.g., vss. 25–27 with forms of the root sr̥j “surge”), and the hymn begins and  ends with verses containing the imperative dhāraya “secure, sustain.”
### 1
In purifying yourself, o Soma, bring wealth in thousands and an
abundance of good heroes;
secure our claims to fame for us.
### 2
You swell refreshment and nourishment; most exhilarating for Indra, you sit down here in the cups.
### 3
Pressed for Indra, for Viṣṇu, soma has streamed into the tub.
Let it be honeyed for Vāyu.
### 4
These swift brown ones have surged across the tangles (of sheep’s wool), the soma juices, in a stream of truth. 5. Strengthening Indra, crossing the waters, making it all Ārya,
smashing away the non-givers,
### 6
The pressed juices rush along their own realm, the brown ones,
the drops, going to Indra.
### 7
Purify yourself in the very stream with which you made the sun shine, impelling the waters belonging to Manu.
### 8
He has yoked Etaśa, (the steed) of the Sun, purifying himself in Manu’s  presence,
to drive through the midspace.
### 9
And these ten tawny mares of the Sun he has yoked, to drive,
the drop, announcing, “(I go) to Indra.”
### 10
From here sprinkle in circles the soma pressed for Vāyu, the songs, (the  soma) exhilarating to Indra,
onto the sheep’s fleece.
### 11
O self-purifying Soma, find wealth for us that is difficult to surpass, that is difficult to attain by one who craves it.
### 12
Rush toward wealth in thousands of cows and of horses,
toward the prize of victory and fame.
### 13
Soma, like the Sun-god, purifies himself, pressed by stones,
placing his own sap in the tub.
### 14
Across the Ārya domains these clear juices in a stream of truth
have flowed to a prize of cows.
### 15
Pressed for Indra the mace-bearer, the soma juices, mixed with curds, have streamed across the filter.
### 16
O Soma, as the most honeyed, rush forth into the filter for wealth, as the exhilarating drink that best pursues the gods.
### 17
Him do the Āyus groom in the rivers, the tawny prize-seeker,
the drop exhilarating to Indra.
### 18
In purifying yourself, o Soma, bring masses of gold, of horses, of  heroes;
bring hither a prize of cows.
### 19
As if sprinkling a prize-seeking (horse) when the prize (is set), sprinkle  prize-seeking (soma) in circles onto the sheep’s fleece,
(the soma) most honeyed for Indra.
### 20
The inspired poets, seeking help, with their insights groom the sage poet  worthy to be groomed.
The bull rushes ever roaring.
### 21
To the water-crossing bull, Soma, in a stream of truth
have the inspired poets cried out in unison with their insights, their
thought.
1288 IX.64
### 22
Purify yourself, o god, attended by the Āyus. Let your exhilarating  drink go to Indra;
mount to Vāyu according to the (ritual) statute.
### 23
O self-purifying Soma, you spill down wealth worthy of fame.
As dear one, enter the sea.
### 24
Smashing away the scorners, you purify yourself, finding the resolve,  exhilarating, o Soma.
Thrust from yourself the people who do not seek the gods.
### 25
The self-purifying soma juices, the clear drops have surged
toward all products of poetic skill.
### 26
The swift, resplendent, self-purifying drops have surged,
smashing away all hatreds.
### 27
The self-purifying ones have surged from the heaven, from the midspace onto the back of the earth.
### 28
Becoming purified in a stream, o Soma drop, smash away all errors, away the demonic forces, o you of good resolve.
### 29
Smashing away demons, Soma, rush ever roaring
toward highest brilliant tempestuousness.
### 30
In us, o Soma drop, secure goods—heavenly, earthly,
all that are choice.

64 (776) Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The hymn begins with an insistent tr̥ca establishing Soma as a bull. What follows is  for the most part a conventional treatment of the purification process, with special  emphasis on his entry into “the sea” (that is, the purificatory waters, vss. 8, 16, 17,  19, 27). The association with the Sun found in the preceding hymn is also present  here, with Soma not merely yoking the Sun’s horse, Etaśa, but identified with him  (vs. 19) and with the Sun himself in the final words of the hymn (vs. 30; see also  vss. 7, 9). Soma’s light and brilliance are also mentioned throughout (vss. 1, 8, 13,  15, 28).
### 1
A bull are you, Soma, a brilliant one—a bull following his bullish  commandments, o god.
As bull, you have established your own foundations.
### 2
Of you, the bull, bullish is the strength; your wooden (cup) is a bull, your  exhilarating drink a bull.
In truth, o bull, you are really a bull. 3. You, the bull, whinny like a horse. Sur(round) the cows, sur(round) the  steeds, o drop;
open up the doors for wealth for us.
### 4
They have surged forth—the prize-seeking soma juices—with a yen for  cows and for horses,
with a yen for heroes—the swift clear ones.
### 5
Being beautified by those who seek truth, being groomed in the two hands, they purify themselves in the sheep’s fleece.
### 6
All goods for the pious—heavenly, earthly, and those of the midspace— let these soma juices bring in purifying themselves.
### 7
O you who find [/know] all, of you purifying yourself the surges have  surged forth,
like the rays of the sun.
### 8
Making a beacon, from heaven you rush toward all forms.
O Soma, you swell as the sea.
### 9
Yourself being impelled, you send out your speech, you who purify  yourself at your expansion.
You have roared like the Sun-god.
### 10
The drop has become purified, the conspicuous dear one, by the  thought of the poets.
Like a charioteer his horse, it has released (its wave),
### 11
Your wave which, pursuing the gods, has streamed around in the filter, sitting on the womb of truth.
### 12
Rush into our filter, as the exhilarating drink that best pursues the gods, o drop, for Indra to drink.
### 13
For refreshment purify yourself in a stream, being groomed by the  inspired ones.
O drop, with your light come toward the cows.
### 14
Becoming purified, make wide space and nourishment for the people, o  you who long for song,
when you are released into the milk-mixture, o tawny one.
### 15
Becoming purified for the pursuit of the gods, drive to your rendezvous  with Indra,
flashing, guided by the prize-seekers.
### 16
Being impelled forth, the swift drops,
sped by insightful thought, have surged to the sea.
### 17
Continually being groomed, the lively drops
have come at will to the sea, to the womb of truth.
### 18
Inclined toward us, encompass for us all goods with your strength. Protect for us a shelter full of heroes.
1290 IX.65
### 19
Etaśa the draft-horse measures out his pace, being yoked by the
versifiers,
when he is deposited in the sea.
### 20
When the swift one sits on the golden womb of truth,
he leaves behind the undiscerning.
### 21
The seekers have cried out to (him); the discerning wish to attain (him). The undiscriminating sink down.
### 22
For Indra with the Maruts, o drop, purify yourself as the most honeyed, to sit on the womb of truth.
### 23
The inspired poets knowing [/finding] speech, the ritual adepts,
adorn you;
the Āyus groom you all over.
### 24
Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa drink your sap, o poet,
as do the Maruts, when you purify yourself.
### 25
You, Soma, while becoming purified, send out speech that is attentive to  poetic inspiration
and brings a thousand presents, o drop.
### 26
And speech bringing a thousand presents, ready for combat [/bounty],  o Soma—
becoming purified, o drop, bring that hither.
### 27
Becoming purified, o drop, much invoked by these peoples,
as dear one, enter the sea.
### 28
(Provided) with ever-flashing light, with a form that encircles with chant are (both) the clear soma drinks and those mixed with cows [=milk].
### 29
Being impelled, guided by the impellers, the prize-seeker has stridden to  the prize—
sitting (on the womb of truth) like raptor(-birds).
### 30
Separately [=unmixed], o Soma, and uniting (with milk), as poet  of heaven
purify yourself for well-being and as the sun to be seen.

65 (777) Soma Pavamāna
Bhrgu V ̥ āruṇi or Jamadagni Bhārgava
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Even in this maṇḍala devoted to “self-purifying” Soma, the constant repetition of  that epithet and its associated verbal forms (“purify yourself,” etc.) in this hymn is  remarkable. In particular, the idiom “by purifying yourself bring here ...” (much  more economically expressed in Sanskrit by ā́ pavasva) is insistent, along with other  demands that Soma bring or convey goods here. Intermingled are verses treating the familiar details of soma preparation. All in all, the hymn seems flat, uninspired,  and repetitive.
The tr̥ca consisting of verses 22–24 breaks the monotony to some degree, with  the first two verses listing various places where the soma may be pressed (the  meaning of some of these words is disputed and their translation provisional),  and only the third returning to the dominant theme of the hymn. The final tr̥ca  (vss. 28–30) brings the hymn to a close with a flurry of repetitions of the preverb  ā́ “here, hither,” in a list of items we wish to bring to hand as a result of the soma  offering.
### 1
The rosy (fingers) impel the sun; the kindred sisters impel their lord; those seeking the great impel the great drop.
### 2
O self-purifying one, with light after light, as god from among the gods, enter all good things.
### 3
O self-purifying one, by purifying yourself bring here good praise, rain,  and friendship from the gods,
continuously for refreshment.
### 4
Because you are a bull, we, very attentive, invoke you who are brilliant  with radiance,
o self-purifying one.
### 5
By purifying yourself bring here an abundance of heroes, you yourself  becoming exhilarated, o you of good weapons.
Come just here, o drop.
### 6
When you are poured all around with waters, being groomed in the  two hands,
you attain to your seat by means of the wooden (vessel).
### 7
Sing forth to self-purifying Soma, as Vyaśva did—
to the great one with a thousand eyes—
### 8
Him whose tawny hue, dripping with honey, they impel (like) a fallow  bay with the stones,
the drop for Indra to drink,
### 9
It’s with you—that prize-seeker who has won all the stakes—
that we choose partnership.
### 10
As bull purify yourself in a stream, and as exhilarating drink for the  one accompanied by the Maruts [=Indra],
making all things your own by your strength.
### 11
You, o self-purifying one, who look like the sun, the upholder of  (Indra’s?) two arms,
do I impel—the prize-seeker to the prizes.
### 12
Conspicuous because of this poetic inspiration, purify yourself as  tawny one in this very stream.
Spur on your yokemate to the prizes.
1292 IX.65
### 13
By purifying yourself bring great refreshment here for us, o drop visible  to all,
finding the way for us, o Soma.
### 14
The tubs have cried out, o drop. In streams, with strength,
enter (them) for Indra’s drinking.
### 15
You, whose exhilarating, sharp sap they milk out with stones— purify yourself as smasher of hostility.
### 16
The king is sped by (words of) wisdom, purifying himself in Manu’s  presence,
to drive through the midspace.
### 17
Convey to us here, o drop, hundredfold thriving of cattle, an abundance  of horses,
and the gift of good fortune, for aid.
### 18
Bring to us here, o Soma, strength and speed, as if in physical form, for  luster,
when you have been pressed to seek the gods.
### 19
Rush, o Soma, most brilliant, to the wooden vessels, constantly  bellowing,
sitting like a falcon in your womb.
### 20
For Indra, for Vāyu, for Varuṇa, for the Maruts, for Viṣṇu
the water-winning soma rushes.
### 21
Establishing refreshment for our offspring and for us on all sides,  o Soma,
by purifying yourself bring thousandfold (wealth) here.
### 22
The soma juices that have been pressed in the distance, those nearby, or those yonder in a reed-filled (lake),
### 23
Those (pressed) in foamy (places) among performers (of rituals), those  in the middle of dwelling places,
or those among the five peoples,
### 24
By purifying themselves, let them bring here to us rain from heaven and  an abundance of heroes—
the gods, the drops, being pressed.
### 25
He purifies himself, the delightful tawny one, while being hymned by  Jamadagni
and being impelled onto the hide of the cow.
### 26
Forth (go) the clear (soma juices), speeding with vigor, being impelled  like teams.
Being brought to readiness, they are groomed in the waters.
### 27
Those present at the pressings have impelled you for the sake of the  divine conclave.
Purify yourself with this light. 28. Here your skill, which is joy itself, we choose today, here (you as)  draft-animal,
here the much coveted drink,
### 29
Here the gladdening (drink), here the one worthy to be chosen, here the  inspired poet, here the inspirited one,
here the much coveted drink,
### 30
Here wealth, here kind attention, here, o strong-willed one, right here  on our bodies,
here the much coveted drink.

66 (778) Soma Pavamāna, except Agni 19–21
One hundred Vaikhānasa poets
30 verses: gāyatrī (except anuṣṭubh 18), arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn sets larger rhetorical goals for itself than the last one and inhabits  a less airless rhetorical space. Indeed, the hymn is in part about space: the con stricted area in which the soma is prepared and the materials employed in the  preparation are likened to various cosmic domains and natural phenomena (see,  e.g., vss. 2–3, 5–6, 12–13). Soma himself is explicitly or implicitly identified with  other deities and natural forces, and they with him:  the sun (vss. 18, 22, 27),  probably Indra (vs. 26), and especially Agni (vss. 19–21). This last identification  is so complete that the Anukramaṇī identifies Agni as the divinity of this tr̥ca— not surprisingly, as it begins (vs. 19) with an address to Agni, who is assigned  the archetypal Soma epithet “self-purifying” (vs. 20, with verbal forms in vss. 19  and 21), while also keeping his own characteristic vocabulary (esp. “installed in  front” [puróhita] vs. 20).
The poet also seeks comradeship with Soma (vss. 1, 4, 14, 18), in addition to the  usual good things.
From an Indo-European perspective, the hymn is notable for containing one of  three R̥gvedic occurrences of the famous phrase ákṣiti śrávaḥ “imperishable fame,”  cognate with Greek kléos áphthiton “idem,” and the formula, identified by Adelbert  Kuhn in 1853, that launched the field of comparative Indo-European poetics.
### 1
Purify yourself, you who are common to all the separate peoples,
(surging) toward all products of poetic skill,
a comrade for your comrades, to be reverently invoked.
### 2
From those two you rule over all, self-purifying one—from the two  domains [=Heaven and Earth]
that stand facing (each other), o Soma.
### 3
The domains that are yours, Soma, you surround entirely
according to the ritual sequences, o self-purifying poet.1294 IX.66
### 4
Purify yourself, begetting refreshments, (surging) toward all valuables, as a comrade to aid your comrades.
### 5
Yours are the gleaming rays that spread widely on the back of heaven across the filter, Soma, through your domains.
### 6
Yours are these seven streams that flow forth to your command, Soma. For you do the milk-cows run.
### 7
Drive forth, Soma, in a stream, pressed as exhilarating for Indra, establishing for yourself imperishable fame.
### 8
Together the seven siblings cried out to you, inciting with insightful  thoughts
the inspired poet at the contest of Vivasvant.
### 9
They groom you together, the unwed ones, on the sheep’s *back, in the  lively (water),
when, hoarse-voiced [/creaking], you are anointed [/greased] in the  wood(en cup).
### 10
Of you purifying yourself, o poet and prizewinner, the surges have surged, like chargers seeking fame.
### 11
Toward the cask dripping with honey they have surged onto the sheep’s  fleece.
The insightful thoughts have bellowed.
### 12
Toward the sea have the drops gone, like milk-cows toward home, to the womb of truth.
### 13
For our great joy the waters, the rivers rush forth, o drop,
when you will clothe yourself with cows.
### 14
Since we are likely to gain in comradeship with you, with you as  our help,
we long for comradeship, o drop.
### 15
Purify yourself for the quest for cattle, for the great one of manly eye,  o Soma.
Enter here into the belly of Indra.
### 16
Great are you, Soma, preeminent, strongest of the strong, o drop. Being a battler, you win every time.
### 17
(You,) who are stronger even than the strong, more a champion even  than champions,
more generous even than those who give much,
### 18
You, Soma, are the sun; (bring) refreshments here at the winning of the  offspring of our own bodies.
We choose (you) for comradeship; we choose (you) for fellowship.
### 19
O Agni, you bring (longer) lifespans through your purification; impel  hither nourishment and refreshment to us.
Into the distance thrust misfortune. 20. Agni—a seer, self-purifying, belonging to the five peoples, installed  in front—
him we beseech for a great household.
### 21
Agni, as a good worker, through your purification bring luster and an  abundance of heroes for us,
establishing in me wealth and thriving.

1296 IX.67
This final hymn of the IXth Maṇḍala gāyatrī collection is, according to the  Anukramaṇī, the product of at least seven different poets, most of them found ing poets of the Family Books of the R̥gveda and all eponymous ancestors of  the most prominent gotras of later times—each responsible for a single tr̥ca, with  the last eleven verses assigned either to yet another poet or to Vasiṣṭha, the poet  of the immediately preceding tr̥ca. It has been convincingly argued by Proferes  (2007: 10) that this structure shows that the separate lineage rites were already being  collected into a single pan-Ārya ritual during the R̥gvedic period and that this com posite hymn was a conscious attempt to bring the various clans under one ritual  umbrella. He argues that the final two verses (31–32) were added by the redactors  or compilers and celebrate this ecumenical project, by declaring that the assemblage  is greater and more powerful than the sum of its parts.
Certainly its parts are quite various. The first twenty-one verses, attributed to the  various clan-poets, are for the most part conventional Soma Pavamāna verses, and  the tr̥cas for the most part exhibit some internal cohesion. The single unconventional  tr̥ca consists of verses 10–12, attributed to Atri, in which the god Pūṣan dominates.  Pūṣan otherwise scarcely appears in the IXth Maṇḍala, has little or no connec
tion with soma elsewhere (gruel is his favored meal), and barely appears in the Atri  Maṇḍala (V) except in lists of other gods. The reason for his intrusion here is unclear. Verses 22–27 form a self-contained purificatory spell, calling on various gods,  including Soma, Agni, and Savitar, in addition to groups of gods, to purify us with  their own characteristic instruments. There follow two verses (28–29) that return to  the soma theme, and then the strangest verse of all (30). The interpretation of this  verse is much disputed, but it appears to refer to the myth of the disappearance of  the ritual Agni and urges Soma to bring him back, along with a, or the, rat, which  may be a reference to the god Rudra, whose animal victim in later ritual is a rat. But  this is only a guess.
The last two supplementary verses (31–32) were discussed above.
### 1
You, Soma, are supporting, invigorating, strongest at the ceremony. Purify yourself, readying wealth.
### 2
You, bringing exhilaration to superior men when pressed, most
exhilarating when you have run,
are patron to Indra, with your stalk.
### 3
You, having been pressed by stones—rush, roaring constantly,
toward highest brilliant tempestuous force.
### 4
The drop, being impelled, rushes across the sheep’s fleece;
the tawny one has roared for the prize.
### 5
O drop, you rush through the fleece, through to acclamations, through to  gifts of good fortune,
through to prizes consisting of cows, o Soma.
### 6
Bring here to us, o drop, wealth in cattle and horses—
a hundredfold, a thousandfold, o soma. 7. The self-purifying drops, swift across the filter,
have reached Indra on their journeys.
### 8
The prominent somian sap, the primordial drop
purifies itself for Indra—a lively one for a lively one [/Āyu].
### 9
The rosy (fingers) impel the sun; to the self-purifying one, dripping  with honey,
they cry out in unison with a song.
### 10
Pūṣan whose horses are goats is our helper on every journey.

### 20
This one, pounded, bepraised, plunges across the filter,
the sheep’s fleece, as demon-smasher.
### 21
What peril nearby and what at a little distance finds me here—
o self-purifying one, smash that away.
### 22
The one who purifies himself through our filter today, the limitless one who is the purifier, let him purify us.
### 23
The filter that is stretched out here within your flame, o Agni,
and the sacred formulation—with that purify us.
### 24
Your filter of flames, Agni—with that purify us;
with the impulsions of sacred formulations purify us.
### 25
With both, god Savitar, with the filter and with your impulsion
purify me all about.
1298 IX.68
### 26
With the three purify us—you, god Savitar, with your greatest
(impulsions), you, Soma, through your greatest domains,
and you, Agni, with your skills.
### 27
Let the godly folk purify me; let the Vasus purify me with insight. O All Gods, purify me; o Jātavedas, purify me.
### 28
Swell forth, flow forth, Soma, with all your shoots
as highest oblation for the gods.
### 29
Close to the dear youth who always excites wonder, the one growing  strong through the poured offering,
have we come, bearing homage.
### 30
The axe [=flame] of the one not to be stilled [=Agni] (has) disappeared.  By purifying yourself bring it here, o god Soma,
so also the rat [=Rudra?], o god Soma.
### 31
Whoever studies the “Self-Purifying” (verses), the sap assembled by  the seers,
that one eats the whole purified (sap), sweetened by Mātariśvan.
### 32
Whoever studies the “Self-Purifying” (verses), the sap assembled by  the seers,
for him Sarasvatī milks out milk, fresh butter, honey, and water.
Jagatı Hymns: 68–86 ̄
## 68 
68 (780) Soma Pavamāna
Vatsaprī Bhālandana
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
The first of the Soma hymns in jagatī meter (IX.68–86), this poem well dem onstrates the increased possibilities for verbal and conceptual richness that the  longer meter affords, in contrast to the concision and constriction of gāyatrī.  The hymn has an omphalos structure: since verse 10 is a summary verse and in  a different meter (triṣṭubh), verse 5 is the middle verse and encodes the esoteric  knowledge that is the hymn’s message. This verse is framed by a number of verbal  and semantic responsions (though not as tightly arranged as in some omphalos  hymns): for instance, the fingers of verses 4 and 7, as well as the same phrase “held  by men” in both verses; the forms of the root vid “find, discover” in verses 3 and  6 (and 9).
More important is the conceptual architecture: the hymn leads up to the ompha los and away from it, returning to its conceptual starting point. It begins with the ritual soma and the familiar details of its preparation (vss. 1–2): the journey across  the filter and the mixing with milk, complete with details about the actual filtering  process, as the juice leaves its detritus in the filter. But toward the end of verse 2, the  journey gains a larger resonance, however vague: soma circles “the wide expanse,”  an area that sounds more ample than a mere sheep’s fleece. In verses 3 and 4 the  journey has turned cosmic: heaven and earth are now the domain for Soma’s travel  and for his fecundating activity, and in our view the contrast between Soma’s swell
ing footprint in 4b and his head in 4d expresses his cosmic reach, from his feet on  earth, swelling with rain, to his distant head in heaven.
Verse 5, the omphalos, provides an explanation, albeit a mystical one, for the  difference between the ritual soma of the first two verses and the cosmic one of  verses 3–4. He really had two births, one in secret even beyond the two worlds and  one made evident to all. And as a consequence there are actually two Somas, a fact  first recognized by Heaven and Earth. (Such is our reading of this verse, which has  generally been interpreted quite differently: one influential opinion identifies the  Aśvins as the twins mentioned, a solution of desperation in our opinion.)
The second form of Soma, the physical and visible one, is brought to earth in  verse 6, and the poets and ritualists transform him into the ritual soma now familiar  to us. The remaining verses before the summary (7–9) bring us back to the current  ritual soma with which we began, but with a clearer awareness of the powers his  dual nature has bestowed on him. For example, in verse 1 the drops are simply “pro
vided with speech,” but in verses 8–9 Soma “rouses speech” all the way to heaven.  Similarly, in verse 2 he simply “circles around” the wide expanse, whereas in 9d, the  last pāda of the hymn proper, he “finds” wide space, a feat much desired and much  celebrated by the Vedic Āryas.
### 1
Forth toward the god have the honeyed drops flowed, like milk-cows. Sitting on the ritual grass, provided with speech, with (full) udders, they  have assumed as their swirling raiment the ruddy (cows’ milk).
### 2
Bellowing continually he has cried out to the (cows) in front; loosening  his shoots, the tawny one becomes sweet.
Across the filter, circling around the broad expanse, the god will lay
down his stems at will.
### 3
The exhilarating drink, which measured across the converging twin  sisters [=Heaven and Earth], swelled those two imperishable ones,
grown strong simultaneously, with imperishable milk.
Continually rediscovering the two great, unbounded world-halves,
advancing upon imperishable (space), he assumed his full dimension. 4. Wandering between the two mothers [=Heaven and Earth], stirring  up the waters, the wise one swells his own footprint by his
independent power.
The plant is ornamented with grain when he is held by men; while he  joins with his female kin [=fingers], he guards his own head.
1300 IX.69
### 5
Along with skill and mind the poet is born; the embryo of truth was  deposited beyond the twins [=Heaven and Earth].
Those two were the first to recognize that there were two youths: the  (one) birth deposited in secret and the other held aloft.
### 6
The inspired thinkers discovered the form of the gladdening one, when  the falcon brought the stalk from out of the distance.
They groomed him in the rivers, the eager well-grown plant, circling
around, worthy of verses.
### 7
The ten maidens [=fingers] groom you when you are pressed, Soma,  when you are impelled by the seers with thoughts and insights
and with invocations of the gods through the sheep’s fleeces. Held by  men, you will break out the prize to be won.
### 8
The inspired thoughts, the rhythms have roared to Soma, the branchy  one, circling forth, keeping good company,
who, honeyed, in a stream, in a wave from heaven, rouses speech—the  immortal one who conquers wealth.
### 9
This is the one who rouses (speech) to the whole realm of heaven.  Soma, being purified, sits in the tubs.
He is groomed with waters, with cows, when he has been pressed by
stones. Being purified, the drop finds dear wide space.
### 10
In just this way, o Soma, purify yourself, being poured all around,  establishing for us vigor most bright.
We would invoke Heaven and Earth, the two without hatred. O gods,  establish wealth rich in heroes for us.

Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
Attributed to the same poet as the author of the famous Indra hymn I.32 (and  indeed I.31–35, as well as IX.4), this hymn is dense with ever-shifting imagery,  expressed in many forms: similes, metaphors, identifications. Sometimes several ref erents are simultaneously possible, as in verse 1, where both “thought” and “soma”  could be the subject of the middle part of the verse. This verbal richness is quite  appropriate, since at least the first two verses concern the poetic impulse; note the  nice description of the tongue as “the gladdening goad” in 2b.
The middle verses (3–7) treat Soma’s journey across the filter to meet and mix  with the cows/milk. This mixture is described in increasingly elaborate images of  clothing in verses 4–5, ending with the cosmos as his garment (5cd). The journey is  completed in the first half of verse 7, and the hymn comes to a more conventional  ending with prayers for goods and aid. 1. Like an arrow on a bow, my thought is aimed. It is released like a calf  to the udder of its mother.
Like (a cow) with a broad stream, it gives milk as it comes here in the  lead. Under the commandments of this one [=Soma the god], the
soma (juice) is dispatched.
### 2
And while my thought is being engorged, the honey is poured. The  gladdening goad [=tongue] bestirs itself within the mouth.
The self-purifying one is a thundering, like (the thundering) of beaters.  The honeyed drop rushes round the fleece.
### 3
Seeking his wives, he purifies himself all around in the fleece and upon  the hide. The granddaughter of Aditi loosens (her garment [=shoots  of the soma plant]) for him who goes to truth.
The tawny one [/fallow bay], held fast, has whinnied—the sacrificial  exhilarating drink. Sharpening his own manly powers, like a buffalo,  he beautifies himself.
### 4
The bull bellows, and the milk-cows go in response. The goddesses go  to their rendezvous with the god.
He has stridden beyond the silvery sheep’s fleece. Soma has wrapped  himself in (milk) as if in a freshly washed cloak.
### 5
Being arrayed, the immortal tawny one has wrapped himself with an  unworn, gleaming garment.
With his might he has made the back of heaven for his raiment and an  underlayer made of cloud in the two cups.
### 6
Like the rays of the sun that set sleepers in motion, the exhilarating  (soma juices) arise all at once from sleep.
The swift surges (surge) around the stretched string [=filter]. But
without Indra he [=Soma] does not purify any domain of his.
### 7
As at the forward plunge of a river toward the deep, the swift
exhilarating drinks, roused by bulls, have achieved their course.
Weal (be) for our two-footed and our four-footed at their homecoming.  Let prizes and peoples stand by us, Soma.
### 8
By purifying yourself bring (wealth) in goods and gold, in horses, cows,  and barley, and an abundance of good heroes,
for you (soma-juices), o Soma, are my fathers, the heads of heaven, set  forth as creators of vitality for me.
### 9
These self-purifying soma juices have gone forth to Indra, like chariots  to a win.
Pressed, the tawny ones go beyond the ovine filter, having left behind  their cover, to the rain.
### 10
O drop, purify yourself for lofty Indra, since you are very merciful,  beyond reproach, caring for the stranger.
Bring gleaming goods to the singer. O Heaven and Earth, together with  the gods—further us.

Reṇu Viśvāmitra
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
An intricate and difficult hymn, some of whose puzzles remain unsolved. The  theme of the hymn is the difference between, and ultimate unity of, heavenly Soma  and earthly, ritual Soma—a theme that was also the subject of nearby IX.68. The  disjunction is announced in the first verse, where the “real” milk-mixture is pro
duced in heaven, and the worlds are Soma’s garment. In verse 2, by contrast, it  seems that the earthly Soma is seeking a share of his heavenly counterpart by per forming cosmic deeds through ritual means. A rapprochement is effected in verse  3, where Soma’s beacons (kétu) go to and work upon both men and gods, and as a  consequence they accept him as their king; on the basis of other passages in which  this term is found, the beacons appear to be both his cosmic sunlike rays and the  glinting streams of ritual soma as they circle in the filter. The intermediary role of  Soma between gods and men and Heaven and Earth remains the subject of the fol lowing verses (4–6), though not all is clear, especially the first half of verse 4 and  the last half of verse 6. The last four verses (7–10) return us to the ritual Soma and  his ultimate goal, the body of Indra, but the cosmic associations he acquired in the  earlier parts of the hymn make him nourishment fit for the gods.
### 1
Three times seven milk-cows have milked out for him the real
milk-mixture in the foremost distant heaven.
He made the four other dear worlds to be his raiment, when he grew  strong through the truths [=hymns].
### 2
Seeking a share of the dear immortal one, through his poetic skill he has  loosened both, Heaven (and Earth), from each other.
He lavishly wraps himself in the glinting-sharp waters when, by the god’s  [=Soma’s] fame, they [=waters] know his seat.
### 3
Let those immortal undeceivable beacons of his suffuse both races  [=gods and men],
the beacons by which both manly and godly (powers) become purified.  Just because of that have the zealous ones accepted him as their king. 4. He, being groomed by the ten who work well [=fingers], (goes) forth to  bellow forth amid the midmost mothers [=waters?].
Protecting the commandments of the dear immortal one [=heavenly
soma], having his sight on men, he surveys both clans [=gods
and men].
### 5
Constantly being groomed, propelled between the two worlds-halves, he  is roused to give suck to Indra.
With his blustering the bull thrusts away evil thoughts, always setting his  sights, like a sharpshooter, on rich spoils. 6. The ruddy one, becoming visible, goes (to Heaven and Earth) as if to  his two mothers, roaring again and again, like the clamor of the
Maruts.
Recognizing the first truth, which is the realm of solar splendor, he of  strong will has chosen it for his glorification.
### 7
The fearsome bull bellows forcefully, sharpening his golden horns,  wide-gazing.
Soma sits down upon his well-made womb. His skin comes to be made  of cattle; his garment of sheep.
### 8
Gleaming, purifying his spotless body, the tawny one has run down  onto the sheep’s back,
pleasing to Mitra, Varuṇa, and Vāyu. The honey is made threefold by  those who make it well.
### 9
Purify yourself as bull, Soma, to pursue the gods. Enter the heart of  Indra, which is the receptacle of Soma.
Ahead of oppression, carry us across difficulties, for he who knows the  territory tells the directions to the one who asks.
### 10
Like a team spurred on, rush to the prize. O drop, purify yourself into  the belly of Indra.
Carry us across (difficulties) as if across a river with a boat, since you  know how. Like a battling champion, rescue us from insult.

R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9
The subject of this hymn is, as so often, Soma’s journey across the filter to take  his seat as ritual drink after the various stages of preparation. The journey is pre sented as a straightforward trajectory on the one hand, with his arrival among  the gods and his union with the praise hymn the last step, in verse 8. But the  hymn is also structured by a number of responsions between the earlier and the  later verses; note especially 2b and 8a, with the almost identical phrases “the  color that is his” and “this is his color.” In this particular example the forward  movement of the journey and the architectonic structure of responsions comple ment each other, for in verse 2 Soma sheds his original form and color and in  verse 8 he gains new ones.
### 1
The tempestuous one is sent surging, along with the gift-cow, to take his  seat here. Vigilant, he pursues deceits and protects from the demon.
The tawny one makes himself a headdress, cloud and milk for an
underlayer in the two cups, and the sacred formulation for his raiment.1304 IX.72
### 2
Like a smiter of peoples, explosive he goes forth, roaring again and  again. He spills down the lordly color that is his.
He abandons his covering, and he goes to his rendezvous with his father.  He makes what floats nearby [=milk] in its full measure into his fresh  garment.
### 3
Pressed by the stones, he purifies himself between the two hands. With  his cloud he acts the bull [/rains]; he trembles (in poetic inspiration)
with his thought.
He rejoices in, unites with, achieves success through the song. He washes  himself in the waters. He sacrifices for himself in his fullness.
### 4
All around they sprinkle the heaven-ruling (son) of strength, of honey,  grown strong upon the mountain, the conqueror of the secure house, in whom, on whose head, the cows prepare the foremost (milk) in their
udder in broad (streams) for him who eats the good oblation [=Indra]. 5. The ten sisters on the two hands have assembled him like a chariot, here  in the lap of Aditi.
As he goes, he extends toward the secret track of the cow which the
thoughtful have produced for him.
### 6
Like a falcon to its womb [=nest], the god hastens to sit upon the golden  seat made by insight.
They let the dear one spill onto the ritual grass with a song. Like a horse  (its stall), the one worthy of the sacrifice approaches the gods.
### 7
Far away is the ruddy poet of heaven, all adorned. The three-backed bull  has bellowed to the cows.
The marshal who has a thousand ways and means [=Soma] radiates,  like the hoarse-voiced singer [=Agni], across the many dawns as they  go away.
### 8
He makes for himself a glittering form—that is his color. When he has  lain down in the clash (of the pressing stones), he wards off errors.
Winning the waters, he drives by his own will to the divine folk. He joins  with the lovely praise hymn, with what is tipped with cows.
### 9
Like a bull going around the herds, he has bellowed as he circles. He has  put on the glitterings of the sun.
The heavenly eagle looks down upon the earth. Soma surveys the
creatures in accord with his purpose.

Harimanta Āṅgirasa
9 verses: jagatī
The role of humans in both the physical and the verbal preparation of Soma is  emphasized in this hymn. The first verse sets this tone, with the anonymous priestly subjects of “they groom” of pāda a and the anonymous praisers who impel the  soma in the second half, a division of labor found as well in verse 2; see also verses  4–6, 8. The exact responsion of the last parts of 4d and 5b seem to mark an ompha los, but there is little other evidence for such a structure.
The hymn contains one major problem: the hapax vinaṃgr̥sá in 3c. The phrase ology in this pāda is strongly suggestive of erotic slang, but unfortunately the word  has so far defeated all attempts to decode it. It is worth noting, however, that it is a  partial anagram of the patronymic of the poet Harimanta Āṅgirasa, and he may be  punning on his name in this playful, erotic context.
### 1
They groom the tawny one [/fallow bay]; like a chestnut he is yoked.  Soma is anointed with milk-cows in the tub.
When he raises his voice, the circle of friends of the one praised by
many—however many they are—speed him on with their thought.
### 2
The many inspired thinkers speak all at once, when they have milked the  soma into the belly of Indra,
when the men of skilled hands groom him, the desirable honey, with the  ten belonging to the same nest [=fingers].
### 3
Not stopping, he goes beyond (the filter) toward the cows, across the  dear bellow of the Daughter of the Sun.
According to his pleasure, the vinaṃgr̥sa [?] “stuck it” to him. He dwells  together with the paired, kindred sisters [=fingers].
### 4
Rinsed by men, pressed by stones, the dear one on the ritual grass, the  husband of the cows, from of old the drop that follows the ritual
seasons,
accompanied by Plenitude, assuring success to the sacrifice of Manu,  gleaming, with insight he purifies himself for you, Indra.
### 5
Driven on by the two arms of men, pressed in a stream, following his  own nature Soma purifies himself for you, Indra.
He has fulfilled their intentions; he has won completely the thoughts at  the ceremony. Like a bird sitting in the wood the tawny one has taken  his seat in the two cups.
### 6
They milk the thundering, imperishable plant; the industrious inspired  poets (milk) the poet.
The cows and the thoughts in uninterrupted array, ever regenerating, go  together to him in the womb, the seat of truth.
### 7
On the navel of earth is the buttress of great heaven. In the wave of the  waters and within the rivers he is sprinkled.
The mace of Indra, the bull possessing conspicuous goods, the
invigorating soma purifies himself in a way dear to the heart.
### 8
Purify yourself all around the earthly realm, as you do your best for the  man who praises and the man who rinses (you), you very resolute one. Don’t deal us out of a portion of a good that will touch our
dwellings: might we clothe ourselves in ample golden wealth.
1306 IX.73
### 9
(Bring) here for us, o drop, a hundred shares of horses, a thousand shares  of flocks and gold.
Measure out lofty, rich refreshments. Give study to our praise,
self-purifying one.

73 (785) Soma Pavamāna
Pavitra Āṅgirasa
9 verses: jagatī
A complex and enigmatic hymn, whose difficulties stem primarily from the double  system of reference that pervades the hymn. The signature phrase is “they have  sounded in unison” (sám asvaran, vss. 1, 4, 5, 6); in none of its occurrences is there  an overt subject, an omission that is surely deliberate. The verb forms in ques
tion, and indeed most of the hymn, can be interpreted as referring either to the  soma streams as they noisily cross the filter or to the priests/poets who provide  the hymns that accompany soma’s journey. This double reference is found even in  the name of the poet to whom the hymn is attributed: Pavitra (“Filter”): the filter  is both the sheep’s wool filter that purifies the soma and the poet who creates the  ritual speech; the word pavítra occurs several times in the hymn (vss. 3, 7, 8, 9, and  implicitly 4). The “solution” to the central riddle of the hymn, this dual reference,  is suggested in the first half of verse 7 and definitely expressed in the final verse  (9), where “the thread of truth” (r̥tásya tántuḥ) is stretched both on the filter and  on the tongue-tip. The thread may be both the track of the soma across the filter  and the continuous line of speech. The second half of the verse emphasizes the  importance of united action to attain it, and the necessity of always advancing.
Another thematic strain is the deployment of the power of this unified sound  against enemies and hostile forces (see esp. vss. 5, 6, 8), a power associated with  Varuṇa and his māyā́ (“magic power, artifice,” vss. 5 and 9), with whom Soma is  identified, first in verse 3.  Varuṇa is of course the protector of commandments  (vratá, vss. 3, 5, 8) and is associated with truth/true speech (r̥tá, vss. 1, 6, 8, 9), words  prominent in the hymn. Thus, Soma, as the embodiment of Varuṇa, and the poets  who assist him can marshal Varuṇa’s weapon, “true speech,” against forces that  deny or attempt to thwart it.
Many individual puzzles remain, but the overall structure and purpose of the  hymn are clear.
### 1
In the jaw (of the pressing stones) while the droplet was blowing its blast,  they sounded in unison. The ties of lineage have joined together in the  womb of truth.
The lord [=Soma] has made his three heads to be seized. The boats of  the trusty one [=Soma] have brought the good (ritual) performer
across to the other shore. 2. Altogether joined together, the buffaloes have been propelled [/have  propelled (him)]. The seekers have set (him/speech) atremble in the
swell of the river.
Giving birth to the chant with the streams of honey, they have made  Indra’s own dear body grow strong.
### 3
Provided with the filter, they take their seats around speech. Their  ancient father guards his commandment.
As great Varuṇa, (Soma) has hidden himself in the sea. Only the
insightful have been able to take hold of his supports.
### 4
Down in that (filter) of a thousand streams, they have sounded in  unison—as have the honey-tongued, inexhaustible (streams) in the
vault of heaven.
His fervent spies do not blink: at every step there are snares that bind. 5. Those who sounded in unison from the father and the mother [=Heaven  and Earth], blazing with their verse, burning up those who follow no  commandment,
they blow away by magic power the black skin hated by Indra, from  earth and from heaven—
### 6
Those who sounded in unison from their ancient edifice, those with a  signaling call for their reins, counselors of the wild one [=Soma].
The blind and deaf have retreated: evildoers do not traverse the path  of truth.
### 7
Here in the wide-stretched filter of a thousand streams the poets of  inspired thought purify their speech.
The lively Rudras [=Maruts] without deceit are their spies, well directed,  lovely to see, with their eyes on men.
### 8
The herdsman of truth is not to be tricked: his will is strong. He has set  three filters within his heart.
Knowing, he looks upon all living creatures. He jabs the disgusting
deniers of commandments down into the pit.
### 9
The thread of truth is stretched widely, here on the filter and on the tip  of the tongue, through the magic power of Varuṇa.
Only the insightful, seeking to reach it together, have attained it. The one  who does not advance will fall down into the pit here.

74 (786) Soma Pavamāna
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8
This hymn is attributed to Kakṣīvant, the skilled and crafty poet of I.116–126,  who names himself in verse 8. Although it is not as intricate as some of his Ist  Maṇḍala productions, it invites the same sort of double readings as the previous
1308 IX.74
hymn (IX.73) and achieves this ambiguity by the same means, the suppression of  overt referential subjects and objects. It is notable that the word sóma appears only  twice (and only toward the end, vss. 7 and 9) and derivatives of the root pū “purify”  only in the final verse.
The primary doubled reference arises from the identification of soma with rain.  Particularly in the central verses 4–6 the entities and actions described can apply to  either or both; for example, the men “pissing down” the unnamed substance in 4d  may either be the Maruts producing rain or the priests producing soma. Toward the  end the discourse becomes more clearly somian, and these are the verses in which  the words “soma” and “self-purifying” appear.
### 1
Like a new-born (calf), he has roared down into the wood(en vessel).  When the ruddy racehorse strives to win the sun,
he keeps company with the milk-strong semen of heaven. We implore  him for extensive protection through his benevolence.
### 2
The (soma) plant, the prop and buttress of heaven, which, when well  extended and fully filled, encompasses in every direction,
that (plant) will offer sacrifice to these two great world-halves when they  turn hither. The poet unites the united pair and the refreshing drinks. 3. A great delight is the well-prepared somian honey, and wide is the  pasture-land of Aditi for him who goes to truth,
who, as a dawn-red bull, is master of the rain from here, who is the
leader of the waters, ageless and worthy of verses.
### 4
The embodied cloud is milked of ghee and milk. The navel of truth, the  immortal (drink) is born.
United, possessed of good drops, they please him. The swollen men piss  down the one propelled.
### 5
The plant, keeping company with the wave, has roared. For Manu it  swells the skin that seeks out the gods.
It deposits the embryo in the lap of Aditi, the one by which we will
acquire both progeny and prosperity.
### 6
Let there be inexhaustible (streams) down in the (filter) of a thousand  streams, and in the third realm (streams) bringing offspring.
The four hidden (streams), bursting down from heaven, dripping with  ghee, carry the oblation, the immortal (drink).
### 7
He makes himself a white form when he is striving to win. Soma,
benefactor and lord, knows the world.
He keeps company with insight and (ritual) labor—that is the course  (that leads) to him. He will split open the water-filled cask of heaven. 8. And the racehorse, having won, has stridden to the gleaming white tub  anointed with cows, at the finish line.
Those serving the gods propel him with their mind. (Let there be a
hundred) cows for Kakṣīvant of a hundred winters. 9. Your juice, when you have been infused with the waters, runs through the  sheep’s fleece, o self-purifying one.
Being groomed by the poets, become sweet for Indra to drink, o most  exhilarating self-purifying one.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: jagatī
Soma’s deep, almost reflexive, involvement in verbal products and production is  the subject of the first two verses of the hymn. He strengthens himself on his own  names in verse 1, and in verse 2 is both the physical (tongue, speaker) and concep tual (father) source of truth and insight. In the second half of verse 2, in the sort of  paradox much beloved by R̥gvedic seers, he not only knows the hidden names but  as son bestows them on his parents.
The remaining three verses are more conventionally concerned with the prepara tion of the ritual soma, though his connection with cosmic entities remains clear,  especially in verse 4.
This hymn and the four following (IX.75–70) are attributed to the same poet as  the gāyatrī hymns IX.47–49.
### 1
Delighted, he purifies himself, (aiming) toward his own dear names, upon  which the youthfully exuberant one grows strong.
The lofty one, wide gazing, has mounted upon the chariot of the lofty  sun that faces in many directions.
### 2
As the tongue of truth, he purifies himself as his own dear honey—he,  the speaker and father of this insight, who cannot be deceived.
The son sets a secret name on his two parents and a third in the
luminous realm of heaven.
### 3
Flashing, he has roared down toward the tubs, being guided by men into  the golden bucket.
Those who produce the milk of truth have bellowed to him.

Pressed with stones, delighted by our thoughts, making the two

Run forth all around, Soma, for our well-being. As you are being purified  by men, dress yourself in the milk-mixture.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: jagatī
This portrait of Soma militant resembles the martial spirit of another of Kavi  Bhārgava’s hymns, IX.47. The dense series of combative images also track Soma’s  journey through the purificatory procedure, and his warlike power is to be har nessed for our own ends in the final verse (5). But Soma is not merely a warrior; he  is also a master of verbal art, who triumphs in poetic competitions (vs. 4). A short  but very satisfying poem.
### 1
The supporter of heaven purifies himself, the sap that gets results, the  skill of the gods to be celebrated by men.
The tawny one sent surging, like a charger by warriors, deploys his full  dimensions in the rivers at will.
### 2
Like a champion, he takes his weapons in his hands, a chariot-rider  striving to win the sun in the cattle raids.
Rousing Indra’s tempestuous force, the drop propelled by the industrious  ones [=fingers] is anointed [/driven] by those of inspired thought.
### 3
O Soma, purifying yourself in a wave, displaying your power, enter the  belly of Indra.
Swell the two worlds for us, as lightning does the rain clouds. As if
according to our vision, mete out prizes to us over and over.
### 4
He purifies himself, the king of all who see the sun. Vanquishing the  seers, he has made the vision of truth bellow.
He who is groomed by the lance [=ray] of the sun is the father of
thoughts, one whose poetic skill is entirely unattainable.
### 5
Like a bull around the herds, you charge around the cask, a bull roaring  again and again in the lap of the waters.
You purify yourself to be most invigorating for Indra, so that we who  have your help will conquer in the clash.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: jagatī
In addition to familiar tropes of soma-preparation (e.g., vss. 1, 3, 4), the hymn  briefly treats the famous myth in which a falcon steals soma from heaven (vs.  2), with one of the few R̥gvedic mentions of the heavenly archer Kr̥śānu, who  attempted retaliation. As noted, verse 4 for the most part is a standard soma verse,  but pāda c skates fleetingly and unemphatically over an apparent paradox, with a male Soma conceiving himself as his own embryo. In the final verse Soma is com pared to Varuṇa, because of his control over truth and deceit, and to Mitra, in his  role as mediator among communities.
### 1
This honeyed one has cried out in the bucket, the mace of Indra, more  wondrous than any wonder.
The good milkers of truth, dripping with ghee, rush bellowing to him,  like milk-cows with their milk.
### 2
The primordial one purifies himself—he whom the falcon, propelled  across the airy realm, stole from heaven.
Quivering, with a mind fearing Kr̥śānu the archer, it [=falcon] binds on  the honey.
### 3
Let these drops, those ahead and those behind, run to a great prize of  cows for us—
those drops worth looking at, cherished like fertile cows, which take  pleasure in every sacred formulation, every oblation.
### 4
This one here, knowing how, will win against those who seek to win—the  drop praised by many with fully focused mind,
who has conceived the embryo in the seat of the powerful one and rushes  to the wide-open pen of cows.
### 5
The active, effective sap of heaven purifies himself as great Varuṇa, not  to be deceived by one who goes astray.
The one worthy of the sacrifice has been pressed as Mitra in the (ritual)  enclosures [/communities], constantly whinnying like a charger acting  the bull in the herd.

Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: jagatī
A fairly straightforward hymn. The first three verses treat the preparation of the  soma: after being swollen with water it is sent forth into the filter, which captures  the plant detritus, on its way to the milk mixture (vs. 1); it goes across the filter and  into the cup (vs. 2); and it is mixed with waters, here unusually personified as the  nymph-like females, the Apsarases (vs. 3). The last two verses list the benefits that  will accrue to us when the gods drink the soma.
### 1
The king, begetting speech, has flowed forth; clothing himself in the  waters, he seeks to attain to the cows.
The sheep grasps his defilement, (the stems) attached to his body.
Cleansed, he travels to his rendezvous with the gods.
1312 IX.79
### 2
For Indra, o Soma, you are poured in circles by the men. As a wave  drawing the gaze of men, as poet, you are driven to the wood
[/anointed in the wood],
for there are many courses for you to travel and a thousand fallow bay  horses sitting in the cups.
### 3
The Apsarases belonging to the sea, sitting within, have streamed toward  Soma of inspired thought.
They spur him on, the conqueror of the secure house; they beg the
imperishable self-purifying one for his grace.
### 4
Winning cows for us, winning chariots and gold, winning the sun and the  waters, winning thousands, Soma purifies himself,
whom the gods have made their exhilarating draught for drinking, the  sweetest ruddy drop, who is joy itself.
### 5
O Soma, purifying yourself, you rush, seeking us, while making these  treasures real.
Smash the rival nearby and the one who is in the distance; make wide  pasturage and fearlessness for us.

79 (791) Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: jagatī
The combative spirit of this hymn is reminiscent of that in other hymns attributed  to Kavi Bhārgava, especially IX.47 and IX.76. The hymn is especially interesting  because of the light it throws on social divisions in the R̥gvedic period. The word arí (vss. 1, 3), here translated “stranger” following Thieme (1938), is a much-discussed  and much-contested one, underlying as it does derivatives such as ā́rya “Ārya.”  We are of the opinion that an arí is a member of the larger Ārya society, but not  of one’s immediate community. He is thus a stranger, but one with whom one in  principle shares social values and to whom one owes certain reciprocal duties, such  as hospitality. But as a stranger he may also pose a threat to the smaller community  one belongs to, if he exhibits hostility rather than a communal spirit. The scenario  sketched in this hymn involves the latter type of arí, whose hostility menaces the  success of our sacrifice (vs. 1). Verse 3 is quite explicit about the affinity of the  arí: he is “one of our own,” while a person who does not belong to the larger Ārya  society is called a “wolf,” an outlaw, when his actions threaten us. The poet calls on  Soma to destroy both types of enemies.
Verse 4 provides a brief interlude, outlining the cosmic dimensions of Soma— from heaven to earth, where his “fingers,” the shoots of the plant, grow—and a few  details of the preparation, vividly rendered. This verse cleverly incorporates four  different body parts (navel, fingers, skin, and hands) each belonging to a different entity. The final verse summarizes the process of pressing and calls once more for  Soma to display his feistiness on our behalf.
### 1
Without impulsion let our tawny drops run, forth to those dwelling in  lofty heaven, when they are pressed.
If hostilities will reach our refreshments, those of the stranger will go to  destruction. Our insightful thoughts will prevail.
### 2
Let our drops run forth, those arousing exhilaration, or (those) with  which we speed the chargers to the stakes,
across the crookedness of any mortal. May we always bear away the stakes. 3. Now, in the case of the hostility of one of our own, (we proclaim:) “he,  indeed, is a stranger!” And, in the case of the hostility belonging to
the other (side), (we proclaim:) “he, indeed, is a wolf!”
As if in a desert, thirst should strike them. O self-purifying Soma, smite  those of evil intent.
### 4
It was in heaven, in its navel to which your highest (form) was bound;  your “fingers” have grown on the back of the earth.
The stones gnaw you on the skin of the cow. Those of inspired thought  milk you in the waters with their hands.
### 5
In just this way, o drop, do those foremost ones, excelling in splendor,  express your sap of good essence and good ornament.
Self-purifying one, you will undermine every scorn(er). Let your
tempestuous spirit, your dear exhilaration become manifest.

5 verses: jagatī
On the one hand, this hymn is somewhat static, stuck at the same stage of soma’s  preparation, as the almost exact responsion of the last two verses (4–5) emphasizes.  On the other hand, Soma’s relationship with the gods, especially Indra, a relation ship that figures in every verse, enlarges the conceptual frame of the hymn and  keeps it from seeming airless.
### 1
It purifies itself—the stream of Soma, who has the gaze of men. With  truth he summons the gods from heaven.
With the roar of Br̥haspati he has flashed forth. Like seas they [=the  waters?] envelop the pressings.
### 2
You, o prizewinner, toward whom the cows have bellowed—brilliant, you  mount the metal-hammered womb [=cup].
Lengthening the lifetime of the bounteous ones and their great fame, o  Soma, for Indra you purify yourself as bullish exhilaration.1314 IX.81
### 3
The most exhilarating one purifies himself in the cheek of Indra, the  one of good omen clothing himself in nourishment [=milk], for fame. He spreads himself out facing toward all creatures. Playful, the tawny  bullish steed flows.
### 4
You, most honeyed, do the men milk for the gods; you of a thousand  streams do the ten fingers milk.
O Soma, roused by men, pressed by stones, by purifying yourself bring  all the gods here, you winner of thousands.
### 5
You, honeyed, do those having hands milk with stones; you the bull do  the ten fingers milk in the waters.
Exhilarating Indra and the divine race, o Soma, purifying yourself, you  rush like the wave of a river.

Vasu Bhāradvāja
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5
Attributed to the same poet as the preceding hymn (IX.80), this hymn concerns  itself even more strongly with Soma’s connection with the gods, devoting the final  two verses of a five-verse hymn to a litany of gods invited to the soma sacrifice. The  preceding verse contains two occurrences of the word vásu “good (one),” which is  also the name of the poet. Soma’s task of mediating between the world of gods and  men is treated in verse 2, anticipating the appeal for his help to the poet in verse 3  and the invitation to the gods in verses 4–5.
### 1
The bedizened waves of self-purifying soma go forth to the belly
of Indra,
when, ladled up with the curds, with the glorious (product) of the cows,  the pressings have exhilarated the champion for giving.
### 2
For soma has flowed to the tubs. Like a steed that pulls (the chariot), the  bull has a rapid course,
and knowing of the double birth of gods (and men), he attains to what is  from yonder and what from here.
### 3
O Soma, purifying yourself, scatter goods for us; o drop, become a  bounteous (giver) of great largesse.
Conferrer of vigor, do your best for the good one [/Vasu] with your  kind attention. Do not pour away your property at a distance
from us.

Let Pūṣan, self-purifying (Soma), Mitra, and Varuṇa come here in  fellowship, bringing us lovely presents—
and Br̥haspati, the Maruts, Vāyu, the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar, Savitar, and
Sarasvatī, who is easy to guide. 5. Both Heaven and Earth who set all in motion, god Aryaman, Aditi, the  Apportioner,

82 (794) Soma Pavamāna
Vasu Bhāradvāja
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5
The first two verses of this hymn are conventional treatments of Soma’s journey  across the filter and his mixing with milk (here called ghee). Verse 3, however, is more  cryptically phrased, and the name Soma is not mentioned. He appears as a buffalo  with feathers and/or leaves, and his father is Parjanya (“thunder”): the image is of a  plant produced by the rains. As often, his home is in the mountains, here identified  as the navel of the earth. And the rinsing waters, the milk, and the pressing stones  of the ritual preparation appear in the second half of the verse. Verse 4 is notable  for its 1st-person singular speaker; the abrupt phrase “Listen:  I  am speaking to  you” is reminiscent of the famous command given by the goddess Speech (Vāc) in  X.125.4 “Listen to me, you who are listened to. It’s a trustworthy thing I tell you.”  First-person singular speech is quite rare in Maṇḍala IX. The combination of a rid dling middle verse and the poet’s announcement of his own speech is reminiscent of  omphalos hymns, though there is little other support for such a structure.
### 1
Soma has been pressed—the ruddy, tawny bull. Wondrous like a king, he  has roared to the cows.
While being purified, he circles around the sheep’s fleece, to sit, like a  falcon, on his ghee-filled womb.
### 2
As a poet with ritual expertise, you circle around the great (filter).  Groomed like a steed, you rush to the prize.
Warding off difficulties, o Soma, be merciful. Wearing ghee as your
raiment, you drive around.
### 3
Parjanya is the father of the feathered [/leafy] buffalo. In the navel of the  earth, on the mountains he has established his dwelling place.
The sister waters have also flowed to the cows. He will unite with the  stones when the ceremony is undertaken.
### 4
(Kindly) like a wife to her husband, you, kindly one, are generous of  yourself. O embryo of the steadfast (earth?), listen: I am speaking to you: amid the choir I shall advance to good living. O Soma, irreproachable,  be watchful in the ritual enclosure [/community].
### 5
Just as for the earlier ones you encompassed the prize as a winner of  hundreds, of thousands, not shirking, o drop,
so purify yourself for renewed good progress. The waters follow your  commandment.

83 (795) Soma Pavamāna
Pavitra Āṅgirasa
5 verses: jagatī
A well-known hymn, whose manifold difficulties are also well known. It in many  ways resembles the famous Vena hymn, X.123, which also involves a mystical iden tification between Soma and the sun. The double meanings and enigmas are, as  often, fostered by the suppression of overt reference. Crucial verbs lack expressed  subjects, and unidentified asya “of him/it” substitutes for expressed possession (see  2b, 2c, 3c, 4a). The word sóma does not appear in the hymn at all, nor do his com mon epithets. The hymn has elicited many different and contradictory interpreta tions, to which we add our own.
Attributed to the same poet as IX.73, this hymn shares with that earlier one  the mystical metaphor of the filter (pavítra), which is also the name of the poet.  Indeed, the words “outstretched” and “filter,” construed with each other in the last  verse of IX.73 (vs. 9), open this hymn, and the two verses (73.9 and 83.1) both con
cern the qualities required to attain the filter and what it represents. In this hymn  the necessary quality is being cooked, rather than raw; it is somewhat startling to  encounter this whiff of Claude Lévi-Strauss very much avant la lettre. In this con text “cooked” must refer in the first instance to the ritual preparation of soma.  Although this preparation does not involve literal cooking, via application of heat,  it clearly turns the raw material extracted from the natural plant into a cultural  product, both through physical manipulation and through verbal accompaniment.
But the filter metaphor has a cosmic dimension, as is especially clear in verse  2, where it is compared to the sun with its rays spread across the sky like the  tracks of the soma across the filter. The “cooking” of verse 1 provides a neat  transition to the “hot one” of verse 2, heat being an obvious characteristic of  the sun.
Verse 3 and the first half of verse 4 are quite enigmatic—not surprisingly, given  their position in the middle of the hymn. Both the “dappled one” and the “ox” can  refer both to the Sun and to Soma, each of whom is also associated with dawn,  and the first half of the verse thus continues the Sun/Soma identification of verse  2. The second half of verse 3 appears to contain one of those paradoxes beloved  of R̥gvedic bards. In our (very tentative) interpretation, the forefathers are the  ancestral poet-sacrificers or their divine prototypes. They both “set” the embryo  of Soma/Sun, that is, engendered it, and they were themselves made into poets by  the magic power or artifice (māyā́) of the same Soma/Sun. In this way the Soma/ Sun is both progenitor of the forefathers in their ritual role and, as they fulfill their  ritual role, their child. The identity of the Gandharva in verse 4 is not entirely clear,  but on the basis of parallels, especially in the Vena hymn mentioned above, it seems  likely that it is again a double reference to Soma and the Sun, each guarding his track (or perhaps the track of the other), thus taking up the theme of the track  found in verse 2.
With the second half of verse 4 we return to a much clearer ritual context  and to the filter with which we began. The filter traps the impurities of the soma  as the liquid passes over it, and the priests attain (a reprise of the verb found  twice in vs. 1) the prepared soma. The final verse (5) returns to the 2nd-person  address to the ritual Soma, last found in the first half of verse 1. But the Soma  thus addressed has achieved a much-elevated status:  he is proclaimed a king,  outfitted with cosmic garments and traveling a cosmic course, with the filter, the  focus of the hymn, as his chariot. The very last words of the hymn attribute to  him “lofty fame.”
The omphalos structure of the hymn is quite pronounced. The outermost verses  (1ab, 5)  are couched in the 2nd person and have a clear ritual content, with an  inner ring (vss. 1cd/2ab, 4cd) serving as transition between the ritual context and  the mystical identifications. There are a number of formal responsions that mark  these rings, besides the 2nd versus 3rd person of verses 1 and 5: pavítram (1a, 2a)  / pavítra(-ratha) (5c); páry eṣi (1b) / pári yāsi (5b); āśata (1d, 4d); padá- (2a, 4a).  Enclosed within these rings are the mysterious and shifting identifications that  make the hymn both aggravating and mesmerizing.
### 1
The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred formulation.  Advancing, you circle around its limbs on all sides.
A raw one, with unheated body, does not attain it [=filter]; only the
cooked ones, driving along, have attained it entirely.
### 2
The filter of the hot one is outstretched to the track of heaven; its blazing  threads have been extended.
His swift (steeds) aid the Purifier. They mount the back of heaven in  their manifestation.
### 3
The dappled one at the front has made the dawns shine. The ox, seeking  the prize, bears the worlds.
They were measured out [=created] as masters of artifice by his artifice;  the forefathers having their gaze on men set the embryo.
### 4
The Gandharva guards his track just so; the infallible one protects the  races of the gods.
The lord of snares [=filter] grasps the defiler with his snare. Those who  best perform (ritual) action have attained the draught of honey.
### 5
You possessor of the oblation, as an oblation yourself you drive around  the great heavenly seat, around the ceremonial course, clothing
yourself in cloud.
As king, having the filter as your chariot, you have mounted the prize.  Having a thousand spikes, you win lofty fame.

Prajāpati Vācya
5 verses: jagatī
Unlike the last hymn, this one concentrates on the preparation of the soma, and,  although he has a cosmic dimension (see esp. vs. 2), it is always clear that Soma is  the topic and the referent. The most interesting image is found in verse 2, where  Soma “performs the knotting and unknotting.” On the ritual level, this phrase  probably refers to Soma’s journey through the tangle of sheep’s wool on the filter,  but comparison with IX.97.18 suggests that it also has moral force, with Soma  separating and distinguishing the straight way from the crooked one.
### 1
Purify yourself—exhilarating the gods, unbounded, winning the waters— for Indra, for Varuṇa, for Vāyu.
Make for us today wide space accompanied by well-being. Sing to the  heavenly people in the wide dwelling place.
### 2
He who has mounted the worlds, immortal Soma flows around them all. Performing the knotting and unknotting in order to prevail, the drop  accompanies (the gods?), like the sun the dawn.
### 3
He who is sent surging along with the cows onto the plants, prospering in  the benevolence of the gods, bringing goods near at hand,

This very Soma is purifying himself, thousand-winning, spurring on the  vigorous speech that awakens at dawn.

Vena Bhārgava
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 11–12
The last two hymns of the jagatī group, IX.85–86, break the standard pattern of  decreasing numbers of verses, having twelve and forty-eight verses respectively, after  a group of hymns with five verses (IX.75–84). However, each of these longer hymns  can be divided into a series of shorter ones, which then conform to the patterns of  hymn arrangement. In the case of IX.85, it consists of three groups of four verses  each. The entire assemblage is attributed to Vena Bhārgava, also the supposed poet of the enigmatic “Vena” hymn (X.123; see also a brief discussion under IX.83). As  we will see, there are certainly striking similarities between the last quartet of IX.85  (vss. 9–12) and X.123.
The first quartet (vss. 1–4) begins with Soma the militant, keeping unworthy and  hostile forces at bay and aiding Indra in the same enterprise (vss. 1–2). His relation ship to Indra persists in verses 3–4, which show a more positive side of the militant  Soma: his status as king (vs. 3) and winner of space for us (vs. 4).
The second section (vss. 5–8) is quite straightforward and focuses on the purifi cation of the soma, deploying the standard tropes.
As noted the final four verses (9–12) strongly resemble the Vena hymn (X.123),  but they are considerably easier to decode. They concern heavenly Soma, who is  identified with the sun, but who also appears in a number of different guises: a bull,  a poet, and a king (all in vs. 9), an ox (vs. 10), an eagle, a child, and a bird (vs. 11),  and finally a Gandharva (vs. 12).
### 1
O Soma, when well pressed, flow around for Indra. Let affliction be gone,  along with demonic power.
Let the duplicitous not reach the exhilaration of your sap: let the
wealth-bringing drops be here.
### 2
Spur us on in the clash, self-purifying one, for you are the skill of the  gods, their dear exhilarating drink.
Smash the rivals; (come) here to those seeking blessings. Drink the soma,  Indra; smash down the scorners for us.
### 3
Undeceivable, you purify yourself as most exhilarating, o drop; you  become the very self of Indra, the highest wellspring.
Many men of inspired thought cry out to him; they seek out the king of  this creation.
### 4
Having a thousand channels and a hundred streams, unerring, the drop,  the desirable honey purifies itself for Indra.
Winning a dwelling place, winning the waters, rush onward. Make a wide  course for us, o Soma the rewarder.
### 5
Ever roaring, you are anointed [/driven] with cows in(to) the tub. You  rush across the sheep’s fleece all at once.
Constantly being groomed like a winning steed, Soma, you have flowed  entirely into the belly of Indra.

Purify yourself sweet for the heavenly breed, sweet for Indra whose name  is lovely to call,
sweet for Mitra, Varuṇa, Vāyu, Br̥haspati—as the honeyed one not to be  deceived.

Purifying themselves, they rush to the lovely praise hymn. The

The wide-gazing bull has mounted heaven. The poet has caused the  luminous realms of heaven to shine forth.
The king goes ever bellowing across the filter. Those having the eyes of  men milk for themselves the beestings of heaven.

In the vault of heaven the seekers milk honey-tongued, inexhaustible  (streams) from the mountain-dwelling ox,
the droplet growing strong in the waters, in the sea, the honeyed one in  the wave of the river, in the filter.

The eagle that has flown to the vault—the many hymns of the trackers  yearned after (him).
The thoughts lick the child who always excites wonder, the golden bird  standing on the earth.

Akrṣṭā ̥ s, the Māṣā seer-group (1–10); Siktatās, the Nivāvarī seer-group (11–20); Prś̥ nis,  the Ajā seer-group (21–30); Atris (31–40); Atri Bhauma (41–45); Grtsam ̥ ada (46–48) 48 verses: jagatī, arranged in trcas ̥
As noted in the introduction to IX.85, this last hymn of the jagatī group, one of the  longest in the R̥gveda, can actually be easily divided into smaller hymns, in this case  into sixteen sets of tr̥cas, and can thus be made to conform to the patterns of hymn  arrangement. The resulting triadic groupings do not at all match the divisions in  the Anukramaṇī reproduced above. The degree of internal cohesion between tr̥cas  varies considerably: some show no obvious signs of unity, while others (e.g., vss.  28–30) are stylistically unified. There is also some chaining across tr̥ca boundar
ies; for example, verse 4, which begins the second tr̥ca, is strictly parallel to verses  1 and 2 (especially the former). Such chaining is not an argument against the tr̥ca  division, as perceived similarities between particular tr̥cas might have dictated the  arrangement of originally separate hymns. The last tr̥ca (vss. 46–48), attributed to  Gr̥tsamada, ends with the Gr̥tsamada clan refrain of Maṇḍala II.
That said, the impression this sprawling collection gives is of an agglomeration  of soma-hymn clichés, many of which are repeated with little or no variation at  irregular intervals throughout the “hymn.” 1.

The heavenly, fine-feathered, honeyed drops, most exhilarating, take  their seats around the cask.

Your beacons circle around all the domains, though you are in

Reaching through (the domains), you purify yourself, Soma, according  to your ordinances. You rule as lord of all creation.

The rays, the beacons of the self-purifying one circle around on both  sides, though he stays fixed.
When the fallow bay is groomed in the filter, seated in his womb, he sits  down in the tubs.

Beacon of the sacrifice, lovely at the ceremony, he purifies himself.  Soma proceeds toward the rendezvous with the gods.
Having a thousand streams, he rushes around the cask. The bull keeps  bellowing as he goes across the filter.

He purifies himself, always finding the fellowship of Indra. Soma, while  being purified, sits in the tubs.
### 10
Light of the sacrifice, he purifies himself as its dear honey, the father,  begetter of the gods, possessing conspicuous goods.
He establishes a secret treasure in the two independent powers
[=Heaven and Earth], as the most invigorating exhilarating
Indrian sap.
1322 IX.86
### 11
Roaring toward the tub, the prize-seeker rushes, the lord of heaven with  his hundred streams, wide-gazing.
The fallow bay sits in the seats of Mitra, the bull constantly being  groomed by the sheep, the streams.
### 12
At the forefront of the rivers, purifying himself he rushes; at the  forefront of speech he goes foremost among the cows.
At the forefront of the prize(-contest) he takes great stakes as his share.  The bull of good weapons is purified by the pressers.
### 13
This one here, accompanied by thought, like a bird spurred on has run  into the sheep’s (fleece), purifying himself in a wave.
By your resolve, o sage poet, by your insight, the clear Soma purifies  himself between the two world-halves for you, o Indra.
### 14
Clothing himself in a mantle that touches heaven, the one worthy of the  sacrifice, filling the midspace, is fitted into the worlds.
While being born, he has stridden along the cloud toward the sun; he  wishes to entice his age-old father here.
### 15
He extends his great shelter to the clan, when he has reached through  his first domain.
What is his footprint in the highest distant heaven—from that he  proceeds toward all the (streams) in uninterrupted array.
### 16
Forth has the drop proceeded to the rendezvous with Indra: a comrade  does not transgress against an agreement with his comrade.
As a young blood rushes together with young women, so does Soma— into the tub, along a path with a hundred courses.
### 17
Forth have your insights stridden, arousing exhilaration, expressing  admiration, inviting admiration in their joint dwellings.
The inspired thoughts, the rhythms have roared to Soma; the milk-cows  have mixed him with milk.
### 18
O Soma, o drop, purifying yourself, bring us continuous, swelling,  unfailing refreshment by purifying yourself,
(refreshment) that, never drying up, will milk out for us three times  a day an abundance of good heroes, along with cattle, prizes,
and honey.
### 19
The bull of the thoughts, wide gazing, purifies himself—Soma, the  lengthener of day, of dawn, of heaven.
Through the action of the rivers he has made the tubs bellow, entering  the heart of Indra through (the action of) the inspired ones.
### 20
Through the inspired ones the primordial poet purifies himself; guided  by men he has roared around the casks.
Engendering the name of Trita, he flows as honey, to create the
partnership of Indra and Vāyu. 21. This one here, being purified, has made the dawns shine widely; this one  has become the maker of wide space for the rivers.
This one, having milked thrice seven (cows) for his own milk-mixture— the exhilarating Soma purifies himself in a way dear to the heart.
### 22
Purify yourself, Soma, in the heavenly domains, surging into the tub,  into the filter, o drop.
Sitting in the belly of Indra, ever roaring, guided by the men, you have  made the sun mount in heaven.
### 23
Pressed by the stones, you purify yourself in the filter, o drop, entering  the belly of Indra.
You have become one whose gaze is on men, wide-gazing one. Soma,  you opened up the cowpen for the Aṅgirases.
### 24
You, o Soma, purifying yourself, do the very attentive poets applaud as  they seek help.
You did the fine-feathered (falcon) carry here from heaven, o drop, you  who are adorned all over with all thoughts.
### 25
Seven milk-cows roar toward the tawny one being purified on the  sheep’s fleece in a wave all around.
Into the lap of the waters, into the womb of truth have the Āyus, the  buffaloes propelled the poet.
### 26
The drop being purified plunges beyond the scorners, making all paths  good for the worshipful one.
Making the cows into his raiment, the delightful poet, playful like a
steed, rushes around the fleece.
### 27
Inexhaustible, possessing a hundred streams, excelling in beauty  [/serving as mixture], they [=mixing waters] roar down to the tawny
one as they provide water.
The fingers groom him wreathed with cows, on the third back, in the  luminous realm of heaven.
### 28
Yours are these offspring of the heavenly semen; you rule over all  creation.
And all this here is under your will, self-purifying one. You are the
foremost founder of foundations, o drop.
### 29
You are the sea, o poet, the all-knowing [/-finding] one; yours are these  five regions in your [/their] expansion.
You have carried yourself beyond heaven and earth; yours are the
lights, self-purifying one, and the sun.
### 30
You, o self-purifying Soma, are purified for the gods in the filter, in the  expansion of space.
You did the fire-priests first grasp; to you have all these worlds
submitted themselves.1324 IX.86
### 31
The husky-voiced one goes forth across the sheep’s fleece; the tawny bull  has roared down into the woods [/wooden vessels].
The hymnic visions, bellowing [/in their longing], have roared together.  The thoughts lick the child who always excites wonder.
### 32
He has enveloped himself with the rays of the sun, stretching his own  threefold thread, in the way that is known.
Leading the newer directives of truth, as a husband he proceeds to the  rendezvous with his wives.
### 33
The king of rivers, the lord of heaven purifies himself. He proceeds  along the paths of truth, ever roaring.
The tawny one is poured around with his thousand streams as he is  being purified, begetting speech, bringing goods near at hand.
### 34
Purifying yourself as a great flood, brilliant like the sun, you run across  the fleecy filters.
Hand-purified by the men, pressed by the stones, you dash for the great  rich prize.
### 35
Self-purifying one, you rush toward refreshment and nourishment. Like  a falcon in the woods, you sit in the tubs.
For Indra is pressed the exhilarative, exhilarating drink of exhilaration,  the utmost prop of heaven, wide-gazing.
### 36
The seven sisters, as mothers, (go) to the newborn child of worthy birth,  who is attentive to poetic inspiration,
the heavenly Gandharva of the waters, whose gaze is on men—to  Soma, for the regulation of all creation.
### 37
Showing mastery, you speed across these worlds here, o drop, having  hitched up your golden fine-feathered (mares).
Let them stream honeyed ghee and milk for you. O Soma, let the  separate peoples stay under your commandment.
### 38
You, Soma, are one whose gaze is on men on every side. Purifying  yourself, bull, you run across these (worlds).
Purify yourself in a manner rich in goods and gold for us. May we be  (fit) to live in the worlds.
### 39
Purify yourself, as finder of cattle, of goods, of gold. Depositing seed, o  drop, you are fitted into the worlds.
You, Soma, are rich in good heroes, finder of all [/all-knowing]. These  inspired poets here reverently approach you with a hymn.
### 40
The wave of honey has raised (our?) desires; clothing himself in waters,  the buffalo plunges through them.
The king whose chariot is the filter has mounted the prize. He of a  thousand spikes wins lofty fame.
### 41
He rouses all blessings, consisting of offspring and easy to bear,  through our whole lifetime, day upon day. Then, o drop, when drunk, on our behalf beg Indra for a sacred
formulation bringing offspring and for wealth consisting of horses in  the homestead.
### 42
At the vanguard of the days [=dawn] the tawny, delightful, exhilarating  drink makes himself conspicuous with his appearance through the days. Setting in place the two peoples [=gods and men], he speeds between  them in upholding the “praise of men” and the heavenly (praise).
### 43
They anoint him—anoint him separately and jointly. They lick (him  who is) resolve; they anoint him with honey—
him, the ox flying in the burbling up of the river. (The waters,) who
purify the gold (of soma), grasp the stock-animal within themselves.
### 44
Sing to the self-purifying one who is attentive to poetic inspiration. Like  a great stream he rushes beyond his stalk;
like a snake he slinks beyond his withered skin. Playful like a steed, the  tawny bull has run.
### 45
Going in the vanguard, the king who is found in the waters displays his  power, the measure(r) of the days, fitted into the worlds.
The ghee-backed fallow bay, a flood lovely to see, having light as his  chariot, accustomed to wealth, purifies himself.
### 46
It has been sent surging—the prop of heaven, the exhilarating drink  held aloft. It rushes threefold around the worlds.
The thoughts lick the plant that always excites wonder, when the
versifiers have come to array it with a hymn.
### 47
Your streams go forth beyond the fine (hairs) of the ewe; as you are  being purified, there go continuous charges.
When, o drop, you are anointed with cows in the two cups, being
pressed you sit in the tubs, Soma.
### 48
Purify yourself, Soma, finding the will, to be hymned by us. Run around  in the sheep’s fleece as dear honey.
Smite all rapacious demons, o drop. – May we speak loftily at the ritual  distribution, in possession of good heroes.
Trisṭubh Hymns: 87–97 ̣

87 (799) Soma Pavamāna
Uśanas Kāvya
9 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn, attributed to Uśanas Kāvya (perhaps because of the mention of that  figure in vs. 3), is built in part of standard soma-hymn tropes, but the militant
1326 IX.87
Soma is particularly on view (vss. 2, 7), as well as his association with Indra (vss.  4, 8, 9). There are also the faintest sketches of Soma’s participation in well-known  myths: the Vala myth (vs. 3cd, where Soma is credited with finding the cows), the  falcon’s stealing of soma from heaven (vs. 6c), and the dog Saramā’s role in the  recovery of the cows in the Vala myth (vs. 8ab).
This last example neatly shows the integration of ritual and mythic themes. The  first half of the verse, which alludes to the myth, does not identify the grammati cal subject by name or attribute, but does use a pronoun to mark it as female. This  might seem to exclude Soma as the referent—until we reach the final word of the  verse: dhā́rā “stream,” a feminine noun regularly used of the “stream of soma,”  which does allow the identification. From the mythological point of view, the dog  Saramā comes out of the mountain and finds the cows in the cave; in ritual terms  the (feminine) stream of soma comes out of the pressing apparatus and mixes with  the cows’ milk in the vessel. And this superimposition of ritual upon myth allows  Soma, indirectly, to be identified as the rescuer of the cows himself, as in verse 3.
### 1
Run forth around the cask; sit down; being purified by men, rush to  the prize.
Grooming you like a prizewinning horse, they lead you toward the ritual  grass with reins.
### 2
He of good weapons, the god, the drop purifies himself, smiting
malediction, protecting the community,
the father, begetter of the gods, possessing good skill, prop of heaven,  buttress of the earth.
### 3
Seer, inspired poet, going in front of the people, an insightful craftsman  [/R̥bhu], Uśanā in poetic skill—
only he found what of theirs was deposited, the secret, hidden name of  the cows.
### 4
This very one, honeyed Soma, has flowed for you, Indra, a bull for a bull,  around in the filter.
Thousand-winning, hundred-winning, much-giving, the prizewinner has  mounted the ritual grass ever and always.
### 5
These soma drinks have been sent surging toward bovine thousands,  toward acclamations, for great immortal reward,
being purified by the filters—like fame-seeking steeds driving to battle. 6. Because, much invoked of the peoples, he has flowed around all
nourishments while being purified—
now bring pleasurable things, you falcon-brought one; thrusting out
wealth, rush to the prize.
### 7
This Soma being pressed, the steed like a surge sent surging, has run  around in the filter,
whetting his sharp horns like a buffalo, on a cow-hunt toward cows, like  a champion warrior. 8. This one traveled from within the highest stone [=mountain]; she found  the cows that were somewhere in the enclosure.
Like lightning from heaven thundering with the clouds, the stream of  soma purifies itself for you, Indra.
### 9
And now while being purified, Soma, you drive around a throng of cows  in the same chariot with Indra,
and around many lofty refreshments, you of lively drops. Do your best,  able one. These (refreshments? verses?) are your invitatory praise.
## 88 
88 (800) Soma Pavamāna
Uśanas Kāvya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is structured by a series of similes; only the first verse lacks an explicit  simile. Many of the similes also involve identification of Soma with other divinities  (see esp. vss. 3–5, 7), and so the powers and mythological deeds of these gods are  implicitly attributed to Soma by way of these comparisons.
The two outer verses (1, 8) are complementary to each other. The first is addressed  to Indra and announces the soma as distinctively his, while verse 8, emphasizing the  2nd-person pronoun as verse 1 did, declares that to Soma belong the distinctive  qualities and attainments of the Ādityas.
### 1
This soma is pressed for you, Indra; for you it purifies itself.
You—drink of it—
the one that you have made your own, that you have chosen, the drop,  the soma to be yoked for exhilaration.
### 2
It has been yoked, like a chariot that conquers much, as the great one to  win many goods.
Therefore, all creatures stemming from Nahus, standing upright beside  the wood(en cup), roar at him at the winning of the sun.
### 3
You, who like Vāyu with his team maintain your desired course, who like  the Nāsatyas are most availing at a summons,
who like the Treasure-Giver in person bring all desirable things—like  Pūṣan you give speed to insight, o Soma.
### 4
You, who like Indra are a doer of great deeds, are a stronghold-splitting  smiter of obstacles, Soma.
Because, like Pedu’s (horse), (you are the smiter) of those with serpents’  names, you are the smiter of every Dasyu, Soma.
### 5
He who, like Agni in the wood, is being set loose in the wood(en cup), he  deploys his full dimensions in the rivers at will.
Like people battling is the trampling of the great one. Self-purifying  Soma raises a wave.
1328 IX.89
### 6
These soma juices have surged across the sheep’s fleeces—they are like  the heavenly buckets that hold the rain from clouds—
toward the tubs at will when pressed, like rivers downward to the sea. 7. Tempestuous like the troop of Maruts, purify yourself, impervious to  calumny like that heavenly clan.
Quickly become benevolence for us, having a thousand ripples like the  waters, like a sacrifice that conquers in battles.
### 8
The commandments of King Varuṇa are yours; yours is his lofty, deep  domain, o Soma.
You are blazing pure, like dear Mitra. You are besought for skill like  Aryaman, o Soma.
## 89 
89 (801) Soma Pavamāna
Uśanas Kāvya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The standard tropes of soma preparation, the swelling of Soma in water, his  manipulation by the priests’ fingers, his journey across the filter, and his mixing  with milk, provide the subject of this hymn, but, as often, each of these depic tions has a cosmic dimension—as in verses 1–2, where Soma is compared with  heavenly rain.
### 1
This draft-horse has streamed forth along the paths. Like the rain from  heaven, the self-purifying one has flowed.
Having a thousand streams, he has taken his seat by us, in the lap of his  mother, and in the wood: Soma.
### 2
The king of rivers has donned his garment. He has boarded the ship of  truth, (which goes) the straightest.
The drop, sped by the falcon, has grown strong in the waters. His father  yields him as milk; he yields as milk the offspring of his father.
### 3
They [=waters or cows] draw near the unbridled lion of honey, the tawny,  ruddy master of this heaven.
The champion, first in battles, asks for the cows for himself. The young  bull protects them all around with his gaze.
### 4
The honey-backed, terrible, unbridled horse—they yoke that towering  one to the wide-wheeled chariot.
His sisters, his kin, groom him. Those who share an umbilical bond
nourish the prizewinner.
### 5
Set down within the same support, four, yielding ghee as their milk,  accompany him.
They rush, being purified with homage. They, the many, surround him  on all sides. 6. (He is) the prop of heaven, the support of the earth, and all the dwelling  places are in his hand.
Your wellspring will provide (horse-)teams to the singer. The plant of  honey purifies itself for Indrian power.
### 7
Vanquishing but unvanquished, o Soma, as Vr̥tra-smasher purify  yourself for Indra and to pursue the gods.
Have mastery over great, much-glittering wealth. Might we be lords of  an abundance of heroes.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Attributed to Vasiṣṭha, the poet of the VIIth Maṇḍala, this hymn ends (vs. 6d) with the  Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, encountered constantly in VII. Martial images dominate, start ing with verse 1 and showcased especially in verse 3 (see also 4cd and 5ab). The aim  of war, to secure peace and prosperity, is depicted in the center of the hymn (vs. 4ab).  Some of the divine beneficiaries of Soma’s invigorating capability are listed in verse 5.
### 1
Being propelled, the begetter of the two worlds has driven forth like a  chariot, striving to win the prize,
going to Indra, sharpening his weapons, taking all goods in his hands. 2. Toward the three-backed bull, who imparts vitality, have the voices of the  songs bellowed.
Clothing himself in the woods, like Varuṇa in the rivers, the conferrer of  treasures distributes desirable things.
### 3
Having a horde of champions, having hale heroes, purify yourself as  victorious conqueror and winner of stakes,
with your sharp weapons and snapping bows invincible in combats,
vanquishing your rivals in battles.
### 4
Providing broad pastures, creating (places) without danger, by purifying  yourself procure the two united forms of plenty [=Heaven and Earth]. Striving to win the waters, also the dawns, the sun, and the cows, you  have roared together great prizes for us.
### 5
Exhilarate Varuṇa, o Soma; exhilarate Mitra. Exhilarate Indra, o  self-purifying drop, and Viṣṇu.
Exhilarate the troop of Maruts; exhilarate the gods. Exhilarate great  Indra, o drop, for his exhilaration.
### 6
In this way, like a king full of resolve, ever smiting all obstacles to  progress with your onslaught, purify yourself.
O drop, impart vitality to our speech. – Do you protect us always with  your blessings.

91 (803) Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The first three verses of this hymn concentrate on the journey of the soma across  the filter toward the mixing milk and toward Indra, but the militancy characteristic  of the previous hymn (IX.90) asserts itself in verse 4. The final two verses (5–6) ask  for bounties and blessings in return for our verbal and ritual service.
### 1
Billowing, he has been let loose as if at a chariot contest—the foremost  inspired thinker with his insight.
The ten sisters drive the draft-horse on the sheep’s back toward the seats. 2. In pursuit of the heavenly race, the drop is being pressed on (it [=fleece])  by the poets, the sons of Nahus,
the drop that is constantly being groomed (to go) forth by men—by
mortals as the immortal—by the sheep, the cows, and the waters.
### 3
The bull roaring over and over to the bull [=Indra], the plant, purifying  itself for him, moves toward the gleaming white milk of the cow.
A versifier who knows speech, the sun travels widely across the fine
(fleece) by a thousand unbesmirched paths.
### 4
Shatter even the entrenched seats of the demon. While being purified, o  drop, uncover the prizes of victory.
Hew down from above with your thrusting weapon the one who led here  from afar those (enemies) who are (now) nearby.
### 5
As of old, make forward-facing paths for our newer hymn, o you who  grant all wishes.
Lofty (riches?), which are hard to capture by the covetous—might we  attain them from you, o you who do many things and have many
cattle.
### 6
Becoming purified in just this way, (grant) waters, the sun, and cattle to  us, and ample progeny and posterity,
luck, broad dominion, and lights to us, o Soma—grant that we may see  the sun for a long time.
## 92 
92 (804) Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Like many hymns in the IXth Maṇḍala this hymn describes Soma’s journey, but  here the focus is on the endpoint, on Soma’s reaching his goal and taking his seat  in the vessels: the “seat” theme is found in three of the six verses (2, 3, 6). Soma is also a poet (vs. 2) and surrounded by poetry (vs. 3). It is this association with the  kaví, the sage poet and master of words, that probably prompted the most striking  statement in the hymn, that all the gods are “in your secret” (vs. 4). This statement  comes in the middle of the hymn and may constitute a weak omphalos, especially  as it is embedded in a series of verses that play with numbers (2–4), often a sign of  an omphalos structure.
### 1
The tawny one, the plant, being pressed, is sent surging all around in the  filter, like a chariot being urged on to win.
He will achieve a signal-call meant for Indra as he is being purified.  He has returned the favor to the gods through his pleasurable
offerings.
### 2
His gaze on men, he has run here, acquiring the name “poet” in the filter,  in his womb,
taking his seat in the cups, like a Hotar on his seat. The seven inspired  seers have approached him.
### 3
The very wise pathfinder who belongs to all the gods, Soma as he is being  purified goes forth to his very own seat.
He is one to take his rest amid all the poems. Steadfast, he arranges
himself throughout the five peoples.
### 4
O self-purifying Soma, it is in your secret that all these gods are, the three  times eleven.
The ten (fingers) with their autonomous powers, the seven exuberant  streams groom you upon the sheep’s back.
### 5
Now, let this be true of the self-purifying one, this on which all the bards  concur:
that he made light for the day and wide space; he furthered Manu but  made close quarters for the Dasyu.
### 6
Circling around, like a Hotar circling the seats provided with (sacrificial)  animals, going to assemblies like a true king,
Soma being purified has traveled to the tubs, taking his seat like a wild  buffalo in the woods [/wooden cups].

Nodhas Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Attributed to Nodhas Gautama, the poet of I.58–64, this hymn ends with the clan  refrain found in most of those Ist Maṇḍala hymns, although it does not display the  virtuosity characteristic of those compositions. The first three verses concern the  journey of the soma to the vessels and the mixing with water and with milk. The  last two (4–5) are requests for bounties.
1332 IX.94
### 1
The ten sisters, grown strong all together, the insightful thoughts of the  insightful one, the runners, groomed (him).
The tawny offspring of the sun dashed around (the filter). He reached  the wooden cup like a prizewinning steed.
### 2
Like a calf bellowing along with the mothers, the bull of many favors  [/tail hairs] has run together with the waters.
Like a young blood going to a maiden at the trysting place, he comes  together with the ruddy (cows) in the tub.
### 3
And the udder of the inviolable cow has swelled forth; the drop of good  wisdom is accompanied by streams.
The cows prepare his head with their milk in the cups, as if with freshly  washed goods.
### 4
O self-purifying drop, along with the gods excavate wealth in horses for  us as you bellow.
Let Plenitude come eagerly on her chariot in our direction, for the giving  of goods.
### 5
Now, as you are being purified, mete out to us all-glittering wealth,  abounding in superior men, befriended by the wind [/whose
friendship is sought].
The lifetime of the extoller has been extended, o drop. – Early in the  morning—soon—he should come, bringing goods through his
insight.

94 (806) Soma Pavamāna
Kaṇva Ghaura
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The word sóma does not appear until the last pāda (5d) of this hymn, which plots a  sometimes difficult course to this ending. The hymn features similes that exploit idi omatic ambiguity to produce different meanings in the simile proper and the frame  (see esp. vss. 1 and 3) and by obscure turns of phrase (see esp. 4d). It is therefore  not surprising that, as in IX.92, Soma is identified as a kaví, a poet, enmeshed in  poetry (vs. 3), and the main focus of the hymn, especially in the first three verses,  is the interchange between the poetic products of the mortal participants in ritual  and those of Soma himself.
### 1
When the insightful thoughts contend over him, like adornments upon a  prizewinner, like the clans over the sun,
choosing the waters, he purifies himself, poetically crafting a thought like  a stable for the raising of livestock,
### 2
Once again disclosing the domain of the immortal one. The worlds  spread out for the finder of the sun. The insightful thoughts, swelling like cows in good pasture, acting with  truth, have bellowed to the drop,
### 3
When the poet encompasses (all) poems, as a champion chariot
[/the chariot of the *Sun] (encircles) all the worlds,
exerting himself among the gods for glory for the mortal, for his skill  exerting himself anew for riches among (the gods) of much exertion. 4. Born for splendor, he has come forth from splendor; he establishes  splendor and vitality for the singers.
Clothed in splendor, they have gone to immortality. Their encounters  come to pass beside the one of measured pace [=Agni].
### 5
Rush to refreshment and nourishment, to horse and cow. Make broad  light; exhilarate the gods.
Because all these things are easy to conquer for you, o self-purifying  Soma, you repel the rivals.
## 95 
95 (807) Soma Pavamāna
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
5 verses: triṣṭubh
As in the preceding hymn, IX.94, the complementarity and interaction between  Soma’s poetic efforts and those of the ritualists provide the subject of this hymn.  Soma’s speech is the topic of the first two verses, culminating in 2cd in his revelation  of the “hidden names of the gods” that will be proclaimed aloud on the ritual ground.  But the verbal compositions of the mortals take center stage in verses 3–4. In the final  verse (5), Soma both prompts the speech of others and (it seems) produces his own.
### 1
The tawny one keeps roaring as he is being set loose, as he is sitting in the  belly of the wood, as he is being purified.
Guided by men, he makes cows his raiment. Thereupon he generates  poetic thoughts through his own powers.
### 2
The tawny one, having been set loose on the path of truth, directs his  speech, like an oarsman his boat.
The god reveals the hidden names of the gods to be proclaimed on the  ritual grass.
### 3
Constantly overtaking each other like the waves of the waters, the  inspired thoughts press forward to Soma.
Doing homage, they come close to him and come together with him, and  desirous they enter him, who is also desirous.
### 4
They milk him, constantly being groomed like a buffalo on the back (of  the filter), the plant, the mountain-dwelling ox.
The poetic thoughts accompany him as he bellows. Trita carries Varuṇa  in the sea.1334 IX.96
### 5
Inciting speech, as the Upavaktar incites the speech of the Hotar, while  being purified, o drop, unleash the inspired thought.
Since (you) and Indra have the power for good fortune, might we be
lords of an abundance of heroes.

96 (808) Soma Pavamāna
Pratardana Daivodāsi
24 verses: triṣṭubh
This twenty-four-verse hymn, immediately following three five-verse hymns in the  same meter, can easily be made to fit the sequence if it is analyzed as consisting of  a collection of four-verse hymns, as Oldenberg clearly states (1888: 201). The six  hymns thus obtained show different degrees of internal cohesion.
For example, the first four verses display clear thematic unity and development.  The first verse is explicitly martial, with Soma as a warrior about to charge, a pic ture continued in the following verse. In verse 3 he achieves one of the most desired  results of Vedic warfare, wide space for us to inhabit, and with this obtained, verse  4 articulates a counter-message, that of peace and nonviolence. Indra is explicitly  mentioned in the first three verses, and comradeship is a central theme, as is seen in  verses 1, 2, and 4.
The second hymn (vss. 5–8) shows stylistic progression. It begins with a rhe torically restricted verse (5), consisting primarily of seven repetitions of the word  “begetter” with different genitive complements. The next verse (6)  continues the  dominantly nominal construction of vs. 5, but with a more varied verbal repertoire,  though the nominative-genitive syntagm persists. Verse 7 continues to describe the  qualities and characteristic actions of Soma, in the 3rd person, though it abandons  the strict nominal style. And finally vs. 8 breaks out into the dynamic 2nd person  and imperative mood.
The third group (vss. 9–12) ends with a characteristic hymn-final summary verse,  which seems to mark a decisive break from what follows. Although no clear the matic unity imposes itself on the four verses, the focus on Soma’s relationship with  our ancestral ritualists and our hope that this relationship will continue fruitfully is  noticeable, especially in the last two verses (11–12). On the other hand, it is difficult  to identify any unifying features in the next group of four (vss. 13–16), which con sist primarily of standard soma-hymn tropes. In verses 17–20 Soma as poet (esp. in  vss. 17–18) and his journey from the filter to the cups provide a weak cohesion. In  the final group (vss. 21–24), three verses (22–24) contain courtship imagery, and the  root krand “roar” is prominent.
### 1
The army-leader, the champion, at the forefront of the chariots, goes  forth seeking cattle. His army bristles with excitement. Making the invocations of Indra beneficial for his comrades, Soma puts  on his ravishing garments.
### 2
The tawny ones [=fingers] jointly groom his tawny (horse), without  resting, with acts of reverence that spur on the horse.
The comrade of Indra mounts the chariot; the knowing one drives with  him to our good thought.
### 3
Purify yourself, o god, for the conclave of gods, for great delight, o  Soma, as Indra’s drink.
Creating the waters and making this heaven rain, from the wide (realm)  make wide space for us as you are being purified.
### 4
For freedom from overthrow and freedom from assault purify yourself,  for well-being, for lofty wholeness.
This do all these comrades desire; this do I desire, o self-purifying
Soma.
### 5
Soma purifies himself—the begetter of poetic thoughts, begetter of  heaven, begetter of earth,
begetter of Agni, begetter of the sun, begetter of Indra, and begetter  of Viṣṇu.
### 6
Formulator for the gods, trail-blazer for the sage poets, seer for the  inspired poets, buffalo of the wild beasts,
falcon of the birds of prey, axe of the trees—Soma goes rasping
through the filter.
### 7
Like a river its wave, self-purifying Soma has sent the wave of speech  pulsing forth, the hymns, the inspired thoughts.
Looking within, he surmounts these communities here below, a bull  among the cows, recognizing them.
### 8
Exhilarating, vanquishing in battles but unvanquished,
thousand-spurting—rush to the prize.
Purifying yourself for Indra, o drop, as inspired thinker raise a wave  from the plant, driving the cows.
### 9
The dear Soma, sought by the gods, (goes) around in the tub, the  enjoyable one for Indra’s exhilaration.
The drop of a thousand streams, a hundred prizes, goes like a
prizewinning team to the concourses.
### 10
The primordial one, finding goods (even) while being born, being  groomed in the waters, being milked on the stone,
protecting from imprecations, the king of creation, he finds the way for  the sacred formulation as he is being purified.
### 11
Because with you, self-purifying Soma, our insightful forefathers  performed their (ritual) acts,
open up the barriers, vanquishing but unvanquished; become a
benefactor to us with heroes and with horses.
1336 IX.96
### 12
Even as you purified yourself for Manu, as conferrer of vitality, smiter  of foes, finder of wide space, accompanied by oblations,
just so purify yourself now, conferring wealth. Stand side-by-side by  Indra. Generate weapons.
### 13
Purify yourself, Soma, rich in honey, following the truth, clothing  yourself in waters, on the sheep’s back.
Sit down in the cups full of ghee as the most elating, exhilarating drink  for Indra.
### 14
Having a hundred streams, purify yourself into the rain from heaven— thousand-winning, seeking the prize in pursuit of the gods,
bellowing along with the rivers in the tub, along with the ruddy (cows),  prolonging our lifetime.
### 15
This very Soma, being purified by poetic thoughts, like a prizewinning  steed just outstrips hostilities.
Like the milk milked out of Aditi, it is invigorating, broad like a way,  like a draft-horse easy to control.
### 16
Having good weapons, being purified by the pressers, rush to the dear  hidden name (of the cows? of Indra?),
to the prize, like a team with desire for fame, to Vāyu, to the cows, o  god Soma.
### 17
The colt just born, the delightful one they groom; the Maruts in a flock  beautify the cart horse.
Though being a poet by virtue of his hymns, a poet by his poetry, Soma  goes rasping across the filter.
### 18
Having the mind of a seer, a maker of seers, gaining the sun, having a  thousand devices, trail-blazer for poets,
a buffalo, seeking to gain the third domain, Soma, as rhythm
[/the anuṣṭubh meter], regulates the virāj (meter) according to rule. 19. Sitting in the cups, the falcon, the bird spreading (his wings), the  cow-finding drop, bearing weapons,
accompanying the wave of the waters, the buffalo declares the sea to be  the fourth domain.
### 20
Like a resplendent young blood grooming his own body, like a steed  running to gain the stakes,
charging around the cask like a bull around the herds, constantly  roaring he has entered the two cups.
### 21
Purify yourself, o drop, as self-purifying one, with your mighty powers.  Constantly roaring, rush around the fleeces.
Playing, enter the two cups while being purified. Let your exhilarating  sap exhilarate Indra.
### 22
His lofty streams have been sent surging forth. Anointed with cows he  has entered the tubs. Making a melody [/performing the sāman], devoted to a melody
[/the sāman], attentive to poetic inspiration, roaring he goes as if to a  comrade’s sister.
### 23
Smiting aside the rivals, self-purifying one, you go like a swain to his  beloved, the drop besung.
Sitting in the woods like a flying bird, Soma, being purified, has settled  in the tubs.
### 24
As you purify yourself, Soma, your beams come here like a maiden— the good milkers giving good streams.
The fallow bay granting many favors, led hither into the waters, has
roared in the tub of those who seek the gods.

97 (809) Soma Pavamāna
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi 1–3, Indrapramati Vāsiṣṭha 4–6, Vrṣ̥ agaṇa Vāsiṣṭha 7–9, Manyu  Vāsiṣṭha 10–12, Upamanyu Vāsiṣṭha 13–15, Vyāghrapād Vāsiṣṭha 16–18, Śakti  Vāsiṣṭha 19–21, Karṇaśrut Vāsiṣṭha 22–24, Mrḷ̥īka Vāsiṣṭha 25–27, Vasukra Vāsiṣṭha  28–30, Parāśara Śāktya 31–44, Kutsa Āṅgirasa 45–58
58 verses: triṣṭubh, arranged in trcas ̥
This is the longest hymn in the R̥gveda, consisting of fifty-eight verses, arranged  in three-verse units. It is also the last IXth Maṇḍala hymn in triṣṭubh. Despite  its extraordinary length, it can be analyzed as consisting of a series of originally  independent tr̥cas combined into one, and it therefore conforms to the prevailing  principles of arrangement in the Saṃhitā. In the first half (vss. 1–30) each tr̥ca is  attributed to Vasiṣṭha or to a different Vasiṣṭhid; the second half is divided between  two, non-Vasiṣṭhid, poets. If we assume that the tr̥ca division continues in this sec
ond half (as most scholars do), the Anukramaṇī ascription does not conform to  the tr̥ca division, as the first two verses of the tr̥ca of verses 43–45 are credited to  Parāśara Śāktya and the last one to Kutsa Āṅgirasa. There is also an extra verse,  most probably the final one (58), which contains the Kutsa refrain of Maṇḍala  I  (I.94.16cd, etc.). Although according to the Anukramaṇī each of these poets  is responsible for fourteen verses, there is no more apparent unity in these larger  stretches than in the individual tr̥cas of the first half.
As is often the case in such long, composite hymns, the tr̥cas exhibit varying  degrees of cohesiveness, from the tight and emphatic verbal repetitions of verses  49–51 to the diffuseness of groupings like verses 7–9, 40–42. Some of the tr̥cas,  though not thematically or verbally unified, have a third verse that marks it as final;  for instance, the first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–3, 4–6) each end with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain  as the last pāda, and the final verse of three tr̥cas begins with a summary evā́ “thus”  (vss. 13–15, 19–21, 25–27), a word characteristic of final verses.
As might be expected, the contents of this hymn are also extremely various,  but generally exhibit the standard tropes of soma hymns:  the mechanisms of
1338 IX.97
soma preparation, including the journey across the filter and the mixing with  waters and with milk; the power of soma to incite the gods, especially Indra,  and the power of the ritualists and, especially, the poets, to strengthen the soma  for this task; and the rewards the ritualists will receive from properly prepar
ing the soma. Nonetheless, the hymn contains a number of striking similes and  metaphors, and some passages of great difficulty, chief among which is the tr̥ca  of verses 52–54, which may (or may not) be a dānastuti and whose translation  here is provisional in places. Note also verse 38, which in our interpretation con
tains an archaic formula denoting an archaic figure, the “Placer of the Sun” (see  Jamison 2010).
### 1
Being purified by his impulsion, his drive, the god has intermingled his  sap with the gods.
Pressed, he goes rasping around the filter like the Hotar around the fixed  seats provided with (sacrificial) animals.
### 2
Wearing auspicious festival garments, as a great poet pronouncing  enigmas,
coil yourself into the two cups while being purified, wide-gazing and  watchful in the pursuit of the gods.
### 3
The dear one is groomed on the sheep’s back, the more glorious of the  glorious ones, a fellow countryman at our side.
Cry out, run, as you are being purified. – Do you protect us always with  your blessings.
### 4
Sing forth: let us recite to the gods. Impel Soma for great stakes.
The sweet one will purify himself across the sheep’s fleece. He will sit in  the tub, seeking the gods for us.
### 5
The drop, coming here to fellowship with the gods, purifies himself in a  thousand streams for exhilaration.
Being praised by men, he has gone along his earlier domain, to Indra for  great good portion.
### 6
As a fallow bay, rush for wealth for the praiser as you are being purified.  Let your exhilarating drink go to Indra for the taking.
Drive on the same chariot with the gods to bounty. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
### 7
Speaking forth his poetry like Uśanā, the god proclaims the races of  the gods.
Of great commandment, of blazing lineage, pure, as a boar he goes
rasping toward his tracks.
### 8
The geese have journeyed forth to (Soma’s) sharp battle-fury, from  nearby to their home, in a bullish flock.
The comrades speak in unison to the self-purifying one a songful music  difficult to forget. 9. He hastens at the pace of the wide-ranging one [=Viṣṇu?]. The cows, as  they seem to bellow, give their measure to the one who plays at will
[=Soma].
The sharp-horned one makes himself an ample (face). By day he
appears tawny, but silvery by night.
### 10
The prizewinning drop purifies himself, bringing cows down in flood— Soma stimulating the power in Indra, for exhilaration.
He smashes demonic force; he deflects hostilities, making wide space as  king of the community.
### 11
Then being infused with honey in a stream, he purifies himself across  the fleece, when he has been milked by the stone,
the drop enjoying the fellowship of Indra, the god, the exhilarating
drink of the god, for exhilaration.
### 12
He purifies himself toward his own dear (tracks?), while being purified,  the god infusing the gods with his own sap.
The drop, clothing himself in his foundations according to the ritual order,  has enwrapped himself in the ten fingers on the back of the sheep.
### 13
The ruddy bull keeps roaring at the cows; bellowing he goes to heaven  and earth.
His voice, like Indra’s, is heard at the contest. He rushes, making this  speech perceptible here.
### 14
Good to taste, swelling with milk, you go, setting in motion the
honeyed plant.
Purifying yourself, you go, producing thunder, while being poured
around for Indra, o Soma.
### 15
Purify yourself thus, an exhilarating one for exhilaration, bowing with  your weapons (those) of the water-grasper.
Encompassing the glistening color, seeking cows, rush to us, when you  are poured around, o Soma.
### 16
Having taken pleasure, o drop, (making) easy pathways easy to travel  for us, purify yourself on a broad (path), making us wide spaces.
Smashing asunder obstacles to progress as if with a deadly weapon, run  along the back, on the sheep’s back.
### 17
Stream rain to us—heavenly, hurrying, bringing refreshment, luck for  the livestock, of lively drops.
Run, pulling apart [=discriminating] these bonds here below, these
webs, like straightened curls, o drop.
### 18
Untie like a knot the straight and the crooked way that are knotted up,  when you are being purified, o Soma.
Like a fallow bay steed you whinny on being let loose; run, o god, as a  man in his prime in possession of a dwelling place.
1340 IX.97
### 19
Delightful, for the divine conclave for exhilaration, run around the  back, on the sheep’s back.
Possessing a thousand streams, sweet-smelling, not to be outwitted,  flow around at the winning of prizes, at the victory over
superior men.
### 20
Though without reins, without chariot, not yoked, having been let loose  like steeds in a contest,
these gleaming soma-drinks run. O gods, drive right up to them, to  drink them.
### 21
Thus, o drop, flow around the cloud, the flood in the cups, toward our  pursuit of the gods.
Let Soma give to us desirable, lofty wealth, powerful and abounding in  heroes.
### 22
When the speech from the mind of the seeker fashioned him [=Soma]  on the foundation of the preeminent one [=Agni or Indra?] or
face-to-face with the cattle,
thereupon the cows came to him at will, bellowing—to the delightful  husband, the drop, in the tub.
### 23
The divine giver of drops, sweller of drops, (goes) forth. As truth, he  purifies himself for truth, the very wise one.
Possessing the (royal) mandate, he has become the king of what belongs  to the community. He has been brought forward to the earth by the  ten reins.
### 24
Purifying himself with the filters, having his gaze on men, as the king of  gods and mortals
he has become once again the wealth-lord of wealth; the drop bears the  pleasing truth that is easy to bear.
### 25
Like a steed rushing to a win for the sake of fame, rush to the pursuit  of Indra and Vāyu.
Give us a thousand lofty refreshments; become a finder of chattels  while you are being purified, o Soma.
### 26
Pursuing the gods while being poured around, let the soma drinks run  to a dwelling place rich in good heroes,
bringing favor here through sacrifice, possessing all desirable things,  sacrificing at day(break) like Hotars, most gladdening.
### 27
Thus, o god Soma, purify yourself for the conclave of gods, for their  great delight, as the gods’ drink,
for we are greatly driven at the encounter. Make the two world-halves  of good standing while you are being purified.
### 28
Like a horse you whinny on being yoked by the bulls, fearsome like a  lion, swifter than mind. Along paths turned hitherwards—those which are the straightest—
bring benevolence here to us by purifying yourself, o drop.
### 29
A hundred god-generated streams have been sent surging; these  thousand the poets groom.
O drop, by purifying yourself bring here from heaven a means of
winning. You are the leader of great spoils.
### 30
Like surges from heaven, (like those) of days, his surges have surged.  Like a king, the wise one does not violate his alliance.
Being put in your place according to our intentions, like a son
according to the intentions of his father, bring freedom from
overthrow here to this clan by purifying yourself.
### 31
Your honeyed streams have surged forth, when, purified, you go across  the sheep’s fleece.
Self-purifying one, purify yourself as the domain for the cows. On being  born, you swelled the sun with rays [/chants].
### 32
Ever roaring along the path of truth, gleaming you radiate across the  domain of the immortal one [=sun?].
Providing the means for exhilaration, you purify yourself for Indra,
spurring on your own speech with the thoughts of the poets.
### 33
As heavenly eagle, o Soma, gaze down, swelling the streams with (ritual)  action in the pursuit of the gods.
O drop, enter the tub for holding the soma. Roaring, come right up to  the ray of the sun.
### 34
The draft-horse rouses forth the three voices, the hymnic vision of  truth, the inspired thought of the sacred formulation.
The cows go asking for a cowherd; the thoughts go bellowing eagerly  to Soma.
### 35
To Soma (go) the milk-cows bellowing eagerly; to Soma the inspired  poets asking for him with their thoughts.
Soma, pressed, is purified while being anointed [/driven]; to Soma the  chants, the triṣṭubh verses cry out together.
### 36
Thus, o Soma, being poured around, being purified, bring well-being  here to us through your purification.
Enter Indra with a lofty shout; strengthen speech, beget plenitude.
### 37
In accordance with truth, the wakeful inspired poet of the thoughts,  Soma, being purified, has sat down in the cups,
he whom they serve, eager in rivalry—the Adhvaryus of good hands,  the charioteers (of the sacrifice).
### 38
He, being purified close by, like the Placer of the Sun has filled both  world-halves, and he has disclosed them.
He with whose help the winners of dear things (win) dear things, he will  extend spoils as if to a victor.
1342 IX.97
### 39
The strengthening strengthener, being purified, Soma the rewarder,  helped us with his light,
with which our forefathers, knowing the track, finding the sun, burned  the cows out of the rock.
### 40
As the sea he has roared at his first expansion, begetting the creatures as  king of creation.
The bull in the filter, on the sheep’s back, Soma has grown loftily, the  drop being pressed.
### 41
Soma the buffalo performed this great (deed), that [/when] as embryo of  the waters he chose the gods.
Purifying himself, he placed strength in Indra. The drop begat the light  in the sun.
### 42
Exhilarate Vāyu for his quest and for our benefit; exhilarate Mitra and  Varuṇa, while you are being purified.
Exhilarate the Marutian troop; exhilarate the gods; exhilarate Heaven  and Earth, o god Soma.
### 43
Purify yourself, as the straight smiter of the crooked, thrusting away  affliction and insults,
perfecting your milk with the milk of cows. You are (the comrade) of  Indra; we are your comrades.
### 44
Purify yourself into the sweetness of honey, into a wellspring of goods;  by purifying yourself bring here to us a hero and a portion.
Sweeten yourself for Indra as you purify yourself, o drop, and by  purifying yourself bring here to us wealth from the sea.
### 45
Soma, pressed in a stream, driving like a steed, has streamed like a river  to the deep, as prizewinner.
He has sat in the wooden womb while being purified. The drop has  flowed together with the cows, with the waters.
### 46
This very Soma purifies himself for you, o Indra, in the cups, insightful  and powerful for you who desire it—
the charioteer having the eye of the sun, whose impetuosity is real, who  has been sent surging like the desire of those who seek the gods.
### 47
He, being purified with age-old vitality, hiding himself in the forms of  the daughter (of the Sun [=Dawn]) [=milk],
in the waters clothing himself in shelter providing threefold defense,  rasping like a Hotar he drives to the concourses.
### 48
Now, you, o god Soma, as charioteer—flow around for us in the two  cups, while being purified,
sweetest in the waters, honeyed, truthful, you whose thoughts become  reality, like god Savitar’s.
### 49
Rush toward Vāyu in pursuit while being hymned, toward Mitra and  Varuṇa while being purified, toward the superior man who quickens insightful thought and bestrides  the chariot, toward Indra the bull with the mace in his arms.
### 50
Rush toward your garments that garb well, toward the good-milking  cows, while being purified,
toward glittering golden goods, to bring them to us, and toward chariot  horses, o god Soma.
### 51
Rush toward heavenly goods for us, toward all earthly goods, while  being purified,
toward that by which we shall win property, (that is,) toward a seer’s  (portion) for us like that of Jamadagni.
### 52
By purifying yourself with this purification bring goods here in this way.  O drop, at (the time of) the hiding of the moon [=early morning] run  forth into the lake.
The copper-colored (Sun/Fire), sped like the wind, is also there. The  very wise one [=Soma?] also gives (to us) the superior man [=Indra?]  to make the charge.
### 53
And with this purification purify yourself for us at the famous ford  of the (prize/wealth) worthy of fame [=place of distribution of
dakṣiṇās?].
The challengers’ challenger [=Indra?] will shake off sixty thousand
goods like ripe (fruit) from a tree, for our joy.
### 54
Of him—“Bull” his name—there are these two great forceful weapons  of death either at the hiding of the moon or at the caressing
[=mixing soma with milk]:
he put the challengers to sleep and “snowed” them. Turn back from
here those without alliance (with us), back those without perception.
### 55
You converge on the three filters stretched out, but you run along just  one while you are being purified.
You are Bhaga, you are the giver of the gift; you are bounteous to the  bounteous ones, o drop.
### 56
This one, knowing all, possessing inspired thoughts, purifies himself— Soma, the king of all creation.
Rousing the droplets at the rites, the drop proceeds over and across the  sheep’s fleece all at once.
### 57
The undeceivable buffaloes lick the drop. On his track the poets squawk  like birds of prey.
The insightful ones impel him with their ten fingers. They jointly anoint  his form with the sap of the waters.
### 58
With you who purify yourself, o Soma, we would pull out the perfect  (“hand” of dice) at the match, time after time.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant this to us, and Aditi, River, and
Earth and Heaven.1344 IX.98
Anusṭubh Hymns: 98–101 ̣
## 98 
98 (810) Soma Pavamāna
Ambarīṣa Vārṣāgira and R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
12 verses: anuṣṭubh, except brhat ̥ ī 11
The themes that dominate this hymn are standard soma tropes. The normal stages  in the preparation of the soma are treated (see esp. vss. 2–3, 6–10), and the poet  regularly reminds Soma of the gifts he should bring to his mortal preparers (see esp.  vss. 1, 4–5, 12). Indeed the hymn begins and ends with an appeal for vā́ja “prizes”  (vss. 1a, 12cd), in a sort of ring composition.
However, although the sentiments expressed and descriptions provided are unre markable, the hymn is characterized by very choppy and sometimes incoherent syn tax (which for purposes of translation has been cleaned up somewhat). Since there  are also metrical disturbances in the hymn, one wonders if it has been transmitted  entirely correctly.
### 1
O drop, stream to us the wealth coveted by many that best wins the prize, bringing a thousand presents, powerfully brilliant, vanquishing (even)  the distinguished.
### 2
This one, being pressed, has engirded himself in the sheep’s fleece, as a  man on a chariot does in armor.
The drop, impelled by the wooden (paddle), has flowed in streams while  being impelled.
### 3
This drop, being pressed, has flowed around in the sheep’s fleece, aroused  to exhilaration,
the one who, erect at the ceremony, goes seeking cows with his stream,  like (Agni) with his flame.
### 4
Because you, o god, are goods for each and every pious mortal,
o drop, you seek to win wealth in thousands, which has a hundred
embodiments.
### 5
May we be (most nearest) to these goods of yours, coveted by many, o  good one, Vr̥tra-smasher,
most nearest to your refreshment and favor, o you who are not poor.
### 6
The self-glorious one, smashed by stones, whom the twice five sisters bathe—the one dear and desirable to Indra, full of waves,
### 7
This delightful tawny brown one they purify all around with the fleece, him who circles around all the gods together with his
exhilarating drink.
### 8
For with his help (the gods) are drinking (the exhilarating drink) that  brings skill to realization, the delightful one who has placed lofty fame among your [=poets’]
patrons, like the sun (in heaven).
### 9
The drop has been born of you two at the sacrifices—o you two  world-halves [=jaws of soma press?], goddesses who (yet) belong to
mankind—
the mountain-abiding god. Unfailingly, very noisily (I praise?) him.
### 10
O Soma, you are poured around for Indra, the Vr̥tra-smiter, to drink, and for the superior man who gives priestly gifts, and for the god sitting  on the seat.
### 11
The age-old soma drinks have flowed into the filter at the break
of dawn,
snorting away into the distance those who know the crooked ways and  those without discernment, early in the morning.
### 12
O comrades, might we and you, our patrons, attain him who shines in front, whose prizes are to be secured. Might we gain him who offers a house  full of prizes.

99 (811) Soma Pavamāna
Two sons of Rebha, the Kāśyapas
8 verses: anuṣṭubh, except brhat ̥ ī 1
The varieties of thought and its poetic expressions are the focus of this hymn, espe cially in its earlier verses (1–2, 4–5), and Soma’s mental and verbal powers comple ment those of his mortal worshipers (vs. 6). The physical preparation of soma is not  neglected, however (esp. vss. 3, 7–8).
### 1
For the delightful daring one they draw the bow, the manly power. Those seeking the great one weave a glowing garment for their lord at  the forefront of the inspired words.
### 2
And prepared by night, he plunges toward the prizes,
when the insightful thoughts of Vivasvant impel him, the tawny one,  to drive.
### 3
We groom this one of his [=Vivasvant?], the one who is exhilaration,  Indra’s best drink,
whom the cows have previously sucked with their mouths and now the  patrons do.
### 4
They have cried out to him with an ancient song, while he is being purified. And the insightful thoughts yearn for him, those bearing the names of  the gods.
### 5
They purify him on the sheep’s fleece, while the steadfast one grows strong. Those of inspired thought hope for him to be like a messenger, (for
them) to be first in his thought.
1346 IX.100
### 6
Becoming purified, the most exhilarating Soma sits in the cups,
depositing his seed (in them) as if in livestock. The lord of insight
displays his eloquence.
### 7
He is groomed by those who work well [=fingers], the god pressed for  the gods.
As his complete attachment to them [=waters] is known, he plunges
through the great waters.
### 8
O drop, pressed and held by men, you are led through into the filter. As the one most exhilarating for Indra, you sit down here in the cups.

100 (812) Soma Pavamāna
Two sons of Rebha, the Kāśyapas
9 verses: anuṣṭubh
As Oldenberg suggests (1888:  128–29), in order to conform to the principles of  arrangement, this hymn must have originally consisted of two separate hymns, of  five and four verses respectively. This division, made solely on numerical grounds,  is confirmed by the structure of the hymn, for the final four verses repeat or ring  changes on the first five. Verse 6, the first of the original second hymn, is structur
ally, and in part verbally, identical to the final verse of the original first hymn (5),  but also incorporates, in variant form, verse 4d. Verse 7 repeats much of verse 1 in  different order. Verse 8 deviates more from its model, verse 2, but reproduces verse  2d verbatim as verse 8d. Verse 9 is the most distant from its model, verse 3, but  contains the “heaven and earth” found in the “earthly and heavenly goods” of 3cd.  Once again we see the ways in which the R̥gvedic poet uses formulaic language and  poetic templates for his own purposes.
### 1
Those without deceit cry out to him, dear and desirable to Indra.
The mothers lick him like a calf in its first stage of life, just born.
### 2
While being purified, o Soma drop, bring here doubly lofty wealth. You foster all goods in the house of the pious man.
### 3
Set loose the insightful thought yoked with mind, as thunder
does rain.
You foster earthly and heavenly goods, o Soma.
### 4
Your stream, when you are pressed, runs in a circle like (the horse) of a  victor,
speeding through the sheep’s fleece like a winner bringing prizes.
### 5
For our will and skill, o poet, purify yourself in a stream, Soma,

### 6
Purify yourself as best winner of prizes in the filter, pressed in a stream, most honeyed for Indra and Viṣṇu, for the gods, Soma. 7. The mothers, those without deceit, lick you, the tawny one, in the filter, as milk-cows do a new-born calf, o self-purifying one, at your expansion. 8. O self-purifying one, you drive to great fame with your brilliant rays. Vaunting yourself, you keep smashing away all the dark shades in the  house of the pious man.
### 9
O you of great commandment, you have carried yourself beyond heaven  and earth.
You have fastened on your mantle in your greatness, self-purifying one.

16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2–3, arranged in trcas ̥
In order to conform to the pattern of arrangement, this last hymn in the anuṣṭubh  group must actually have consisted originally of five three-verse hymns, with a single  verse (16) appended, as was already pointed out by Oldenberg (1888: 201). There is,  however, some interconnection among the tr̥cas that points to a sense of cohesion.  In particular, the first and last tr̥cas (vss. 1–3 and 13–15) are linked by the striking  image in their first verses (1, 13) of a sacrifice-defiling dog drawn to the sound of  the soma being pressed, a dog that must be driven away. Verse 13 also contains a  brief and enigmatic allusion to a myth also enigmatically mentioned to in X.171.2.
Most of the rest of the hymn contains standard material: the details of prepara tion of the drink and its journey across the filter to mix with the milk, as well as its  relationship to the gods, especially Indra. There is some internal unity visible in the  individual tr̥cas, but it is not pronounced.
### 1
With your advance victory over the stalk, for the pressed soma to cause  exhilaration,
pierce away the dog that has the long tongue, o comrades.
### 2
What flows forth and around in a pure stream, the pressed
drop, like a horse that gets results,
### 3
That one, the soma, poor at burning [?], do the superior men, with their  insight aimed toward all,
impel to the sacrifice with stones.
### 4
The most honeyed pressed soma drinks, exhilarating to Indra,
provided with filters, have flowed. Let your exhilarating drinks go to  the gods.
### 5
“The drop purifies himself for Indra,” so the gods said.
The lord of speech does battle [/seeks bounties], holding sway over all  with his strength.
1348 IX.102
### 6
Possessing a thousand streams he purifies himself, a sea setting speech  aswing,
Soma, lord of riches, comrade of Indra, day after day.
### 7
This one here is Pūṣan, Wealth, Fortune; Soma rushes as he is being  purified.
As lord of all creation, he has surveyed both world-halves.
### 8
Together the dear ones have cried out to him, the cows avid for  exhilaration.
The soma drinks make their own paths, the self-purifying drops. 9. The one who is strongest [=Indra], bring him here, o self-purifying one,  the one worthy of fame,
who sur(mounts) the five domains, with whom we shall gain wealth.
### 10
The soma drops purify themselves, as best pathfinders for us, allies, unblemished, rich in purpose, finding the sun, when they are  being pressed.
### 11
Having been pressed by the stones, conspicuous on the hide of the cow, the finders of goods have roared together from all around toward  refreshment for us.
### 12
These purified soma juices, attentive to poetic inspiration, mixed with curds, are worthy to be seen like suns, mobile yet fixed in the ghee.
### 13
Like a mortal he [=the dog] has shown preference for the speech of the  stalk being pressed.
Smite away the dog, the ungenerous one, as the Bhr̥gus (did) the Battler. 14. Their kinsman has wrapped himself in a cloak (of milk) to enjoy it, like  a son in the two arms (of his mother).
He runs like a swain to a maiden, like a wooer, to sit in the womb. 15. He is a hero, bringing skill to realization, who has propped apart the  two world-halves.
The tawny one has wrapped himself in the filter, like a ritual adept, to  sit in the womb.
### 16
Soma purifies himself with the fleeces of sheep, on the cow’s hide. Ever roaring, the bullish fallow bay goes to his rendezvous with Indra.
Usṇ ̣ih Hymns: 102–106
## 102 
102 (814) Soma Pavamāna
Trita Āptya
8 verses: uṣṇih The many obscurities in this hymn exist in tension with the clarity of its larger  structure: it is a ring composition, with a pāda-length phrase in the first and last  verses (1b, 8c) defining the ring: “spurring on the visionary power of truth.” This  phrase also sets one of the underlying themes, that Soma during his preparation  inspires and creates poetic truth. There is clarity also in the general progression of  the hymn, which follows Soma’s journey from the press (vs. 2) and across the filter  (vs. 3) to his final preparation (vs. 7). Another theme that runs throughout is that of  Soma as a child in relation to his mothers (vss. 1, 4, 7; see also 6), who not only gave  him physical birth but also formed him in his ritual rule (see vs. 4).
It must be admitted, however, that much remains puzzling in the hymn. There  are a number of problems of syntax and lexicon. The two adjacent appearances  of Trita (or “the third one,” vss. 2–3) are also unclear, though they clearly play  on the numerals two and three found in those verses. The hymn is ascribed by the  Anukramaṇī to Trita Āptya, and so it might be that the poet is simply inserting  himself in the poem. But, since Trita Āptya is actually a mythological figure, it is  more likely that the Anukramaṇī has assigned the hymn to that figure on the basis  of the occurrences of tritá in those two verses.
### 1
Through his action the child of the great (rivers), spurring on the  visionary power of truth,
encompasses all dear things—now once again.
### 2
In the two “jaws” [?] [=soma press?] of Trita [/the third one], when he  [=Soma] took to the hidden track,
(he traveled) through the seven domains of the sacrifice—now, right to  his own dear (place).
### 3
(Across) the three (filters), on the backs of Trita (“the third one”), in a  stream—rouse wealth!—
he measures out the stages of his journey—the very resolute one.
### 4
The seven mothers [=rivers?] instructed him as a ritual adept, when he  was born for splendor.
This one is the enduring (treasure) of treasures, since he paid attention  (to his mothers).
### 5
Under his commandment are all the gods of one accord and without  deceit.
Eagerly sought are your joys, since they [=gods] take pleasure (in them). 6. The embryo that those strong through truth have begotten as lovely to see, the poet, most liberal at the ceremony, sought by many—
### 7
Toward (him) the two youthfully exuberant mothers of truth
[=world-halves? Night and Dawn?] go, conjoined but each in her own  person—
when stretching the sacrifice in due order, they [=priests] anoint (him). 8. Through your resolve, with gleaming eyes, you unclosed the pen of  heaven,
spurring the visionary power of truth forth in the ceremony.

## 103 
103 (815) Soma Pavamāna
Dvita Āptya
6 verses: uṣṇih
The most salient stylistic feature of the hymn is the preverb that begins each verse— pári “around” in all but the first verse—with the preverb increasingly less integrated  syntactically with the rest of the verse. The focus on pári arises from the description  of the motion of the soma as it is poured in circles into the filter.
Like the last hymn, this one follows the journey of Soma and also focuses on his  ritual role and his participation in reciprocal ritual speech. Not only do we find the  technical term vedhás “ritual adept’ (vs. 1), as in IX.102.4 and 101.15, but also the  likewise technical vāghát “cantor” (vs. 5) in its only appearance in the IXth Maṇḍala.  The poet’s presentation of his speech and poetic thoughts in verse 1 and the voices  of the seers in verse 3 are met by Soma as himself “leader of thoughts” in verse 4.
The hymn shares some lexical and thematic material with the immediately pre ceding IX.102. In addition to the aforementioned vedhás, note, for example, the  cleverly variant pādas 102.5b and 103.4b, which both contain “all the gods” and  lack of deceit. But in 103 all the gods are embedded in a compound modifying  Soma, whereas in 102 they are syntactically independent; moreover, the “deceit”  theme is carried by two different roots (dabh, druh) in two different valences: the  gods of 102 do not deceive, while Soma in 103 cannot be deceived. It is difficult  not to consider 102 and 103 as composed in conversation with each other, and the  Anukramaṇī’s ascription of 103 to Dvita Āptya (“the second Āptya”) clearly plays  off 102’s Trita Āptya (“the third Āptya”—but also the original Āptya from a myth
ological perspective, since he is a commonly mentioned figure and has an Avestan  correspondent, whereas Dvita Āptya is essentially found only here).
### 1
Forth to the ritual adept, to Soma as he is being purified, shall I bear the  upraised speech
like a present, along with my thoughts. He will find enjoyment.
### 2
Around the sheep’s fleeces he rushes, being anointed with cows.
Being purified, the tawny one creates three seats for himself.
### 3
Around the cask dripping with honey he rushes on the sheep’s fleece. The seven voices of the seers have cried out to him.
### 4
Around (he rushes)—the leader of thoughts, belonging to all the gods,  undeceivable.
Soma the tawny, being purified, entered the two cups.
### 5
Around—following your divine independent powers, drive in the same  chariot with Indra,
being purified as an immortal cantor by cantors.
### 6
Around—like a prize-seeking team, the god pressed for the gods,
reaching through (it), the self-purifying one runs through (the filter).

Parvata Kāṇva and Nārada Kāṇva, or the two Apsarases named Śikhaṇḍinī, daugh ters of Kaśyapa
6 verses: uṣṇih
This hymn forms a close pair with 105 and the two are a textbook demonstration  of how R̥gvedic poets generate variations on underlyingly identical lexical and the matic material. The two hymns correspond verse by verse, and even in translation  the identity of many of the words, their grammatical forms, and whole phrases is  clear. But the poets avoid pāda-length repetitions and introduce variation via lexical  replacement or grammatical transformation.
The contents are unremarkable; both hymns deploy the usual soma-hymn tropes,  though the final apotropaic verse is refreshingly vivid.
### 1
Comrades, sit down here; sing forth to him as he is being purified. With sacrifices attend on him like a child for splendor.
### 2
Send him like a calf to join with his mothers—him who brings success to  the household,
who pursues the gods, the exhilarating drink with double strength.
### 3
Purify him who brings success to skill, for him to pursue the troop (of  Maruts),
to be most wealful for Mitra and Varuṇa.

O drop, lord of exhilarating drinks—you are the one affording delight to  the gods—

Agni Cākṣuṣa (1–3), Cakṣus Mānava (4–6), Manu Āpsava (7–9), Agni Cākṣuṣa (10–14) 14 verses: uṣṇih
This last hymn in the uṣṇih collection, as is common with hymns positioned at  the end of their metrical grouping, is too long and needs to be broken down into  smaller units: four tr̥cas (vss. 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12) followed by a two-verse hymn  (13–14). In this case the division is in general accord with the Anukramaṇī, which  ascribes the hymn to three different mythical poets, marked by their patronymic  relationships as grandson, son, and father, each with a tr̥ca. The grandson returns  as poet of the last five verses, that is, of the final tr̥ca (10–12) and the two-verse unit  that ends the hymn.
The contents of the hymn are entirely conventional, with a focus on Indra as  drinker of the soma, especially in the first part of the hymn. Note that “finding the  sun” is also a preoccupation, and that word (svarvíd) appears once in each of the  first three tr̥cas (vss. 1, 4, 9).
### 1
Let these pressed (soma drinks) go to Indra, the tawny ones to the bull, the drops born because of (Indra’s?) attentive hearing, finding the sun. 2. This one here, bringing gain for the taking, purifies himself for Indra  when pressed.
Soma takes note of the victorious one, as is (well) known.
### 3
Indra, in the raptures of just this (soma), grabbed a handful
bringing gain,
and he carried the bullish mace—he who is entirely victorious in the waters.
### 4
Run forth as the wakeful one, o Soma; flow around for Indra, o drop. Bring here brilliant tempestuous force that finds the sun. 5. For Indra purify yourself into bullish exhilaration, as the one visible  to all,
possessing a thousand courses, path-making, wide-gazing.
### 6
The best finder of the way for us, most honeyed for the gods,
drive along your thousand paths, ever roaring.
### 7
Purify yourself in streams, o drop, to pursue the gods with strength. Honeyed, sit in our tub, o Soma.
### 8
Your droplets, swimming in water, have strengthened Indra for
exhilaration.
The gods have drunk you for immortality
### 9
O you pressed drops, run wealth to us here while being purified,
bringing the heavens to rain and the waters to streaming, finding
the sun.
### 10
Soma, being purified in a wave, runs across the fleece of the sheep, at the forefront of speech, self-purifying, ever roaring.
### 11
With insights they impel the prizewinner, playing in the wood, across  the sheep [=fleece].
The thoughts sound together toward the three-backed one.
### 12
He has been sent surging toward the tubs, like a prize-seeking team at a  competition.
Being purified, begetting speech, he has flowed.
### 13
The delightful fallow bay purifies himself, across the tufts, at speed, streaming glory consisting of heroes to the praisers.
### 14
In this way purify yourself, seeking the gods. The streams of honey have  been sent surging.
Rasping, circle around the filter on all sides.

Seven Seers
26 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas, except dvipadā virāj bhurij 3 and dvipadā virāj 16 as supplemental verses to the preceding pragātha
This long hymn mostly stays focused the usual themes of the IXth Maṇḍala: the  pressing of Soma, his journey across the filter, his entry into the waters, his mixing  with cows’ milk, and his arrival at his destination, the wooden cups. Interspersed1354 IX.107
are references to Soma’s cosmic aspect (e.g., the heavenly udder in vs. 5) and cos mic deeds (e.g., making the sun mount in heaven, vs. 7). Especially prominent in  the middle and late parts of the hymn are mentions of the sea (vss. 9, 14, 15, 16,  21, 23), referring both to the waters that the soma enters and to the expanse of  soma itself.
Toward the end the hymn takes a slightly personal turn, in the pragātha of verses  19–20, where the poet celebrates his fellowship with Soma and, by implication, the  mental state he achieves from drinking the soma. In particular, 20cd “We have flown  like birds far past the sun...” recalls several famous 1st-person descriptions of soma’s  effects: VIII.48.3 “We have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to  the light; we have found the gods” and X.119, the Laba-sūkta, in which the soma-drinker  flies through the cosmos, describing his bird’s eye view of heaven and earth.
### 1
From here sprinkle around the pressed drink, which is the soma, the  highest oblation.
The manly one who has run within the waters, the soma did he [=the  priest] press with stones.
### 2
Now, while being purified by the sheep, flow around as one who is  undeceivable, very sweet-smelling.
Even when (you) have just been pressed in the waters, we become
exhilarated by your stalk, while preparing you with cows as the higher  (oblation),
### 3
Being pressed all around to be seen—the exhilarator of the gods, the  wide-gazing drop that is resolve.
### 4
O Soma, you rush while being purified in a stream and clothing yourself  in the waters.
Conferring treasure, you sit here upon the womb of truth as the golden  wellspring, o god.
### 5
Milking the heavenly udder of his own dear honey, he has taken his  ancient seat.
The prizewinner rushes to the support worthy of the asking, the
wide-gazing one rinsed by men.
### 6
O Soma, while being purified all around in the sheep’s fleece, wakeful  and dear,
you became an inspired poet, the best of the Aṅgirases. Equip our
sacrifice with honey.
### 7
Soma the rewarder purifies himself, the best pathfinder, the inspired,  wide-gazing seer.
You became the sage poet who best pursues the gods. You made the sun  mount in heaven.
### 8
Soma, being pressed by the pressers upon the backs of the sheep, drives with his stream as if with a golden horse, drives with his
delighting stream.
### 9
Provided with cows he has flowed together with the cows at the water’s  edge; Soma has flowed together with those that have been milked.
They have gone into the enclosures as if into the sea. The invigorating  one wells out for exhilaration.

O Soma, while you are being pressed by the stones, (you come) here  across the sheep’s fleeces.

### 11
He has become groomed across the fine (hairs) of the ewe, like a  prize-seeking team at a competition.
Self-purifying Soma is to be cheered on by those of inspired thought,  by the inspired reciters of verses.
### 12
O Soma, like a river that has swollen with its flood, you have swollen  forth with the milk of the plant to pursue the gods,
wakeful like an exhilarating drink, toward the cask dripping
with honey.
### 13
The delightful one has clothed himself in a silvery cloak, to be caressed  like a dear son.
The laborers propel him, in their two hands, as they would a chariot,  into the rivers.
### 14
The soma juices, the Āyus, purify themselves into an exhilarating drink  of exhilaration—
they of inspired thought, bringing exhilaration and finding the sun,
(purify themselves) upon the surface of the sea.
### 15
Purifying himself, he crosses the sea with his wave as king and god— and lofty truth—
rushing according to the ordinance of Mitra and Varuṇa, being
propelled—the lofty truth,
### 16
Being guided by men, the delightful, wide-gazing king and god
belonging to the sea.
### 17
Soma purifies himself as the exhilarating drink, pressed for Indra along  with the Maruts.
Possessed of a thousand streams he rushes beyond the sheep’s fleece.  The Āyus groom him.
### 18
Being purified in the cup, a poet begetting thought, Soma rejoices  among the gods.
Clothing himself in waters, he has wrapped himself with cows as the  higher (oblation), sitting in the woods [/wooden cups].

O Soma, I rejoice in your fellowship (with me) every day, o drop.
Many things, o brown one, get me down—way down. Go past these
barriers.
### 20
Both by night and by day, Soma, I am at your udder for fellowship with  you, o brown one.
We have flown like birds far past the sun that scorches with its heat.
### 21
While being groomed, dexterous one, you impel your speech upon  the sea.
O self-purifying one, you rush toward ample, much-craved, golden
wealth.
### 22
Being groomed, purifying yourself on the sheep’s fleece, as bull you  have roared down into the wood(en cup).
O self-purifying Soma, you rush to the rendezvous with the gods, being  anointed with cows.
### 23
Purify yourself to win the prize, (aiming) toward all products of  poetic skill.
Soma, you, the exhilarating one, were [/are] the first to spread out the  sea for the gods.
### 24
Purify yourself all around the earthly realm and the heavenly ones, o  Soma, in accordance with your ordinances.
O wide-gazing one, the inspired poets propel you, resplendent, with
their thoughts and insights.
### 25
Purifying themselves, they have been set loose across the filter in  a steam—
the exhilarating coursers, fit for Indra along with the Maruts, toward  wisdom [/the ritual meal] and pleasing offerings.
### 26
Clothing himself in the waters, he rushes around the cask, the drop  being propelled by the pressers.
Begetting the light, he has made the delighting cows bellow, making the  cows as if into his fresh garment.

Gaurivīti Śāktya 1–2, Śakti Vāsiṣṭha 3, 14–16, Ūru Āṅgirasa 4–5, R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja  6–7, Ūrdhvasadman Āṅgirasa 8–9, Krtaya ̥ śas Āṅgirasa 10–11, R̥ṇaṃcaya 12–13 16 verses: kakubh alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, except gāyatrī yavamadhyā 13, arranged  in pragāthas
The Anukramaṇī names seven different poets as authors of this hymn; the  Anukramaṇī’s divisions do not correspond at all to the clear pragātha structure,  however, and therefore seem questionable. Within the pragāthas there is, more often than not, syntactic dependency between verses (e.g., vss. 3–4, 7–8, 13–14), as well as  some thematic continuity. Stylistically the hymn, especially toward the beginning, is  characterized by rather choppy syntax and often presents itself as a mosaic of semi self-contained phrases. On the other hand, there are signs of ring composition: the  first phrase of the hymn, “purify yourself as the most honeyed for Indra, o Soma”  recurs as the framing words of the first verse of the final pragātha (vs. 15), and the  relative clause about the drinking of soma that introduces verse 2 is echoed, with  the same relative pronoun, in 14a.
Allusions to the Vala myth are found in the interior of the hymn (vss. 4, 6). The  heavenly soma, conceived of in part as rain, is also a prominent theme (vss. 9–11,  and also probably vss. 4 [the “dear immortal one”] and 6 [the “watery” cows]). This  cosmic soma is, as usual, a counterpoint to the ritual soma, the standard details of  whose preparation are found throughout.
### 1
Purify yourself as the most honeyed for Indra, o Soma, as the
exhilarating drink that best finds resolve,
greatly, as the exhilarating drink that best rules heaven,
### 2
Since, having drunk of you, the bull acts as a bull, at the drinking of this  sun-finding (soma).
Bearing good marks he [=Soma] strode toward the refreshments, like  Etaśa toward the prize.

O self-purifying one, it was certainly you as the most brilliant who made  the heavenly races heed

Our (soma) of which Indra will drink, of which the Maruts, or Bhaga  along with Aryaman,
by whom we will bring Mitra and Varuṇa here and Indra here for
great help.

For Indra to drink, o Soma—held by men, having good weapons and  most exhilarating,
purify yourself as the most honeyed.

Enter into the heart of Indra, the repository of soma, like rivers into  the sea,
being pleasing to Mitra, to Varuṇa, to Vāyu, the highest prop of

Dhiṣṇya Fires, descendants of Īśvara
22 verses: dvipadā virāj, arranged in trcas ̥
The Anukramaṇī’s fanciful ascription of this hymn to the dhiṣṇya (“holy”) fires  finds no echo in the composition itself.
The lightness and brevity of this meter (each verse containing four pādas of  a mere five syllables each) do not lend themselves to complex phraseology or elaborate images. Instead the hymn consists primarily of standard apostrophes to  Soma (e.g., the imperative “purify yourself” occurs five times in the hymn: vss. 4, 5,  6, 7, 10) and simple present-tense descriptions of the process of preparation (e.g.,  vs. 11 “they purify”; vs. 12 “they groom”).
For links with the next hymn, see the introduction to IX.110.
### 1
Run forth and around for Indra, o Soma, sweet for Mitra, Pūṣan,  and Bhaga.

110 (822) Soma Pavamāna
Tryaruṇa and Trasadasyu
12 verses: pipīlikamadhyā 1–3, ūrdhvabrhat ̥ ī 4–9, virāj 10–12, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn is made up of verses in three rare meters; in fact verses 4–9 are the only  ones in all of the R̥gveda in this meter (consisting of verses of three pādas of twelve  syllables each), and the first three verses are the only pipīlikamadhyā stanzas in the  R̥gveda with this syllable count (12 8 12). (The meter’s name means “ant-middled,”  because a short pāda is sandwiched between two longer ones.) Despite the hetero
geneity of the meters, there is evidence that the hymn is a conceptual unity, par ticularly in the signs of ring composition: the last two verses (11–12) echo the first  two. “The one who gains the prize” (11c) matches “to gain the prize” in 1a; the two  forms of the root sah “vanquish” in verse 12 (a and c) recall the “vanquisher” in 1b;  the “difficult plunges” in 12b are the negative counterpart of Soma’s plunge in 2c.  Internally we may note that the begetting of the sun in verse 3, at the end of the first  tr̥ca (3a, with its initial verb ájījanaḥ) is immediately reprised in 4a, in a new meter,  again with the fronted verb ájījanaḥ.
The hymn also echoes some of the vocabulary and phraseology of the preceding  hymn, X.109, whose metrical simplicity is in marked contrast to this hymn. Both  hymns begin almost identically, though adjusted by the addition of particles for the  metrical difference: IX.109.1a pári prá dhanva and 110.1a páry ū ṣú prá dhanva ...,  both meaning “run forth and around.” The rare word pīyū́ṣa “beestings, first-milk,”  which makes two appearances in 109 (vss. 3, 6), recurs in 110.8, qualified as “the  beestings of heaven” (diváḥ pīyū́ṣam) like the “heavenly beestings” of 109.3 (divyáḥ
pīyū́ṣaḥ).
In content the first three and the last three (10–12) verses are fairly straight forward, and, especially the last three verses, are concerned with the earthly soma  of the ritual, though also celebrating his great powers in confronting enemies and  obstacles. A hint of the cosmic soma comes in verse 3, in the aforementioned beget ting of the sun, though in this verse this action is linked with Soma’s ritual progress.  The middle six verses (4–9), in an otherwise unattested meter, are more difficult  and treat the interaction and blurred boundaries between earthly, ritual soma and cosmic soma. The gods’ yearning for soma (see esp. vs. 6) and the primal prepara tion of soma (see esp. vss. 7–8) are described, and the final verse of this group (vs.  9) declares Soma’s universal power.
### 1
Run forth and around to gain the prize, around as the vanquisher of  obstacles.
As the requiter of our debts, you speed [/are implored] to overcome
hatreds.
### 2
Because we cheer you on, Soma, when you are pressed for the great  (prize), in your kingship in the clash,
you plunge forward toward the prizes, o self-purifying one.
### 3
For you have begotten the sun, o self-purifying one, in spreading your  milk by your skill,
hastening along with Plenitude, who is lively with cows.
### 4
You have begotten it, o immortal one, here among mortals, upon the  foundation of the truth, of the dear immortal one [=heavenly soma]. You have always flowed, ever streaming toward the prize.
### 5
Because with your fame you drilled ever closer to the inexhaustible  drink for men, as if to some kind of wellspring,
while being carried in the (priest’s) hands, like (booty by someone) with  arrows in his hands—
### 6
Because of that, seeing for themselves a friendship with him who is  radiant with goods [=Soma], some heavenly beings roared to him.
He uncovers the fleece as the god Savitar uncovers a desirable thing.
### 7
In you, Soma, those who first twisted the ritual grass placed their  insight for the great prize of victory and for fame.
Impel our (insight), o hero, for heroic power.
### 8
The ancient beestings of heaven, worthy of hymns—they milked that  out of the great depth of heaven.
They cried out in unison toward Indra as he was being born.
### 9
Now, o self-purifying one, in that (you) sur(mount) these two worlds  here and all these creatures by your greatness,
outstanding like a bull in the herd you extend yourself over them.
### 10
Self-purifying Soma, being purified in the sheep’s fleece, has streamed,  playing like a child—
the drop possessing a thousand streams and a hundred prizes.
### 11
This one being purified, the honeyed and truth-possessing drop, the  sweet wave, purifies himself for Indra—
the one who gains the prize, finds wide space, and confers vitality.
### 12
Purify yourself, vanquishing the battlers, repelling demons and difficult  plunges,
having good weapons, having vanquished your rivals, Soma.

111 (923) Soma Pavamāna
Anānata Pārucchepi
3 verses: atyaṣṭi
This hymn is the only one in the IXth Maṇḍala in the intricate atyaṣṭi meter, with  its variable lines and patterned repetition. The poet, according to the Anukramaṇī,  is Anānata son of Parucchepa, a poet not otherwise represented in the R̥gveda.  However, his putative father, Parucchepa, is the author, again according to the  Anukramaṇī, of I.127–39, the only sustained corpus of atyaṣṭi in the R̥gveda.
The hymn begins with a description of Soma’s journey, and the final verse (vs.  3) returns to this theme. The middle verse (vs. 2) is a brief, and quite enigmatic,  treatment of the Vala myth. In our view it involves something of a reversal of some  standard tropes. The 2nd-person subject of the first three pādas of the verse is  Soma, who is here credited with retrieving the cows stolen by the Paṇis. These cows,  of course, also represent the milk with which the soma will be mixed. Soma then  grooms or cleans these cows along with his (or their?) mothers. Now ordinarily it is  Soma who is groomed; he doesn’t perform any grooming on others. And a number  of translators and commentators have attempted to make the verb used here (mar jayasi) reflect this normal usage. However, this particular verb form is emphatically  and unambiguously transitive, and it seems likely that the poet is thus drawing our  attention to the role reversal, with the usual female agents of Soma’s grooming  relegated to auxiliaries.
The reference of the next item, the melody or sāman, is equally obscure. If it  is part of the Vala myth, it may refer to the song sung by Indra/Br̥haspati and the  Aṅgirases to open the cave and free the cows; they came “from afar” bringing their  song, and to the cows within the cave the song would have sounded “from afar.” It  is also possible that the simile just refers to a general situation, the pleasure one gets  from hearing a snatch of song out of nowhere. In any case in the last portion of this  verse Soma acquires vigor or vitality from the cows, who are also identified as the  three forms of ritual speech.
### 1
Being purified with this golden light, he crosses all hatreds with (horses)  of his own yoking—like the Sun with the (horses) of his own yoking.
In the stream of pressed (juice) he shines ruddy and tawny as he is being  purified,
when he makes the circuit of all his forms by (the impetus of) the
versifiers—by (the impetus of) the versifiers with their seven mouths.
### 2
You found that good thing of the Paṇis [=herd of cows]. You groom (it),  along with your mothers, in your own house—in your house through  the insights of truth.
Like a melody (heard) from afar, this is where the insights find pleasure. He has acquired vitality through the tripartite ruddy (cows)—shining, he  has acquired vitality. 3. Following his earlier [/eastern] direction he drives, ever observant. He  aligns himself with the reins [/(sun’s) rays] as a chariot lovely to
see—a heavenly chariot lovely to see.
The hymns, the manly powers, have come: they excite Indra to victory, when you [=Soma] and his mace become unbudgeable—unbudgeable in  battles.
The last three hymns in the IXth Maṇḍala share a refrain, are all in paṅkti meter,  and can be safely considered supplements to the original book on the grounds of  language and subject matter (see Oldenberg 1888: 202).

112 (824) Soma Pavamāna
Śiśu Āṅgirasa
4 verses: paṅkti
This charming little hymn has no obvious connection to soma except through its  refrain (which it shares with the next two hymn, 113–114, also in the same meter),  which sits oddly in each verse, and through the glancing mention of the soma-presser  in 1d. The diversity of people’s occupations and of their goals is the theme, presented  in casual style and sometimes colloquial language (see especially the designations for  father and mother in vs. 3), with the gently cynical message that what everyone really  wants is gain or an easy life. The final verse (4) opens out to the nonhuman world.
Perhaps the most interesting verse, as a small window on realia, is the second  one, which presents a rare picture of a smith and his equipment. The “old plants”  must be for producing a hot fire, the “feathers of birds” for fanning the flames, and  the stones are probably whetstones.
Casting about for a reason for the refrain and for the inclusion of this hymn in  the IXth Maṇḍala—it may be that the point of the refrain is that, like the people  and animals mentioned in the body of the text, the drop has its own goal, particular  to itself, namely simply to seek Indra. Or perhaps the hymn was simply too delight
ful to abandon.
### 1
Truly our thoughts are various, and the obligations of peoples are  different:
a carpenter seeks the broken, a healer the injured, a formulator a man  who presses soma.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
### 2
With old [=dry] plants, with the feathers of birds,
and with stones—throughout the days the smith seeks a man who
has gold.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.1364 IX.113
### 3
I am a bard, Papa a healer, and Mama is pushing a pestle.
Having varying thoughts but (all) seeking goods, we follow (goods)
like cows.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
### 4
The draft-horse seeks an easy-rolling chariot, beguilers a joke;
the penis seeks the hairy split, the frog just seeks water.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.

113 (825) Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
11 verses: paṅkti
The special interest of this hymn rests in the vision of heaven in its second half.  Most strikingly, the imagery that describes this heaven—its freedom, joy, and sat isfaction of all desires—occurs again in the Upaniṣads to characterize the mysti cal realization of the self. The hymn begins more or less as a conventional soma  hymn, however. In verse 1 Indra is urged to drink the soma to strengthen himself  for action, and in verse 2 Soma is commanded to purify himself, with the signature  imperative pavasva. Verse 2 also introduces the theme of true ritual speech, which is  taken up again in verses 4–6. Verse 3 seems to contain an interlude about the rain,  which provides the sap to the soma plant, though the mythological sequence involv ing the Daughter of the Sun and the Gandharvas is obscure.
Verses 6 and 7 are the omphalos verses and provide a dramatic transition from  the poet’s description of the preparation of soma in the first half of the hymn to  a vision of heaven (vss. 7–11), where immortality and the fulfillment of all desires  are attained. Verse 6 is still set on the ritual ground and is in some ways the climax  of the hymn, for it anticipates the drinking of the soma. Since soma is the drink of  deathlessness, the ceremony becomes the place of immortality. Verse 6 is also gram
matically incomplete, consisting only of a dependent clause and producing tension  awaiting resolution in a main clause that will answer the implicit question: “what  will happen in this ‘where’?” The first half of verse 7 is responsive to 6 and thus  builds the tension, but the locus of the “where” has changed: the poet has trans
formed the ritual space into the heavenly realm. The tension finds its release in the  second half of verse 7, with the long-postponed main clause. The remaining verses  reproduce the structure of verse 7, enlarging and embellishing the vision of the  immortal world.
What links the first half of the hymn to the second, besides the transforma tive responsion of verses 6–7? The answer is not entirely clear, but it seems that  the true speech that accompanies the preparation of the soma (vs. 2), perhaps the  natural speech of the thunder (vs. 3), the true speech Soma himself speaks (vs. 4),  the sacred formulation with which he is purified (vs. 5), and the verbal behavior of the formulator of that formulation (vs. 6) provide Soma with the power to bestow  immortality. He does so by placing the poet in the immortal realms, and placing is  also a recurrent theme in the first half of the hymn: Indra places soma’s strength  in himself in verse 1; the rain is placed in soma as his juice in verse 3; soma is pre
pared by the Placer in verse 4; the sun was placed in the heavenly world in 7b, and  finally the poet implores Soma to place him in the same world in 7c. The first two  of these placings also involve clear transformation of substance:  soma becomes  Indra’s strength; the rain becomes soma’s sap. We can also see transformation in  the Placer’s preparation of soma in verse 4, as this preparation makes a physical  substance into a drink of immortality, and ultimately in Soma’s placing of the poet  in the immortal world, which will make the poet himself immortal. The command  of the second half of verse 7 “place me in that immortal, imperishable world” is fol lowed by the command refrain of the remaining four verses (8–11), “there make me  immortal,” a sequence that appears to support the notion that the “placing” both  precedes and causes the poet’s transformation.

Let Indra, Vr̥tra-smasher, drink the soma in the reed-filled (place), placing strength in himself as he is about to perform a great heroic deed. – O drop, flow around for Indra.

114 (826) Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
4 verses: paṅkti
This final hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala has the feeling of an afterthought. The seer  addresses himself in verse 2, and the fortunate ritualist depicted in verse 1 is most  likely Kaśyapa as well. In verse 3 he produces a triad of heptads, which have little to  do with his call to Soma to protect us (3d). The final verse (4) repeats this call and  enlarges on the dangers we wish to avoid.
### 1
The one who has stridden along the domains of the self-purifying drop, of him they say “(he will) have good offspring”—the one who has
dedicated his thought to you, Soma.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
### 2
O seer Kaśyapa, strengthening up your songs with the praises of the  mantra-makers,
do homage to Soma the king, who was born as the lord of plants.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
### 3
Seven are the quarters, each with its separate sun; seven are the Hotars  sacrificing in due order.
The Āditya gods, who are seven—with them, o Soma, protect us.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
### 4
The oblation that is readied for you, o king—with that, o Soma,
protect us.
Let no hostile man overcome us, and let nothing whatsoever afflict us. – O drop, flow around for Indra.

Agni Vaiśvānara
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
3 verses: triṣṭubh
A rather perfunctory and quite brief hymn, with phraseology borrowed from other  hymns. Verse 2 seems to refer to the myth of the Agni’s disappearance.
## 01
Might we be in the favor of Vaiśvānara, for he is the king and full glory  of the creatures.
Born from here, he surveys this whole (world). Vaiśvānara aligns himself  with the sun.
## 02
Sought in heaven and sought on earth, being sought, Agni entered all the  plants.
Sought forcefully, let Agni Vaiśvānara protect us from harm by day and  by night.
## 03
Vaiśvānara, let this come true of you: let riches and generous patrons  accompany us.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.

The Xth maṇḍala consists of 191 hymns like Maṇḍala I, but it has a more miscel laneous character and looser organization than its twin. As a whole, X was certainly  the final addition to the codified R̥gveda, and it contains many hymns with younger  linguistic features and “popular” themes, or at least subjects that were not central to  the soma sacrifice that dominates the rest of the R̥gveda and determines the choice  of hymns to be included or excluded in the rest of the text. These include life-cycle  rituals like the funeral and the wedding, meta-reflections on the sacrifice and its  parts, additional mythological material, celebrations of deities and divine forces  peripheral to the soma sacrifice, dramatic monologues and dialogues, healing spells  and curses, and so forth. However, it is easy to overemphasize the special character  of X, for, when compared even with the chronologically close Atharvaveda, the  intricate, playful, and allusive style, the lexicon, and the complex development of  themes of most of X are quite distinctively R̥gvedic.
Approximately half the maṇḍala is organized into collections generally attrib uted to individual poets. The first few of these collections are comparable in num ber of hymns to those in I, but starting with X.61 the hymns are arranged first in  pairs (61–84) and then, beginning with X.85, as individual hymns.
This maṇḍala contains too many striking hymns, famous or unsung, to list here.  The reader is referred to the introductions to the individual collections and hymns.
The first nine hymns of Maṇḍala X are assigned to two different poets: Trita Āptya  1–7 and Triśiras Tvāṣṭra (“Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar”) 8–9. Both of these are  mythological figures, who appear as opponents in the same myth, which is narrated  briefly at the end of X.8. Although the poets’ names were generated from the mytho
logical material and therefore do not reflect “real” poets, it is clear from their narra tive connection that the hymns belong together (Oldenberg 1888: 232–35). All of the Trita Āptya hymns (1–7) and the first two-thirds of X.8 are dedicated  to Agni. The last three verses of X.8 (7–9), where the myth of the confrontation of  Trita Āptya and his three-headed opponent is narrated, is assigned to Indra by the  Anukramaṇī. The final hymn (X.9) is to the Waters.

An appropriate beginning to an Agni cycle, this hymn recounts the birth of the  ritual fire at dawn—the word jātá “at birth, once born” is repeated four times in the  hymn (vss. 1–3, 6). But this nascent fire is endowed with cosmic importance, identi fied as the embryo of the two worlds (vs. 2) and compared to Viṣṇu in his lofty reach  (vs. 3ab). The role of his hymnists is also given its due (3cd), and Agni’s pivotal  priestly role in the sacrifice is emphasized as the hymn continues (vss. 5cd–7). In the  final verse (7) Agni is sent forth to bring the gods to the ritual ground, where the  sacrifice can begin.
1. At the forefront of the dawns he has stood upright on high. Having gone  out from darkness, he has come here with light.
With his luminous beam, Agni, beautiful of limb, has filled all the seats  at his birth.
2. At your birth you are the embryo of the two world-halves, o Agni, the  beloved one dispersed among the plants.
A brilliant babe, circling around the dark shades and the nights, you  have come forth from your mothers, constantly roaring.
3. In just such a way as Viṣṇu, knowing his farthest (step), at his birth he  protects on high the third (seat?).
When with their mouth they have made their own milk [=poetry] for  him, they with single mind chant to him here.
4. And then your birth-givers [=kindling wood], bringing nurture, proceed  toward you, who are strengthened by food, with food;
you go toward them in turn as they (acquire) other forms [=burn]. You  are the Hotar among the clans of Manu.
5. (They chant) to the Hotar of the rite, possessing a brilliant chariot, the  luminous beacon of every sacrifice,
to Agni, who is the half-sharer with every god in his greatness, but in his  beauty the guest of the peoples.
6. Agni, donning garments and ornaments on the navel of earth,
ruddy at birth in the footprint of the refreshment—when set in front, o  king, sacrifice to the gods here.
7. Because you have ever extended through heaven and earth, Agni, as a  son extends both his parents,
drive forth to those eager ones and convey the gods here, o youngest
powerful one. X.2 (828) Agni
Trita Āptya

The most salient characteristic of the hymn is its concern with the ritual sequence  (r̥tú) and with Agni as the god who ensures that these sequences are properly  arranged and performed. In this feature it reminds us of the hymns devoted to the  r̥tugrahas (the offering of “sequential cups” to an ordered set of divinities by an  ordered series of priests); see I.15 and II.36–37. Although our hymn has much in  common with those hymns, it does not provide the complete series, as those hymns  do. Instead it focuses on Agni as the Hotar and the central figure in the sacrificial  program—the senior partner, as it were, in the ritual enterprise involving both Agni  and mortals as officiants. Agni’s most important quality in this hymn is knowl edge: he is called vidvā́n (or pravidvā́n) “knowing” four times in the hymn (vss. 1,  3, 4, 7), and “discerning” (vijānán) once (vs. 5). The epithet we have translated as  “Establisher of Thought” in verse 2 (mandhātár) probably also participates in this  theme, since it is etymologically almost identical to the name of the chief divinity in  the Old Iranian pantheon, Ahura Mazdā, “Lord Wisdom” (< Proto Indo-Iranian  *mn̥s-dhaH). Mortals, by contrast, are very un-knowing (áviduṣṭara, vs. 4)  and  prone to moral and ritual mistakes (vss. 4–5).
Less prominent in the hymn, but noteworthy because of the importance of this  theme later in the Xth Maṇḍala, is the distinction between the path going to the  gods (vs. 3)  and that to the forefathers (vs. 7), which figures prominently in the  funeral hymns (X.14–18).
1. Please the gods, who are eager for it, o youngest one. Knowing the ritual  sequences, o lord of the sequences, perform the sacrifice here.
Those divine sequential-sacrificers—along with them, o Agni, you are  the best sacrificer among the Hotars.
2. Pursue the office of Hotar and of Potar of the peoples. You are the  Establisher of Thought and the Giver of Wealth, possessing the truth. (When) at the svāhā-call we shall make the oblations, let Agni the god  sacrifice to the gods, (himself) deserving it.
3. We have come along the path of the gods, to carry forward along it what  we can.
Agni is the one who knows: he will perform the sacrifice; just he is the  Hotar. He will arrange the rites, he the ritual sequences.
4. If we shall confound the commandments of you who know, o gods—we  who are so very unknowing—
knowing Agni fulfills all this through the ritual sequences by which he  will arrange the gods.
1370 X.3
5. If, naively in their thinking and scant in skill, mortals do not pay heed to  the sacrifice,
discerning Agni, the Hotar, finding the resolve, will sacrifice to the gods  as best sacrificer according to the ritual sequence.
6. Because the begetter has begotten you as the face of all the rites, their  brilliant beacon,
so win by sacrifice, throughout the lands filled with superior men, eagerly  sought cattle-rich refreshments belonging to all peoples.
7. You whom Heaven and Earth, you whom the waters, you whom Tvaṣṭar,  the good begetter, has begotten,
you, knowing the way along the path leading to the forefathers—once  kindled, beam brilliantly in all directions, o Agni.

The very moment of transition from night to dawn is the event celebrated in this  hymn—the time when the ritual fire is kindled. Agni’s triumph over Night, a female,  and his welcoming of Dawn, likewise a female, are the subjects of the first three  verses, and the whole hymn is pervaded by Agni’s wide shining and the many words  that express his radiance and brightness.
The poet is also fond of synesthetic images, as when his journeys “kindle” calls  in verse 4, or his beams “purify themselves” (the signature verb of the soma drinks)  like sounds (probably of soma as well) in verse 5. The poet’s pet word for Agni, aratí “spoked wheel” (vss. 1, 2, 6, and 7), presumably originally referring to the shape of  the fireplace, prompts a number of chariot and journey images through the hymn  (vss. 4, 6, 7).
1. The powerful spoked wheel, now kindled, has appeared, to exercise his  skill—he who is Rudra-wild but of easy birth, o king.
Observant, he beams widely with his lofty beam. Driving away black  (Night), he comes to luminous (Dawn).
2. When with his form he has prevailed over black, mottled (Night),  begetting the young woman [=Dawn], the child of a lofty father
[=Heaven],
propping upright the radiance of the sun, the spoked wheel of heaven  beams widely with the Vasus.
3. The auspicious male [=Sun], in company with the auspicious female  [=Dawn], has come here. As her lover, he approaches his sister from
behind. Through the days with their good portents, Agni, spreading out, has  prevailed over the night with his luminous colors.
4. Of this one here—of Agni, our kindly companion—his journeys are, as  it were, kindling the calls of the lofty one [=pressing stone?];
on the journey of the lofty bull worthy to be invoked, the nights appear  as his own beams.
5. Whose beams, like the sounds (of soma?), purify themselves when the  lofty one, bringing the good day, is shining—
he who reaches heaven with his most eminent, sharpest, playful, highest  radiant beams.
6. His snortings resound when he, his wheel-rim visible, is panting along  with his teams—
he who, the best of gods, the spoked wheel of wide extent, beams widely  with his age-old, luminous, crackling (flames).
7. Convey here something great for us and take your seat here as the spoked  wheel of Heaven and Earth, the two youthful ones.
May Agni, powerfully thrusting, with his powerfully thrusting horses,  the tempestuous one with his tempestuous ones, come here.

The usual high points of the birth and growth of Agni are covered in this hymn.  What gives the hymn its character are the concentrated and somewhat unusual  images that are studded through it. This is already evident in verse 1, where Agni  (who is fire, after all) is compared to “the first drink in a wasteland”; presumably  the point of comparison is that both are eagerly desired and it is not certain they  will appear. A  series of similes involving domestic animals follow in verses 2–3,  while verses 4–6 concern the firewood that covers the nascent fire and that it begins  to consume. The most elaborate and surprising image is found in verse 6, where the  two arms of the priest who is tending the fire are compared to two thieves entering  the woods, risking their lives. “Going into the woods” must refer to the manipula tion of the firewood; the “risk” must be that of being burned. But why “thieves”?  Most commentators think that the thieves are entering the wood to attack travel
ers and tie them up with cords—the ten cords compared to the priest’s ten fingers.  Perhaps, but the image is the more resonant for not being entirely transparent.
1. I begin the sacrifice to you and I propel my thought to you, so that you  will become the one to be extolled at our invocations.
You are like the first drink in a wasteland, o Agni, for Pūru who seeks to  attain (you), you age-old king.
1372 X.5
2. You, upon whom the peoples converge like cows on a warm pen, o  youngest one,
you are the messenger of gods and of mortals. A great one, you act the  go-between through the luminous realm.
3. Raising you like a thoroughbred foal, your mother carries you, seeking  your joint delight.
From the high plain you drive eagerly along the slope. Like a herd
animal set loose, you are seeking to gain your livelihood.
4. We fools do not (know) your greatness, o you who are no fool; but,  observant Agni, you surely know it.
His covering [=wood] lies still; he moves, eating it with his tongue. The  clanlord licks the young woman [=offering ladle] again and again.
5. Wherever it may be, he is born anew among the old ones. He stands in  the wood—a grey one with a banner of smoke.
Although no swimmer, he pursues the waters like a bull—he whom the  mortals, of one mind, lead forward.
6. Like thieves who go into the woods risking their lives, the two (arms)  have harnessed (the firewood? Agni?) with ten cords [=fingers].
Here for you, Agni, is a newer inspired thought: hitch it up like a chariot  with your blazing limbs.
7. Sacred formulation and homage and this song here shall always be  strengthening for you, o Jātavedas.
Guard our progeny and posterity, o Agni, and guard our own bodies  unremittingly.
## 5 (831) Agni
Trita Āptya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
A mystical and enigmatic hymn, with a number of conceptual and phraseological  connections with other such hymns in the R̥gveda. There are numerous conflicting  interpretations of this hymn, not surprisingly. We will just present our own, with  all due caution. In our view the standard theme of the birth of Agni/the ritual fire,  its growing strength, and the rise of its flames and smoke to heaven is grafted onto  a treatment of the mysteries of creation and a claim that poets (or, to be more  explicit, “sage poets,” kaví) have special access to these mysteries and indeed antici
pate and direct the natural processes.
We should start by noting that the name Agni occurs only once in the hymn, at  the beginning of the last half-verse (7c), though he is present in every verse. The  hymn begins with a reference to the sea, but various parallels make it clear that  this “sea” is really the sea in our heart and the source of poetic insight. The poet  claims that this sea is a single entity, but that Agni, who has many births, emerges from it. Already the poet is establishing the priority of poetry over even the god  Agni and the ritual he represents. Pāda c seems to describe the birth of Agni from  the kindling sticks (or possibly also the two world-halves, or night and day). His  later journey to heaven is anticipated by his identification with a bird in pāda d.
In verse 2 the bullish buffaloes in the same nest and the mares with which they  unite are presumably the flames of the fire, mingling and twisting in the fireplace.  The birth of the fire is further described in verse 3, where again the two parents  referred to are probably the kindling sticks but may also represent cosmic pairings.  The cosmic aspect becomes clear in verse 4, where the fire rises between the two  world-halves, which nourish it. The fire rises in the midspace with its flames in verse  5, while in verse 6 it is pictured as a pillar stretching to very highest heaven. Verse  6 reprises some of the vocabulary of the beginning of the hymn: the foundation  (dharúṇa) of verse 1 and the nest (nīḍá) of verse 2 and thus transports the original  earthly birthplace of fire to a new location.
The final verse (7) connects this heavenward journey of the fire [/Agni] with the  issue of creation. The paradoxical phrase “both the nonexistent and the existent”  that famously begins the creation hymn X.129 is a signal that the undifferentiated  mass of matter (for want of a better word) that precedes real creation is present in  the highest heaven where the male Dakṣa, the “skillful one” (in this case identified  with Agni), and the female Aditi, the pair that set the processes of creation into  motion in another famous creation hymn (X.72; see esp. vss. 4–5), are born. Agni  is also identified with the androgynous bovine (both bull and milk-cow) that pre sides over creation in another treatment thereof (III.38; see esp. vs. 7). Thus “our”  just-born ritual fire is identified as both the first created thing and the creator itself,  and ritual time, as so often, recapitulates cosmic time.
We have not yet said anything about the poets’ role, beyond noting the assertion of  priority in verse 1. In verses 2–3 the poets oversee “the track of truth” and control the  thread that others (priests? gods?) are pursuing; we interpret this to mean that the poets  are directing or at least keeping safe the cosmic progress of the fire (see the trails in vs.  4), and in verse 6 it is the poets who establish the boundaries that define its journey.  Also in verse 2 they anticipate the endpoint of the fire’s journey by setting in a secret  place “the highest names.” Since creation is generally viewed as the differentiation of  the mass mentioned above into individual entities with “name and form,” the poets’  control of the hidden names in verse 2 signals their participation in the creative process.
There is much that remains unclear in this hymn, particularly the seven  boundaries in verse 6.  But the connection between the birth of the ritual fire  and the Ur-creation, mediated by the poets, seems to be the conceptual focus of  this hymn.
1. The sea is (just) one, the foundation of riches, but he, having many births,  gazes out from us, from our heart.
He attends upon the udder in the lap of the two that are hidden. The  track of the bird has been set down in the middle of the wellspring.1374 X.6
2. Cloaking themselves [/dwelling] in the same nest, the bullish buffaloes  have united with the mares.
The sage poets protect the track of truth: they have placed in hiding the  highest names.
3. The two possessing both truth and magical power have conjoined with  one another. Having given him his measure, they have given birth to
the babe, making him grow—
him who is the navel of everything, both the moving and the fixed. They  [=gods? priests?] with their mind are also pursuing the thread of
the poet,
4. For the trails of truth (follow) the well-born one, and refreshments follow  (him) from of old for the prize.
The two world-halves, having cloaked themselves in their over-cloak,  have strengthened (their own child) with ghee-drops and foods
of honey.
5. Having bellowed [/being eager], the knowing one has carried up the seven  ruddy sisters from the honey, to be seen.
He held them, born earlier, within the midspace. Seeking a covering, he  has found the one belonging to Pūṣana.
6. The sage poets have fashioned seven boundaries. To just one of these has  the narrow one gone.
The pillar stands on its foundations in the nest of the highest Āyu where  the paths give out.
7. Both the nonexistent and the existent are in the highest heaven, at the  birth of the skillful one in the lap of Aditi.
Agni is for us the first-born of truth, both a bull and a milk-cow in his  previous lifetime.

After the enigmas of the preceding hymn, the relative simplicity of this one comes  as some relief. It begins with an annunciatory “here he is,” and the remainder of  the first three verses consists of relative clauses describing Agni. Relative clauses  also dominate verses 5–6. The contents are fairly standard: Agni’s radiance (esp.  vss. 1–2), his role in the sacrifice and his reciprocal relationship with the poet and  priest (vss. 3–5), and prayers for Agni’s intervention in bringing help and other  good things to us (vss. 6–7). These last two verses address Agni directly; in the first  five verses he appears only in the 3rd person. Unlike the last hymn, in which the  word agní appeared only in the last half-verse, this hymn contains a form of the  name in every verse. 1. Here he is—Agni, in whose protection, in whose charge, and by whose  help the singer thrives—
the far-radiant one who circles around, encircled by the peerless radiant  beams of the dawn rays;
2. The far-radiant one who beams afar with his radiant beams together  with the gods—truthful, untiring Agni—
who has pursued comradeship for his comrades, undeviating like a
teamed steed;
3. Who has control of every effort to pursue the gods and has control of  the dawn at its dawning throughout a full lifetime;
Agni, upon whom a man possessing an invulnerable chariot [=sacrifice]  props his oblations zealously with fortifying (hymns).
4. Grown strong with the fortifying (hymns) and being delighted by the  chants, with swift flight he goes to the gods.
As the gladdening, best-sacrificing Hotar, with his tongue Agni sprinkles  the gods, mingling together (with them).
5. With hymns and reverent gestures attract him here at dawn like
Indra—quivering Agni,
whom the inspired poets hymn with their thoughts—Jātavedas, the
tongue of the overpowering (gods).
6. You in whom all good things have joined together, like horses forming a  team at a contest in their own way—
o Agni, attract here, near to us, the forms of help most cherished
by Indra.
7. Then, o Agni, because, having sat down with greatness, immediately on  being born you became the one to be invoked,
the gods followed your will. Then the foremost helpers became strong.

This last of the Trita Āptya hymns is not particularly noteworthy, though it shows  some affinities with hymns earlier in the Trita Āptya sequence. Verses 5–6 point to  Agni’s role as “seasonal sacrificer” (r̥tv-íj), a role explored in X.2. Agni’s supreme  competence as a sacrificer is contrasted with the potential incompetence of the  mortal sacrificer in verse 4, as in X.2.5. Otherwise the hymn seems primarily con
cerned with the material gain that will come to the mortal sacrificer for his ritual  efforts (see esp. vss. 1d, 2, 4, and 7).
1. Provide well-being to us from heaven and from earth, (for us) to sacrifice  for a full lifetime, o god Agni.
1376 X.8
Might we be accompanied by your visible signs, o wondrous one. Make  wide space for us in exchange for our wide lauds, o god.
2. These thoughts were born for you, o Agni. They applaud your generosity  with its cows and horses,
when the mortal has attained the benefit from you, acquiring it by (these)  thoughts, o well-born good one.
3. I consider Agni our father, Agni our friend, Agni our brother and our  comrade forever.
I do honor to the face of lofty Agni, the worshipful luminous (face) of  the Sun in heaven.
4. Our insights are effective and bring gain to us, o Agni. Whomever you, as  his own Hotar, safeguard in his house,
(let) that truthful one (be) possessed of chestnut horses and much
livestock; for him let there be treasure throughout the days and
daytimes.
5. To the one established throughout the days like an ally for the
harnessing, the ancient sequential-sacrificer and lover of the rite,
to Agni did the Āyus give birth with their arms and install among the  clans as their Hotar.
6. Perform sacrifice by yourself to the gods in heaven, o god. How can a  callow man without discernment do it for you?
Just as you sacrificed to the gods, o god, according to the ritual
sequences, so perform sacrifice to your own body, o well-born one.
7. Become our helper, Agni, and our herdsman; become the creator of  vitality and the provider of vitality for us.
And grant to us the giving of oblations, o very great one, and safeguard  our bodies unremittingly.
## 8 (834) Agni (1–6), Indra (7–9)
Triśiras Tvāṣṭra
9 verses: triṣṭubh
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn, along with the following one (X.9  to the Waters), to a different poet from the first seven Agni hymns of the maṇḍala,  which are attributed to Trita Āptya, it is fairly clear that these nine hymns belong  together, on the basis of criteria like shared phraseology, as well as larger structural  considerations. (See Oldenberg 1888: 233–34.) The poet of X.8–9 is given as Triśiras  Tvāṣṭra, a speaking name: “Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar” and a figure who is the  mythological enemy of Trita. Thus, as Oldenberg saw, the two poets to whom this  sequence of nine hymns is ascribed are narratively linked, and both names were  probably assigned as poets to these hymns because of the mythological narrative  sketched in this particular hymn. Trita’s defeat of his three-headed foe, also known as Viśvarūpa (“having all  forms”), is treated in the last three verses of our hymn (7–9). The myth goes back to  Indo-Iranian times in one form or other. In the Younger Avestan Hom Yašt (Yasna  9–11), Zarathushtra asks the Haoma (= Skt. Soma) the names and stories of the  men who first pressed him. In Y 9.7–8 Haoma names a certain Āϑβiia (note the  similarity to, but not identity with, Āpt(i)ya) as the second man to press him, whose  son, Θraētaona, smote a mighty serpent-dragon (Aži Dahāka; cf. the Sanskrit  cognate áhi “serpent” frequently used of Vr̥tra) with three heads (ϑrikamǝrǝδa; cf.  mūrdhán “head” in vss. 3 and 6 of this hymn). Immediately thereafter (Y 9.10–11)  he identifies Θrita (= Skt. Trita) as his third presser, one of whose sons defeats  another formidable dragon (also aži) in a particularly imaginative fashion. The  names Āϑβiia and Θrita, though differently distributed, and the three-headed mon ster speak strongly for the kinship of the two myths, though they are not identical  in all their features.
What is not clear is why this little mythic vignette has been appended at the end  of this Agni cycle, though we will suggest some reasons at the end of the introduc tion. Here and elsewhere in Vedic the story of Trita Āptya’s slaying of three-headed  Viśvarūpa is associated with Indra (even in this hymn; see vss. 8–9), not Agni, and  it is assimilated in several ways to the better-known Vala myth—generally an Indra  myth. First, Trita Āptya begins his quest in a cave or hole of some sort (vs. 7a), and  the happy result of the defeat of Viśvarūpa is the release of his cows (vss. 8–9)—just  as the cows confined in the Vala cave are released at the end of that myth. Moreover,  the “familial” (vs. 7) or “ancestral” (vs. 8) weapons Trita employs in the fight appear  to be mental and verbal (see especially the “visionary thought” he seeks in 7b and  his “speaking” his weapons in 7d). In the Vala myth Indra and his helpers, the  Aṅgirases, break open the cave with verbal spells, not physical weapons. Since the  corresponding Avestan version does not have these elements, it is likely that these  Vala-like features were grafted onto the inherited myth, whose popularity was per
haps waning in R̥gvedic times. (It does have a robust revival in Vedic prose.) The first few verses of the hymn for the most part contain standard Agni fare,  though with a cosmic dimension. The fire, conceived of also as a powerful male  animal, reaches through the worlds to heaven itself (vs. 1), just after it is born (vs. 2).  His birth and installation are further treated in verse 3, where the ritual references  probably also have cosmic referents. The hymn begins to take an odd turn in verse  4. In that verse Agni “sets seven steps,” thereby “begetting an alliance (or, the god  Mitra).” The seven-step reference is to the culminating ritual action particularly  of the marriage ceremony, after which the marriage is irrevocable, when the bride  and groom take seven steps together; other alliances can be assimilated to the mar riage alliance by the performance of the seven steps (see Jamison 1996a: 120–23).  These seven steps are always taken beside the ritual fire, and as Proferes (2007) has  discussed at length (on this particular passage, see p. 61), the fire is also a symbol  of the alliances made by social groups. Through those alliances the fire itself is  strengthened and increased, hence the “for the sake of your own body” in this verse.  The reason for this intrusion of the social world at this point in the hymn is unclear,
1378 X.8
since heretofore the focus has been entirely on Agni. In the following verses (5–6)  Agni is identified with, or transformed into, a series of divinities and functional  roles. Perhaps these identifications were suggested by the alliance generated in verse  4, representing the web of associations in which Agni participates.
The six Agni verses end with Agni setting his head (mūrdhán) in heaven. As  noted above, the hymn in fact contains two occurrences of mūrdhán (vss. 3, 6),  and its Avestan cognate kamǝrǝδan (with pejorative ka-prefix), in the bahuvrīhi  Θri-kamǝrǝδa “having three heads,” qualifies the monster killed by Āϑβiia’s son.  The corresponding form in the Trita myth in this hymn has a different word for  head, -śíras- (acc. sg. m. tri-śīrṣā́ṇam, vs. 8). However, the R̥gveda does contain  an occurrence of tri-mūrdhán—but referring to Agni, in the phrase trimūrdhā́naṃ
saptáraśmim “having three heads and seven reins” (I.146.1). The three heads are  most likely the three ritual fires, the seven reins possibly the seven priests, but the  important thing is that this same phrase, “having three heads and seven reins,” is  found in our hymn X.8, describing the enemy Viśvarūpa (8c). This, we would submit,  is the initial point of contact between this Agni hymn and the Trita saga appended  to it: the old Indo-Iranian myth used the word *tri-mr̥Hdhan for the three-headed  beast. But the epithet can also be used positively as a descriptor of Agni with his  three representative fires on the ritual ground. The poet is playing with the delicious  positive/negative polarities of the epithet, and signals the connection between the  Agni portion of the hymn and the little Trita myth by using the word originally used  of the monster, mūrdhán, elsewhere in the hymn.
But there may be another connection. As we noted, Agni undergoes several  transformations in the last verses of his section of the hymn. And it is quite possible  that verse 7 is suggesting yet another transformation, into Trita or “the third (fire),”  being born in the fireplace, seeking poetic vision and ritual release. Agni sometimes  seems to be called Trita (see esp. X.46.3, 6), and the Trita/Viśvarūpa story may be  introduced here via a modulation through Agni identified with Trita.
1. With his lofty beacon Agni drives forth; the bull keeps bellowing to the  two world-halves.
He has reached up even to the farthest ends of heaven; the buffalo has  grown strong in the lap of the waters.
2. He rejoices as an embryo, as a hump-backed bull. No miscarriage, the  calf has bellowed vehemently.
Causing (the oblations) to be lifted up to the conclave of gods, he goes  first within his own dwelling places.
3. He who has seized the head of his two parents [=Heaven and Earth?  kindling sticks?], (him) they [=priests] have set down at the rite as the  sun’s undulating flood.
At his flight the ruddy females [=flames? dawns?] with the horse [=fire?]  as their foundation find pleasure in their own bodies within the womb  of truth. 4. Because you go at the forefront of every dawn, o good one, you have  become the far-radiant one at (the time of) the twins [=Night and
Dawn?].
For truth you have set your seven steps, begetting an alliance [/Mitra] for  the sake of your own body.
5. You become the eye and herdsman of great truth; you become Varuṇa  when you pursue (your tasks) for truth.
You become the Child of the Waters, o Jātavedas; you become the
messenger of him in whose oblation you will take pleasure.
6. You become the leader of the sacrifice and of airy space, where you are  accompanied your kindly teams of horses.
In heaven you have set your head, which wins the sun, and you have
made your tongue to be the conveyor of oblations, o Agni.
7. With his resolve, Trita [/the “third” fire], within a cave [/cover]—seeking a  visionary thought according to the ways of his distant forefather,
longing for companionship in the lap of his parents, speaking his own  familial weapons—pursues (his tasks).
8. That one, Āptya, knowing his ancestral weapons, urged on by Indra,  attacked.
Having smashed the three-headed, seven-reined (monster), Trita let loose  the cows, even those of Tvaṣṭar’s son.
9. Indra split (the heads) off the one trying to reach up to much power— the lord of settlements (split them off) the one who thought himself
(the same).
Having made the cows of Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭar, his own, he  twisted off his three heads.
## 9 (835) Waters
Triśiras Tvāṣṭra or Sindhudvīpa Āmbarīṣa
9 verses: gāyatrī, except triṣṭubh 8–9
The last four verses of this hymn (6–9) are identical with I.23.20–23 (save for the  absence of I.23.20d) and treat the healing and expiatory properties of the Waters,  who provide healing remedies (vss. 6–7) while also carrying away the detritus of  moral misbehavior (vs. 8). The paradox of “fire in the waters” (as embodied else
where in the figure of Apām Napat “Child of the Waters,” identified with Agni) is  also alluded to in verses 6 and 8. The healing and life-giving qualities of the Waters  are also found in the two preceding verses (4–5).
The first three verses of the hymn stand somewhat apart from the remainder of  the hymn and progress from the bland and generic to a rather surprising conclusion.  Verse 1 simply describes the Waters as refreshing and asks them for nourishment
1380 X.9
and happiness. In verse 2 the refreshment is specified as juice or sap (rása) and  implicitly compared to breast milk, since the Waters themselves are compared to  mothers. And then there is the very puzzling verse 3, which can only be understood  as an enlargement of that simile, for it is said that the Waters “animate and beget  us.” But even more puzzling than their apparent role in giving birth to “us” is their  purpose in so doing: so that we will go to be “fit” for the dwelling of an unidentified  third party. This third party is generally assumed, most likely correctly, to be the  patron of the sacrifice, and the poet/sacrificer calls upon the Waters to (re)vivify  him, send him to the house of the patron, and make him fit to render service to this  patron in the form of hymns and ritual labor—but the stark economy with which  this sentiment is expressed challenges the modern interpreter.
1. Since you Waters are sheer refreshment, so destine us for nourishment and to see great happiness.
2. Your most beneficent juice—make us have a share in that here,
like eager mothers (their milk).
3. Let us, as your (offspring), go to be fit for him for whose peaceful  dwelling you animate
and beget us, o Waters.
4. Let the goddesses, the Waters, be luck for us to prevail, for us to drink. Let them flow to us for luck and life.
5. Those who are mistresses of things of value, ruling over the settled  domains,
the Waters do I beseech for a healing remedy.
6. “Within the waters,” Soma said to me, “are all healing remedies
and Agni who is weal to all.”
7. O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my body
and (for me) to see the sun for a long time.
8. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me—
whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth. 9. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap. Full of milk, o Agni, come here. Merge me with luster.
The next ten hymns (X.10–19) form a Yama cycle, though the subject matter found  in the individual hymns is quite various. Yama, the son of Vivasvant, is king of the  land of the dead because he was the first mortal to die. Yet he was apparently born  immortal (see esp. I.83.5) and chose to become mortal, subject to death, “for the sake  of the gods...and for the sake of offspring” (X.13.4). The opening hymn in the cycle,  the dialogue of Yama and his twin sister Yamī, on the fraught topic of embarking on  incestuous sex in order to produce offspring, addresses Yama’s change of status and  his choice, but in a deliberately oblique and misleading fashion, as Yama spurns the  sexual advances of his sister, and at the end of their bitter argument there seems little  likelihood of children. The last six hymns in this cycle (X.14–19) are collectively known as funeral  hymns. The first, X.14, is devoted especially to Yama in his role as king of the realm  of the dead, while the others, especially 15–18, concern various aspects of death  and the treatment of the dead—for example, the forefathers who preceded us to  Yama’s realm in X.15, the cremation fire in X.16, the funeral itself in X.18. The  intermediate hymns, X.11–13, have less superficially clear connections to the Yama  saga, but both X.12 (vss. 6–7) and X.13 (vss. 4–5) make important comments on  Yama and on Yama’s choice.
There is also an underlying unifying theme, that of duality and twinned-ness: the  absolute disjunction between and the ultimate complementarity and unity of the  mortal and the immortal, life and death, men and gods, men and women, heaven  and earth, sacred and profane. It is appropriate that the cycle should begin with the  dialogue between the primal twins, Yama and Yamī, whose very names mean “twin”  and who bridge the gap between mortal and immortal.
## 10 (836) Dialogue of Yama and Yamı̄
Yama Vaivasvata and Yamī Vaivasvatī
14 verses: triṣṭubh
This justly famous (and much discussed) hymn presents a tense dialogue between  a pair of twins, the male Yama and female Yamī (yamá means “twin”; yamī́ is the  feminine form), who become the first mortals. Yamī́, who speaks first, urges her  twin brother to have sex with her, so that they can have children and continue their  line in the approved manner. Yama indignantly rejects her advances, outraged by  the idea of incest and certain that the divine guardians of moral order will see the  act and punish them.
It is impossible in a short introduction to do justice to the richness of this hymn  and the extraordinary skill with which the poet deploys grammatical categories  such as person, number, and verb modality in service of the condensed drama of  their encounter. Both Yamī and Yama make legalistic arguments, often using juridi
cal turns of phrase, and especially in the first part of the hymn they distance the  personal and emotional implications of their speech by regularly using plural and  3rd-person forms to refer to each other. It is not until the last word of verse 4 that  one of them uses a 1st-person dual (“we two”) form. They also use dueling divine  models for the relationships they are arguing for: Yama cites their near ancestors,  “the Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden,” as reason not to violate  the incest taboo (vs. 4) and Mitra and Varuṇa as stern enforcers (vs. 6) with spies  everywhere (vs. 8)—while Yamī claims that Tvaṣṭar, who shapes embryos in the  womb, made them a married couple already in the womb (vs. 5) and twice (vss. 5,  9) invokes as their divine counterparts Heaven and Earth, a notoriously incestuous  pair (as she makes quite explicit in 9c). The use and placement of kinship terms
1382 X.10
in the hymn is also notable, including the fact that “brother” and “sister” are not  encountered until verse 11. It is also striking that the names of the speakers do not  appear until verse 7.
The emotional temperature of the hymn rises significantly at that very point.  Yamī abandons her legalistic arguments—that they need to have offspring, that they  were already a married couple in the womb—in favor of a naked expression of sexual  desire. Yama remains unmoved, but the roiling emotions are reflected in the ragged  meter of some of the later verses (12–13), especially in the latter verse where Yamī breaks off her speech in frustration in a very short pāda containing two occurrences  of a word (batá) found nowhere else and exhibiting aberrant phonology. Our render
ing of the word aims at the level of slangy insult to which batá appears to belong. The hymn ends in an impasse. Yama remains obdurate and urges Yamī to find  another lover—a difficult quest when there are no other mortals! However, given  the rest of his history, sketched briefly above, we must assume that he gave in in the  end, on the evidence of X.13.4.
1. [Yamī:] I would turn my partner right here to partnership—even though  he has gone across many (realms), across the flood.
A (ritual) adept should provide a grandson for his father, envisioning his  furtherance on the earth.
2. [Yama:] Your partner doesn’t want that partnership, in that she [=sexual  partner] will have the same “marks” [=family characteristics] (though)  dissimilar form [=gender].
The sons of the great one, the heroes of the Lord, the upholders of
heaven, look around widely.
3. [Yamī:] The immortals do want this: a legacy of the one and only mortal. Your mind has (already) been set upon my mind, upon me. As husband,  you should enter the body of (your) wife.
4. [Yama:] What we have not done before, should (we do it) now? While  proclaiming truths, we would [/should we] murmur untruth?
The Gandharva in the waters and the watery maiden—that is our
umbilical tie; therefore our kinship is of the highest.
5. [Yamī:] (Even) in the womb the Begetter made us two a married couple,  god Tvaṣṭar, the impeller who provides all forms.
No one transgresses his commandments. Heaven and Earth take heed of  this about us.
6. [Yama:] Who knows about this first day? Who has seen it; who will  proclaim it here?
Lofty is the ordinance of Mitra and Varuṇa. Will you speak about
superior men [=gods] with deviant (speech), lubricious one?
7. [Yamī:] Desire for Yama has come to me, Yamī, to lie together in the  same womb [/place].
Like a wife to her husband I would yield my body. We would “let ’er rip”  like two chariot wheels. 8. [Yama:] They do not stand still; they do not blink—the spies of the  gods who roam about here.
With another than me, lubricious one, drive off straightaway; with him  “let ’er rip” like two chariot wheels.
9. [Yamī:] Night and day she would do service to him. She could for an  instant trip up the eye of the sun.
The couple has the same (kin-)ties as Heaven and Earth. Yamī could  bear the unbrotherly (act) of Yama.
10. [Yama:] Later generations will come, in which kin will perform the  unkindred (act).
Keep plumping up your arm as pillow for a (real) bull. Seek another  than me as husband, well-portioned one.
11. [Yamī:] What will “brother” (mean) when there will be no refuge. And  what will “sister,” if Dissolution will come down?
Driven by desire many times I murmur this: mingle your body with
my body.
12. [Yama:] Verily, I must not mingle my body with your body. They call  him evil who will go down on his sister.
With another than me arrange your pleasures. Your brother does not  want this, well-portioned one.
13. [Yamī:] You jerk, you really are a jerk, Yama! Truly we have not found  mind and heart in you.
Another (woman) will surely embrace you, like a girthband a yoked
(horse), like a vine a tree.
14. [Yama:] You (will embrace) another, Yamī, and another will embrace  you—like a vine a tree.
Seek his mind—or he yours. Then make yourself a very happy
compact.
## 11 (837) Agni
Havirdhāna Āṅgi
9 verses: jagatī 1–6, triṣṭubh 7–9
This hymn, which has some phraseological echoes of X.10 but lacks its mythologi cal content, falls into two metrical parts, which correspond to its thematic structure.  The last three verses (7–9), in triṣṭubh, are fairly straightforward, describing the  benefits that accrue to a mortal who serves the ritual fire and calling on Agni to  bring the divinities to the sacrifice and let it begin.
The first six verses, in jagatī, are far more complex, and, when viewed as a piece,  without the three triṣṭubh verses at the end, turn out to have an omphalos struc ture: the middle pair of verses (3–4) are parallel in structure, have the phrase agníṃ hótāram “Agni (as) Hotar” opening their final pādas, and together treat both the1384 X.11
initiation of the current sacrifice and the charter myths for the introduction of the  two ritual substances, fire and soma (with concomitant juggling of verb tenses). In  verse 3 the first sacrificer, Manu, is present at the kindling of the ritual fire; verse 4  sketches the famous tale of the falcon’s theft of soma from heaven.
The outer verse pairs, 1–2 and 5–6, treat these two substances and their deified  counterparts, fire/Agni and soma/Soma, both simultaneously and in parallel, with  the referent often left unclear. The final verse of this section (6) is especially busy,  with both Agni and Soma actively performing their ritual tasks at the same time  (and perhaps under the same descriptions; see esp. 6c). The tentative identifications  in that verse are made on the basis of the use of the phraseology in other parts of  the R̥gveda. For example, the exact phrase “he trembles with his thought” is used  of Soma in IV.71.3, and the verb translated as “he displays his power” (taviṣyá) in  that same pāda has Soma as its subject in its two other occurrences. However, it is  very likely that the poet expected the audience to consider both possibilities for the  referent in each case and to grasp thereby the underlying commonalities of the two  ritual substances. The first section of the hymn is thus a simpler example of the  conflation of Agni and Soma found in the fiendish hymn V.44.
1. The bull [=Soma] has milked out his draughts of milk for the bull  [=Indra] by the milking of heaven—he the youthfully exuberant,
undeceivable (son) of Aditi.
He [=Agni] knows everything, as Varuṇa does, through his insight. Let  him who is worthy of the sacrifice perform sacrifice throughout the
sacrificial sequences.
2. The Gandharvī is murmuring, and let (that) watery maiden protect my  mind all around at the bellowing of the bellowing (bull) [=Soma].
Let Aditi set us down in the middle of what we desire. Our eldest brother  [=Agni] will proclaim (it) first.
3. And even now Dawn, rich in cattle, rich in glory, accompanied by the  Sun, has dawned for Manu,
when they [=priests] beget Agni as Hotar for the ritual distribution—him  being eager for it and following the will of those who are (also) eager. 4. And this drop here [=Soma], widespread and widely visible, has the bird,  the falcon that was sent (for it), brought here to the rite,
when the Ārya clans choose wondrous Agni as their Hotar. And so was  his insight born.
5. You are always delightful, like pasture lands to a prosperous man,  (when,) o Agni, you conduct good rites with the libations of Manu,
or when, having ritually labored and having gained for the inspired poet  a prize worthy of hymns, you journey near with abundant (gifts).
6. Rouse his [=Agni’s] two parents [=kindling sticks], (as) a lover (rouses) his  “piece of luck” [=girl]. The gladdening one [=Soma] is seeking to attain (the  cows?) and sends (speech) from his heart. The draft-horse [=Agni and/or Soma?] is speaking; the bounteous one  [=Agni?] is performing his work well. The lord [=Soma?] displays his  power; he trembles (in poetic inspiration) with his thought.
7. Whatever mortal will attain your favor, o Agni, son of strength, he is  famed beyond (all).
Acquiring refreshment for himself, being conveyed by his horses,
brilliant and formidable, he attends upon (you) through the days.
8. When, o Agni, this assembly will become godly among the gods, a  sacrificial one, o sacrificial one,
and when you will share out treasures, o you of independent will, then  pursue a share for us rich in goods.
9. Hear us, Agni, in your seat, in your abode. Yoke the speeding chariot of  the immortal one.
Convey here to us the two world-halves, whose sons are the gods. Don’t  be the absent one among the gods; you should be here!
## 12 (838) Agni
Havirdhāna Āṅgi
9 verses: triṣṭubh
On first reading, this hymn appears to be full of non-sequiturs and false starts, but  further consideration allows some coherence to be wrung from it. It begins inno cently enough, with two verses devoted to the sacrifice initiated by Agni as Hotar,  with Heaven and Earth as witnesses—picking up the topic of the last verse of the  preceding hymn (X.11.9). In our view, the third verse continues that theme: an obla tion derived from a cow, probably ghee, is made into the fire; thus it is Agni’s “own  acquisition.” This sacrificial event in some sense generates the gods and their cos mic activity, which is framed as a yájus or sacrificial formula, and it also generates  the rain, the “heavenly ghee.” We may see here an early example of the famous  Upaniṣadic doctrine of the Five Fires and the water-cycle, whereby the oblations,  produced from the plants and animals on the earth, rise to heaven as smoke and  return to earth as water, to start the cycle anew. The sacrifice begun in verse 1 seems  to end with verse 4, where Heaven and Earth are again (as in vs. 1) called upon to  hear us. What has been added conceptually is the notion that Heaven and Earth  also participate in the cycle that the sacrifice controls, by producing rain (“honey”)  in the course of time.
The second half of the hymn (vss. 5–8; vs. 9 is repeated from the preceding hymn,  X.11.9) appears to be on another subject, or several other subjects, entirely. It begins  with the worried speaker speculating on what wrong we have done to Varuṇa, con trasting the unfathomable reactions of that god with the more forthright and reliable  Mitra. It ends (vs. 8cd) with the perhaps over-hopeful assertion that Mitra, along
1386 X.12
with Aditi and Savitar, will declare us blameless to Varuṇa. But the verses in between  (6–7) at first seem unconnected with this current drama. It is our contention, how ever, that these verses, especially verse 6 about Yama, provide the mythological sup
port for the poet’s hope that his relationship with Varuṇa can be repaired. Verse 6 needs to be read in the context of X.10, the famous dialogue between  Yama and his twin sister Yamī, but also of X.13.4, another cryptic verse about  Yama in this cycle of hymns. In X.10, as is well known, Yama and Yamī argue  about her desire to have sex with him in order to produce offspring. He strongly  resists, condemning (X.10.2) their possible pairing by characterizing it with the  phrase also quoted in 6b of this hymn: sálakṣmā yád víṣurūpā bhávāti, “that (the  female) will have the same ‘marks’ [=family characteristics] (though) dissimilar  form [=gender]” in our rendering. This phrase has received many different inter pretations; we believe that it defines the forbidden incestuous partner Yamī as  being of the same family but of a different shape—female rather than male—as  Yama. The dialogue of X.10 ends with the issue unresolved. It is X.13.4 that  seems to give us the answer. In that verse Yama “chose death” for the sake of the  gods and for the sake of offspring “did not choose immortality.” It seems that  Yama was born immortal (see esp. I.83.5) but chose to forego this state, in order  to produce children and also to institute the sacrifice to the gods. This act of  self-abnegation and the change of state it produced is, in our view, what is being  celebrated in verse 6 here. The poet first (pāda a) mentions Yama’s “immortal  (name),” which he does not want to think about—since it reminds him of the  taint of incest (pāda b), but his other name, by implication the “mortal” one, is  a happy one to think about and ensures Agni’s protection for the thinker. (Note  that the actual name Yama is only mentioned in the second instance.) In the next verse (7) we move to the seat of Vivasvant, a common kenning for the  ritual ground, but in this context it is important to remember that Yama is a descen dant of Vivasvant (see his patronymic in, e.g., nearby X.14.1 vaivasvatám...yamám).  The juxtaposition of Yama in verse 6 and Vivasvant in verse 7 reminds the audience  that Yama chose death in order to institute the sacrifice, and further reminds them  that when they perform sacrifice they are replicating the actions of Yama, which  transformed his bad reputation (“name difficult to contemplate”) into a good one.  Thus, though we still have no idea why the gods do what they do (see 7ab, 8ab), we  trust in the power of our sacrifice to make things right with these inscrutable gods.
1. Heaven and Earth, who speak what is real, become the first to hear in  accordance with truth,
when the god, setting mortals to sacrifice, takes his seat as Hotar facing  (them), as he comes to his own life.
2. As the god encompassing the gods in accordance with truth, first convey  our oblation, as the observant one,
possessing a beacon of smoke, foaming with radiance by kindling, you,  the gladdening constant Hotar, who sacrifice better with your speech. 3. It’s the god’s own acquisition: the immortal (drink) that comes from the  cow. “Those born therefrom uphold the two wide (worlds)”—
this sacrificial formula of yours do all the gods follow, when the speckled  (cow) gives as her milk the heavenly ghee, the water.
4. I sing your work [/waters], o ghee-backed pair, to strengthen (it/them).  Hear me, o Heaven and Earth, you two world-halves.
When the daytimes and the days will go (on the way) leading to the other  life, then let our parents [=Heaven and Earth?] hone us with honey.
5. Why has king (Varuṇa) grasped [/complained about] us? What
commandment of his have we transgressed? Who fully understands?
For Mitra, even when angry [/moving crookedly], is like a signal-call  (going) to the gods, also (like) the victory-prize of those driving (in
chariots).
6. Difficult to contemplate is the name of the immortal (male) in the case  “that (the female) will have the same ‘marks’ [=family characteristics]  (though) dissimilar form [=gender].”
Whoever will contemplate Yama’s (name that is) good to contemplate— protect him unremittingly, o lofty Agni.
7. At which ritual distribution the gods reach exhilaration and uphold (the  two worlds) at the seat of Vivasvant [=ritual ground]—
they placed the light in the sun and the nights in the moon: the two
[=sun and moon] move around the brightness [=Agni] without
wearying—
8. On which cryptic thought the gods converge—we do not know it.
May Mitra, Aditi, and god Savitar here declare us to Varuṇa to be
without offense.
9. Hear us, Agni, in your seat, in your abode. Yoke the speeding chariot of  the immortal one.
Convey here to us the two world-halves, whose sons are the gods. Don’t  be the absent one among the gods; you should be here!
## 13 (839) The Soma Carts
Havirdhāna Āṅgi or Vivasvant Āditya
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 5
According to the Anukramaṇī, this hymn is addressed to the two havirdhāna carts,  the carts on which the soma is brought to the place of sacrifice. Although the carts  are not explicitly mentioned in the hymn, this assignment is undoubtedly correct  and confirmed by the recitation of the first two verses in the later canonical rit
ual when the carts are pushed into place. The first four verses are also found in
1388 X.13
Atharvaveda (Śaunaka) XVIII.38–41 (in slightly different order) in a large collec tion of funeral verses, while verse 5 is paralleled by Atharvaveda VII.57.2. The  hymn presents a number of difficulties, and the conceptual relationship among the  verses is not always clear. Nonetheless, for various reasons (to be sketched below) it  seems likely that the R̥gvedic hymn forms a unity.
The first two verses are the clearest and have the clearest ritual content: the two  soma carts are hitched up, the signal for the sacrifice is given, and the carts are  brought to the sacrificial ground.
After these two verses of relative clarity, we are plunged into the numerological  obscurity of verse 3—not surprisingly the middle verse with the typical form of an  omphalos verse. (Oldenberg refers to its “vague mysticism” [vage Mystik] and sug gests resignation as a proper response for the interpreter [1913: 135 = 1967: 822].)  It does not help that the first, scene-setting pāda contains the impossible word rúp,  which arouses the same bewilderment in its other occurrence, IV.5.7. Nonetheless,  we can sketch some parameters for the interpretation of the verse, though our inter pretation is quite insecure in detail. First, it seems to continue the ritual scenario  of the first two verses, and the 1st-person speaker, with his four 1st-person verbs,  matches the speaker of the first pāda of the hymn. In the first pāda of this verse we  suggest (following an offhand suggestion of Oldenberg’s [1913: 136 = 1967: 823])  that the “five steps” (páñca padā́ni) of the rúp (here translated “mount”) are the  five verses of this very hymn. The “four-footed” (cátuṣpadī) entity in the next verse  must be feminine in gender, and various suggestions have been made for what noun  to supply. We believe that its reference is deliberately ambiguous: it may refer to the  four pādas of a verse (ŕ̥c fem.), thus continuing the (possible) theme of 3a. It has  also been suggested that the noun is vartaní “course, track” (also feminine), and the  speaker is literally following the track of the two soma carts, each with two wheels,  thus four wheel-ruts altogether. The only other R̥gvedic occurrence of the adjective  “four-footed” is in I.164.41, where it modifies the noun gaurī́ “buffalo cow” refer
ring to Speech, which is regularly said to consist of four parts. Thus in our view  this pāda refers both to ritual action (following the four wheel-ruts of the carts)  and ritual speech (the four-pāda verse), and ritual speech in particular calls to mind  Speech in general. In the next pāda (3c) the poet seems to make explicit the equiva
lence of his particular ritual speech and Speech in general by claiming to make a  single syllable the equivalent of Speech herself. This mystical treatment of the ritual  ends with a purification (3d).
Verse 4 veers off in a different direction and alludes obliquely to what we might  call the Felix Culpa (“fortunate fall”) of Yama, who, though born immortal (at least  according to I.83.5 and possibly X.17.1), chose death over immortality in order to  sacrifice to the gods (pāda a) and produce offspring (pādas b and d), whereas the  gods constituted their sacrifice through Br̥haspati and avoided death but also do not  reproduce. (So, roughly, Geldner.) This fleeting reference to Yama’s choice seems to  answer the question left hanging at the end of X.10—will Yama yield to Yamī’s  frenzied entreaties for sex or will he maintain his ascetic distance? On the basis of the offspring mentioned here, he seems to have yielded, though in the present verse  the role of Yamī has been elided and the agency rests with Yama—he “chose.” But why, one may well ask, is this bit of Yama’s history found in a hymn dedi cated to the soma carts? It is probably more productive to ask why a hymn to the  soma carts is found in this Yama cycle (X.10–19), positioned right before the funeral  hymns, especially X.14 dedicated to Yama. First, remember that the Atharvaveda  repetitions of the first four verses of this hymn are found in the collection of funeral  verses, so to the compilers of the Atharvaveda they must have seemed appropriate  to a funeral context. Note, moreover, that the carts themselves are called “twins”  (yamé) in verse 2, paired with verse 4 around the omphalos verse 3; “twins” of  course calls to mind the twin couple Yama and Yamī. The pairing of the two carts  also reminds us of the two divergent paths, one leading to the gods (devayā́na), one  to the ancestors or forefathers (pitr̥yā́na); the latter is the one that the dead follow  to the world where Yama presides. This journey is a particular preoccupation of  the funeral hymns, and the conflation of the twin (yamé) soma carts with the twin  paths, one of which leads to Yama, may explain how the soma carts ended up in  the Yama collection.
The final verse brings the hymn full circle, but with a series of tricks embedded  in it. On the surface the last half of the verse returns to the ritual situation and the  soma carts, which take their places (yatete) with the same phraseology as verse 2  (yátamāne). They rule over and thrive on “it” of both kinds, most likely a reference  to both pure and mixed soma (cf., e.g., VIII.101.10). But the lack of explicit refer
ents for any of the forms of “both,” combined with the first half of the verse, which  has nothing obvious to do with the carts, invites us to look further. The first half of  the verse seems to draw the same contrast as in verse 4 between gods and mortals.  While the referent in pāda a is fairly clearly Indra (the epithet “accompanied by the  Maruts” being a strong clue), we are inclined to see Yama as the referent in pāda b;  he who surrendered his immortality for the sake of offspring is identified as a father  in conjunction with sons, in fact the mortals whom he sired after he chose death.  We, the poets and sacrificers, are among these sons, and have learned our verbal  craft (“have made truth [our] familiar”) and produced this poem.
If we are correct in our identification of Yama as the father in 5b, there are  several further implications for the structure and contents of this hymn. On the  one hand, the father and sons of 5b both recall and contrast with “all the sons  of the immortal one” in 1c, for those were the gods. So we have another element  of a formal ring structure, but with a different referent. The contrastive pairs  Indra/Yama and gods/mortals may also underlie the insistent “both/both kinds”  of the second half of verse 5, where (despite the neuter [or feminine] gender of the  repeated subject ubhé “both”) Indra and Yama may be credited with joint ruler ship (note that Yama is called “king” in the first verse of the next hymn, X.14.1d)  and prosperity.
To sum up and indeed to go further, this hymn, and the hymn cycle within  which it is embedded, are a reflection of and a reflection on the dualities that define
1390 X.14
human existence: mortal and immortal, male and female, heaven and earth, sacred  and profane, as we pointed out in the introduction to the Yama cycle as a whole.  These dualities are neatly conceptually symbolized in the notion of twins, the pri mal twins Yama and Yamī, and in this hymn also ritually symbolized by the twin  soma carts, appropriate both to the sacrifice and to the divergent paths that lead  to the gods and the ancestors respectively, thus providing a proper preface to the  funeral hymns that follow.
1. I yoke for you two with reverence the age-old sacred formulation. Let the  signal-call of the patron go forth afar like a pathway.
Let all the sons of the immortal one [=gods] listen (to it)—those who  inhabit the heavenly domains.
2. When, taking your own places like twins, you came here, the god-seeking  descendants of Manu brought you forward.
Sit here upon your own wide space, as you know it. Become good seats  for our drop.
3. I have mounted along the five steps of the mount, and I go along
following the four-footed (track/verse/speech) according to
commandment.
With (just) a syllable I make a counterpart to it [=Speech?]. Upon the  navel of truth I purify (it) completely.
4. For the sake of the gods he chose death and for the sake of offspring he  did not choose immortality.
They [=gods] made Br̥haspati, the seer, into their sacrifice. Yama left  behind his own dear body (as offspring).
5. The seven (rivers?) flow for the child accompanied by the Maruts
[=Indra]. For their father [=Yama?] have the sons made truth their
familiar.
Both (carts) rule over it [=soma?] of both kinds. Both take their places,  and thrive on the one of both kinds.

Yama Vaivasvata
16 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 13–14, 16 and brhat ̥ ī 15
This is the first of the funeral hymns, and it is dedicated for the most part to Yama,  the first to die and the king of the world of the dead, where the forefathers dwell  and to which a newly dead person makes his way along the pitr̥yā́na or “way of the  forefathers.” Because he was the first to die, Yama discovered this path and blazed  the trail, as it were, to the pleasant, well-watered (vs. 9) pasture-land (vs. 2).
The hymn falls into three parts. Verses 1–6 offer praise to Yama as the pathfinder  to the ancestral world (vss. 1–2) and then invite him to attend our sacrifice along with others, both gods and ancestors—suggesting implicitly that the pitr̥yā́na is  a two-way street. It is also noteworthy that, though the gods and the forefathers  respond to slightly different variants of the ritual cry (vs. 3: svā́hā for the gods  versus svadhā́ for the forefathers), the mechanisms for the sacrifice to gods and fore
fathers are presented as more or less identical in this section and in verses 13–16,  and in particular Yama is offered soma. See also the next hymn, X.15. Verses 7–12 concern not this age-old death but a recent one. A newly dead man  is addressed and urged to follow the same path, to join Yama and the ancestors in  highest heaven and even to reunite with the body from which he has been temporar ily separated (vss. 7–8). Potential troublemakers along the way are dismissed (vs. 9),  and the dead man is escorted by the two formidable guardian dogs of Yama (vss.  10–12).
The last four verses (13–16) are in dimeter meter (save for 15c), instead of the  triṣṭubh of the rest of the hymn. The first three are simple exhortations to perform  sacrifice to Yama; the final verse (16) is by contrast quite opaque, with some of  the typical marks of obscurity: unidentified referents (pādas a and b), numerology  (pāda b), and manipulation of names of meters (pāda c). In particular, pāda b pres
ents us with six broad feminine entities and one lofty neuter one. (The contrasting  grammatical genders so obvious in the Sanskrit are not easily rendered in transla tion.) The six broad feminines are generally considered to be worlds or realms (on  the basis of VI.47.3, which, however, doesn’t have an overt referent either), and the  lofty neuter some other superior type of space. Given the extreme uncertainty of  the referents, the syntax (should pāda b be construed with pāda a, or with cd, or,  as we have done, connected neither to what precedes nor what follows?), and the  reason for the presence of this verse as the finale of this hymn, we have chosen to  leave the meaning open.
1. To the one who has departed along the great slopes, having spied out the  path for many,
son of Vivasvant, unifier of the peoples—to Yama the king show favor  with oblation.
2. Yama first found the way for us: this pasture-land is not to be taken away. (The way) on which our ancient forefathers departed, along that (do)  those who have since been born (follow) along their own paths.
3. Mātalī having been strengthened along with the poets, Yama with the  Aṅgirases, Br̥haspati with the versifiers,
both those whom the gods strengthen and who strengthen the gods— the ones [=gods] become exhilarated on (the cry) “svāhā,” the others  [=forefathers] on “svadhā.”
4. This strewn grass here, Yama—just sit here on it, in concord with the  Aṅgirases, our forefathers.
Let mantras pronounced by poets convey you hither. Become exhilarated  on this oblation, o king.
1392 X.14
5. With the Aṅgirases, deserving of the sacrifice, come hither; Yama,  become exhilarated here along with the Vairūpas—
I call upon Vivasvant, who is your father—once having sat down at this  sacrifice, on this ritual grass here.
6. The Aṅgirases, our forefathers, the Navagvas, the Atharvaṇas, the  Bhr̥gus deserving of soma—
may we be in the favor of these who are deserving of the sacrifice; may  we be also in their propitious benevolence.
7. Go forth, go forth along the ancient paths on which our ancient  forefathers departed.
You will see both kings becoming exhilarated on the svadhā(-cry),  Yama and Varuṇa the god.
8. Unite with the forefathers, unite with Yama, with what has been  sacrificed and bestowed, in the highest distant heaven.
Having left behind imperfection, come home again. Unite with your  body in your full luster.
9. (You all)—go away, go apart, and slink away from here. It is for him  that the forefathers made this world.
A resting place anointed with waters through the days and nights Yama  gives to him.
10. Outrun the two dogs of Saramā’s breed, four-eyed and brindled, along  the path that leads straight to the goal.
Then approach the forefathers who are good to find, who reach  exhilaration in joint revelry with Yama.
11. Your two dogs, Yama, who are guardians, four-eyed guards of the path  with their eyes on men—
to them deliver him, o king. Provide for him well-being and freedom  from disease.
12. The two broad-nosed, reddish-brown messengers of Yama, stealers of  lives, pursue the peoples.
Let these two here today grant a fortunate life again to us, to see  the sun.
13. For Yama press the soma; for Yama pour the oblation.
To Yama goes the sacrifice, properly prepared, with Agni as messenger. 14. For Yama pour the ghee-rich oblation and set it forth.
He will guide us to the gods, for us to live for a long lifetime.
15. For Yama the king pour the most honeyed oblation.
Here is homage to the seers born of old, to the age-old makers of  the path.
16. He flies with the Trikadrukas. Six are broad, but just one is lofty. The triṣṭubh, the gāyatrī, the meters—all these are established in Yama. X.15 (841) Pitars
Śaṅkha Yāmāyana
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 11
This hymn is simply an expansion on the invitation in the last hymn (X.14.4–6) to  the forefathers to come to our sacrifice. They are repeatedly urged to sit on the ritual  grass, to partake of the offerings, including soma, and to provide us with material  and spiritual benefits in return. The language is quite straightforward, with very  few verbal tricks. Only in verse 3 do we encounter a turn of phrase that invites  our inquiry: in the first half of the verse “I” find not only the forefathers on the  ritual ground but also “the grandson/child” (nápāt) and the “stride of Viṣṇu.” The  “grandson” may be a reference to Agni, often called “child of strength” (ū́rjo nápāt)  and also frequently identified with the “Child of the Waters” (Apām Napāt), but  it may also and simultaneously refer to the various descendants of the returning  forefathers, descendants who would be present at the ritual and serving at it. As for  Viṣṇu’s wide stride, most commentators take this as the highest heaven, that is, the  last of Viṣṇu’s three strides. But it is hard to understand how this would be found  “here”; we think rather that it refers to Viṣṇu’s first stride, which measures out the  earth, and in this case that it is a specific reference to the delineated sacrificial space.
Toward the end of the hymn, the god Agni becomes prominent (vss. 9–14) and  his special relationship with the forefathers—as their cremation fire—is alluded to  (esp. vss. 11, 14).
1. Let the nearer ones rise up, up the further, up those in the middle—the  forefathers deserving of soma.
Those who have gone to (their next) life avoiding the wolf, knowing the  truth, let those forefathers help us at the invocations.
2. Let this homage here today be for the forefathers—those who went  previously, those who went later,
those who are seated here in the earthly realm, or who are now among  the clans of good community.
3. I have found here the forefathers good to find and the grandson and the  wide stride of Viṣṇu.
Those who, sitting on the ritual grass, share in the pressed soma and the  food at (the cry of) “svadhā,” they are the most welcome arrivals here. 4. You forefathers who sit on the ritual grass inclined this way with your  aid, we have made these oblations for you. Enjoy!
Come here with your most luck-bringing help. Then provide for us luck  and lifetime without flaw.
5. The forefathers deserving of soma have been summoned here to the dear  stores on the ritual grass.
Let them come hither, let them listen (to us) here; let them speak on
(our) behalf, let them help us.1394 X.16
6. Having bent your knee, having sat down to the south, greet this sacrifice  here—all of you.
Do not harm us, o forefathers, because of any offense that we may do  to you in our human way.
7. Sitting in the lap of the ruddy (Dawns?), provide wealth for the pious  mortal.
To your sons, o forefathers, hold out (a portion) of this good thing.
Provide nourishment here.
8. Those ancient forefathers of ours deserving of soma, the Vasiṣṭhas, who  journeyed along to the soma-drinking,
in joint enjoyment with them let Yama—he eager with them eager—eat  the oblations according to their desire.
9. Those who have thirsted, panting, among the gods, those knowing the  priestly functions, those fashioned by praise along with chants—
with them, o Agni, drive here, turned this way—with the forefathers who  are good to find and truly here, the poets who sit by the gharma drink.
10. Those who are truly here—eating oblations, drinking oblations, taking  their place on the same chariot with Indra, with the gods—
with them, o Agni, drive here—with the thousand god-extolling,
further, earlier forefathers, who sit by the gharma-drink.
11. Sweetened by Agni, o forefathers, come here. Sit each on his own seat,  you of good guidance.
Eat the oblations set forth on the ritual grass. Then provide wealth in  hale heroes.
12. You, Agni Jātavedas, reverently invoked, have conveyed the oblations,  having made them very fragrant.
You have presented them to the forefathers; they have eaten them at
(the cry of) “svadhā.” (Now) you, o god—eat the oblations set forth.
13. Both the forefathers who are here and those who are not here, both  those whom we know and those whom we do not know,
you know how many they are, o Jātavedas. Through your own powers  [/at svadhā-calls], enjoy the well-performed sacrifice.
14. Those burned by fire and those not burned by fire who become
exhilarated at (the cry of) “svadhā” in the middle of heaven,
along with them (go) as sovereign king (on the way) leading to (the
other) life. Arrange your body as you wish.
## 16 (842) Agni
Damana Yāmāyana
24 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 11–14
The focus on the cremation fire in the last part of the preceding hymn (X.15) is  enlarged upon here. This fire is seen both as a blessed release of the dead man to the realm of the ancestors and as a menace to the vulnerable dead body. This  ambivalence is clearly on display in the first verse, where the fire is begged not  to burn up the body, but, on the other hand, to make the dead man “cooked”  and ready to go to the forefathers. The same sentiment is repeated in verse 2,  and the journey undertaken. The dead body itself is addressed in verse 3, with  its parts consigned to the corresponding cosmic entities. Two more verses to  Agni follow (4–5), continuing the themes of verses 1–2. In verses 6–7 the body  is addressed again: in verse 6 it is reassured that the physical indignities it has  undergone since death will be fixed by the cremation fire and by soma, but in  verse 7 it is urged to protect itself against the same fire. The cremation seems to  end with verse 8.
With the cremation concluded, the next verses (9–12) treat the inauspicious but  powerful cremation fire and the means to render it harmless and to reintegrate it  into the generally auspicious sphere of fire. The “flesh-eating fire” is first explicitly  distinguished from “the other” fire, the ritual fire that receives the oblations to the  gods, and the flesh-eating fire is assigned the task of taking the sacrifice to the  ancestors and bringing them to the sacrifice here. Since this task is parallel to that  of the other fire, the gods’ ritual mediator, the negative aspects of the flesh-eating  fire can be set aside, and it can be conceptually reconfigured as a positive force, a  transformation completed in verse 12.
In the final two verses (13–14) the place where the cremation took place returns  to nature, with the fire extinguished and plants growing again. The import of the  final apostrophe to a cool and chilly feminine entity is clear, even though the refer ent (a water plant?) is not.
1. Don’t burn him through, Agni; don’t scorch him; don’t singe his skin,  nor his body.
When you will make him cooked to readiness, Jātavedas, then impel him  forth to the forefathers.
2. When you will have made him cooked to readiness, Jātavedas, then  deliver him to the forefathers.
When he will embark on the (way) leading to (the other) life, then he will  lead at the will of the gods.
3. Let your eye go to the sun, your life-breath to the wind. Go to heaven  and to earth as is fitting.
Or go to the waters, if it has been fixed for you there. Take your stand in  the plants with your limbs.
4. The goat is your portion. With your heat, heat it up. Let your flame heat  it up, let your beam.
The propitious bodies that are yours, o Jātavedas, with those convey him  to the world of good (ritual) performers.
5. Release him again to the forefathers, o Agni—the one who, offered to  you, proceeds by his own powers.
Clothing himself in life, let him go in pursuit of his remains: let him  unite with his body, o Jātavedas.
1396 X.17
6. What of yours the black omen-bird pecked at, or the ant, the serpent,  or the dog-footed (beast),
let omnivorous Agni make it free from curse, and Soma, who has
entered the brahmins.
7. Make for yourself an enveloping armor against fire with (the flesh of)  cows. Cover yourself entirely with grease and fat,
lest the bold one, bristling with his flame, fasten himself around you,  intending to utterly burn you up.
8. This beaker here, o Agni—don’t overturn it. It is dear to the gods and  to those deserving of soma [=forefathers]—
the beaker that is the drinking vessel of the gods—in it the immortal  gods find their exhilaration.
9. Flesh-eating Agni I send off in the distance. Carrying away defilements,  let him go to those who have Yama as king.
Here let only this one, the other Jātavedas, carry the oblations to the  gods, knowing what’s ahead.
10. The flesh-eating Agni who entered your house, though he saw this one  here, the other Jātavedas—
that god I take for the sacrifice to the forefathers. He will send the
gharma (drink) to the highest seat.
11. The flesh-conveying Agni who will sacrifice to the forefathers, who are  strong through truth,
he will proclaim the oblations to the gods and the forefathers.
12. Eagerly we would install you; eagerly we would kindle you.
Eagerly convey the eager forefathers here, to eat the oblation.
13. The one whom you have entirely burnt, Agni, that one extinguish  in turn.
Let the kiyāmbu plant grow here and the pākadūrvā and the vyalkaśā. 14. O cool lady full of cooling, chilly lady full of chill,
join together with the lady frog—stimulate this fire here.

Devaśravas Yāmāyana
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh or purastādbrhat ̥ ī 13, anuṣṭubh 14
This hymn consists of a disparate collection of segments, which do not seem to  form a coherent whole and which do not always have an obvious connection to the  death/funeral context of this cycle of hymns.
The first two enigmatic verses may well be the most discussed of all R̥gvedic  mythological sketches, although this wide-ranging and ongoing discussion has not  brought as much clarity as could be desired. The verses provide us with a skeletal three-generation mythological family tree, with a father, the god Tvaṣṭar, and his  daughter, who is identified as both mother of Yama and wife of Vivasvant. All this  is fairly clearly set out in the first verse: it opens with a Svayaṃvara (“self-choice  marriage”) invitation issued by the father for his daughter, to which the whole  world responds (1ab), and the second half (1cd) appears to summarize the results  of that marriage—the husband chosen apparently being Vivasvant, and the child  issuing from the marriage apparently being Yama. (It should be noted, though,  that the identity of Tvaṣṭar’s daughter [1a] with the mother of Yama [1c] and wife  of Vivasvant [1d] is only implicit from context, not expressly stated, and her name  is not given in vs. 1.) The only disquieting part of this verse comes with the last  word: “she disappeared” (nanāśa). This word sets the stage for its companion verse.
The second verse considerably muddies the clean lines of our initial family tree.  It turns out that the vanished woman of verse 1 was actually hidden away (2a) by  an unnamed set of individuals—perhaps the gods, who create and pass off on (the  unsuspecting?) Vivasvant a simulacrum of his wife (2b). In the second half of the  verse the neat maternal line of 1c is likewise made obscure: someone (the origi
nal woman? the simulacrum?) bears the Aśvins (2c), and she (or the other female)  leaves behind (abandons? leaves as a legacy?) two unnamed paired ones (2d). Yama,  the son in 1c, is not mentioned by name, but he may lurk as part of the two in 2d  (Yama and Yamī? Yama and Manu?), who could on the other hand be the afore
mentioned Aśvins. Each of these possibilities has had its scholarly champions (and  it has in fact also been argued that 2d refers to two pairs, that is four in all). The last  word of verse 2 is the feminine name Saraṇyū (lit., “hastening”), seeming to identify  our protagonist, but the name provides little help, and could, in principle, belong to  either the original or the duplicate woman.
All in all, the two verses seem deliberately and cleverly designed to mislead and  confuse, and in that they have admirably succeeded, beginning with the retellings of  the story in the later Vedic tradition and continuing to this day. The myth has also  often been invoked in a comparative Indo-European context. (For a recent discus
sion of the history of scholarship and for his own Indo-European interpretation,  see Jackson 2006: Part II: esp. 72–93.) This is not the place to produce a full treat ment of the myth behind the verses or its various interpretations; suffice it to say  that we are inclined to see the paired two in 2d as Yama and Yamī, in part because  a connection with Yama’s history is the only way to make sense of the inclusion of  these verses here.
The relevance of the next set of verses (4–6), to Pūṣan, is considerably clearer.  Pūṣan as the good guide and finder of lost livestock makes an excellent psycho pomp, leading the dead along the dangerous path to the next world.
The goddess, and river, Sarasvatī is addressed in the next three verses (7–9), with  a final verse (10) to the Waters in general. Sarasvatī here seems especially connected  with the dead forefathers and the offerings to them at the ritual (esp. vss. 8–9); this  may be an early foreshadowing of the later ritual offering of water to the dead, or,  as verse 10 suggests, connected with the general purificatory power of waters (see  X.9.6–9 earlier in this maṇḍala).
1398 X.17
Verses 10–13 concern the “drop” (drapsá) and are addressed in the 2nd person to  Soma, who is never named but clearly identifiable from his characteristic vocabu lary. There is no mention of the forefathers or of anything related to a funeral, and  there is no obvious reason why these verses should have been attached to this hymn.  Indeed, the final purificatory verse (14) would follow better directly on verse 10.
1. “Tvaṣṭar is arranging a wedding for his daughter”: (on hearing) thus, all  this world comes together.
The mother of Yama, the wife of great Vivasvant, while being conveyed  around (on her wedding journey), went missing.
2. They hid her away, the immortal, from the mortals. Having made a  female of the same appearance, they gave her to Vivasvant.
And she was carrying the Aśvins (in the womb), as it happened, and she  left behind the two, the paired ones [=Yama and Yamī?]—Saraṇyū.
3. Let Pūṣan stir you forth from here—the wise one, whose livestock doesn’t  get lost, the herdsman of the world.
He will deliver you to these forefathers; Agni (will deliver you) to the  gods who are good to find.
4. Āyu (“Lifetime”) having a complete lifetime will protect you all around.  Let Pūṣan protect you from in front on the path forward.
Where those of good action sit, where they have gone, there let god
Savitar place you.
5. Pūṣan knows all these regions through and through: he will lead us along  the least perilous (way).
Granting well-being, the glowing one, possessing hale heroes—not
keeping distant, let him go in front, foreknowing.
6. On the forward path of paths was Pūṣan born, on the forward path of  heaven, on the forward path of earth.
He wanders back and forth to both the dearest seats, foreknowing.
7. Sarasvatī do those seeking the gods invoke, Sarasvatī when the ceremony  is being extended.
Sarasvatī did those of good action invoke. Sarasvatī will give a thing of  value to the pious.
8. O Sarasvatī, you who drove on the same chariot with the forefathers,  becoming exhilarated at the svadhā(-calls), o goddess—
having taken your seat here on this ritual grass, bring yourself to
exhilaration. Provide us refreshments that bring no disease.
9. Sarasvatī, whom the forefathers invoke, as they arrive at the sacrifice in  the south—
provide here a portion of refreshment worth thousands and thriving of  wealth among the sacrificers. 10. Let the waters, the mothers cleanse us; let them, ghee-pure, purify us  with their ghee,
for the goddesses carry forth every defilement. I rise up from them
gleaming, purified.
11. The drop spurted through the first days, both through this womb here  and the former one.
I offer the drop circling around through the same womb, according to  the seven priestly functions.
12. Your drop that spurts and your plant that is set in motion by the arms,  from the lap of the Holy Place,
or from the Adhvaryu or from the filter, that one of yours I offer with  my mind when the vaṣaṭ-cry is made.
13. Your drop that has spurted, your plant, and what is below and what  beyond the ladle—
let this god Br̥haspati pour it all together for benefit.
14. Full of milk are the plants, full of milk my little speech.
Full of milk indeed is the milk of the waters. With it cleanse me
altogether.
## 18 (844) Death, etc.
Saṃkusuka Yāmāyana
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except 11 prastārapaṅkti, 13 jagatī, 14 anuṣṭubh
This lovely hymn falls into several sections, each treating the end of the funeral  service. The first six verses depict the mourners leaving the service and returning to  their lives. Death is dismissed in verse 1, and in verses 2–3 the living turn back to an  enhanced life, full of “dancing and laughter” (vs. 3). They are separated from death  by a barrier (vs. 4); in the later ritual a stone is set down near the grave. Verses 5–6  are especially concerned with the orderly sequence of life and death, in particular  the fear that the younger will die before their elders and disrupt the proper sequence  (see esp. 5cd).
The next three verses (7–9) have been much discussed, especially in the context  of “suttee” (satī) or widow-burning, though the verses are emphatically not a depic tion thereof. From verse 8 it appears that the widow lies down, temporarily, beside  her dead husband, but is summoned back to life and indeed symbolically reborn  to become the wife of a new husband (quite possibly her brother-in-law, in levirate  marriage). The happy women in verse 7 apparently approach the funeral pyre to  adorn the widow for her return to life. A similar “return to life” is granted the dead  man’s bow in verse 9, where someone, quite possibly the dead man’s son, repossesses  the bow to put it to future use.
1400 X.18
The burial is the subject of verses 10–13, with an emphasis on the softness and  gentleness of the welcoming earth, both mother and bride, which lies lightly on  the dead man. Verse 13 forms a sort of ring with verse 1, with both expressing a  prohibition against harm with the same construction and the same root √riṣ (1d  mā́...rīriṣaḥ, 13b mā́...riṣam). This ring defines the final verse (14) as outside the  hymn proper, and other indications support this extra-hymnic status. It is in dimeter  meter, instead of the trimeter that prevails elsewhere, and the Aśvalāyana Gr̥hya  Sūtra, which treats the ritual usage of all the other verses, ignores it, as does the  medieval commentator Sāyaṇa. The sense of this verse is also much disputed. Many  scholars think that the poet is predicting his own future death, on a day that is  approaching him, in the first hemistich, and in the second he restrains his speech in  anticipation. (As Geldner says, rather more dramatically than usual, “der Rest ist  Schweigen” [the rest is silence].) In contrast, we consider this to belong to the typi cal genre of hymn-final meta-poetic verses, in which the poet comments on his own  skill in producing the poem that precedes. By this interpretation, the first half-verse  concerns the well-conducted funeral that has just taken place, while the second  refers specifically to the poet’s taming and controlling the speech that accompanied  that ritual.
1. Depart, Death, along the further path, which is your own, different from  the one leading to the gods.
To you who possess eyes and who listen do I speak: do not harm our  offspring nor our heroes.
2. Effacing the footprint of death when you have gone, establishing for  yourselves a longer, more extended lifetime,
swelling up with offspring and wealth, become cleansed and purified, o  you who are worthy of the sacrifice.
3. These the living have turned aside from the dead. The invocation of the  gods has become favorable for us today.
We have gone facing forward to dancing, to laughter, establishing for  ourselves a longer, more extended lifetime.
4. I set down this barrier here for the living. Let no one of these later go to  this goal.
Let them live for a hundred ample autumns. Let them conceal death with  a mountain.
5. Just as the days follow each upon the last, just as the seasons follow  straightaway upon the seasons,
so, o Ordainer, arrange their lifetimes, so that the later does not leave  behind the earlier.
6. Mount your lifetime, choosing old age, taking your place each following  the last, as many as you are.
Here will Tvaṣṭar, affording good birth, in concert (with the Wives of the  Gods), make a long lifetime for you to live. 7. These women here, non-widows with good husbands—let them, with  fresh butter as ointment, approach together.
Without tears, without afflictions, well-jeweled, let the wives first mount  the womb.
8. “Arise, woman, to the world of the living. You lie beside him whose life  is gone. Come here!
You have come into existence now as wife of a husband who has
grasped your hand and wishes to have you.”
9. Taking the bow from the hand of the dead for our dominion, luster,  and strength,
you there and we here—may we with good heroes win all contests and  hostile engagements.
10. Creep upon this mother earth, the broad earth of wide expanse, who is  very kindly.
The young girl, soft as wool for the one who gives priestly gifts—let her  protect you from the lap of Dissolution.
11. Arch up, Earth; do not press down. Become easy to approach for him,  easy to curl up in.
Like a mother her son with her hem, cover him, Earth.
12. Let the earth stay arching up. For let a thousand (house)posts be fixed  in (her).
Let the house be dripping with ghee. Let it always be sheltering to
him there.
13. I prop up the earth from you. Setting down this earth clod here, let me  not be harmed.
Let the forefathers uphold this pillar for you. There let Yama fix your seats.
14. On the day facing me [=today] they have set (him=dead man) down  like a feather from an arrow.
The speech facing me I have grasped, like a horse by its halter.
## 19 (845) Cows
Mathita Yāmāyana or Bhrgu V ̥ āruṇi or Cyavana Bhārgava
8 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 6
This simple, repetitive, but charming call to the cows to come home is the final  hymn of the Yama collection, though its connection to the other hymns in the cycle,  especially the funeral hymns that immediately precede it, is unclear. The signature  idiom in this hymn is “turn back,” and perhaps it was attached to the Yama cycle on  thematic grounds, because the first verses of the preceding hymn, X.18, concern the  return to life of the living after the funeral of their dead kinsman (see esp. X.18.3).
1402 X.20
1. Turn back. Don’t keep going. Keep company with us, o rich ones.
O Agni and Soma, who bring goods back, hold our wealth fast for us. 2. Turn them back again; bring them back here again.
Let Indra hold them back; let Agni drive them near.
3. Let these turn back again. Let them prosper in (the care of) this man, the  lord of the cattle.
Right here, o Agni, fix them down fast. Here let it remain—our wealth. 4. Also the one who is the cowherd—I call him to the journeying back, the  coming back, the bringing to agreement, and the going away,
to the turning here and the turning back.
5. He who has managed the dispersal, who has managed the going away, the turning here, and the turning back—let the cowherd also turn back. 6. You turner back, turn them back here; give the cows to us again, o Indra. Let us find enjoyment with them alive.
7. On every side I surround you with nourishment, ghee, and milk.
Whatever gods there are who are worthy of the sacrifice, let them join us  with wealth.
8. You turner back, turn them here; you turner back, turn them back. The earth has four quarters: from these, turn them back.
The Anukramaṇī gives a choice of authorship for the next seven hymns, X.20– 26: Vimada, the son of Indra or Prajāpati, or Vasukr̥t Vāsukra. The patronymic of  the latter choice would identify the poet as a son or descendant of Vasukra Aindra,  the author of the three desperately difficult hymns that immediately follow (27–29).  The poet of X.25.11 also identifies with or identifies himself as Kakṣīvant, the very  skilled poet of I.116–126.
Whatever the poet’s affiliation, he is fond of unusual meters (see esp. 21, 22, 24,  25) as well as puns on the name Vimada. The hymns are dedicated to Agni (20–21),  Indra (22–1st half of 24), the Aśvins (2nd half of 24), Soma (25), and Pūṣan (26).
## 20 (846) Agni
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
10 verses: gāyatrī, except ekapadāvirāj 1, anuṣṭubh 2, virāj 9, triṣṭubh 10
This first of the Vimada hymns starts with a single-pāda verse adapted from the first  verse of X.25 and placed here to provide an auspicious beginning for the series. The  second verse has a similarly marked beginning: its first two words are identical to the  first words of the R̥gveda, I.1.1 agním īḷe “I invoke Agni....” The hymn mostly treats  the familiar topic of the physical presence of the ritual fire, though with some strik
ing imagery and turns of phrase. The fire’s expansion upward, even to heaven, is the subject of the middle verses (4–6), with his expansion opening the way also for mor tals and for gods. In the final summary verse (10) the poet Vimada names himself.
1. Make auspicious thought our familiar.
2. Agni do I invoke, the youngest, for delights, an ally [/Mitra] difficult to  restrain by reason of his (own) command,
upon whose foundation the mottled (cows) [=flames] honor the sun (as  well as) the udder of their mother [=fireplace].
3. With his (own) body as his nest, his radiant beam his beacon, him  whom they make increase with their mouth,
he flashes—his teeth [=flames] in a row.
4. The way for the stranger and the clans goes onward, since he [=Agni]  has reached the ends of heaven—
as the bright-shining poet, (but also as) a cloud.
5. He takes pleasure in the oblations of the son of Manu. The craftsman  stands erect at the sacrifice.
Fixing his seat, he goes in front.
6. For he is peaceful dwelling, oblation, and sacrifice. By harkening only to  him, their way goes onward:
the gods (go) to Agni, who is equipped with axes [=flames].
7. I seek Agni, who dominates through sacrifice, and the friendship of  (that) kindly ancient.
They say that Āyu [=Agni] is the son of the stone.
8. Whichever superior men are from among us, they should all be “in  the money”
when they make Agni increase with their oblation.
9. Black, white, and red is his course; coppery, silver, and ruddy is glorious  (Agni).
The begetter has begotten him of golden form.
10. In just this way, o Agni, child of nourishment, Vimada, in company  with the immortals, will convey to you his inspired thought
and his songs, as he implores your good favors. Refreshment,
nourishment, a good dwelling—all that have you brought.
## 21 (848) Agni
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
8 verses: āstārapaṅkti
This hymn is notable for two related formal features, its meter and its refrain. The  meter āstārapaṅkti (8 8 / 8 4 8 4) is limited to this group of hymns attributed to  Vimada, providing the meter for the two hymns X.21 and X.25 and the first half  (vss. 1–3) of X.24. (The Anukramaṇī identifies the meter of the single verse X.170.41404 X.21
as āstārapaṅkti, but the characteristic 8 4 8 4 sequence must be read as 12 12 there.)  In all the Vimada occurrences the two four-syllable pādas form a grammatically  unified refrain (the same refrain in all three hymns), interrupted by an eight-syllable  pāda semantically and syntactically integrated into the rest of the verse: ví vo máde
x x x x x x x x vívakṣase “In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).” The  first four-syllable pāda of the refrain is also a pun on the poet’s name: ví vo máde,  literally “in exhilaration you...,” but also “Vi...mada” (itself interrupted by the  enclitic pronoun vaḥ). Although the effect is striking and insistent, it is also impos
sible to render in translation, and so the refrain has been unified and placed at the  end of the verse. To illustrate the difficulties of a literal translation, we will give a  rendering of the first verse in this hymn in that style:
As if with (hymns) with their own twists, we choose you, Agni, as Hotar for our sacrifice whose ritual grass has been strewn—in exhilaration you  (gods)—
(we choose you,) sharp and pure-flamed—I wish to acclaim.
The formal novelty of the hymn is not matched by its content, which is simply a  typical celebration of Agni’s installation as Hotar at his kindling, along with wishes  for his gifts of wealth.
1. As if with (hymns) with their own twists, we choose you, Agni,
as Hotar
for our sacrifice whose ritual grass has been strewn, (you,) sharp and  pure-flamed.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
2. They beautify you—those close at hand who receive bounty in horses  [=priests].
The pouring(-ladle) pursues you, o Agni, as does the oblation whose  course is straight.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
3. Those having (you) as their foundation [=flames] sit upon you, “pouring”  with their tongues like women pouring with their ladles.
Black and silver forms and all beauties do you put on.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
4. Whatever wealth you hold in regard, o Agni, you overpowering
immortal,
bring that here for us to win the prize, the bright (wealth) here to the  sacrifices.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
5. When just born, Agni found all the poetic arts with (the aid of) the  Atharvan (priest).
He became the messenger of Vivasvant, dear and desirable to Yama.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods). 6. They invoke you at the sacrifices, o Agni, while the ceremony is
proceeding.
You provide all desirable goods to the pious man.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
7. They have installed you as the beloved priest at the sacrifices, o Agni, ghee-faced and blazing for Manu, most observant with your eyes.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
8. O Agni, with your blazing flame you spread yourself wide and lofty. Roaring, you act the bull; you set an embryo in your female kinsfolk  [=plants].
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
## 22 (848) Indra
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
15 verses: purastādbrhat ̥ ī, except anuṣṭubh 5, 7, 9, triṣṭubh 15
The metrical scheme of this hymn is unique in the R̥gveda (see Oldenberg 1888: 122);  most of the verses have an 11 8 8 8 configuration (or something approaching it),  despite the Anukramaṇī’s identifications. Like many hymns whose meter is irregu lar, this one is driven more by phraseology, verbal echoes, and lexical chaining than  by meter. The responsion and chaining begin with the first two verses, which consist
of a rhetorical question about Indra’s fame (vs. 1) and its answer (vs. 2). The general praises of Indra continue in the next two verses, but shade, in  verse 4, into the myth (or fragments of myth) that occupy most of the rest of the  hymn: the journey of Indra and his client Kutsa (unnamed here) to the house of  Uśanā (Kāvya) with the horses of the Wind (vss. 4–6), the plea to Indra to smite the  demon Śuṣṇa (7–9), and the actual slaying of Śuṣṇa and its aftermath (vss. 10–11,  14), with several verses interspersed (12–13) begging Indra for aid and comfort.  (These may belong to the Śuṣṇa saga and represent the speech of the same “we”  who asked Indra to kill the demon in vss. 7–9, but they can also be generalized to  the current “we” of singers and patrons.)
Although there are many puzzles in these mythological verses, the real crux is the  pair concerning (apparently) the slaying of Śuṣṇa, verses 10–11, which contain sev eral well-nigh-impenetrable hapaxes and whose syntax is in places unparsable. Verse  10, especially, may be deemed impossible, and its translation is therefore provisional  and differs radically from others’ interpretations. We believe that it contains a badly  remembered and garbled allusion to an inherited Indo-Iranian mythic complex.  The hapax kārpāṇé, which others interpret as “in the sword-combat” (relating it  to a much later attested word kr̥pāṇa “sword”), we connect with the Avestan word  karapan (read disyllabically in the Gāthās), the designation of a person or persons  hostile to the Mazdayasnian religion and associated with equally hostile kauuis
1406 X.22
(e.g., Yasna 44.20, Yasna 32.12, 14–15, Yasna 46.11)—just as our kārpāṇé occurs  in a verse with unidentified (and, as it happens, syntactically untethered) kavis. In  the topsy-turvy religious system of the Gāthās, of course, entities viewed positively  in the R̥gveda (like kavis) have negative valuation. This is not the place to explore  this hypothesis in detail, but for another apparent manifestation of this myth, see  X.99.9, and for further discussion see Jamison (2009d [2013]).
The hymn ends with an impeccable triṣṭubh verse (15), containing a conven tional invitation to Indra to drink the soma and conventional wishes for his good  will and patronage.
1. Where is Indra famous? Among what people is he famed today like an  ally among the people?—
he who, whether in the dwelling place of the seers or in concealment, is  constantly celebrated in song.
2. Here is Indra famed. Among us today he is praised as the wielder of the  mace, equal to song—
he who like an ally among the peoples has made glory for himself
among the peoples, not by halves;
3. He who is the lord of great strength, not by halves, and of great
manliness, the thruster,
the bearer of the bold mace, like a father (of) his dear son.
4. As the one having yoked the two boisterous horses of the Wind, as god  (having yoked those) of the god, o wielder of the mace,
as the one who streams along the radiant path when set loose along the  highways, he is praised.
5. You have come to just these two horses of the Wind, the silvery ones, to  drive them by yourself,
those for which no god nor mortal can be found as controller.
6. Then Uśanā asks you both [=Indra and Kutsa] on your coming, “With  what purpose (have you come) to our house?
You have come from afar, from heaven and earth, to a mortal.”
7. You will ask for us, for our upraised sacred formulation, Indra.
We (in return) beg you for this help, that you smite Śuṣṇa, the non-man. 8. The Dasyu of non-deeds, of non-thought, the non-man whose
commandments are other, is against us.
You smasher of non-allies, humble the weapon of this Dāsa.
9. (Be there) for us, Indra, o champion, with champions, and (let us be)  aided by you, by your power.
In many places offerings bellow to you in competition like battle cries. 10. You incited these excellent men at the obstacle-smiting for the
Karpan [?], you mace-wielding champion,
when (you found?) him [=Śuṣṇa] in hiding—the sage poets (being
there), (profiting from) *the strength of your lordly power, *like
the clans. 11. Right away these things (became) yours, Indra, on gaining control over  (his) property for giving, you mace-wielding champion,
when with your fellow travelers you humbled everything born of Śuṣṇa. 12. Let your good superior powers not go nowhere for us, champion Indra. May each one of us be in the favor of these (powers) of yours,
mace-wielder.
13. For us let these (gifts?) of yours (become) real. They bring no injury— your caresses,
whose benefits, like those of milk-cows, we would know, mace-wielder. 14. While, handless and footless, the earth grew strong through the powers  of her wise ways,
you, circling him with respectful circumambulation [=as if for the
animal sacrifice], jabbed down Śuṣṇa for the whole of life.
15. Drink, drink the soma, hero Indra! Don’t mean (us) harm, goods lord,  since you are good.
And protect the singers and the bounteous (patrons), and make us rich  from (your?) great wealth.
## 23 (849) Indra
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 1, 7; abhisāriṇī 5 (so Anukramaṇī)
The hymn begins with a fine Indo-Iranian opening “we sacrifice to/worship  (yájāmahe) Indra,” reminiscent of the Younger Avestan litanies with the identical  verb yazamaide. The praise of Indra that follows is fairly conventional; we hear of  his mace (vss. 1, 3), his pair of fallow bays (vss. 1–3), and, less usually, his beard (vss.  1, 3). He is portrayed, in contrastive but complementary fashion, as at once warrior  and generous and paternal patron (see, e.g., vss. 1d, 2b, 5).
The final two verses (6–7) mention the poet Vimada (7b) and his family (6a),  and both verses feature prominently the verb vidmā́ “we know,” a partial anagram  of this name. Indra’s name is also played upon, in the adjective iná “strong” (6c),  and possibly, earlier in the hymn, by the presence of several pleonastic occurrences  of the particle íd (3a, 4d). In the same spirit, the frequent occurrence of the pre
verb/particle ví seems designed to recall the Vimada name. This punning is more  subtle and varied than that found in the Vimada hymns with the repeated catch word refrain ví vo máde ... vívakṣase (X.21, 24.1–3, 25). Thus, though the contents  of the praise are conventional, the playful phonological complexity gives texture to  the poem.
1. We sacrifice to Indra with the mace in his right hand, the charioteer of  the fallow bays who follow separate commandments.
He stands erect, constantly shaking out his beard, while apportioning  (goods) by virtue of his weapons, by virtue of his generosity.
1408 X.24
2. His are the two fallow bays and the goods [=soma] to be found in the  wood(en cup). Indra, the smiter of Vr̥tra, shall be bounteous with his  bounties.
As R̥bhu, Vāja, R̥bhukṣa [=the three R̥bhus] he masters his strength,  (saying,) “I whet down even the name of the Dāsa.”
3. When (he takes?) the golden mace, then he mounts the chariot, which his  two fallow bays draw, along with the patrons—
the bounteous one famed of old, Indra, master of the prize of
long(-lasting) fame.
4. Even now, as rain he (sprinkles) all things belonging to his herd; Indra  sprinkles his tawny beard.
He pursues his track down to the honey having its lovely dwelling in the  pressed soma. He tosses (his beard) upward like the wind a tree.
5. He who smote with his speech those of disputatious speech, those of  insulting speech, and many thousands of the hostile,
this and every (other) masculine deed of his do we sing—he who, like a  father (his son), has strengthened his own force and strength.
6. The Vimadas have begotten this praise for you, Indra, (praise)
unprecedented, best of many, for the one of good gifts [/drops],
for we know the feeding of him, which is that of a strong one. May we  bring him close like cowherds their livestock.
7. Let no one keep us away from this fellowship between you, Indra, and  Vimada the seer,
for we know your (fatherly) solicitude, o god, like that of kin. Let there  be friendly fellowship of you for us.
## 24 (850) Indra (1–3), the Asvins (4–6) ́
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
6 verses: āstārapaṅkti 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6
Two separate short hymns, distinguished by divinity, meter, contents, and style. The  first three verses, to Indra, contain the Vimada refrain. (For a discussion of its  structure see the introduction to X.21.) The poet straightforwardly asks for goods  and aid from the god in return for the soma offered to him.
The second three verses, to the Aśvins, allude to an otherwise unknown or  little-known myth in which these gods churn out a pair of females (which may or  may not be magical fire-churning sticks), which fly away to the gods’ disappoint ment; the gods ask the Aśvins to return them (vss. 4–5). If we knew the myth, it  would no doubt be fascinating, but in the absence of further textual evidence, it  must remain a tantalizing fragment. 1. O Indra, drink this honeyed soma pressed in the cup;
lay down for us a foundation of wealth in thousands, o you of
many goods.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
2. We beseech you with sacrifices, recitations, and oblations:
o power-lord of power, set in place for us the best that can be chosen. – In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
3. You who are the lord of those things to be chosen, the invigorator of  the weak,
and the helper of the praisers, o Indra, protect us from hatred and
constraint.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
4. O powerful ones, you two possessing magical powers churned out the  two joined (fire-churning sticks?),
when, reverently invoked by Vimada, you churned, o Nāsatyas.
5. All the gods yearned after the two joined (sticks?) as they flew away. The gods said to the Nāsatyas, “Bring (them) back again.”
6. Honeyed is my going away and honeyed (my) coming again.
O gods, do you two make us honeyed by your divinity.
## 25 (851) Soma
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
11 verses: āstārapaṅkti
The only Soma hymn in the Xth Maṇḍala, this hymn, like the others dedicated to  Soma outside the IXth Maṇḍala, lacks reference to the ritual preparation of the  soma drink, the theme that dominates the IXth Maṇḍala. In fact, there is almost no  acknowledgement that soma is a ritual substance at all: just the phrase “the fellow
ship of the stalk” in verse 1, the identification of Soma as máda “exhilarating” in  verse 10, and the refrain beginning “in... exhilaration” (ví...máde), itself a pun on  the name of the poet Vimada (see introduction to X.21).
The Soma of this hymn is predominately a protector, benevolently forgiving  childish transgressions on our part (vs. 3), watching over our possessions and our selves (vss. 6–7), and guarding us from external threats (vss. 3, 7–10), as well as  helping us cultivate our best qualities (vss. 1, 4). This Soma also presides over the  distribution of desirable things, probably in the form of the priestly gift or dakṣiṇā.  This aspect of Soma is first hinted at in verse 2, developed in verse 5, and trium phantly proclaimed in the final verse, 11.
The hymn contains some curious turns of phrase and slanted imagery,  and so the mention of the great Ist Maṇḍala poet Kakṣīvant in verse 10 is not
1410 X.25
altogether surprising. It is unclear whether the poet of this hymn is simply claim ing Kakṣīvant’s mantle or whether there is a family connection or even identity  with Kakṣīvant.
The least clear part of the hymn is the second part of the final verse (11), where  it is claimed that Soma will help the blind and the halt “for the seven.” Soma’s aid  to the disabled is expressed in similar terms in VIII.79.2, another Soma hymn found  outside of IX, but the identity of “the seven” in our verse is disputed, and the poet  seems to have wanted to leave it open.
1. Make auspicious thought, skill, and resolve our familiars.
Then in the fellowship of your stalk (o Soma, we will take pleasure), as  cows take pleasure in a pasture.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
2. Touching your heart, they sit amid all your domains, Soma.
Then these desires of mine spread out, seeking good things.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
3. And I transgress your commandments, Soma, through naïveté.
So then, like a father to his son offer mercy to us; (guard us) against the  fatal weapon.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
4. Our insights go forth together, like torrents into springs.
Hold our resolve firm like beakers, o Soma, for us to live.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
5. Through the powers that belong to you who are clever and strong,  o Soma,
these insightful ones, avid, open the pen full of cows and horses.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
6. You protect our livestock, Soma, and the moving (world [=living
creatures]) dispersed in many places.
You gather them, for them to live, as you watch over all living beings
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
7. Soma, be our undeceivable herdsman on all sides.
Ward off failures, o king; let no defamer hold sway over us.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
8. Soma, stay watchful as one of good resolve, to confer vital energy on us. As one who knows the territory better than man, protect us from deceit  and from difficult straits.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
9. O drop that best smashes obstacles, you are for us Indra’s benevolent  comrade,
when they call upon him in the conflict as they do battle at the winning  of progeny.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods). 10. Here he is: the exhilarating, overpowering one dear to Indra grows  strong;
he strengthens the thought of great Kakṣīvant, the inspired poet.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
11. He sends prizes of cows to the inspired poet, to the pious one.
He, according to his wish, will advance the blind and the halt for
the seven.
– In my exhilaration I wish to acclaim you (gods).
## 26 (852) Pūsaṇ
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
9 verses: anuṣṭubh, except uṣṇih 1, 4
Unlike most treatments of Pūṣan in the R̥gveda, with their generally simple but  lively and colloquial language and concentration on Pūṣan’s mundane activities,  this hymn is bristling with difficulties, oddly constructed hapax compounds, and  high, though frequently unclear, sentiments. See especially verse 6, whose language  and intent are almost entirely obscure.
The general themes are Pūṣan’s reciprocal relationship with inspired poets and  their thoughts (see vss. 1–2, 4–5) and his role as companion and friend (see vss.  2, 5–8).
1. Because our inspired thoughts, the cherished teams, go forth toward  (them),
[/Because their cherished teams go forth toward our inspired thoughts,] let the two wondrous ones—(Vāyu,) who possesses a chariot with teams,  and mighty Pūṣan—help (them).
2. He [=Pūṣan] to whom belong this greatness, the friendship with the Wind  [/sought-after friendship], this people here—
the inspired poet will strive to win (him) with his hymnic visions. He  [=Pūṣan] has taken cognizance of the good praise hymns.
3. He knows the good praise hymns. Pūṣan the bull, like a drop,
sprinkles sprinklings [?], sprinkles on our enclosure.
4. We would contemplate you. For us, god Pūṣan, (you are)
both the means to realize our thoughts and to stir up our inspired poets, 5. Half-sharer of sacrifices, horse-driver of chariots,
seer—he who was established by Manu as the companion who wards off  (hatred) for the inspired poet—
6. The husband of her who cares [?] [=Sūryā?], (companion) of the gleaming  (female [=Dawn?]) and the gleaming (male [=Agni, Soma, Sun?]),
weaver of garments of sheep [=wool], always rubbing [=cleaning] the  garments.
1412 X.27
7. Powerful lord of prizes, powerful companion of prosperities,
the delightful one has shaken forth his beard, shaken it out at will—he  who is not to be deceived.
8. O Pūṣan, the goats should turn the pole of your chariot hither—
(you are) the companion of every striving man, born of old, not to be  driven away.
9. Our chariot let Pūṣan the mighty aid with his vigor.
He will become the increaser of prizes; he will hear this call of ours.
The three hymns ascribed to Vasukra Aindra (X.27–29) are both very rich and very  strange, and will repay concentrated study for untold time to come.
## 27 (853) Indra
Vasukra Aindra
24 verses: triṣṭubh
This is one of the most obscure and also one of the most intriguing hymns in the  R̥gveda. In general and in its many particulars it has received a number of compet ing and conflicting treatments. We will restrict ourselves to presenting our own,  often tentative, interpretation, without discussion of other possibilities that have  been advanced.
First of all, in our opinion the hymn falls into two complementary units, verses  1–12 and 13–24, with the former subdivided into verses 1–7, 8–10, and 11–12 and  the latter into verses 13–18 and 19–24. The overall theme of the whole hymn is the  proper reciprocal relationship between men and gods, especially Indra, as symbol
ized by the sacrifice, and the proper functioning of the cosmos that this mutual rela tionship ensures. But this theme is treated in distinct ways in the course of the hymn. The first half is primarily in dialogue between Indra and the singer. In it  Indra contrasts the aid he gives to sacrificers with the destruction he metes out  to non-sacrificers (vss. 1, 4), and the singer echoes Indra’s contrastive pairing by  announcing his intention to offer to Indra, as opposed to the self-aggrandizing  atheists (vs. 2). Indra is somewhat skeptical of the singer’s intent (vs. 3): he suggests  that men sacrifice to him only when they need his help (3cd), but after he has helped  them win, they forget to offer to him (3ab). Indra continues boasting about his pow ers (vs. 5), perhaps taken up by the singer (or still in the mouth of Indra himself;  vs. 6), promising destruction to non-sacrificers. The singer’s glorification of Indra’s  powers and the devastation he will produce ends this section (vs. 7).
The contrast between followers of Indra and their opposites is continued by  another image in the next verses, the metaphor of lost and straying livestock. In  verse 8 cows are wandering loose, grazing in the pasture of a stranger, though  accompanied by a cowherd. In our view the cows stand for men, turning away from devotion to “their own lord,” Indra, to follow other ways and other leaders. In  verse 9 Indra promises to reassemble his lost herd and reestablish proper relation ships among them. The first half of verse 10 has the sound of a truth formulation,  again announcing the reassembling of the herd, with the second half of the verse  expressing the consequences for his weakened enemies, using the striking image of  these enemies fighting Indra “with women,” a phrase used elsewhere of about-to be-defeated opponents (V.30.9; cf. I.104.3).
The mention of women in verse 10 may have prompted the coda verses 11–12,  which treat the legal issue of the flawed woman given in marriage, known also from  the later dharma literature (cf. Mānava Dharma Śāstra IX.72–73, VIII.205, 224).  According to Manu a father is culpable if he tries to marry off a physically or  mentally flawed girl without declaring her faults in advance, but if he has informed  the bridegroom before the marriage, the latter has no legal recourse. Here verse  10 contrasts the suitor of a blind girl who knows she is blind (ab), with one who  was tricked into marriage without that knowledge and who therefore has the right  to deploy mení “the power of thwarted exchange.” (For further discussion, see  Jamison 1996b.) Verse 12 presents the opposite picture of an unflawed and happy  bride, embodying the appropriate and successful functioning of the exchange rela tions that characterize Ārya society.
Thus, though this first half of X.27 utilizes three dominant images—sacrificers  versus non-sacrificers, a unified herd following its herdsman versus dispersed and  straying livestock, and a properly contracted marriage versus one that involves  fraud and deception—all three contrast proper social relationships with aberrant  ones, and warn of the consequences of the latter
The second half of the hymn seems superficially to have nothing to do with  what went before, but viewed in the larger context it can be seen to pick up the first  and most important image, that of sacrifice as the binding relationship between  men and gods, and to develop it. The first six verses of this half (vss. 13–18) deal,  in our view, with the creation of the sacrifice and the mystery of its central focus,  the fire. This section begins with two riddling verses (13–14) identifying the fire  without naming it: verse 13 of the already kindled fire and verse 14 of its creation  by the “lofty steed” without shadow or foliage, probably the fire-churning spindle  (later pramantha), and the mother, probably the lower fire stick (aráṇī) with a hole  in which the spindle is turned and from which the “embryo,” the fire itself, emerges.  The second half of this verse describes the oblation, conceived of as a cow, “lick ing the calf (that is, the fire) of another (that is, the fire stick)” when poured into  the fire. The creation of the fire is also treated in verse 16, with much of the same  lexicon, but with the addition of the ten fingers, which manipulate the fire-making  apparatus.
In between is an enigmatic verse (15) about unidentified but numerically pre cise groups coming from different directions. In our view this treats the original  establishment of the sacrifice through the cooperation of various prototypical Ārya  communities (perhaps including the Seven Seers, the Navagvas, and the Daśagvas).1414 X.27
This theme is continued, though somewhat enigmatically, in verse 17, but in verse  18 there is schism: two groups go off in opposite directions and follow opposite cus toms, cooking versus non-cooking. It is the cooks and their fire who are predicted  to prevail. With this we return to the stark divisions of the first half of the hymn  between sacrificers and non-sacrificers. The split depicted in verse 18 also reminds  us of the fuller treatment of sacrificial schism in I.33.4–10.
If the first eighteen verses of this hymn are fiendishly difficult, the last six  (19–24) might properly be termed impossible—not so much because of their  grammar, but because of the rare words, the obscurity of the references, and the  unclarity of the relationships of the verses to each other and to the rest of the  hymn. The interpretation that follows is even more tentative than what has pre
ceded. The first two verses of this section (19–20) seem to be riddles turning on  astronomical or temporal references. The first may refer to the year and its com ponent parts (“the horde”) turning by itself and regularly bringing an end to the  mortal generations while renewing itself. The “two oxen of the Pulverizer” (death  or old age?) in verse 20 could perhaps be another temporal reference, to night and  day as similarly measuring out the lifespan of humans, beneath the eternal world  of heaven and the heavenly bodies. This theme appears to be continued in the  first half of the next verse (21), though what the “mace” (vájra) represents here is  entirely unclear—perhaps the year or other temporal division as a weapon that  smites mortals. The second half of this verse seems to offer a less bleak picture  than the inevitable decay and destruction that temporal divisions bring in their  train: there is “other fame,” to which old age can lead, though what that fame is  or is based on is not stated.
If we are correct, the implicit answer to this question is the sacrifice and its cen ter, fire, and this answer is given obliquely in verse 22. Fire the substance is always  potentially present, but not always actually present, and so it appears to defy the  temporally defined progress to old age and death. Latent “within every tree,” it  can burst forth at any time. It is frightening in some of its effects (the flames as  “man-eating birds”) and strikes terror in all beings (pāda c), but is also the benevo lent focus of sacrifice (pāda d). The original establishment of the sacrifice by the  gods seems to be treated in verse 23, and in the thoroughly obscure last pāda of  that verse Indra, unnamed, may come himself to the sacrifice for epiphany, thus  returning us to the beginning of the hymn and the direct involvement of Indra with  sacrificers.
The last verse is no clearer than the preceding ones, though it seems to be  announcing a final, instructive truth according to which one should lead one’s life.  Perhaps the idea is that the sacrifice is the means to life, which connects one to the  eternal world of heaven and the sun. The destructive temporal forces mentioned  earlier (vss. 20–21) were “below the sun,” but in this final verse the sun reveals itself,  hides the mist (if that’s what the phonologically problematic hapax busá means),  and reaches its “foot” (a sunbeam going toward the ground?) out to be seen, thus  providing a potential bond for the sacrificing mortal to the higher world. This shaft of light, liberated from its covering, that ends the hymn, seems an optimistic prom ise to the addressee of better things than decay and death.
But much of this is poorly supported speculation, and the hymn, especially the  final verses of the hymn, invites further detailed investigation.
1. [Indra:] I will really “boil over,” singer, when I do my best for the presser,  the sacrificer.
But I am a smiter of the one who gives no milk-mixture, who injures the  true, who seeks crooked ways—the nullity.
2. [Singer:] When I will drive together for battle those who do not follow  the gods, puffing themselves up in their bodies,
at home I will cook you a bulging bull; I will pour down sharp soma  fifteen-fold.
3. [Indra:] I do not know anyone who speaks thus, after he has smashed the  godless ones in the clash.
When he has caught sight of the mettlesome clash, only then do they  proclaim two bulls to me (as offering).
4. [Indra:] When I was in communities unknown, they all were bounteous  to me, since I was really there.
But truly I despoil the nullity even if he is here at peace, as I destroyed  the one on the mountain [=Vr̥tra?], having grasped him by the foot.
5. [Indra:] Truly they do not confine me in (just one) community, nor do the  mountains (confine me), when I am minded.
(Even) one with a stunted ear will be afraid of my roar. Just so, day after  day the dust will stir.
6. [Indra? Singer?:] He will now see those here who drink the cooked (milk  oblation) and who serve the foreleg without (offering to) Indra, and
those who play the lord’s role for an arrow,
or who have scorned their ardent comrade. The wheel-rims should now  roll over them!
7. [Singer:] You have come into being, you have grown strong, and you have  traversed your lifetime. Now (the opponent) in front will shatter; the  one behind will shatter now.
The two covers [=heaven and earth] do not encompass him who has  labored on the far shore of this airy realm.
8. [Singer:] The cows, dispersed, ate the grain of the stranger. I saw them  roaming with their cowherd.
The cries of the stranger came together from all sides. For how long will  their own lord find pleasure in them [=cows]?
9. [Indra:] When I will round up those that eat the grass and grain of the  peoples all together in a wide pasture,
then a yoked (animal) will seek an unhitcher, while he who longs to will  yoke an unyoked one.
1416 X.27
10. [Indra:] And just then you will consider this truly spoken by me—that  I shall bring the two-footed and the four-footed together.
Whoever then will fight the bull [=Indra] with women, I, who cannot be  combatted, will share out his possessions.
11. (A father) who has a daughter blind from birth—who, knowing her (as)  blind, will have designs on her [/will be hostile (to him=the father)]? (On the other hand, not knowing her state), which of the two will  unleash (the power of) violated exchange against him [=the
father]—the one who marries her or the one who woos her (on the  bridegroom’s behalf)?
12. How different is the maiden, gratified all around by an admirable (gift)  worthy to be chosen, from a bride-seeking man from among the  young bloods?
She becomes a fortunate bride, when she is well adorned. She wins  herself an ally [=spouse] in public.
13. He has swallowed (it [=firewood]) from the foot; he eats what’s in front  of him. He has set out head upon head [=his flames], as his shield. Sitting, he destroys the (kindling stick) erect in his lap; bending
downward, he goes along the upstretching earth.
14. Lofty but without a shadow and without foliage is the steed [=kindling  stick]. The mother [=lower fire stick] stands still; unloosed the
embryo eats.
Licking the calf of another, she [=oblation] lows. In what form did the  milk-cow deposit her udder?
15. Seven heroes [=Seven Seers?] came up from the south, eight from the  north: they joined together.
Nine [=Navagvas?] with grain sacks [?] came from the west, ten
[=Daśagvas?] in the east traverse the back of the rock.
16. One brownish one [=fire], common to the ten (fingers)—they spur on to  decisive resolve.
The mother bears the embryo well-placed in her belly—him seeking  after nothing, she being content.
17. The heroes cooked a fat ram; there were dice strewn down for gaming. Two roam the lofty steppe [=heaven?], provided with filters, purifying  (soma?) in the waters.
18. Shrieking, they went apart in opposite directions: one half will cook,  for the other half does not cook.
This god Savitar here says this to me, “Only he whose food is wood,  whose food is melted butter will win.”
19. I saw the horde [=year?] on the move from afar, turning by its own  power, without a wheel. It escorts forward the generations of peoples of the stranger,
diminishing their “tails” at the same time as transforming itself
ever anew.
20. These two oxen of the Pulverizer [=old age? death?] have been yoked for  me. Do not drive (them) forth; wait just an instant.
The waters also come through to the goal of this one, and he has come  into being as the Harmer below the sun.
21. This is the mace that has been rolled out in many ways, below the  fullness of the lofty sun.
But there exists other fame beyond this. Unwaveringly, old age
crosses to it.
22. Held in check within every tree, the cow [=fire?] will bellow. From there  the man-eating birds [=flames?] will fly forth.
Then all this creation here will be afraid, though pressing (soma) for  Indra and doing its best for the seer.
23. The first of the gods stood still at the measuring (of the sacrificial  ground?); the later ones of them came up from the cutting (of it).
Three marshy places [=fire hearths?] heat the earth; the two (horses?)  convey the “stammerer” [?] [=Indra?] to the fullness (of the sacrifice?  of the sun?).
24. This is your means of life. And know this—don’t hide away such a thing  in the clash—
when the sun reveals itself, it hides the mist [?]. Its “foot” is released as  if from a garment.
## 28 (854) Indra
Vasukra Aindra
12 verse: triṣṭubh
Another devilish hymn by the very talented Vasukra, and a worthy companion piece to X.27. Like the first half of X.27, this hymn consists of a dialogue between  Indra and a singer/sacrificer, introduced in this case by a verse spoken by the sacri ficer’s wife (who then disappears from the hymn). The hymn is more tightly struc tured than X.27, and it complements X.27 in another way: though the second half  of X.27 is deliberately obscure and esoteric in its expression, X.28 presents itself  (however misleadingly) as instruction to the simple, couched in straightforward  language.
The topic of the hymn, to be reductionist, is successful and unsuccessful sac rifices, and the human participants in the dialogue seem to express anxiety about  failing, perhaps by accident, to provide a sacrificial offering adequate to attract  the gods, especially Indra. The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the sacrificer’s wife, who is
1418 X.28
also Indra’s daughter-in-law, anxiously noting Indra’s absence from the sacrifice. In  verse 2 Indra responds that he protects those who provide him adequate soma; the  singer (probably) replies, perhaps a bit testily, that not only do they press soma and  cook bulls for Indra, but Indra does consume this provender (vs. 3).
There follows an abrupt change of subject, or at least change of tone. Indra  begins verse 4 with “Mark well this (speech) of mine, singer” and then alludes  glancingly to what appear to be animal fables of the sort found in much later texts  like the Pañcatantra. In verse 5 the mortal expresses doubt about his ability to  understand the god because of his (the mortal’s) simple nature, but also expresses  certainty that the god will enlighten him at the right time. The next three verses  (6–8) we will take up below. The animal fables return in verses 9 and 10, while the  last two verses (11–12) contrast greedy people, who consume what was destined  for the sacrifice and thereby actually weaken themselves, with the hard-laboring  sacrificers, who thrive.
The hymn is thus structured in the following way: the outer verses (1–3, 11–12)  concern successful and unsuccessful sacrifices and sacrificers, the opening verses  being more personal, the final ones more general. Within this frame there is an inner  ring of verses (4–5, 9–10), which establish a dialogue between mortal and god about  this problem and which express the god’s teaching in the simple terms a mortal  can understand, that is, in animal allegories briefly alluded to. This double ring of  complementary verses thus surrounds and marks out the center of the hymn, verses  6–8, and especially the exact center of the twelve-verse hymn, verses 6–7. These two  verses are also rhetorically responsive, and both their position and their structure  define them as an omphalos. Furthermore, they are uttered directly after the singer  has expressed certainty that Indra will proclaim his doctrine at the right time (vs.  5cd). Everything in the context seems to mark these verses as the direct teaching of  Indra, his significant message—and, indeed, as his epiphany, the epiphany that was  expected but not realized in verse 1. The vaunting self-praise in the omphalos verses  contrasts strangely with the animal fable verses that form the inner ring around  them, for in those the message seems to be rather that the weak can best the strong.
The re-transition from the ātmastuti (“self-praise”) of the omphalos (vss. 6–7) to  the animal fables (vss. 9–10) is effected by an even more enigmatic verse (8). Though  it does not match any of the structurally paired verses of the rest of the hymn, it  may carry the key to the whole, for it seems to treat the original establishment of  the sacrifice, instituted first by the gods. This reminds us of the more elaborate treat
ment of the origins of the sacrifice in X.27.13–18 (esp. 15), and it also suggests that  the sacrifice is the tool by which the weak (currently mortals) may control the strong  (Indra and the gods), as in the animal fables that enclose the hymn’s center. Reached  by way of a playful transition (vss. 10d, 11a), the final two verses (11–12) return us  to the present day and the ritual situation, and remind us of the contrast between  sacrificers and non-sacrificers in the first half of X.27, especially verses 2 and 7.
A word about the animal verses. Despite the major importance of animal  fables and allegories in later Sanskrit, there is essentially nothing like them in Vedic, especially early Vedic, and even the allusions to stories we have here— which are reminiscent of the summary verses of Pañcatantra tales—are unique  in the R̥gveda. Keeping in mind that animal stories are not told in later Sanskrit  simply to amuse, but are overtly instructive and educational, especially for cal low and wayward youth, we can connect the use of these allusions in this hymn  to the singer’s self-description as “a simple man,” incapable of understanding  Indra’s message (vs. 5). Indra is tailoring his instruction to the mental abilities  of his hearer: rather than express himself in the usual mysteries of R̥gvedic high  style (as in the immediately preceding X.27), Indra packages his message in a  series of beast fables. If this reading of the hymn’s general scenario is correct,  then we must assume already for the R̥gvedic period not only the existence of a  body of story literature, of animal fables, but also (more interestingly) a fairly  organized functional role for this literature in an instructional setting, conform
ing to the same model that we find quite a bit later in Indic literature in general.  And this in turn may lead us to reconsider the standard views of the history of  Indian literature and especially the connections between Vedic and Classical  genres.
For further discussion of this hymn, see Jamison (2004a; 2007: 80–83; 2008b).
1. [Sacrificer’s wife:] While every other stranger has come here, only my  father-in-law has not come here.
He should eat the roasted grains and he should drink the soma. Well-fed  he should then go home again.
2. [Indra:] The sharp-horned bull [=soma] continually bellowing has  mounted to the height (of heaven), upon the expanse of the earth.
In all communities I protect him who, having pressed the soma, fills both  my cheeks.
3. [Singer/Sacrificer:] With a stone they press the exhilarating, powerful  soma-drinks for you, Indra. You drink of them.
They cook bulls for you. You eat of them—coming when you are
summoned with nourishment, bounteous one.
4. [Indra:] Mark well this (speech) of mine, singer: The rivers carry the  flotsam against their current.
The fox crept up on the lion, his opponent; the jackal sprang on the boar  from out of the underbrush.
5. [Singer/Sacrificer:] How shall I mark this (speech) of yours—I, a simple  man, mark the inspired thought of you who are clever and strong?
You who know will declare to us at the proper time toward which half  your chariot-pole is to come to rest, bounteous one.
6. [Indra:] Because in this way they grow me strong, higher even than lofty  heaven is my chariot-pole.
Many thousands do I “grind down” all at once, for the begetter begot me  as one without rival.
1420 X.29
7. [Indra:] Because in this way they begot [/knew] me as strong and  powerful, at every action (calling) “o Indra” (to me,) the bull—the
gods (did this)—
I smashed Vr̥tra with the mace, while exhilarated; I opened up the
enclosure through my greatness for the pious one.
8. [Indra:] The gods came; they carried axes; hewing the trees, they  advanced with their clans toward (the ritual ground),
depositing the good wood in the belly [=the hearth(s) of the ritual
fires]. Where there is brushwood [?], they [=flames?] burn it up.
9. [Indra:] The hare swallowed the razor coming toward it. I split apart a  rock with an earth clod from afar.
Even a lofty one shall I weaken for a weakling. The calf, swelling up,  will pursue the bull.
10. The eagle caught its talon just so, like a lion entrapped into a snare. The buffalo also got trapped, when it was thirsty. The monitor-lizard  plowed this way for him.
11. The monitor-lizard will plow this way for those who taunt the brahmins  with their food.
The very same ones eat the released oxen, themselves breaking their
powers, their own bodies.
12. But these (others) have become very fortunate by their ritual labors— the ones who urged themselves on at the soma(-pressing) with
their hymns.
Speaking manfully, measure out prizes to us; in heaven you have
established your fame, your name as “hero.”
## 29 (855) Indra
Vasukra Aindra
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Shorter than Vasukra’s other two hymns, but no less daunting in the intricacy of  its expression, especially in verse 1, which displays phonological, morphologi cal, and syntactic tricks too numerous and too dense to discuss in detail here.  (See Jamison [forthcoming c].) Suffice it to say that the verse manages to refer,  by indirection and implication, to the five most important gods at the dawn rit ual: Agni, Indra, Vāyu, and the Aśvins, though only Indra is named. (Dawn is  the sole important divinity absent, but she appears in the first pāda of the next  verse.) Besides the common R̥gvedic habit of employing words applicable to two  or more referents, the verse shows in embryo a device prized in later kāvya: that  of allowing a single phonological sequence to be read in two of more different  ways by means of variant word divisions. Add to this an unprecedented syntactic construction, which is also a syntactic pun, and dizziness ensues for the hearer/ reader.
The structure and thematic contents of the hymn are less clear than in X.27 and  28, however. After the first two extremely opaque verses, which appear to treat the  dawn ritual and the divine conjunction of Indra and Agni (and probably of the two  Aśvins), the poet turns his hopes and attention to attracting Indra to show himself  at the sacrifice, to produce an epiphany (see esp. vs. 4), through properly performed  offerings. There are a number of obscurities in these verses as well, especially verse  5, and the lack of a perceptible structure hampers our efforts to clarify them. Much  remains to be excavated from this rich poetic mine.
1. Whether he takes pleasure in the wood or not, he [=Agni] has been  installed (as priest) [/been deposited (in the wood)]. The gleaming
praise has waked you two, o bustling ones [=Aśvins, or Agni and
Indra]—
(the praise) in which Indra (took pleasure) on many days (as did) the  Hotar [=Agni]—(each being) the manly one, best man among men,
earth-protector.
2. At the forefront of this dawn here and of the later one, might we be at  the manly prancing of you [=Indra], who are the best man of men.
Triśoka [/the three-flamed one (=Agni)] brought a hundred men
here (on the same chariot) with Kutsa—the chariot that will be
victorious.
3. Which exhilarating drink is to be enjoyed by you, Indra? As powerful  one, run to my hymns through the doors.
When (will) the vehicle, (that is,) the inspired thoughts, (come) near to  me? I would compel you here to highest generosity with (my offerings  of) food.
4. When (will) the brilliance of one such as you (come) to our men, Indra?  With which hymnic vision will you equip yourself? When will you
come to us,
(to be) actually present like an ally, o wide-ranging one, for our
offering—though there could be inspired thoughts at anybody’s food  (offering)?
5. As the sun sends (each man) forth to his task, do you send forth, (like a  boat) to the further shore, those who go, each to his own desire, as if  going to the providers of wives,
and those men who seek to empower their many hymns for you,
powerfully born Indra, along with their (offerings of) food.
6. The two copious “measures,” heaven and earth, are now well fixed by  your might, by your poetic skill.
Let the ghee-rich pressed soma-drinks be to your liking, let the
honey-drinks be in sweetness for your drinking.
1422 X.30
7. They poured out a tankard of honey for him, a full one for Indra, for he  is one whose generosity is real.
He has grown strong on the expanse of the earth, the manly one
pre(eminent) through his will and his masculine powers.
8. The very powerful Indra has penetrated the battling hosts. The many  (hosts) marshal themselves for him, for his comradeship.
Mount upon the hosts like a chariot that you will spur on with
auspicious benevolence.
Hymns X.30–34 are attributed to Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, though Oldenberg (1888: 234–35)  entertains the possibility that this group should be joined with the Vasukra hymns  that precede on the basis of shared phraseology.
## 30 (856) Waters or Apām Napāt
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is very ritually determined, and in fact it tracks closely the ritual acts  performed in the classical śrauta ritual at its recitation in the soma sacrifice. In verses  1–3 the Adhvaryu priests are sent to fetch water for the soma-pressing, but first make  an offering to the waters and the Child of the Waters (Apām Napāt). The Adhvaryus  then bring the waters to the sacrificial ground (vss. 4–9), with a reminder that they  (the waters) owe a favor to Indra, the principal drinker of soma, because he freed  them (vs. 7). More praise of the waters follows (vss. 10–12) as they approach the  place of sacrifice. They arrive in verses 13–14, and the pressing can begin in verse 15.
The feminine and enthusiastically yielding nature of the waters (the stem áp being feminine in gender) and their relationship to various masculine forces, the  Adhvaryus (vs. 2), Soma (vss. 5–6), and the gods (vs. 15), are also emphasized.
1. Let the course for our sacred formulation go forth to the waters that are  among the gods, as if by the harnessing of mind,
to the great wellspring of Mitra and Varuṇa. I will make the well-twisted  (hymn) subject to that which possesses broad expanse [=waters?].
2. O Adhvaryus, since you have become provided with oblations, go to the  eager waters, o eager ones—
(the waters) upon which the ruddy eagle gazes down. Harness the wave  today, o you of skillful hands.
3. O Adhvaryus, go to the waters, to the sea. Sacrifice with your oblation to  the Child of the Waters.
He will give you the well-purified wave today. For him press the
honeyed soma, 4. (For him) who shines without kindling wood within the waters, whom  the inspired poets call upon at the ceremonies.
O Child of the Waters, give the honeyed waters by which Indra grows  strong for his heroic deed,
5. By which Soma is delighted and becomes excited, like a young blood  with lovely young women.
Go forth to these waters, o Adhvaryu. When you will pour (them) in,  then purify (them) with plants.
6. Just in that way young women accede to a young man, when he goes to  them who are eager as he is eager.
They are agreed in mind and they perceive alike—the Adhvaryus, the  Holy Place, and the divine waters.
7. He who made wide space for you who were blocked, he who freed you  from the great curse,
to him, to Indra, propel your honeyed wave that exhilarates the gods,  o waters.
8. Propel to him the honeyed wave, which is your embryo, o rivers, and is a  fountain of honey—
(the wave) with ghee on its back, worthy of invocation at the
ceremonies. Rich waters, hear my call.
9. Rivers, propel the exhilarating wave providing drink to Indra, which  rouses both (races? [=gods and men]),
(the wave) arousing exhilaration, stemming from the uśānā-plant,
born of a cloud, the fountain that spreads widely around the
triple-threaded (sacrifice?).
10. Those whirling about in two streams, roving like cattle-raiders in teams, the begetters and masters of existence—the waters grown strong
together sharing the same womb: o seer, now extol them!
11. Impel our ceremony by a sacrifice to the gods; impel our sacred
formulation to gain the spoils.
At the yoking of truth unloosen your udder. Grant us attentive hearing,  o waters.
12. O rich waters, because you hold sway over the good, and you bring  favorable resolve and the immortal (soma?),
and you are masters of wealth that brings good progeny, let Sarasvatī establish this vital energy for the singer.
13. As the waters have just appeared in front—on their way here, bringing  ghee, milk, and honey,
allying in mind with the Adhvaryus, bringing the well-pressed soma
to Indra—
14. They have now arrived here, rich and bringing spoils for the living. O  Adhvaryus, comrades, make them take their seats;
set these down on the ritual grass, you (comrades) in soma, these who  are allied with the Child of the Waters.1424 X.31
15. The eager waters have come here to this ritual grass. Seeking the gods,  they have taken their seats at the ceremony.
Adhvaryus, press the soma for Indra. The sacrifice to the gods has
become easy for you to master.
## 31 (857) All Gods
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa
11 verses: triṣṭubh
An extremely obscure hymn. As in many such compositions, one of the major  sources of obscurity is the uncertainty of the referents in many key verses and the  possibility of multiple referents in such cases. The interpretation given here is ten tative and uncertain, and even if correct, or partially so, it does not exclude other  possible interpretations. In our view, the hymn speculates about the mystery of the  sacrifice, about the relations between men and gods that the sacrifice encodes, and  about Agni, the most conspicuous symbol of the sacrifice and the mortal–immortal  partnership, as the foundational principle of the cosmos and the neutralization of  the distinction between space and time. Although assigned to the All Gods, this is  obviously not a conventional All God hymn (if such exist) but one for which the  designation serves as a cover for mystic speculation. If it has a conventional deity,  it is Agni.
The hymn begins innocently enough with four verses establishing the ritual scene.  However, even in the first verse we encounter something unusual: the raw material  of the sacrifice seems to be seeking us out, as if the gods themselves were assisting  us in our duties toward them. Nonetheless, verse 2 asserts that the mortal sacrifi
cer must exert his own inherent powers in order to perform a proper sacrifice and  receive its benefits. The happy result of the mutual action of men and gods (note the  latter are called “helpers” in 3b) is expressed in verse 3, and in verse 4 (particularly  full of unidentified referents; see esp. pāda d) it seems that the central divine figure  Agni is well pleased and that other gods have favored the sacrificer as well.
Verses 5–6 are roughly the center of the hymn (especially since vs. 11 is a  pseudo-dānastuti); they are verbally responsive (note the asyá beginning 5c, 6a, and  6c, for example), and they introduce a larger cosmic dimension to the depiction of  the sacrifice. They thus qualify as an omphalos. Most important in these two verses  are the three words for “earth” that knit them together: kṣā́ḥ in 5a, bhū́man in 6b,  and, by implication, pr̥thvī́, disguised in the feminine participle paprathānā́ in 6a,  derived from the same root (prath) as pr̥thvī́ in 9a. (The three words—kṣā́ḥ, bhū́man,  and pr̥thvī́—are reunited again in vs. 9, a good indication that the conjunction in  vss. 5–6 was deliberate.) This emphasis on the earth in a ritual context seems to  make an implicit claim that the sacrificial ground is the earth. In verse 5 the sacrifi cial context is more overt: this seems to concern the distribution of the dakṣiṇās or priestly gifts at dawn. Verse 6 is more opaque, but in our view refers to the benevo lence of a well-pleased Agni radiating outward. The second half of verse 6 provides  a transition to the cosmic speculations that follow: the “lord” of 6a seems still to  be Agni, with his womb containing, on the one hand, his flames, and, on the other  hand perhaps, the gods.
The speculations of verses 7–10 begin, as often, with an unanswerable question  about the origins of the cosmos. Verse 7 also contrasts the stable and unchanging  quality of heaven and earth (space) with the ever-changing and aging aspect of  time. This opposition in a way provides the framework for the next few verses,  although the direct connection between 7 and what follows is superficially dim.  However, if, as we believe, the next three verses (8–10) concern Agni, he partakes  of both space and time, and provides the foundation for both. He supports heaven  and earth (8b)—there is no reason to look elsewhere (8a)—but he is also in con stant motion (8cd, 9ab) and appears in many guises (9cd). He thus grounds the  stability of the spatial cosmos while being in constant motion through it. In the  same way (vs. 10), temporal aging is represented by his regular rebirth, but because  of the paradox that he is born before his parents, temporal advance is negated.  The space/time conundrum is solved! The last clause of verse 10, “if they should  inquire” / “when they shall ask,” is in our view the formal closure to the cosmic  speculation opened by a question in verse 7 and not confined to the themes of  verse 10.
The final verse (11) has all the trappings of a dānastuti, appended to the  hymn, but it seems to refer to a very obscure saga also encountered in I.117.8, an  Aśvin hymn.
1. Let the laud of the gods, the means of sacrifice, come in quest of us, to  help us, along with all the overpowering ones [=gods].
Might we come to have good fellowship with them. Might we be those  who cross over all difficulties.
2. A mortal should await material wealth along the path of truth; he should  seek to win it through reverence.
And he should consult with his own resolve and grasp better skill with  his mind.
3. The insightful thought has been set in place; the (sacrificial) portions  have been sent surging. The helpers [=gods] come close to the
wondrous one [=Agni] as if to a ford.
We have attained the fortifying (hymn) for our good faring; we have
become cognizant of the immortals.
4. Our own constant lord and master of the house [=Agni?] should
find pleasure (in him [=sacrificer?]) for whom the god Savitar has
given birth,
or Bhaga and Aryaman should anoint him with cows. That one seems  beloved to him, and so he should be.
1426 X.32
5. Might this earth here be like (the place) of the dawns. When the
possessors of livestock [=gods? patrons?] have assembled here with
their strength,
desiring to partake of the praise of this singer, let the powerful prizes  approach us.
6. The good favor of just this one, spreading out, became the foremost  cow throughout the land;
in the womb of this lord are those of the same nest, being borne in the  same burden.
7. What was the wood, and what the tree from which they carved out  heaven and earth,
the two that stand together, unaging and enduring? But the days, the  many dawns, grow old.
8. There does not exist another of such kind beyond that. The ox bears  heaven and earth.
With a will of his own, he makes his skin into a purifier, when they
convey him, as the tawny (horses) do the sun.
9. Like a snake [?], he passes over the wide earth; as wind (blows) away  mist, he blows across the land,
where, being anointed as Mitra and as Varuṇa, like a fire in the forest,  he has let loose his flame.
10. When the barren cow [=kindling stick] gave birth all at once as she was  being driven/anointed, she, though faltering, did so unfalteringly,
since she has her own herdsmen [=priests].
When the son [=Agni] was born before his two parents [=kindling
sticks], the cow [=lower stick] swallowed the peg [=upper stick]—if
they should inquire.
11. They say that Kaṇva is the son of Nr̥ṣad [/of the one who sits among  men], and Śyāva [/the dusky], the prizewinner, took the stakes.
The gleaming udder swelled for Kr̥ṣṇa [/the black one], but in there no  one made the truth swell for him.
## 32 (858) Indra
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa
9 verses: jagatī 1–5, triṣṭubh 6–9
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn to Indra, in fact the hymn falls into  two separate parts, defined by both meter and content. The first five verses in jagatī are indeed Indra’s, but the last four verses (6–9) in triṣṭubh are more appropriate to  Agni. However, these two parts fit together into a larger thematic whole. The verses dedicated to Indra follow to some degree a conventional “journey”  hymn trajectory: Indra’s pair of horses bring him to the sacrifice in verse 1, with the  journey further described in verse 2. Verse 4 appears to concern the focal point of  the sacrifice, the sacrificial ground or, more precisely, the fire altar, to which all the  sacrificial participants and substances make their way. A two-way journey is fore
seen in verse 5, with Soma (if this identification is correct) on his way to the gods,  and Indra and companion gods on the way to the sacrifice.
Several features disturb this simplistic sketch of the hymn. First, the journey is  also conceived of as a wedding journey; in addition to verse 3 (to be discussed) see  especially the “wooers” in verse 1 and the bridal procession in verse 4. Moreover, the  middle verse of this portion of the hymn, verse 3, has a pronounced omphalos char
acter. It announces itself as a wonder, and then produces three striking paradoxes: the  son who knows his parents’ birth (pāda b), the wife who conveys her husband on the  bridal journey (pāda c), and the same role reversal seen from the husband’s point of  view, a bridal procession made for the man (pāda d). It is difficult to know exactly what  to make of this, but it appears that Indra’s journey to the sacrifice is being imagined as  the wedding journey of a bride. The hyper-virile Indra is in some sense filling the pas
sive role of bride—a fine conceit, though one that the poet does not over-emphasize. The focus on the “seat” in verse 4, quite possibly the hearth, as well as the first  paradox of verse 3, the son who knows his parents’ birth, a typical Agni trope, turn  our attention to that god in the second part of the hymn. The installation and kin dling of the ritual fire are the subject, and the mythic model is the well-known tale of  Agni’s flight, concealment in the waters, and recovery (vs. 6ab). The narrator owes his  knowledge of this to Indra (6cd); in verse 7 he makes a general statement about the  value of instruction for the uninitiated. This short sequence is reminiscent of nearby  X.28, in which Indra acts as the instructor of the callow. Verse 8 returns to Agni and  describes the kindling of a dormant fire. The enigmatic verse 9 presents itself as a  sort of reverse dānastuti, though with the identity of the speakers being somewhat  unclear.
1. The two (horses) are come, those in the power of the one being conjured  up by our insights [=Indra]—(they are come) to the wooers taking
their seats in front along with (the other) wooers.
Indra will find pleasure in both (offerings) of ours when he will take  cognizance of the soma-stalk.
2. O much-praised Indra, you drive across the heavenly luminous realms  and across the earthly ones through the airy space.
Those who convey you in an instant right up to the ceremonies, let them  vanquish the ungenerous ones who chatter.
3. Just this will appear to me as more wondrous than any wonder: that the  son knows by heart the birth of his parents.
The wife conveys the husband amid the uproar; just for the man an
auspicious bridal procession has been made ready.
1428 X.33
4. Just this dear seat do I ponder, to which the milk-cows will direct (their  journey) like a bridal procession,
as will the foremost mother of the flock, a wise counselor, and the
sevenfold people of the music.
5. Seeking the gods (he [=Soma?]) has left a track on his way toward you.  The one who alone surpasses [=Indra] drives with the Rudras,
or among the immortals among whom old age is for giving. Pour honey  all around for your helpers.
6. The protector of the commandments of the gods has announced to me  that the one who was hidden in the waters [=Agni] is (now) being
installed.
Because knowing Indra kept you in his sights, instructed by him have  I come here, o Agni.
7. Because the one not knowing the field asked the field-knower, he goes  forth, instructed by the field-knower—
this, truly, is the good of instruction—and he finds the straight course. 8. Just today did he [=Agni] breathe. He waited (all) these days; covered  over, he sucked his mother’s udder.
Old age has reached the youth. No (longer) angry, the good one has
become of favorable mind.
9. Might we do these auspicious things in giving bounties, o wooden vessel,  o Kuruśravaṇa.
Let this be a gift just for you, bounteous ones, and this soma here, which  I bear in my heart.
## 33 (859) Lament of a Singer [Anukramaṇı: All Gods 1, Indra ̄ 2–3, Dānastuti of Kurusravan ́ ̣a Trāsadasyava 4–5, Upamasravas ́ Mitrātithiputra 6–9]
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa
9 verses: triṣṭubh 1, brhat ̥ ī 2, satobrhat ̥ ī 3, gāyatrī 4–9
A poignant yet proud 1st-person lament of a poet whose patron has died, the hymn  also serves as a sort of job application to his erstwhile patron’s son. The progress of  the poem is marked by changes in meter. In the first verse the poet remembers his for mer privileged position and, in its last pāda, the sudden advent of disaster. The next  two verses (a pragātha) describes his present miserable state (in terms found also in  part in I.105.8) and begs Indra for help. In the last six verses, in gāyatrī, the poet first  recalls how he “chose” (a telling expression) his former patron Kuruśravaṇa (vss. 4–6).  He then introduces himself to the son, Upamaśravas (vs. 7), but returns in the final  two verses (8–9) to his helpless sorrow over the death of his patron and companion. 1. The advance teams of the peoples hitched me up in front. As always,  I carried Pūṣan within.
All the gods then guarded me. There was a shout, “The one of bad
command has come.”
2. They scorch me all about, like cowives, (like ailing) ribs.
Inattention, nakedness, and exhaustion oppress me. Like a bird, my
attention keeps fluttering here and there.
3. Like mice their tails, the cares gnaw at me, your praiser, o you of a  hundred resolves.
At once show mercy to us, bounteous Indra, and become like a
father to us.
4. I chose Kuruśravaṇa of Trasadasyu’s line as my king,
most liberal to his cantors—I a seer—
5. (Saying,) “He whose three tawny (horses) convey me on his chariot along  the straight way—
I shall praise him at a (sacrifice) with a priestly gift of a thousand
(cows)”—
6. (I chose) the father of Upamaśravas for whom there were sweet songs, delightful like a dwelling place for one at home in it.
7. Learn, o Upamaśravas, his son, o grandson of Mitrāthiti:
I am the celebrant of your father.
8. If I could be the master of immortals or of mortals,
my bounteous patron would still live.
9. No one lives beyond the commandment of the gods, even one with a  hundred selves.
And thus have I turned away from my yokemate.
## 34 (860) Gambler
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa or Akṣa Maujavant
14 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7
One of the most famous, most translated, and most anthologized hymns in the  R̥gveda, this lively and vivid lament of the gambler depicts the sad lot of a man  addicted to dicing but unsuccessful at it. This hapless speaker describes the intoxi cation that grips him when he is playing or even contemplating play and that leaves  him helpless to resist (vss. 1, 5–9), as well as the toll this compulsion takes on his  personal life and the self-pity this evokes in him (vss. 2–4, 10–11). At the end of the  hymn the gambler vows to renounce play (vs. 12), and the god Savitar restores him  to his former position (vs. 13). The final verse (14) is the gambler’s address to the  dice, urging them to leave him alone and find another victim. This portion of the
1430 X.34
hymn has the form of a ritual expiation, embodied especially in the last words of  12d, in which the gambler avows the truth of his speech.
Dicing was an important cultural feature of ancient India, especially associ ated with kings and the ruling class. Already in middle Vedic sacrifice, in the  Rājasūya, the ritual of the consecration of the king, there is a ritual dicing  match, rigged so that the king-to-be wins. Of course, the whole of the great epic,  the Mahābhārata, is determined by the outcome of the dicing match between  Yudhiṣṭhira and his cousins: Yudhiṣṭhira gambles away his kingdom, his broth ers, his wife, and himself and must fight to regain his kingship. The much-loved  story of Nala and Damayantī also involves the gambling away of a kingdom,  this time by Nala. And the dharma texts consider gambling, along with hunting  and womanizing, to be a characteristic pursuit—and vice—of kings (cf. Mānava  Dharma Śāstra VII.47, 50; for condemnation of gambling in general see, e.g.,  MDŚ IX.220–28).
Ancient Indian dicing was quite different from the game that the word con jures up in the modern mind, and much scholarship has been devoted to figur ing out what the play actually consisted of (see, e.g., Lüders 1907; Falk 1986).  It seems to have involved a large quantity of a particular kind of nut (vibhīdaka /vibhītaka) as the dice; these had no markings on them. They were thrown into  a hollow on the ground, and the players took turns pulling out a handful. The  best “hand” was one divisible by four, and the other hands were ranked accord ing to how many nuts were left over after a division by four, with a single leftover  nut being the worst (see vs. 2c). For details, see Falk (1986: 73–133). Although  it may be hard for us to imagine the passions enflamed by this kind of long  division, our own games of chance probably will not stand up to scrutiny some  millennia in the future.
The monologue form found here is almost unprecedented in the R̥gveda, and  the shifting play of emotions—guilty excitement, tender remembrance of his  past life and family, scorn for his own weakness and the disgust he arouses in  others, bitter anger at the inanimate dice that brought him low, to which he  ascribes agency and malign intention and for which he still longs—is psychologi
cally convincing and very moving. Showing our own biases, we might proudly  deem it quite “modern.”
1. The dangling (nuts) of the lofty (tree) exhilarate me, the ones born in a  windy place, constantly whirling in the gaming hollow.
Like a draught of soma from Mt. Mūjavant, the wakeful vibhīdaka nut  has pleased me.
2. She did not oppose me, nor did she get angry; she was gracious to my  comrades and to me.
I, on account of one die too many, have pushed away my avowed wife. 3. Her mother-in-law [=my mother] hates me; my wife pushes me away.  A man in distress finds no one to pity him. “I find no more use for a gambler than for an old nag up for sale,” (so  they say).
4. Others fondle the wife of a man whose possessions the die with eyes on  the prize has hungered for.
Father, mother, brothers say about him, “We do not know him; lead  him away bound.”
5. When I resolve, “I will not play with them,” I am bereft of my
comrades, who go off (without me).
And as soon as, scattered down, the brown (dice) have raised their
voice, I just go to their appointed place, like a girl with a lover.
6. The gambler goes to the hall of play asking himself, “will I win?”  puffing himself up with “I will win!”
The dice run counter to his desire, conferring the winning throws on his  opponent.
7. They are just “dice”—but hooking, goading, debasing, scorching,  seeking to scorch,
giving (temporarily) like a child, then in turn slapping down the victor,  infused with honey, with power over the gambler.
8. The troop of them plays, three times fifty strong. Like god Savitar’s,  their ordinances hold true.
Even to the battle fury of the mighty they do not bow; even the king  makes his bow to them.
9. Downward they roll; up above they ricochet. Lacking hands, they  overpower the man with hands.
Heavenly coals scattered down in the gaming hollow, though they are  cold they burn up the heart.
10. The wife of the gambler, abandoned, is scorched, and the mother of the  child wandering who knows where.
In debt, fearful, seeking money, he approaches by night the house of  others.
11. It scorched the gambler to see a woman—the wife and well-ordered  home of others.
Since early in the day he hitched up his brown horses [=dice], the “little  bullock” fell [=left off gambling and sought shelter] (only) at the end  of the fire [=late at night].
12. [Gambler:] He who has become the general of your great throng, the  foremost king of the troop,
to him I put forth my ten (fingers): “I withhold no money. This truth  I speak.”
13. [Savitar:] “Don’t keep playing with dice; just plow your own plowland.  Be content in your possessions, thinking them much.
There are your cows, o gambler, there your wife.” In this way does
Savitar here, protector of the stranger, watch out for me.
1432 X.35
14. [To all the dice:] Make alliance (with us) now; have pity on us. Do not  conjure against us boldly with your terrible (mind/eye).
Let your battle fury now settle down, your hostility. Let another now be  in the toils of the brown ones.
The next four hymns (35–38) form a group, though they are not all attributed to the  same author (see Oldenberg 1888: 229 n. 2, 235). The first two, to the All Gods, are  attributed to Luśa Dhānāka, while the other two were given fanciful poets’ names  derived from the contents of the hymn itself:  37 Abhitapas Saurya (“Scorching  Heat, son of the Sun”) and 38 Indra Muṣkavant (“Indra, possessing testicles”).
## 35 (861) All Gods
Luśa Dhānāka
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13–14
This is primarily a morning hymn, calling especially on the gods associated with  the early morning sacrifice for aid and protection: the Sun, the Dawn, Agni, Indra,  the Aśvins, as well as Heaven and Earth. The ten interior verses (3–12) have a pāda length refrain dedicated to the kindled ritual fire, and the activities of Dawn occupy  much of the hymn (esp. vss. 3–6). The hymn opens out toward its end, with special  focus on the Ādityas (vss. 9, 11–12), but the later prominence of the Ādityas has  been prepared by mention of “blamelessness” in earlier verses (2–3) and by the  “proclamation of truth” in verse 8. This truth, formulated in 8c, is simply that “the  Sun, as spy,” rises every day, but we know from elsewhere in the R̥gveda (nearby X.37  belonging to the same poetic group [see discussion there], as well as, e.g., VII.62.2,  VII.63.1) that the Sun is the eye of the Ādityas, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, who  attests to the innocence or guilt of the men whom he sees as he rises. Thus this brief  truth formulation encapsulates our knowledge that our place in the moral order is  mediated through the cosmic order of the daily rhythm of sunrise.
1. They have awakened—these fires accompanied by Indra, bringing light at  the early brightenings of the dawn.
Let great Heaven and Earth take cognizance of our work. Today we
choose the help of the gods.
2. We choose the help of Heaven and Earth. The Mother Rivers, the  Mountains filled with (soma-)reeds,
the Sun, the Dawn we beseech for blamelessness. Let Soma, being
pressed, make good for us today.
3. Heaven and Earth—let the two great mothers protect us, who are  blameless, for our welfare. Let Dawn, dawning, thrust away evil. – We beseech Agni, when he is  kindled, for well-being.
4. This foremost ruddy one here, *this lovely goddess—let her, the rich  lady, dawn richly for our gain.
In the distance (from us) we would set the fury of the one who is bad to  meet. – We beseech Agni, when he is kindled, for well-being.
5. Those who stretch forth with the rays of the sun, bringing light at the  early brightenings of the dawn,
do you dawn good things widely today for our fame. – We beseech
Agni, when he is kindled, for well-being.
6. Let the dawns without affliction attend upon us; let the fires rear up  loftily with their light.
Let the Aśvins hitch up their thrusting chariot. – We beseech Agni,
when he is kindled, for well-being.
7. The best portion, worthy to be chosen, impel to us today, o Savitar, for  you are a conferrer of treasure.
I call on her, the begetter of wealth, on the Holy Place. – We beseech  Agni, when he is kindled, for well-being.
8. Let this proclamation of truth carry me through, the one that as sons  of Manu we have thought up for the gods:
“Through all the ruddy (dawns) the Sun, as spy, (always) goes up.”
– We beseech Agni, when he is kindled, for well-being.
9. Today at the strewing of the ritual grass, at the yoking of the pressing  stones we beg for lack of hatred and for the realization of our
thought.
Standing in the shelter of the Ādityas, you are astir. – We beseech Agni,  when he is kindled, for well-being.
10. Here is our ritual grass for the joint revelry. I reverently invoke the gods  lofty in heaven. I will make the seven Hotars sit (on the ritual grass).
(We beseech) Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Bhaga, for our gain. – We
beseech Agni, when he is kindled, for well-being.
11. Ādityas, come here for our wholeness; aid our sacrifice for us to grow  strong, you who take pleasure together.
(We beseech) Br̥haspati, Pūṣan, the Aśvins, Bhaga. – We beseech Agni,  when he is kindled, for well-being.
12. O gods, Ādityas, extend to us this shelter good to proclaim, of good  support, protective of men,
for our livestock, for our kith and kin to live. – We beseech Agni, when  he is kindled, for well-being.
13. Let all the Maruts today all (be there) with aid, let all the kindled fires  be (there with aid).
Let all the gods come here to us with help; let all wealth, (every) prize  be for us.1434 X.36
14. One whom you help, o gods, at the winning of prizes, one whom you  safeguard, one whom you carry across narrow straits,
one who knows no fear under your protection—may we be (all) those,  to pursue the gods, powerful ones.

Luśa Dhānāka
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13–14
This hymn is a clear companion piece to the preceding one, X.35. Both hymns con sist of fourteen verses, all jagatī except the last two in triṣṭubh. Both have a refrain,  and the refrain of X.36 (vss. 2–12) is a minor variant of the last pāda of the first verse  of X.35. And there is some shared vocabulary. However, X.36 is not tied closely to  the morning sacrifice, as X.35 is. The range of gods invoked in X.36 is wider than  those in X.35, although there is a distinct Ādityan cast here as well (see vss. 1, 3–4,  12–13). The hymn seems somewhat loosely and inattentively constructed.
1. Dawn and Night, lofty, well-ornamented—Heaven and Earth, Varuṇa,  Mitra, Aryaman—
Indra I invoke, the Maruts, the Mountains, the Waters, the Ādityas,
Heaven and Earth, the Waters, the Sun.
2. Both Heaven and Earth—let those two discerning truthful ones guard us  from narrow straits, from harm.
Let Dissolution, bad to meet, not gain mastery over us. – This help of  the gods we choose today.
3. Let Aditi protect us from every narrow strait—the mother of Mitra and  of Varuṇa the wealthy.
Might we attain sun-filled light that keeps the wolf away. – This help of  the gods we choose today.
4. Let the pressing stone as it speaks drive away demonic forces: the bad  dream, dissolution, every devourer.
Might we attain the Ādityan shelter and that of the Maruts. – This help  of the gods we choose today.
5. Let Indra sit here on the ritual grass; let the refreshing drink swell. Let  Br̥haspati the chanter chant along with the melodies.
We would compose a thought possessing good signs for our life. – This  help of the gods we choose today.
6. O Aśvins, make our sacrifice heaven-touching and of lively ceremony, to  seek favor—
a sacrifice with its reins pointed eastward, bepoured with ghee. – This  help of the gods we choose today. 7. I invoke the Marutian flock, (which is) good to invoke, (which is) pure,  high, luck itself—for comradeship.
Might we acquire the thriving of wealth in order to receive good
fame. – This help of the gods we choose today.
8. We will bring (forward) the one swollen with the moisture of the waters,  providing riches for the living, pursuing the gods, good to invoke, the  glory of the ceremony.
Soma, destined for Indra, with his good reins would we hold fast.
– This help of the gods we choose today.
9. May we win this through easy winning with winners—we living and  with living sons, blameless.
The haters of the sacred formulation should take their own
transgression off in all directions. – This help of the gods we
choose today.
10. You who are worthy of the sacrifice of Manu, listen: what we beseech  you for, gods, give that—
resolve that brings victory, glory accompanied by wealth and heroes.  – This help of the gods we choose today.
11. A great thing of the great ones we choose today: the help of the lofty  gods without assault,
so that we may attain the good born of heroes. – This help of the gods  we choose today.
12. In the shelter of great Agni while he is being kindled (may we be)  blameless to Mitra and Varuṇa for our well-being;
may we be under the best impulsion of Savitar. – This help of the gods  we choose today.
13. All (you) Gods who are under the commandment of Savitar, whose  impulsion is real, and of Mitra and Varuṇa—
establish well-portioned property in heroes and cows, brilliant wealth  for us.
14. Savitar from behind, Savitar from in front, Savitar from above, Savitar  from below—
let Savitar impel wholeness to us; let Savitar bestow on us a long
lifetime.

the name of the supposed author of X.37, Abhitapas Saurya (“Scorching Heat, son  of the Sun”), is an artificial one, derived from the hymn’s subject matter. In X.35 the daily rising of the sun, expressed as a brief truth formulation  (X.35.8), was implicitly connected with the poet’s desire for “blamelessness” and for  the protection of the Ādityas, but these themes were scattered through the hymn,  which focused primarily on the early-morning sacrifice and the various gods associ ated with it. Here the Sun is primary, and his role as the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa,  and thus as the observer of mortals’ guilt or blamelessness, is announced at the  beginning (vs. 1a), and an expanded version of the truth formulation of X.35.8 is  found in the second verse.
The benefits the Sun brings to us and the regularity of his return form the sub ject of the middle part of the hymn. The connection between our moral behavior  and the Sun’s daily round is asserted again toward the end of the hymn (vs. 9),  which concludes (vs. 12) with a general expiation for faults unwittingly committed  and a scapegoating of our enemies.
1. Homage to the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa. Do great service to this truth  [=hymn] for the god.
To the one seen from afar, the signal born of the gods, the son of heaven,  to the Sun—recite!
2. Let this expression of reality protect me around on all sides, where(ver)  Heaven (and Earth) and the days will extend:
“Every other thing that stirs settles down. But always the waters (are in  motion), always the Sun rises.”
3. No godless one seeks the upper hand against you early in the day, when  you drive your chariot with its flying steeds.
The one (wheel) rolls eastward along the dusky realm; with the other  one, the light, you drive upward, o Sun.
4. The light with which you thrust away the darkness, o Sun, and the  radiance with which you rouse up every moving creature,
with that drive away from us every want of nourishment, every lack of  oblation, drive away disease, away the bad dream.
5. For impelled forth, you guard the commandment for all, when not being  angry you proceed upward following your own customs.
When today we will appeal to you, o Sun, the gods should give assent to  our intention.
6. This call of ours let Heaven and Earth, this speech of ours let the waters,  Indra, and the Maruts hear.
Let us not be in want of the sight of the Sun. Living happily may we  attain old age.
7. Always may we—of good mind, of good eye, rich in offspring, without  disease, without blame—
living a long time look upon you rising every day, o Sun who have
Mitra’s might. 8. Upon you, o wide-gazing one, bringing great light, luminous, a joy to  every eye,
mounting from the surface of lofty (heaven)—may we, living, look
upon (you), o Sun.
9. You at whose signal all creatures both go forth and settle down
at night—
by reason of our blamelessness, o golden-haired Sun, rise up with ever  better (fortune) for us day after day.
10. Be luck for us with your eye, luck for us by day, luck with your radiance,  luck in the cold, luck in the heat,
so that there will be luck on the road, luck at home. This brilliant
wealth establish (for us), o Sun.
11. To both our breeds, o gods, to the two-footed and the four-footed,  extend shelter.
Eating, drinking, drawing nourishment, satiated: establish for us this  luck and lifetime without flaw.
12. Whatever we have done to you, o gods, with our tongue or through  absence of mind, whatever grave (offense) angering the gods,
on the ungenerous one who brings misfortune to us, on him set down  this offense, o good ones.
## 38 (864) Indra
Indra Muṣkavant
5 verses: jagatī
The fanciful name of the poet in the Anukramaṇī (“Indra possessing testicles”)  is extracted from the final pāda of the poem (5d); the hymn clearly belongs with  the other compositions of Luśa (X.35–38). It is a martial hymn, calling on Indra  to fight on our side in pitched battles, vanquishing our enemies and sharing the  booty he acquires. The style is lively and at times slangy, especially in the final verse,  with its surprise ending: depicted as all powerful in the rest of the hymn, Indra is  revealed to be not entirely free, but in some unspecified thrall to Kutsa (otherwise  a client of Indra’s in the R̥gveda), and the poet taunts Indra to break the bonds.
1. At this glorious battle charge, Indra, at the vehement battle cry, help us  to win,
when at the winning of cattle, when the bespangled (warriors) have been  emboldened, the missiles fly in all directions at the time to conquer
superior men.
2. Uncover for us at our seat wealth in livestock, flooding with cows, worthy  of fame, o Indra.
May we share the fat with you when you win, able one. As we want it,  make it so, good one.
1438 X.39
3. Whatever godless one, Dāsa or Ārya, will have in view to fight us, o  much-praised Indra—
let those rivals be easy to conquer for you along with us. With you may  we vanquish them in the clash.
4. Who is to be invoked by the few and who by the many, who finds wide  space in close quarters at the time to conquer superior men,
him—the winner in the devouring (battle) today, the famous superior  man—Indra may we make inclined toward us for help.
5. For I have heard of you, Indra, as tightly wound, unyielding, spurring on  (even) the feeble, o bull.
Release yourself from Kutsa! Come here! Will such a one as you stay tied  by the balls?
From X.39 through X.56 the hymns are arranged in groups of three, each trio gener ally ascribed to the same poet by the Anukramaṇī. See Oldenberg (1888: 236). The next three hymns, dedicated to the Aśvins, are attributed to a female poet  Ghoṣā (X.39–40) and her son (X.41). Ghoṣā herself bears the patronymic Kākṣīvatī “daughter/descendant of Kakṣīvant,” the exceptionally artful poet of I.116–126,  who is especially devoted to the Aśvins:  five of his eleven hymns are dedicated  to them (I.116–120). Indeed the phraseology and mythological references of the  Ghoṣā hymns share much with Kakṣīvant’s Aśvin hymns, and whether we accept  the Anukramaṇī’s ascription of the hymns to a woman and her son (the latter iden tified by the metronymic Ghauṣeya), there can be no doubt that these hymns have  a remarkably close relationship to the Kakṣīvant hymns in Maṇḍala I. It is worth  remembering that Kakṣīvant shows a particular interest in women and marriage in  his hymns.
All three of the Ghoṣā hymns begin with a verse invoking the Aśvins’ chariot, but  they diverge significantly thereafter. The final hymn (X.41) is a brief (three-verse)  pendant to the series, straightforwardly describing the Aśvins’ early-morning jour ney to the sacrifice and urging them to come to our offering in preference to other  possible ones. The other two are more complex, with significant involvement of an  apparent woman’s voice, especially in X.40, which focuses on marriage.
## 39 (865) Aśvins
Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13
This first hymn in the series is in most ways a standard Aśvin hymn, especially in the  Kakṣīvant mode. After the first verse devoted to the chariot and a plea to the Aśvins  for lavish gifts (vs. 2), the hymn settles into the familiar pattern of many Aśvin  hymns, in a list form briefly mentioning good deeds performed and benevolent treatment meted out by those two gods. The first catalogue is fairly brief, consisting  of the two verses 3–4, with a formulaic summary (“I shall proclaim your ancient  heroic deeds...”) in verse 5. The poet promises to make the Aśvins “new” (5c), just  as they famously made Cyavāna young again (4ab). A second longer catalogue of  deeds, more formally constructed, occupies verses 7–11.
But these lists are interrupted (in vs. 6) by a surprising, 1st-person intrusion: a  woman (the feminine pronoun iyám opens the verse and makes the gender of the  speaker unmistakable) calls upon the Aśvins and begs them to serve as her parents  and aid her in her plight, since she lacks friends and relations. The reason for her  distress is not given, but the traditional view that she is asking them to find her a hus
band seems reasonable, given that an orphaned girl would have no marital prospects  and would be quite vulnerable to mistreatment. Her verse closely echoes the first verse  of the hymn: she uses the same verb “invoke” and uses a paternal image like that in  verse 1d.
This heartrending verse seems to have no sequel in the hymn. Although it is  not impossible that the following catalogue verses are also her speech, it seems  unlikely because of their strict conformity to Aśvin-hymn diction. While it is  certainly true that the next verses mention several females helped by the Aśvins  (the wife for Vimada, the aid given to Vadhrimatī and to Puraṃdhi, vs. 7; to  Viśpalā in vs. 8), males are just as often recipients of their favor in those verses,  and the most striking female figure, the spinster growing old in her parents’  house in verse 3, who is identified with the woman in verse 6 and indeed with  Ghoṣā by many commentators, is not in a verse that our female speaker could  be saying.
The female speaker in this hymn foreshadows and complements the female  speaker, explicitly identified as Ghoṣā, in the next hymn (X.40.5–8), and the speaker  in this hymn is often said to be that same Ghoṣā. However, in the opinion of one of  us (SWJ) this is quite unlikely because our speaker bemoans her lack of kin, while  Ghoṣā in X.40.5 is said to be a king’s daughter. Instead, the two female speakers  seem meant to contrast with each other and to reflect extreme poles of women’s sta
tus in a marital context. The other of us (JPB) sees the speaker’s lament in 39.6 that  she has no friends or relatives as a metaphorical and hyperbolic characterization of  her unhappy life rather than a literal description of it. In that case the speaker in  X.39 could the woman called Ghoṣā in X.40.
Another, enigmatic reference to a woman is found in verse 11, which ends the cat alogue. The verse declares that no trouble afflicts a man if the Aśvins put his chariot  and his wife (pátnī) “in front.” What exactly is meant here is unclear, but we sug gest that this is yet another fleeting reference to the introduction of the Sacrificer’s  Wife (pátnī) into the ritual in late R̥gveda; the chariot and the wife leading the  way remind us of the Mudgala/Mudgalānī hymn (X.102), in which Mudgala’s wife,  Mudgalānī, serves as successful charioteer in a chariot race—a hymn we have also  interpreted as a reference to the new ritual institution of the Sacrificer’s Wife. (For  further discussion, see the introduction to X.102.)
1440 X.39
The hymn ends with a return to the Aśvins’ chariot drive (vs. 13), with a few more  incidental good deeds, and a summary verse announcing our own praise hymn (vs. 14).
1. Your earth-encircling, smooth-rolling chariot, to be invoked at evening  and at the dawns by the man who offers oblation—
that (chariot) of yours do we now invoke, (we) as the latest of those
who constantly do so—the (chariot) good to invoke like the name of  one’s father.
2. Stimulate liberal giving; swell our insightful thoughts; rouse
profusions—we are eager for that.
Make us a glorious portion, o Aśvins; make it dear to our generous
patrons like soma.
3. You become good fortune even for the woman growing old at home,  the helpers even of the one lacking speed, even of the one furthest
behind.
Even of the blind man, o Nāsatyas, even of the starving, even of the
broken—they say just you are their healers.
4. You two fashioned old Cyavāna, like a chariot, into a youth again, (for  him) to move about.
You pulled the son of Tugra out from the waters. All these (deeds) of  yours are to be proclaimed at the pressings.
5. I shall proclaim your ancient heroic deeds before the people. And you  were also healers, embodiments of joy.
Now we shall make you new (for you) to help us, o Nāsatyas, so that  this stranger will place his trust (in us?).
6. [A woman:] “It’s I who invoked you: hear me, o Aśvins. Like parents for  their son, do your best for me.
I am without friends, without kin, without blood relatives, and
heedless: rescue me in the face of this shame.”
7. You two with your chariot carried down to Vimada the sleek maiden of  Purumitra (to be his wife).
You two came to the call of Vadhrimatī. You two made an easy birth  for Puraṃdhi.
8. You two made youthful vigor again for the inspired poet Kali, who was  approaching old age.
You two dug Vandana out from the antelope snare. You two in an
instant made Viśpalā go.
9. You two raised up Rebha, set in hiding and already dead, o bullish Aśvins. You two made the earth-cleft and the heated (pot) comfortable for Atri,  for Saptavadhri.
10. You two gave to Pedu a white horse, a prizewinner with nine and ninety  prizes, o Aśvins,
(a horse) to be celebrated, one setting its comrades to running, to be
invoked by men like good fortune, and the embodiment of joy. 11. O you two kings and Aditi—not from anywhere does distress or  difficulty or fear reach him
for whom you arrange that his chariot, along with his wife, will be in  front, o Aśvins good to invoke, you who follow the course of the
Rudras [=Maruts].
12. Drive here with your chariot swifter than thought, which the R̥bhus  made for you, o Aśvins,
and at whose hitching up the Daughter of Heaven [=Dawn] is born and  both bright-lit day halves of Vivasvant.
13. You drove your course with your victorious (chariot) through the  mountain. You made the milk-cow swell for Śayu, o Aśvins.
With your powers you two freed the quail, which had been swallowed,  even from within the mouth of the wolf.
14. We have made this praise song for you, o Aśvins. We have fashioned it,  like the Bhr̥gus a chariot.
We have clasped it to ourselves like a dashing youth a maiden, holding  it close like our own son who continues our lineage.
## 40 (866) Aśvins
Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī
14 verses: jagatī
As suggested in the introduction to X.39, we two translators have different  interpretations of the ritual context for this pair of hymns. Accordingly we  have contributed contrastive, signed discussions of the hymn’s context in this  introduction.
SWJ
As already noted, the hymn begins with a mention of the Aśvins’ chariot journey  (vs. 1) and indeed continues with speculations on their whereabouts (vss. 2–3) and  a description of our attempts to attract them to our sacrifice (vs. 4). These verses  contain vivid imagery, especially the contrastive pictures of sexual pairing in verses  2–3 (see also X.39.14c, which is a mirror image of 40.2d).
These erotic images prepare the way for the scenes of apparent betrothal and  marriage that follow (vss. 5–11). These verses open with the speech of a woman  identified as Ghoṣā, whose status as king’s daughter contrasts with that of the  bereft, unnamed woman who speaks in X.39.5 (see the introduction to that hymn).  Ghoṣā boldly addresses the Aśvins themselves and demands to know if they will  “be there” for her (vs. 5). The scene sketched is, in my opinion, a Svayaṃvara or  woman’s “self-choice” marriage. The stage has been set for this in verse 3d, where  the Aśvins are described as coming to soma-pressings “like kings’ sons” (rājaputrā́).
1442 X.40
This tatpuruṣa compound is found only here in the R̥gveda and would neatly iden tify the Aśvins as appropriate suitors coming to a Svayaṃvara, where the woman  making the choice would likewise be a king’s daughter (5b). Her unabashed speech,  questioning them about their suitability as husbands and supporters, would be fit ting in a Svayaṃvara context.
The next verses (6–8) seem to depart from the marriage theme, and it is not  possible to be certain that they are spoken by Ghoṣā. I believe they are, however,  because the marital theme continues beneath the surface: verses 5–7 contain four  somewhat problematic instances of the preverb pári “around” (5a, 6a, 6c, 7c), in  the same metrical position, but in awkwardly unidiomatic verbal lexemes. The  problems they cause for the translator are seen in the somewhat “off” English that  represents them. This intrusive pári is, in our opinion, an insistent reminder of the  wedding context, evoking one of the important parts of the wedding ceremony, the  circumambulation of the fire, and also evoking the consummation of the marriage,  the embrace of the bride, found close to the end of these wedding verses, in 10d “the  wives are to be embraced (pariṣvajé).”
Ghoṣā’s likely speech ends with verse 8, ostensibly praising the Aśvins for “giv ing freedom/wide space” to various individuals and opening up an enclosure with  all the characteristics of the Vala cave, a deed not usually attributed to the Aśvins.  The wide space created and the opening up of the enclosure can (perhaps fancifully)  be taken metaphorically here, in this wedding context, for the deflowering of the  virgin bride.
The following two verses (9–10) return to the narrator/poet and describe the  wedding itself, but develop the theme identified in the previous verse. In the first  pāda of verse 9 the maiden is born—presumably born into womanhood, after the  “opening up” just performed. The “little lad” in flight in the same pāda may be her  bridegroom, or even a pet diminutive for his penis. The next two pādas (9bc), with  sprouting plants and flowing rivers, are generally interpreted as expressing nature’s  approval of the marriage; in contrast we again consider them metaphorical, express
ing the advent of sexual maturity and sexual awakening. The sprouting sprouts of  pāda b remind us of the maiden Apālā’s prayer that her pubic hair would grow along  with the plants in the fields (VIII.91.5–6); the rivers of pāda c might either be her  first menstrual blood, the blood from her deflowering, or sexual fluids produced  by arousal. This verse ends with the same phrase that Ghoṣā used in her question  to the Aśvins, “be there for the day,” but with a reversal of genders (the bride will  be there for her husband, as Ghoṣā asked the Aśvins to be there for her), followed  by the triumphant “this is marriage!” While verse 9 treats marriage as an intimate  exchange between the two principals, verse 10 brings us back to the social aspects of  marriage: the exchange relation created between the families and the effort required  to bring it about. The mysteries of sex are, mysteriously, touched on in verse 11.
The hymn ends with three verses (12–14) more conventionally addressed to the  Aśvins with requests for goods and aid, though the final verse (14) echoes the ques tions about the whereabouts of the Aśvins that began the hymn. JPB
An alternate view of the ritual context of X.39–40 is that both hymns find a place  in an Atirātra, an Overnight Soma Sacrifice, in the morning rites that conclude the  ceremony. In these rites, which are a continuation of the rites of the Third Pressing  from the previous evening, the Aśvins return in the morning of the second day to  receive a last offering of soma. The references to the night between evening and  morning oblations (e.g., X.40.2), to the soma offerings (X.39.4, 40.13, 14), and, of  course, to the Aśvins, to whom both hymns are dedicated, accord with the ritual  context of an Atrirātra.
One of the themes of the Third Pressing in the classical soma rites is the fertil ity of the sacrificing couple. Since this is a relatively late hymn, the Wife of the  Sacrificer may already have been a participant in the rite for which these hymns  were composed. Therefore, the hymns might have been an appeal to the Aśvins to  help make the marriage of the sacrificing couple a success by giving them a son.  Thus, the “little lad” who “has taken flight” in the puzzling verse 9 might be the  hoped-for child, whose birth marks the success of their marriage. His “flight” can  refer to his conception; the image of an embryo “flying” to the womb also occurs  in X.162.3. For a detailed study of the hymn that reflects this interpretation, see  Brereton 2013.
1. Your chariot that is driving where—who attends to that brilliant one for  its good progress, o men—
the (chariot) driving early in the morning, extending to every clan,
traveling at every dawn—(who attends to it) with insightful thought
and labor?
2. Where in the evening, where at dawn will the Aśvins make their evening  meal? Where did they spend the night?
Who takes you to bed, like a widow her brother-in-law, or to a
rendezvous like a maiden a dashing youth?
3. You awaken early in the morning like a pitiable [?] old couple; at every  dawn you, deserving the sacrifice, come to the house.
For whom do you become occulted, or for whom do you descend to his  soma-pressings like kings’ sons, o men?
4. Like hunters on the track of wild elephants, we call you down in the  evening and at dawn with our oblation.
You two bring refreshment to the man who pours the libation in proper  order, you superior men, you lords of beauty.
5. Circling around you two, o Aśvins, Ghoṣā, the daughter of a king, said,  “I ask you, o men:
Will you be there for me for the day and be there for the night? Will you  exert your abilities (for me, as if) for a steed (to win the prize) of horse  and chariot?1444 X.40
6. “You two poets circle around your chariot, o Aśvins; you arrive at the  clans of the singer, as Kutsa (arrived at the poet/Kavi Uśanā).
The bee holds the honey of you two encircled with her mouth, o  Aśvins, as a young woman (holds) a tryst (within her mouth) [=keeps  quiet about it].
7. “You two came to Bhujyu, o Aśvins, you to Vaśa, you to Śiñjāra,  to Uśanā.
The hostile man will circumvent your comradeship, but I find pleasure  in your benevolence along with your help.
8. “You two make wide space for Kr̥śa, you for Śayu, o Aśvins, you for the  worshiper and the widow.
You two open up the thundering enclosure with its seven mouths for  the sake of gain, o Aśvins.”
9. The maiden has been born, and the little lad has taken flight. And  when sprouts have sprouted according to (the Aśvins’) wondrous  powers,
the rivers flow for him as if into a valley; (she) is there for him for the  day (and for the night): this is marriage!
10. They cry over the living; they make a mutual exchange at the rite. The  men [=relatives of the couple] have been devising (the marriage) for a  long stretch:
It is a precious thing for the fathers, that they brought (the couple)  together; a joy for husbands that their wives are to be embraced.
11. We do not know this—proclaim it to us—how a young man dwells  peacefully in the womb of a young woman.
Might we go to the house of the seed-laden bull who has a ruddy cow  as his beloved, o Aśvins. We are eager for this.
12. Your benevolence has come here, you Aśvins whose goods are prize  mares. Our desires have held themselves down firmly in our hearts,  Aśvins.
You have become the paired herdsmen, the two lords of beauty. Dear to  Aryaman, might we reach his porticos.
13. Reaching exhilaration in the dwelling of Manu, provide wealth along  with heroes to the eloquent one.
Make a ford that offers good drink, o lords of beauty. Smash away the  post standing in our path, the malevolence.
14. Where today and among which clans do the wondrous Aśvins, the lords  of beauty, find exhilaration?
Who has held them down? To the house of which inspired poet or  sacrificer have they gone?
## 41 (867) Aśvins
Suhastya Ghauṣeya
3 verses: jagatī
As we already noted in the introduction to this group of hymns, this brief appendix  is a conventional journey hymn. Nothing in this hymn, save the treatment of the  chariot in verse 1, makes its relationship to the two preceding Ghoṣā hymns evident.  The poet is identified as a son of Ghoṣā by the metronymic Ghauṣeya; his first  name, Suhastya “Good-handed,” is extracted from verse 3.
1. This your common three-wheeled chariot—much invoked and worthy of  praise, going again and again to the soma-pressings,
earth-encircling and worthy of the rites—do we invoke with well-twisted  (hymns) at the break of dawn.
2. O Nāsatyas, you mount the early-yoked, early-driving, honey-bringing  chariot,
by which you go to the sacrificing clans, o men, and to the sacrifice even  of a weak man, with its Hotar, Aśvins.
3. Whether you are going to an Adhvaryu of good hands with honey in his  palms, or to an Agnidh of steadfast skill, a domestic leader,
or to the soma-pressings of an inspired poet, from there drive here to  honey-drinking, o Aśvins.
Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa is said to be the poet of the next three hymns (42–44), all dedicated  to Indra and showing clear verbal connections.
## 42 (868) Indra
Krṣ̥ na Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The usual mutually beneficial relationship between Indra, giver of bounties and  aid in battle, and the singer/sacrificer offering poems and oblations in exchange is  the theme of this hymn. However, the hymn is scarcely run-of-the-mill, for the poet  has captured the relationship in a series of deftly fashioned images, and the balance  between giving god and offering mortals is maintained throughout.
1. Like an archer in ambush who shoots farther, like a busy attendant,  bring forth the praise song for him.
With your speech, o inspired poets, surpass the speech of the stranger.  Bring Indra to rest at our soma, o singer.
1446 X.42
2. Try to entice your comrade here, (like) a cow with milking. Singer,  awaken Indra (like) a lover.
Bestir the champion to the giving of his bounty, like a full bucket  overflowing with goods.
3. Do they not call you the benefactor, bounteous one? Sharpen me: I hear  that you are the sharpening.
Let my insight be profitable, able one. Bring Bhaga, the goods-finder,  here to us, Indra.
4. The peoples, taking their stand in conflict together, separately call upon  you in the struggle for “what’s mine.”
Whoever offers an oblation makes (you) his yokemate here: the
champion wants no fellowship with a non-presser.
5. Whoever, providing a pleasing offering, presses for him sharp soma  drops, ample like streaming wealth (on the hoof),
for him (Indra) makes a team of his rivals, easily spurred, easily goaded,  in the early morning of the day. He smashes the obstacle [/Vr̥tra]. 6. Indra, upon whom we have set our laud, the bounteous one who has  fixed his desire upon us—
let his rival, though he is far away, take fright, and let the peoples’  brilliant things bow down to him.
7. Thrust the rival far away into the distance with that mighty śamba-pole  of yours, o you who are much invoked.
Set (a mass of) barley and cattle on us, Indra. For the singer, make his  insight possessed of prizes as its ornaments.
8. Indra, within whom the bullish pressings, the sharp soma drops, have  gone, ample to the end—
the bounteous one will certainly not hold back his giving. He carries  down much of value to the presser.
9. And having overplayed his hand, he will win the jackpot, when the  (gambler) with the best throw pulls out the perfect (“hand” of dice)  at the right time.
Whoever has desire for the gods, he does not withhold the stakes; just  him does the autonomous one [=Indra] unite with wealth.
10. With cows we would overcome neglect that goes ill, and with barley we  would overcome all hunger, o you who are much invoked.
With our kings and our community might we be the first to win the  stakes.
11. Let Indra, lord of the formulation, protect us all around, from behind  and from above and from below, from him who wishes ill—
from in front and from the middle. Let him, as comrade, create wide  space for his comrades. X.43 (869) Indra
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11
This second of Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa’s three eleven-verse Indra hymns has very clear ties  to the previous one, X.42. They share the last two verses (10–11), as well as lexicon  and phraseology. Yet the two hymns are thematically distinct, and X.43 lacks the  carefully balanced reciprocity of X.42. The focus here is on liquids—on nourishing  streams of water (vss. 3, 6–8) as well as on soma (vss. 2, 4, 6–8)—and on finding  the sun or the light (vss. 1, 4, 5, 8). These themes together evoke the triumphant  progress of the Ārya, conquering rivers and finding sunlit space, which is mythically  embodied in Indra’s release of the waters confined by Vr̥tra indirectly reflected in  verse 8b. This recourse to the mythic model accounts for the references to Manu,  the primal Ārya sacrificer (vss. 4, 8).
One can point to a nice index of the different uses even shared elements are put  to in the two hymns X.42 and X.43: identical or almost identical phrases assign  roles to exactly opposite personnel. Thus, the phrase “fix desire on someone” (√śri  kā́mam locative) is found in both X.42.6b and X.43.2b; in the former Indra has  fixed his desire on us, while in the latter I have fixed my desire on Indra. Similarly, in  the elaborate gambling simile found almost identically in X.42.9abc and X.43.5ab it  is the mortal who is the subject in X.42 and Indra in X.43.
1. My thoughts—sun-finding, all directed to a single goal, eager—have  bellowed to Indra.
They embrace him as wives do their husband, embrace the bounteous  one like a sleek young blood, for help.
2. Directed toward you, my mind does not lose the track: just on you have  I fixed my desire, o much invoked one.
Like a king, wondrous one, sit down upon the ritual grass. Since there is  soma here, let there be drinking for you.
3. Indra, warding off from diverse directions neglect and hunger—just he,  as bounteous one, will be master of wealth and goods.
Just his vitality do these seven rivers, in their torrent, increase—the
vitality of the tempestuous bull.
4. Like birds on a leafy tree, the soma drops—exhilarating, sitting in the  cup—have settled down on Indra.
Their countenance, powerfully flashing forth again and again, found the  sun, the light of the Ārya, for Manu.
5. Like a (gambler) with the best throw he pulls out the perfect (“hand” of  dice) in the game, when the bounteous one wins the sun as his takings. No other will be able to match this heroic deed of yours, neither one of  the past, o bounteous one, nor of the present.
1448 X.44
6. Clan after clan does the bounteous one encircle, as the bull keeping  watch over the nourishing streams of the peoples.
In whose soma-pressings the able one rejoices, that one vanquishes,
with his sharp soma juices, those doing battle.
7. When the soma juices have flowed together into Indra, like waters into a  river, like brooks into a pond,
the inspired poets at the (sacrificial) seat increase his greatness, like rain  the barley, with the heavenly gift [/drop].
8. Like an angry bull he flies among the airy realms—he who made these  waters here to have an Ārya as their husband.
The bounteous one found light for the presser possessing lively gifts
[/drops], for Manu who offered oblation.
9. Let the axe [=fire] arise, together with its light. The (cow) of truth,  yielding good milk, should come into being as of old.
Let the ruddy, blazing (fire) shine out with its radiance. The master of  settlements should blaze like the blazing sun.
10. With cows we would overcome neglect that goes ill, and with barley we  would overcome all hunger, o you who are much invoked.
With our kings and our community might we be the first to win the stakes. 11. Let Indra, lord of the formulation, protect us all around, from behind  and from above and from below, from him who wishes ill—
from in front and from the middle. Let him, as partner, create wide
space for his partners.
## 44 (870) Indra
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, jagatī 4–9, triṣṭubh 10–11
This last in the trio of Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa’s Indra hymns shares its final two verses  (10–11) with the previous two hymns, though it otherwise has little in common with  them. The hymn bristles with difficulties in the details, but its overall trajectory is  clear: it is a journey hymn, inviting Indra to drive to our sacrifice (vss. 1–3) to take  his place on the ritual ground and partake of our soma (vss. 4–5). The poet then  contrasts evil-minded non-sacrificers with their generous counterparts (vss. 6–7).  The poet gives a brief précis of the heroic deeds Indra accomplished in the past  after drinking soma (vs. 8), and in verse 9 urges Indra to defeat the poet’s enemies,  while making himself at home at the soma sacrifice.
1. Let Indra, our own lord, drive here for exhilaration—he who, forceful,  thrusting according to his own principle,
is projecting his vigor over all powers with his boundless, great
bullishness. 2. Your chariot provides a good standing place and your fallow bays are  easy to control. Your mace is attached to your fist, o lord of men.
Along a good path, o king, drive swiftly in this direction. We will
strengthen your bullish powers when you have drunk.
3. Let the conveyors of Indra convey him here, the lord of men in whose  arm is the mace; mighty and forceful, let them convey him, the
mighty,
the bull who projects his vigor, possessing real unbridled power; let his  feasting companions convey him here among us.
4. Just in this way you drench yourself in the lord [=soma], the companion  of the cup, the like-minded one, the prop of nourishment upon its
support.
Make it your might; take it entirely within you, so that you will be
powerful for the strengthening of those who keep watch (over us)
nearby [=patrons?].
5. Good things shall come to us, for I have expressed my prayer. Drive  here to the soma-possessor’s offering, which is accompanied by good  prayers.
You are master. Take your seat here on this ritual grass. Your cups
cannot be ventured against, on (ritual) principle.
6. The first invocations to the gods went forth each separately. They  brought themselves fame difficult to surpass.
The *non-protectors [?], who were not able to board the ship of
sacrifice, sank down in stillness.
7. Just exactly in this way let the ones of evil intent, whose horses have  been badly yoked, be behind and facing backward;
correspondingly, those who are nearer and facing forward, they are
(ready) to give, when the many (ritual) patterns and nourishments
are (in place).
8. He gave foundation to the trembling mountains and plains. Heaven  cried out and made the midspaces quake.
He props apart the two Holy Places [=Heaven and Earth] that were
conjoined. Having drunk of the bull, he recites the solemn words in
his exhilaration.
9. I bring this well-made crook to you, with which you will break the  hoof-breakers, o generous one.
Let there be a home for you in this soma-pressing. Become a sharer in  our pressed soma and in our quest, bounteous one.
10. With cows we would overcome neglect that goes ill, and with barley we  would overcome all hunger, o you who are much invoked.
With our kings and our community might we be the first to win the
stakes.
1450 X.45
11. Let Indra, lord of the formulation, protect us all around, from behind  and from above and from below, from him who wishes ill—
from in front and from the middle. Let him, as partner, create wide
space for his partners.
Although the Anukramaṇī names Vatsaprī as the poet of only the next two  hymns (45–46) to Agni, the following (47) to Indra clearly belongs here as well, as  Oldenberg argues (1888: 236).
## 45 (871) Agni
Vatsaprī Bhālandana
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with Agni’s triple birth, in heaven, on the earthly sacrificial  ground, and in the waters (vs. 1), and the next verses touch on Agni’s several  forms (vss. 2–3). The cosmic aspects of Agni (vss. 4–6, 8) are thus marshaled in  service of the ritual Agni, installed as fire-priest in verse 7, and it is therefore easy  to believe in the good things that will come to the mortal who sacrifices to Agni  (vss. 9–12).
1. From heaven was Agni born first; from us was he born second as Jātavedas. (Born) a third time in the waters, the inexhaustible one—kindling him,  the manly minded, very attentive (mortal) sings to him.
2. We know your threefold triads, Agni; we know your domains dispersed  in many places.
We know your highest name, which is hidden; we know the wellspring  whence you have come here.
3. In the sea, in the waters has the one with a manly mind (kindled) you; the  one with manly eye kindled (you) in the udder of heaven, o Agni.
The buffaloes strengthened you, who were standing in the third realm, in  the lap of the waters.
4. Agni has roared like thundering heaven, constantly licking at (heaven  and) earth, anointing the plants,
for as soon as he was born kindled, he surveyed them. He radiates with  his radiant beam between the two world-halves.
5. Rouser of beauties, buttress of riches, propeller of inspired thoughts,  with Soma as herdsman,
good one, son of strength, king in the waters, he radiates forth, being  kindled at the forefront of the dawns.
6. Beacon of all creation, the embryo filled both world-halves while he was  being born. He split even the solid rock in leaving it, when the five peoples sacrificed  to Agni.
7. The fire-priest, pure circlet, very wise—Agni has been installed as  immortal among the mortals.
He raises reddish smoke, as he carries it here and there, seeking to reach  up to heaven with his blazing flame.
8. Seen as a bright ornament, he has flashed forth widely, alight for beauty  through a lifetime hard to forget.
Agni became immortal through his vital powers, when Heaven of good  seed begat him.
9. Whoever will make for you today a ghee-covered cake, o god Agni of  fortunate flame,
lead him further forward, toward a better state, toward favor
apportioned by the gods, o youngest one.
10. Give him a portion in (ritual acts) deserving good fame, Agni; give him  a portion in every solemn speech being pronounced.
He will become dear to the Sun, dear to Agni. He will burst out with  (offspring already) born, burst out with those to be born.
11. Sacrificing to you, Agni, through the days, they have acquired all  desirable goods.
Together with you the fire-priests, seeking wealth, have opened up the  pen full of cows.
12. Agni has been praised by the seers—Vaiśvānara, well-disposed to men,  having Soma as his herdsman.
We would invoke Heaven and Earth, the two without hatred. O gods,  establish wealth rich in heroes for us.
## 46 (872) Agni
Vatsaprī Bhālandana
10 verses: triṣṭubh (and virāj)
Attributed to the same poet as X.45, this hymn is clearly a companion piece to the  previous hymn, sharing much of the same specialized lexicon (e.g., uśíj “fire-priest”)  and an interest in the various forms and births of fire and their relation to the  ritual fire. However, X.46 is, for the most part, more rhetorically driven and more  obscurely phrased than X.45, with images pushed to the edge of intelligibility (and  beyond; see, e.g., vs. 7). The trickiness of its phraseology is matched by its meter, a  shifting combination of triṣṭubh and virāj lines, with a number analyzable as either.  Nonetheless, the emphasis on the installation of the ritual fire is manifest through out: the original installation (vss. 4, 8–10), the reinstallation of the disappearing  Agni (vss. 2–3), and the current installation (vss. 5–6).
1452 X.46
1. Forth (he goes) when just born—the Hotar, the great cloud-finder;  seated among men, he sat down in the lap of the waters.
He who has been established establishes vital powers for you; he is  the extender of goods to the man who does honor and he is the
protector of bodies.
2. This one here—having done honor to him in the seat of the waters, they  followed him along his tracks like a vanished cow.
With reverences seeking him who was hiding in secret, the fire-priests,  the insightful Bhr̥gus found him.
3. This one here—Trita Vaibhūvasa, much seeking, found him on the head  of an inviolable cow.
Growing strong with kindness when just born here in the habitations,  the youth becomes the navel of the luminous realm.
4. The fire-priests with their reverences made him the gladdening Hotar,  the leader of the ceremonies, and made the sacrifice advance,
made him the pure circlet of the clans, when they established him as the  oblation conveyor among the sons of Manu.
5. Forth (they lead him), *glittering, great, conferring poetic inspiration,  splitter of strongholds, no fool—(even) fools (do so).
Leading him, the embryo of the trees, the gold-bearded one, like a steed  for whom a verse is the prize, they have set forth an inspired thought. 6. Trita [= the “third” fire], standing fast in the dwelling places,  surrounded, sits down inside the womb.
From there the domestic leader of the clans [=Agni], having amassed  (goods?), with his reinless (horses) speeds to the superior men
through the spreading expanse.
7. His are the unaging oars of the houses, the pure fires with
singing smoke,
bright, swelling, bustling, sitting on the wood like winds (in trees), like  soma-drinks (in the wooden cups).
8. Agni displays his own pulsing excitement with his tongue, (displays) the  patterns of the earth with his appearance.
Him, blazing and pure, have the Āyus established as gladdening Hotar,  most worthy of sacrifice.
9. Agni, whom Heaven and Earth begat, whom the Waters, Tvaṣṭar, and  the Bhr̥gus begat with their powers,
the one first to be reverently invoked—Mātariśvan and the gods  fashioned him as the means of sacrifice for Manu.
10. You whom the gods established as conveyor of the oblation, whom the  sons of Manu, craving much, established as means of sacrifice,
o Agni, establish vital power for the praiser on your course. One who  seeks the gods ad(vances), for glory gets the girls. X.47 (873) Indra
Saptagu Āṅgirasa
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Though the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to a different poet from the last two,  structural considerations make it clear that it belongs with X.45–46, as Oldenberg  convincingly argues (1888:  236); the Anukramaṇī has simply extracted the name  Saptagu Āṅgirasa from verse 6, where it is properly applied to the god Br̥haspati.  Nonetheless, the subject matter of this hymn is quite distinct from the two Agni  hymns that precede it: it is a naked demand to Indra for wealth. The hymn has a  superficially monotonous structure consisting of attributes in the accusative: verses  2–5 form a single sentence dependent on the second hemistich of 1. But this monot ony conceals, or rather reveals, the poet’s cleverness, for it is entirely ambiguous  whether the accusatives modify Indra or the “wealth” of the refrain found in all the  d-pādas. In the former case, the adjectives would agree with the accusative tvā in the  verb phrase found in 1c vidmā́ hí tvā “for we know you (as),” punctuated and inter
rupted by the syntactically unconnected refrain; in the latter case with the accusative  rayím in the refrain. The semantics of the predicate adjectives in these verses would  allow either, sometimes slightly tipped toward one or the other. It may seem that  the question is settled finally in verse 5, where we encounter the first noun—vā́jam
“prize”—in this sea of adjectives, since “prize” might seem a more likely synonym of  “wealth” than of Indra. However, in the rhetorical universe of the R̥gveda it would  certainly be possible to refer to a god as a prize. We think it highly likely that the  poet intended the audience to consider both possibilities throughout the sequence.
The last three verses (6–8) more conventionally state that praises are being  offered, to Br̥haspati (vs. 6) and to Indra (vss. 7–8), in return for favors.
1. We have grasped your right hand, Indra, seeking goods, you goods-lord  of goods,
for we know you as cow-lord of cows, o champion. – To us give bright,  bullish wealth.
2. Possessing good weapons, good help, good guidance, supporting four  seas worth of riches,
ever to be celebrated, praiseworthy, bringing abundant things of value.  – To us give bright, bullish wealth.
3. Accompanied by good sacred formulations, accompanied by the gods,  lofty, wide, deep, broad-based, o Indra,
accompanied by famous seers, powerful, vanquishing hostility. – To us  give bright, bullish wealth.
4. Winning prizes, having poets as heroes, overwhelming, gaining the stakes,  swelling with strength, of good skill,
Dasyu-smashing, stronghold-splitting—(above all) real, o Indra. – To us  give bright, bullish wealth.1454 X.48
5. Rich in horses, in chariots, in heroes, a thousandfold, hundredfold prize,  o Indra,
having beneficial troops, having poets as heroes, sun-winning. – To us  give bright, bullish wealth.
6. To the one with seven cows [/Saptagu], whose poetic vision is truth, to  Br̥haspati of good wisdom my thought goes forth,
to him, the Āṅgirasa, who is to be reverently approached with homage.  – To us give bright, bullish wealth.
7. My eager messengers, my praises, proceed to Indra, begging for favors, touching the heart, intertwining with the mind. – To us give bright,
bullish wealth.
8. What I beg you for, give that to us, Indra—a lofty dwelling place without  equal among the peoples.
Let Heaven and Earth applaud this. – To us give bright, bullish wealth.
The next three hymns (X.48–50) are both ascribed to and dedicated to Indra  Vaikuṇṭha. Given the supposed identity of poet and dedicand, the first two of these  are appropriately cast as Indra’s own self-praise.
## 48 (874) Indra Vaikuṇthạ
Indra Vaikuṇṭha
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7, 10–11
As noted immediately above, X.48 and 49 present themselves as Indra’s self-praise  (ātmastuti, on which see Thompson 1997). They are spoken in the 1st person, with  insistent 1st-person pronouns and verbs. In this hymn only verse 10 lacks an explicit  1st-person form, and the first verses especially establish the pattern: each pāda of  verse 1 begins with a 1st-person pronoun (ahám, ahám, mā́m, ahám), as does each  half-verse of verse 2 (ahám, ahám), and again, each pāda of verse 3 (máhyam, máyi,  máma, mā́m). (Of the 1st-person singular pronominal paradigm, only instrumental  máyā and ablative mát are absent from this hymn, and both are poorly attested in  the R̥gveda [three and twelve times respectively].)
The contents of the self-praise range over Indra’s many accomplishments, but  especially focus on his victories in battle and what he has won thereby—a warrior’s  boast, in other words. Some of the exploits are obscure, indeed mentioned only here  (e.g., vs. 8).
The only verse lacking 1st-person reference, verse 10, appears to be a riddle,  with a balanced opposition between the good or successful man (?), who has soma  within, and his opposite number, whose failure is exposed by his lack of soma. But  this interpretation must remain tentative, given the puzzles in that verse. 1. I was the foremost lord of goods. I win the stakes over and over.
Upon me do the creatures call, like kinfolk their father. I apportion
food to the pious man.
2. I am Indra, the bulwark and breast(-plate) of the Atharvan. For Trita  I begat the cows from the serpent.
I took the manliness from the Dasyus, through my abilities seeking to  win their cowpens for Dadhyañc and Mātariśvan.
3. For me Tvaṣṭar fashioned the metal mace. To me have the gods bent  their will.
My face, like that of the sun, is difficult to surpass. They recognize me  by what has been done and is to be done.
4. I (win) livestock in cows and horses, overflowing and golden, with my  weapon.
Many thousands do I “grind down” for the pious man, when the soma  drops accompanied by hymns have brought me to exhilaration.
5. I am Indra: only I have not had the stake won away, and never have  I given way to death.
Just when you are pressing soma, beg me for good things. You will not  suffer harm in partnership with me, o Pūrus.
6. I (struck down) by twos those, snorting heavily, who caused Indra and  his mace to fight (them);
I struck down with my stroke those who were challenging (me), while I,  unbowable, was talking tough to those to be bowed.
7. One against one here, I am the utter victor—and against two. What can  three do?
I strike against a multitude, like sheaves on a threshing floor. Do my  rivals, who have no Indra, scorn me?
8. I restored Atithigva to the Guṅgus like a restorative, and I upheld the  obstacle-overcomer among the clans,
when in the smashing of Parṇaya and in the smashing of Karañja, (as)  in the great smashing of Vr̥tra, I spread my fame.
9. Namī Sāpya came to the fore for me in order to enjoy restorative  refreshment, and in the quest for cows he made partnerships (with
me?) once again.
When I readied the arrow for him in the clashes, just then did I make  him one to be praised and hymned.
10. Soma is visible in the one, (even) when it is within (him); the herdsman  exposes the other by its absence.
Whoever tries to fight the sharp-horned bull remains bound within the  thick (fetter) of deception.
11. I, the god of gods, do not violate the ordinances of the Ādityas, Vasus,  and Rudriyas.
For auspicious power they have fashioned me—invincible,
indestructible, unconquerable.
1456 X.49
## 49 (875) Indra Vaikuṇthạ
Indra Vaikuṇṭha
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 2, 11
Like the preceding hymn (X.48), this is an ātmastuti or self-praise spoken by Indra,  with relentless repetition of 1st-person singular pronouns and verbs. For the for mer, note that of the twenty half-verses (excluding the final summary verse 11),  sixteen begin with ahám “I” and one with mā́m “me.” Only three (6c, 7c, and 10c)  lack such an initial pronoun, and 7c has the enclitic mā “me” in second position  (yán mā), while 10c begins with spārhám, a rhyme form to ahám.
As for verbs, the hymn is dominated by the injunctive, with nearly twenty such  forms. This morphological skewing contrasts with the patterns in the preceding  hymn, which has a wider range and more balanced selection of tenses and moods.  The reasons for the prominence of the injunctive are not clear to us and, somewhat  surprisingly, Hoffmann fails to treat this hymn systematically in his monograph on  that verbal form (Hoffmann 1967).
Like X.48 this hymn particularly celebrates Indra’s martial successes and the aid  he gave various mortal clients in subduing their enemies. Several of these vignettes  are little known, if at all, and others are quite obscurely phrased (e.g., vs. 3, though it  treats the well-known saga of Kutsa, Śuṣṇa, and, probably, Uśanā Kāvya; vs. 6). The  hymn also emphasizes, more than X.48, the importance of the sacrifice in strengthen
ing Indra and securing his help: verse 1 announces this theme quite clearly, and verses  4–7 treat the relationship between sacrificer and Indra as well, though not as clearly. The final verse (11) summarizes Indra’s own speech, before addressing him directly  and assuring him that the deeds he himself boasted of will also be praised by  singers.
1. I gave the foremost good to the singer. I made the sacred formulation a  strengthener for me.
I became the inciter of the sacrificer. I have vanquished the
non-sacrificers in every contest.
2. Upon me they conferred the name Indra among the gods—the creatures  of heaven and earth and of the waters.
I (took as my own) the two quick fallow bays, the bulls, who follow a  separate commandment; boldly I took the mace for power.
3. I pierced the cloak for the poet with my thrusts; I helped Kutsa with  this help:
I, as the piercer of Śuṣṇa, held the deadly weapon—I, who did not give  the Ārya name to the Dasyu.
4. I was like a father to the Vetasus for them to prevail; I made Tugra and  Smadibha subject to Kutsa.
I came to be under the direction of the sacrificer: when I brought myself  to the fore for Tuji, his dear things were not to be assailed. 5. I made Mr̥gaya subject to Śrutarvan, when he yielded to me when the  ritual patterns were in due order.
I made the vassal submissive for Āyu, and I made Paḍgr̥bhi subject
to Savya.
6. I am the one who (aided?) Navavāstva of the lofty chariots—I, the smasher  of Vr̥tra [/obstacles], shattered the Dāsa like obstacles [/Vr̥tras]—
when he [=Navavāstva] was causing (me) to grow strong and spread
out according to due ritual order. I made the realms of light on the
distant far shore of airy space.
7. I drive around with the swift (horses) of the Sun, being conveyed forth  in my might by the Etaśas.
When the soma-pressing of Manu says to me (that it [=soma] is) for my  raiment, I will sideline (even) the effective Dāsa with my thrusts.
8. I am the smasher of the seven, a greater Nahus than Nahus. I made  Turvaśa and Yadu to be famed through my power.
I put down the one, his might with my might; I strengthened the nine  and ninety (others) (to become) proud.
9. I, the bull, held fast the seven streams that were flowing and racing  upon the earth.
I of good resolve traverse the floods. Through fighting I found the way  for Manu to seek.
10. I held fast in them that which the god Tvaṣṭar never held fast in
them: the gleaming,
eagerly sought (milk) in the udders, in the bellies of the cows, the honey  of honey, the swelling soma, and its milk-mixture.
11. Thus in this way Indra sought to attract the gods and men to him; with  his stirring (action) he be(stirred them)—the bounteous one whose
generosity is real.
All these (deeds) of yours do the powerful ones sing, you able master of  the fallow bays, whose glory is your own.
## 50 (876) Indra Vaikuṇthạ
Indra Vaikuṇṭha
7 verses: jagatī 1–2, abhisāriṇī 3–4, triṣṭubh 5, jagatī 6–7
A much more conventional Indra hymn than the preceding two of this series (X.48– 49). Here Indra is praised in the context and at the occasion of a soma sacrifice, and  the usual reciprocal obligations of sacrificer and god are set forth.
1. Chant forth to the great one who finds exhilaration from the soma-stalk,  who is common to all men and is present to all,
to Indra, whose good-battling strength, great fame, and manliness the  two world-halves respect.
1458 X.51
2. And now he is praised by his comrade as manly and forceful: Indra is  worthy of celebration for a man like me.
Amid all the chariot-poles and at the getting of prizes, o master of
settlements, or at an obstacle [/Vr̥tra] or among the waters, you find
exhilaration, o champion.
3. Who are those men, Indra, who are for your refreshment, who will strive  to attain your favor as their traveling companion?
Who spur themselves on for your lordly prize; who (spur themselves on)  when waters, their own fields, or masculine power is at stake?
4. You will become great through our sacred formulation, Indra.
You will become the worthy recipient of the sacrifice at all the
soma-pressings.
You will become the stirring of men in every contest and the supreme  mantra, o you who are common to all domains.
5. Right now, as the superior one, help those eager for the sacrifice. The  peoples know your great succor and protection.
Right now, (so that) you will be unaging and you will make (us) strong,  we have made all these soma-pressings powerful, to draw (you) here.
6. We have made all these soma-pressings powerful, to draw (you) here— which you have (now) taken into your own self, o son of strength.
To your liking and for your support, are, in succession, the cup, the
sacrifice, the mantra, and the upraised sacred formulation and speech. 7. Those who craft sacred formulations for you when the soma is pressed,  for you to give of goods and of good, o inspired one,
through the thought of your favor they will go forward along the path,  at your exhilaration on the pressed soma-stalk.
The next three hymns (X.51–53), attributed to Agni Saucīka, treat the well-known  story of the flight and disappearance of Agni, who wished to avoid the ritual role  of conveying the oblations and the fate of his brothers. The gods find him hidden in  the waters and entice him back by promising him a share in the sacrifice.
## 51 (877) Dialogue between Agni and the Gods
Agni Saucīka
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The classic dialogue between Agni and the gods (or one or more gods: he addresses  Mitra and Varuṇa [vs.  2] and Varuṇa alone [vss. 4,  6]). Agni appears still to be  in the waters (or just emerged), and the gods have only recently discovered his  hiding place. The first question is which god spotted him (vss. 1–3). Agni then describes the fear that drove him from his sacrificial role, in responsive language  that defines an omphalos (vss. 4, 6, esp. 4a and 6c). In the omphalos verse (5) the  gods make the argument that Manu, a human and the first sacrificer, deserves to  have his sacrifice completed by Agni’s conveyance of the oblations. It is striking that  the gods, perhaps disingenuously, do not argue for their own deserving state. In the  last three verses (7–9) the gods propose rewards for Agni’s returning to his task, and  he accepts them.
1. [Gods:] Great was that caul and sturdy it was, enveloped in which you  entered the waters.
All your bodies in their multiple forms, o Agni Jātavedas, did a single  god see.
2. [Agni:] Who saw me? Which one was that god who fully saw my bodies in  their multiple forms?
Where indeed, o Mitra and Varuṇa, are all the kindling sticks of Agni  lying, which lead to the gods?
3. [Gods:] We sought you in multiple places, o Jātavedas, you who had  entered into the waters, into the plants, o Agni.
Yama espied you, o bright-beamed one, shining out farther than (a
distance) of ten stages.
4. [Agni:] I went in fear of the Hotarship, Varuṇa, lest the gods yoke  me to it.
My bodies settled down in multiple places. I, Agni, do not attend to this  business.
5. [Gods:] Come here! Manu, devoted to the gods, has desire for sacrifice,  having properly prepared it. Yet you dwell in darkness, Agni.
Make the paths leading to the gods easily passable. Convey the oblations,  showing your benevolence.
6. [Agni:] The brothers of Agni earlier kept rolling along after this business,  like a charioteer along the road.
In fear of this, Varuṇa, I went far away. I flinched from it like a buffalo  from the bowstring of an archer.
7. [Gods:] We will make a lifetime for you, which is free from old age, Agni,  so that yoked (to your task) you will not suffer harm, Jātavedas.
Then will you, showing your benevolence, convey their portion of the  oblation to the gods, o well-born one?
8. [Agni:] Give the fore-offerings and the after-offerings exclusively to me,  the nourishing portion of the oblation,
and the “ghee” of the waters and the “man” of the plants, and let there  be a long lifetime for Agni, o gods.
9. [Gods:] Yours be the fore-offerings and the after-offerings exclusively, the  nourishing portions of the oblation;
yours, Agni, be this whole sacrifice. To you let the four quarters bow.

## 52 (878) Address to the Gods from Agni
Agni Saucīka
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn logically follows the preceding one. Agni has agreed to accept the  Hotarship, which he had originally fled. He ceremonially requests guidance from  the gods about how to perform his new duties in verses 1–2.
The middle verse (3) seems not to be spoken by Agni, but rather by a mortal  attending or officiating at the sacrifice and catching sight of the newly installed  Agni. In the first half of the verse he expresses some anxiety about this fire’s con nection to Yama; at issue is the possible confusion between, or identity of, the  new ritual fire with the cremation fire, which conveys the dead to Yama’s realm.  (Similar anxiety is treated in the funeral hymns, especially X.16.) Reassurance  seems to be dispensed in the second half of the verse; it may be (following Lanman  1884: 388) that the daily rebirth is that of the Agnihotra fire, while the monthly  rebirth is for the Śrāddha, or ceremony in honor of the dead—allowing separation  of the two fires and their functions.
In verses 4–5 Agni quotes the gods’ words as they install him (4cd), and prom ises to fulfill his duties in exemplary fashion. The final verse (6) sums up the gods’  installation of Agni.
1. [Agni:] All you gods, instruct me how, chosen here as Hotar, I shall  conceive it [=task] upon being installed.
Proclaim to me how, by what path I shall convey your share, your
oblation to you.
2. [Agni:] I have sat down as the better sacrificing Hotar. All the gods, the  Maruts spur me on.
Every day, o Aśvins, the Adhvaryu-ship is yours. The kindling stick
becomes the Formulator; this is the poured offering for you two.
3. [Sacificer?:] This one here who is the Hotar—who is he to Yama? Whom  am I calling upon when the gods anoint (him)?
Every day he is born, every month. And so the gods have installed him  as conveyor of the oblation.
4. [Agni:] The gods have installed me as conveyor of the oblation—I who  had slipped away, undergoing many troubles:
“Agni, the knowing one, will arrange the sacrifice for us, with its five
courses, three turns, seven threads.”
5. [Agni:] Through sacrifice I will win you immortality rich in heroes, so  that I can make wide space for you, o gods.
Might I place the mace in Indra’s arms. Then he will win all these battles. 6. [Poet:] Three hundred, three thousand, and thirty-nine gods revered Agni. They sprinkled him with ghee; they strewed the ritual grass for him. Just  after that they installed him as Hotar. X.53 (879) Agni [“Opferlied”]
Agni Saucīka
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6–7, 9–11
This hymn begins from the situation depicted in the last two hymns, but turns into a  mystical meditation on the sacrifice. The first three verses are apparently spoken by  mortal sacrificers, who have installed the recovered Agni as Hotar and are pleased  (vs. 3) with the resulting success of their sacrifice.
In verses 4–5 Agni responds, inviting both gods and men to take pleasure in his  application to this ritual role. Verse 4 also contains one of the few R̥gvedic refer ences to the enmity between the gods (Devas) and the Asuras. Although this persis tent rivalry dominates middle Vedic mythology, it only begins, very tentatively, to  appear in the late R̥gveda, to which period this hymn belongs.
The next three verses (6–8) are again the speech of human priests, addressed  both to Agni and to fellow celebrants, urging them to carry on the ritual work. In  verse 7 the sacrifice, as often, is metaphorically identified with a chariot, and the  puzzling beginning of verse 8 may refer metaphorically to a river crossing, taking  the sacrificers to a better state.
The most enigmatic verses of the hymn are the last three (9–11), in jagatī meter  (as opposed to the prevalent, but not ubiquitous triṣṭubh). They begin with the god  Tvaṣṭar, the “Fashioner” of the gods: he has fashioned drinking cups for the gods,  and now sharpens a hatchet for Brahmaṇaspati to use. Since Brahmaṇaspati has  a transparent name, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” he is almost surely going  to use the hatchet to hew a sacred formulation, the mystical verbal embodiment  of cosmic truth. In verse 10 the poets are urged to use the same types of tools,  presumably to fashion the same things: sacred formulations. Or, in another com mon metaphor, to create “hidden tracks” (that is, mystical verbal compositions).  Verse 11 may be an example of such a hidden track: it is certainly impenetrable  enough, with riddling and paradoxical images that several millennia of study have  not solved.
1. The one whom we sought with our mind, this one has come here just  now, knowing the sacrifice, attentive to its articulation.
He will perform sacrifice for us in the divine assemblage as superior
sacrificer, for he will sit down (as Hotar) close by, in front of us.
2. He has been realized as Hotar, as superior sacrificer by his installation.  Since he watches over the well-placed pleasurable offerings,
we shall sacrifice to the gods deserving the sacrifice—yes! We will
reverently salute those worthy of salutation with ghee.
3. He has made our pursuit of the gods successful today. We found the  tongue of the sacrifice in hiding.
He has come here, sweet smelling, clothing himself in life. He has made  our invocation of the gods fortunate today.
1462 X.54
4. [Agni:] Might I today devise this as the foremost of speech, by which we  gods will overcome the Asuras.
You nourishment eaters and you worthy of the sacrifice, you five
peoples, take pleasure in my Hotarship.
5. [Agni:] Let the five peoples take pleasure in my Hotarship—and the  cow-born and those who are worthy of the sacrifice.
Let Earth protect us from earthly constraint; let the Midspace protect  us from heavenly (constraint).
6. Stretching the thread (of the sacrifice), (o Agni,) go following the  radiance of the airy realm. Protect the paths of light made by
insightful thought.
(You priests,) weave a work without knots for the ever-praising ones.  Become Manu, (o Agni). Generate the divine race.
7. Bind the axle-straps, you comrades in soma [=priests], and set the reins  in order, and ornament (the chariot).
Drive the eight-seated chariot all about, the one with which the gods  led a dear thing to (us?).
8. The stony (stream) is flowing. Pull yourselves together! Stand up!  Advance, comrades!
There let us leave behind those who were unfriendly. Might we cross
over and upward to friendly ones, to prizes.
9. Tvaṣṭar knew (his own) magic powers, as the best worker of workers,  bearing the cups, the most beneficial drinking vessels of the gods.
Now he sharpens the hatchet of good metal, with which the “(chariot-) steed,” Brahmaṇaspati, will hew.
10. Now, poets, sharpen up (the hatchets) that are (here), the axes with  which you carve for the immortal.
As knowing ones, create hidden tracks, (like the track) by which the
gods achieved immortality.
11. They have placed the “maiden” in the embryo [=Agni?], have placed the  “calf” in his mouth, with cryptic mind and tongue.
He, always benevolent, eager to gain, with the yoking strings wins the  victory just at the decisive moment.
The next three hymns (54–56) are attributed to Br̥haduktha Vāmadevya.
## 54 (880) Indra
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This short hymn begins by announcing (somewhat cryptically) that Indra’s fame or  reputation is what prompted a frantic call on him from Heaven and Earth (vs. 1cd), and it ends (6cd) with the poet’s summation of his own praise hymn. In between  there is both standard praise of Indra’s well-known deeds (e.g., vss. 1cd, 3)  and  more ambiguously phrased assessment of his accomplishments. In verse 2bc, for  example, Indra’s victories seem almost dismissively characterized as a magic trick  (māyā́, the word later famously used of the “illusion” of reality) produced by his  own boasts. The four names of Indra in verse 4 are presumably his famous epi
thets, such as vr̥trahán “Vr̥tra-smasher,” but the poet also seems to be slyly implying  that Indra’s deeds are reducible to words. These deprecatory hints are slight and  could be otherwise interpreted, but in any case the poet has avoided a conventional  recital of Indra’s exploits. Instead he seems to be saying that Indra’s great deeds  and the words that express them are essentially the same: his reputation is equiva
lent to himself (vs. 1ab); his own proclamation of his powers is taken by the world  as identical to “battles” (vs. 2); his epithets are the power that produces his deeds  (vs. 4). Although this poetic ploy is, in one sense, the usual message that mortals’  praises strengthen Indra for his deeds, the poet here seems to be claiming something  more: that the poet’s formulations are Indra’s essence.
In the very last pāda of the hymn the poet seems to be doing something simi lar with his own name Br̥haduktha (“having/producing lofty speech”), as Jesse  Lundquist has suggested to me (personal communication). The pāda (6d) reads  brahmakŕ̥to br̥hádukthād avāci (“...has been spoken...from Br̥haduktha, the crafter  of sacred formulations”), with his name positioned between the other two words in  the line. The first half of his name, br̥hát, is a close phonological match to the first  half of the first word, brahma “sacred formulation”; the last half of his name, uktha “(solemn) speech,” is etymologically related to the verb avāci. Thus his very name  can be, as it were, transformed into the verbal products that are his reason for being.
1. It was to your reputation in its greatness, o bounteous one, that the two  frightened world-halves called upon you.
You furthered the gods, you overcame the Dāsa might, as you did your  best for the other progeny, Indra.
2. When you roamed, having grown strong in body, proclaiming your own  powers among the peoples, o Indra,
that was just your magic trick, which they call battles: neither today nor  before have you discovered a rival.
3. What seers before us have reached the end of your whole greatness, in that you begot your mother and father [=Heaven and Earth] at the  same time from your own body?
4. There exist four lordly names for you, the unfalsifiable names of the  buffalo.
You surely know all these, through which you have done your deeds, o  bounteous one.
5. You have made those good things yours alone, both those in the open  and those that are hidden.
Do not pass over my desire, bounteous one: you are the one who takes  heed and gives, Indra,1464 X.55
6. Who placed light within the light, who joined the honeys with the honey. So, a dear fortifying thought has been spoken to Indra from
Br̥haduktha, the crafter of sacred formulations.
## 55 (881) Indra [or the All Gods?]
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
A puzzling and enigmatic hymn, with close ties to the previous hymn, especially  at the beginning. The first puzzle is that this, the second of the three Br̥haduktha  hymns (X.54–56), is assigned Indra as its deity in the Anukramaṇī, but is longer  (eight verses) than the previous hymn (X.54, six verses), which is also dedicated to  Indra. Bergaigne (per Oldenberg 1888: 226) suggests that the ascription is incor
rect, and that this is really an All God hymn, as is the next one (X.56, seven verses).  Although Oldenberg rejected this suggestion (1888: 238–39) on grounds of content,  we are inclined to accept it. Although Indra is the clear or likely deity of most of  the verses (1–3, 7–8), the center part of the hymn (vss. 4–6) is not, in our view,  Indraic. Moreover, the numerology (see esp. vss. 2–3, 5) and the riddling phraseol
ogy throughout, without expressed referents, are quite reminiscent of a certain type  of speculative All God hymn.
The first verse of the hymn exactly matches that of X.54 in structure (with X.55.1  somewhat clearer syntactically), and their second pādas are almost identical. Both  concern the call that Heaven and Earth issued to Indra in fright, and go on, in the  second hemistich, to recount other of Indra’s deeds. And this verse also takes up the  theme of the “hidden name” found also in X.54.4. But already in X.55.1 we meet an  unidentified referent: “the sons of your (or a?) brother,” especially puzzling because,  as far as we know, Indra has no brother.
The name theme continues in verse 2, but introduces a light, into which five  unidentified dear ones merge. Nothing further is made of this merger, but the same  lexeme “merge into” (sáṃ √viś) is used in the next hymn (X.55.1) for the merger of  the body of the dead with light in some unspecified distant place, and it seems likely  that our passage touches on the same theme of death and transfiguration. Though  verse 3 begins with a conventional deed of Indra, filling the world-halves, it pursues  both the numerology of verse 2 and the light, now both fragmented and unified.  Although various identifications of the referents here have been proposed, none is  entirely convincing; moreover, the poet seems more interested in keeping us guess ing than in providing a clear roadmap.
What does seem clear is that the cosmic context of Heaven and Earth and the focus  on light(s) have led us to astronomical imagery, which occupies the next three verses  of the hymn. We begin (vs. 4) with Dawn, explicitly identified, and celebrated in a for mulaic final pāda that is modeled on the refrain of a famous mystical All God hymn, III.55, where the “one and only lordship” is that of the gods. The next verse (5) has  no identified referents at all, and the language is difficult and cryptic. Nonetheless it  seems to refer to the moon traveling among the stars, until swallowed up by a gray  one—perhaps the gray twilight of dawn or the smoke of the ritual fire kindled at  dawn. The poet seems to recognize the hyper-“poetic” quality of this description (5c)  and provides a simply phrased (though not simply interpreted) gloss in pāda d. Verse  6 is most easily interpretable as referring to the sun, who is called a “ruddy eagle”  elsewhere in the R̥gveda, but it could also be Agni or Indra; if the latter, it provides a  transition to the final two verses (7–8), which belong more clearly to Indra.
1. Far away in the distance is that hidden name which the two, frightened,  called you, to grant them vigor.
You propped up Earth and Heaven at the critical moment, when you  were sparking the sons of your brother, bounteous one.
2. Great is that hidden, much-coveted name by which you begat what has  been and by which (you will beget) what is to be.
The light born of old that is his—that dear light do the five dear ones  merge into.
3. He filled the two world-halves and their middle. The five (groups of) gods  in their proper sequence, seven by seven,
does he survey with the thirty-four (lights) in their multiplicity,
(which are one) light having a single form but following various
commandments.
4. In that, o Dawn, you dawned as the foremost of the radiant ones,  because you begat the thriving of the thriving,
in that you have nearer kinship with the more distant (Dawn)—great is  the one and only lordship of great (Dawn).
5. The solitary (moon?) running in the crowd of many (stars?)—though he  was young, the gray one swallowed him—
behold the poetic skill of the god in his greatness. (In simple language:)  today he died; yesterday he was (still) utterly breathing.
6. Through his power he is the powerful, ruddy eagle, who, as the nestless  champion from of old, (has power) over the great.
What he perceives, that is truly real, not false. He is both the winner and  the giver of the eagerly sought good.
7. He acquired his bullish manly powers through these, through whom the  mace-bearer grew strong for the Vr̥tra-smashing,
the gods who, because of the greatness of the deed being done, came  into being without (their own) doing.
8. Giving rise to his deeds with (them as his?) yokemate, he who possesses all  might and all mind, the smiter of taunts, the overcomer of the powerful, having drunk of the soma, having grown strong, the champion blew the  Dasyus forth from heaven in battle.
1466 X.56
## 56 (881) All Gods
Brhaduktha V ̥ āmadevya
7 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, 7; jagatī 4–6
Traditionally this hymn was interpreted as Br̥haduktha’s funeral hymn for his son  Vājin (the name extracted from vājín- “prizewinner” in vss. 2–3). More recently it  has been taken as the funeral hymn for a horse, either the horse sacrificed in the  Aśvamedha (Oldenberg) or simply a particularly distinguished racehorse (Geldner).  We find all these interpretations unduly restrictive. Though it is undoubtedly a funeral  hymn, or, to be more general, undoubtedly refers to what happens after death, there  are no particularly equine features in it, since vājín can be used of humans and gods  as well as horses. Nor is there any trace of the personal grief a poet might express for  his son. Instead the hymn has taken some of the cosmic speculation of the last hymn  (esp. X.55.2) and directed it to the more focused topic of the afterlife.
The first two verses urge the dead to merge his body with a light in an unspeci fied but very distant place, presumably even beyond heavenly lights like the sun, but  associated with the gods. This merger is considered a kind of birth (see vs. 1d). The  distance traveled on this good journey is treated in verse 3.
The meter changes in the next three verses (4–6) and so, to some extent, does  the topic. Verse 4 is quite unclear and quite disputed, in part because the ref erent of the pronoun “their” (eṣām) is not specified. In our opinion the verse  asserts that the ancestors (“forefathers”) do not control the fate of the recently  dead: “their” greatness (i.e., that of the recently dead) is not in the power of their  predecessors, the ancestors (4a); rather, the gods transfer the mental spirit of the  dead to the realm of the gods (4b), where they, the dead, incorporate animating  motion (4c) and re-enter their bodies (4d). In other words, the verse is an attempt  to describe the mechanism whereby the dead regain their bodies, joining mental  power with physical activity within the envelope of the old body. As such, it is  more detailed than the simple, reassuring command to the dead in the funeral  hymn X.14.8 “Unite with your body in your full luster,” which gives no directions  as to how to go about it.
The happy result of this heavenly reincarnation is expressed in the first half of  verse 5, but in the second half a more certain, because more visible, means to life  after death is depicted—the familiar one of extending one’s own life in the lives of  one’s progeny. This R̥gvedic truism is, in our view, developed in the following very  difficult verse (6) in two complementary ways. On the one hand, sons can make their  “lord” (in our view, their father) into a “finder of the sun”—here we take “sun” to  be equivalent to the light in verse 1, with which the dead are to merge—in two ways.  The father can merge with the highest light by being provided with a proper funeral,  and he can have further life on earth, continue to see the sun, as it were, by being  propagated in his children and grandchildren. Viewed from the opposite direction,  the forefathers, already in the heavenly afterlife, established their paternal dominion  by placing descendants in later generations. The final verse, returning to triṣṭubh meter, simply sums up in simpler language  Br̥haduktha’s understanding of this process. For a more detailed interpretation of  this hymn as a funeral hymn, see Brereton (forthcoming a).
1. Here is one (light) of yours, and far away is another one. Merge with the  third light.
At the merging of your body, be one cherished and dear to the gods at  this highest means of begetting.
2. Let your body, o prizewinner, leading the body, establish a thing of value  for us and protection for you.
Unswerving, in order to uphold the great gods, you should exchange  your own light as if for the light in heaven.
3. You are the prizewinner with a winning spirit. You are well gone to  the (dawns?), the good trackers, well gone to the praise, well gone to  heaven,
well gone according to the foremost foundations that hold true, well  gone to the gods, well gone along your flight.
4. Even the forefathers are not masters of their greatness. The gods placed  their mental force among the gods,
and they enveloped those things that were in vibrant motion. They
entered into their bodies again.
5. With their powers they strode around the whole airy realm, measuring  the ancient, unmeasurable domains.
All living beings are held down within their bodies, but they have
extended themselves multiply through their offspring.
6. Sons set up their lord [=father] as a finder of the sun in two ways by a  third action.
And their forefathers have established their own offspring as their
paternal power, as their “stretched thread” among the later
generations.
7. As if with a boat across the swell through all the earth’s directions,  (having gone) beyond the difficult places with blessings,
Br̥haduktha by his greatness has placed his own offspring both among  later ones and among those previous.
After the sequence of hymn trios beginning with X.39, the next group (57–60), of  four hymns, seems out of place, but Oldenberg (1888: 236) suggests that the whole  has been arbitrarily divided into four hymns and could conceivably be resolved into  three. The hymns share a theme—that of healing and returning to life—and are  ascribed to “the four Gaupāyanas.” Perhaps the division into four hymns was sug
gested by the four supposed authors.
1468 X.57–58
## 57 (883) All Gods
Bandhu, Subandhu, Śrutabandhu, and Viprabandhu, the four Gaupāyanas or  Laupāyanas
6 verses: gāyatrī
On its surface this hymn contains a simple revivifying spell seeking the return of  “mind” to a person or persons in some distress—prefaced by two verses seeking to  avoid ritual wrongdoing and to attain the help of Agni. This hymn is closely linked  with X.58, a patterned litany calling for the return of mind. In both, “mind” has a  broader semantic range than it generally does in English, encompassing not merely  thought and mental processes, but what we might want to term “spirit.”
Traditionally this hymn and the following three (X.57–60) are considered the  poetic representations of an itihāsa (traditional explanatory story) concerning the  king Asamāti, who dismissed his purohitas (house-priests), the four Gaupāyanas  (supposedly the poets of these very hymns), and hired several Asuras instead. The  latter deprived one of the Gaupāyanas, Subandhu, of his life, and in this hymn the  three remaining brothers call his mind to return. The anachronistic details in this  story—the king’s house-priest, the evil nature of Asuras—mark it as a secondary  confection, invented for or adapted to hymns composed for other purposes.
1. Let us not depart from the path, nor from the sacrifice of the one who  has soma, Indra.
Let hostilities not stand between us.
2. He who assures the success of the sacrifice, who is the thread stretched to  the gods,
him [=Agni], bepoured, might we attain.
3. We now call mind hither, with soma dedicated to Naraśaṃsa
and with the composed thoughts of our forefathers.
4. Let your mind come here again, for will, for skill, for life,
and to see the sun for a long time.
5. O fathers, let the divine race give us mind again.
May we keep company with the troop of the living.
6. Under your commandment, o Soma, bearing mind in our bodies,
may we, along with our offspring, keep company with it.
## 58 (884) The Return of Mind (Manaāvartaṇam)
The four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas (as for X.57)
12 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn is a continuation of X.57, the spell to bring the return of “mind” to  a dead or dying person. But the monotonous patterned repetition in this piece contrasts with the varied ways in which X.57 seeks the return of mind. In fact, we  might consider this the performative verbal material, the incantation itself, referred  to in X.57.3 “we now call mind hither.”
The structure is simple: each verse envisions a distant location where mind may  have gone, and calls for it to return from that place. The first verse is perhaps the  most crucial, for Yama is the ruler of the dead, and if mind has gone there, the  person in question has presumably died. Yama’s realm is also probably alluded to  in the middle verse (6): the first verse of the Yama hymn, the first funeral hymn  (X.14.1), refers to Yama as the one “who has departed along the great slopes,”  using the same word, pravát, as here. The other destinations are generally features  of heaven or of earth; the range seems like an elaborated version of the disposi tion of the body and its parts in the funeral verse X.16.3 “Let your eye go to the  sun, your life-breath to the wind. Go to heaven and to earth as is fitting. Or go to  the waters, if it has been fixed for you there. Take your stand in the plants with  your limbs,” and it is also reminiscent of similar dispositions of the body in the  Upaniṣads.
1. If your mind has gone to Yama Vaivasvata far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
2. If your mind has gone to heaven, if to earth far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
3. If your mind has gone to the four-cornered land far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
4. If your mind has gone to the four quarters far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
5. If your mind has gone to the flooding sea far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
6. If your mind has gone to the light-beams, the sloping paths (to Yama)  far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
7. If your mind has gone to the waters, if to the plants far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
8. If your mind has gone to the sun, if to the dawn far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
9. If your mind has gone to the lofty mountains far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
10. If your mind has gone to this whole moving world far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
11. If your mind has gone to the distant distances far away,
we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.
12. If your mind has gone to what has been and what will be far away, we will make it turn hither to you, here to live and dwell.

Assorted Divinities (7), Heaven and Earth (8–10), or Indra (10a)
The four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas (as for X.57)
10 verses: triṣtubh, except paṅkti 8, mahāpaṅkti 9, paṅktyuttarā 10
Although the themes in this hymn conform to the healing and restorative tone of  the other Gaupāyana hymns, neither the structure of the hymn nor the particular  application of the verses is entirely clear. Geldner treats it as a unified composition,  with verses 1–3 and 8–10 wishing long life and health to Subandhu, and the middle  verses 4–7 extending these wishes to other beings.
But structural considerations call this view into question. For one thing, Subandhu  is mentioned only in the last part of the hymn (vs. 8), not the first. Moreover, the first  four verses are marked by an apotropaic refrain addressed to Nirr̥ti “Dissolution”  and should be considered as a group. The first of these verses does concern the resto
ration or lengthening of the lifetime of an unnamed person, compared to the Aśvins’  mythical restoration to youth of Cyavāna; the last of the verses (4) is a conventional  prayer to avoid death and attain old age. The two middle verses (2–3) lie further from  the theme of restored life, treating success in sacrifice (2) and in combat (3).
The next two verses (5–6) are addressed to Asunīti “the leader to (the other) life,”  a word found also in the funeral hymns (X.12.4, 15.14, 16.2), calling for the resto ration not only of mind (vs. 5a), the concern of X.57–58, but also of other senses  and powers. The following verse (7), in the same meter, invokes other gods to join  in this restoration.
The final three verses (8–10) are in different, but related meters (variants of  paṅkti, assemblages of eight-syllable lines), and share a three-pāda refrain. The  first two (8–9) call on Heaven and Earth to provide remedies and remove mala dies; the last (10), outside of its refrain, is completely opaque: Indra is asked to  “restore the ...ox that drew the wedding-cart of Uśīnarāṇī,” a female figure appear ing nowhere else in the R̥gveda, or indeed in Sanskrit (though the masculine uśīnara is found as the name of a people in middle Vedic and later) and whose relevance  here cannot be fathomed—efforts to do so only demonstrating the ingenuity, but  not necessarily the good sense, of the scholars who proposed them.
1. His lifetime has been extended further anew, as the two mounters of  the chariot [=Aśvins] (extended) the lifetime (of Cyavāna) with their  resolute (power/speech).
And then (like) Cyavāna he applies his force to his task. – Let
Dissolution move herself farther away.
2. When the sāman (is sung), for wealth we shall equip ourselves with food  affording treasures (of honey) and with measures of fame in quantity. Let the singer rejoice in all these of ours. – Let Dissolution move herself  farther away. 3. May we surmount (the manly powers) of the stranger with our manly  powers, as Heaven does Earth, as the mountains the plains.
The singer perceives all these of ours. – Let Dissolution move herself  farther away.
4. Do not hand us over to death, Soma. May we now look upon the sun as  it rises.

## 60 (886) Asamāti (1–4, 6), Indra (5), Spell to Heal Subandhu  (7–11), Praise of the Hand (12)
The four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas (as for X.57)
12 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–5, anuṣṭubh 6–7, paṅkti 8–9, anuṣṭubh 10–12
Another hymn that invites decomposition. The first six verses are a sort of praśasti  or royal encomium of Asamāti; indeed, the first four form a single sentence. There
1472 X.60
is no obvious connection to the themes of healing and restoration to life found in  the other Gaupāyana hymns, and one can see how the lack of thematic integration  invited the explanatory itihāsa (see introduction to X.57) that provides a tale relat ing King Asamāti to the suffering Subandhu.
The second part of the hymn (vss. 7–12) is a spell to heal Subandhu and restore  his mind. It first recalls him to life (vs. 7), then provides models from the constructed  and natural worlds (vss. 8 and 9 respectively) for securing Subandhu’s mind within  him. The return of his mind is announced in verse 10, while his sickness is banished  in verse 11, again with models from the natural world. Finally the healing hand is  praised in verse 12. Thus, this final segment of the Gaupāyana collection returns us  to the first two hymns, X.57–58, and their concentration on the return of the mind  of a sick person. Note especially that the first verse of X.58, which envisions the  departure of his mind to Yama Vaivasvata in the realm of the dead, is triumphantly  completed here by verse 10, “I have brought the mind of Subandhu here from Yama  Vaivasvata.”
1. To the man of the Māhīnas, with glittering appearance, approached  with praise,
we have come, bearing homage—
2. To Asamāti [/the incomparable], the lavishly overflowing, glittering,  downward coursing chariot,
master of settlements of Bhajeratha,
3. Who dominated the peoples like buffaloes, both those with metal  weapons
and those without, in battle,
4. Under whose commandment Ikṣvāku, the wealthy possessor of
grain-stores, is radiant
like (the sun) in heaven, (as are) the five peoples.
5. O Indra, uphold the lordly powers in the Asamātis, the Rathaproṣṭhas, to be seen like the sun in heaven.
6. For the descendants of Agastya you yoke a ruddy paired team.
You have trodden down the niggards, trodden on all the ungenerous
ones, o king.
7. Here is the mother, here the father; here a means of life will come.
Here is a way to slither forth for you. Subandhu, come here, come out! 8. Just as they tie a yoke with a strap to make it fast,
even so does he hold fast your mind, for living, not for death, but for  invulnerability.
9. Just as this great earth holds fast these trees here,
even so does he hold fast your mind, for living, not for death, but for  invulnerability.
10. I brought the mind of Subandhu here from Yama Vaivasvata,
for living, not for death, but for invulnerability. 11. Downward does the wind blow; downward the sun gives heat.
The cow gives milk that goes downward; downward let your malady go. 12. Here is my hand that brings good fortune; here is my (other hand)  bringing better fortune.
Here is my all-healing one; here the one of propitious touch.
The next twenty-four hymns, X.61–84, are paired hymns, generally attributed to the  same poet and showing signs of internal connection.
The first pair (61–62) are the Nābhānediṣṭha hymns to the All Gods, the first  devilishly complex, the second far less so.
## 61 (887) All Gods
Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava
27 verses: triṣṭubh
The near impenetrability of this hymn with all its poetic tricks and semantic eva sions produces a certain despair in the translator, and it is no wonder that even  sensible and thoughtful interpreters have clearly gone astray—as, no doubt, have  the present ones. Much of what follows is tentative and provisional, but we have  attempted to give an interpretation that is internally consistent and depends as little  as possible on outside and post-R̥gvedic materials.
This hymn and the next one are attributed by the Anukramaṇī to Nābhānediṣṭha  Mānava. Although the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa contains a story about Nābhānediṣṭha  (AiB V.14), it is generally agreed that this later tale has little to do with this hymn  and cannot explain its mysteries. We would go further and suggest that the sup
posed poet’s name has simply been extracted from verse 18, where it is, in our view,  the name or epithet of a different participant. We are inclined to ascribe the hymn  rather to Kakṣīvant, the crafty poet of I.116–126, or a descendant or would-be  epigone of his: Kakṣīvant is mentioned in verse 16, and the hymn has certain con
nections with Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre, especially I.121.
The hymn consists of several different sections, but we believe that these are all  linked through the dawn sacrifice and the participants therein, particularly Dawn  herself, Agni, the Aśvins, and Indra. Two mythological sections treat different  myths about Dawn, and these are sandwiched between sections apparently depict
ing and meditating upon an early-morning sacrifice and the dakṣiṇās, or priestly  gifts, distributed there.
The first four verses concern a man called Tūrvayāṇa, who in a verbal contest  produces a supremely effective verbal formulation, which brings the Aśvins to the  sacrifice and which also prompts liberal gifts to himself and which rescues or oth erwise provides help to his parents and priests. His effective speech is contrasted  with that of Cyavāna (a client of the Aśvins in other circumstances), who produces1474 X.61
only “sweet dregs” (vs. 2), while Tūrvayāṇa’s speech is likened to gushing semen. His  invocation to the Aśvins is given verbatim in verse 4.
The next four verses treat the shocking story of Heaven’s incest with his daughter,  Dawn. This is a favorite myth of the middle Vedic period (see Jamison 1991: 294– 96), but nowhere is it as graphically, if fragmentarily, treated as it is here. She finally  escapes (vs. 8), but before this happens, some of his semen is spilled on the ground  (vs. 7), indeed on the ritual ground (vs. 6). From this semen the ritual fire is fash ioned (vss. 7 and 9). Thus, though the rape of Heaven’s daughter is depicted as  brutal, it results in the creation of the central ritual substance—as so often, around  the world, in myths of cosmic rape and incest the taboo sexual encounter is primally  creative. It seems likely that the comparison of Tūrvayāṇa’s verbal production with  semen, in conjunction with the overall theme of dawn sacrifice, prompted the telling  of this story in just this place.
Verse 9 and the birth of fire form the transition to the next mythological sec tion, the freeing of Dawn from the Vala cave by the Aṅgirases and Navagvas (vss.  9–13). Verses 9–11 all begin “right away” (makṣū́). As noted, verse 9 treats the newly  created fire. In verse 10 (at least in our reading of it) the Navagvas attempt to free  Dawn from her “protector,” the Vala cave. In verse 11 the mythic motifs of the  Dawn cow and her milk and of Agni, the product of Heaven’s semen, are brought  together—the motifs that are sacrificially found together in the dawn sacrifice. The  Aṅgiras story is continued in the two following verses (12–13), though the dramatic  high point has already been reached.
The subject changes abruptly with the next verses (14–15), back to the ritual  fire and the sacrifice to which the Aśvins will come. There then follows a section  that has led many commentators (see especially Oldenberg and Geldner) to con struct elaborate family trees and “back-stories” for the poet, who is supposed to  be seeking either a new, adoptive father (Geldner) or a new varṇa (Oldenberg). In  our view these ingenious constructions are unnecessary and misguided. Instead  the poet, perhaps Kakṣīvant (16c), is presenting his patron with what appears  at first to be a praśasti, an encomium, but which then gently mocks him for  his pretentions and for perceived stinginess. Verse 16 is a fine straightforward  piece of praise, attributing grand titles and qualities to the king, in our view the  poet’s patron. Verse 17 is more equivocal. The king, the sacrificer, is “of two lin
eages”: this is the term that provoked the family-tree constructions of Oldenberg  and Geldner. We think rather that the poet is suggesting that the king is kin to  both the human and divine races—or that the king so believes (see the next verse).  But the poet also says that the king ought to milk the cow that yields sap but  does not give birth—which may be an allusion to the king’s slowness to produce  dakṣiṇās for his poet, who points out in the second half of the verse that he him
self is doing his job in producing poetry. Verse 18 seems to us to embody the  pretensions of the patron-king. His name or epithet is Nābhānediṣṭha, “nearest to  the navel”: “navel” is a standard metaphor for origin and close kinship (especially  the point of origin of two disparate groups), as well as for the focal point of the sacrifice or indeed the world itself. (This epithet must be very old, as the same  word is found in Younger Avestan nabānazdišta “closely related, next of kin.”)  And in the second half of the verse he wonders aloud how high his “navel” is,  relative to an unidentified other, then boasts of the unbroken chain of generations  that links him to the original navel. He gets his comeuppance in the next verse  (19), where the god Agni lays claim to the real navel, the gods, the two births, and  the cow and her products.
With the patron put in his place, the hymn now turns to a depiction of the  dawn sacrifice, or rather its conclusion, in five verses (20–24), each beginning with  the word ádha “(and) now.” The dakṣiṇās are now properly given (see 21ab), and  the poet therefore calls on the gods for honor and protection for the patrons (vss.  22–23). In the final verse of this sequence (24) the poet and his colleagues appear  to be poised to express their final prayers (24b), prayers found in the final verse  (27). In between are two verses (25–26) that ascribe “good lineage” to an unidenti
fied subject, who both takes pleasure in a praise hymn and performs ritual service.  The “good lineage” reminds us of the patron’s claims to distinguished kinship  earlier in the hymn, which were trumped by the god Agni. In these two verses we  believe that the poet deliberately left the subject unidentified and that he meant  the verses to be read with both Agni and himself (the poet) as potential subjects,  thus associating himself with the fine family and divine relations that the patron  craved.
Needless to say, this is a very speculative reading of the poem, and many details  remain unaccounted for. It is to be hoped that further progress can be made in its  interpretation, within a R̥gvedic context.
1. Here is a Rudrian formulation right to the point, (which) he whose  speech is welcome (produced) with his mental force at a contest
in skill,
(a formulation) that, standing ready for liberality, will effectively guide  across his two parents and, on the fifth [?] day, the seven Hotars.
2. Just he, as the winner (at the contest), (stands ready) for the man who  can be outwitted to give: Cyavāna measured out his altar with “sweet”  (dregs),
but Tūrvayāṇa, whose speech is the most welcome, poured enduring  semen like a gush—
3. (Tūrvayāṇa)—to whose invocations you two [=Aśvins] run and win  inspired words, (produced) by his skill, that are like sharp thinking,
he who, powerfully manly, with arrows in his hand, brought his aim to  fulfillment.
4. “When black (Night) is sitting among the ruddy cows (of Dawn), o  Aśvins, I call upon you two, the sons of heaven.
Pursue my sacrifice, come here to my food, like winners to refreshment,  as the two of whom no deception can be remembered.”
1476 X.61
5. He whose (penis,) which performs the virile work, stretched out,  discharging (the semen)—(that one,) the manly one, then pulled away  (his penis, which had been) “attending on” (her).
Again he tears out from the maiden, his daughter, what had been  “brought to bear” on her—he the unassailable.
6. When what was to be done was at its middle, at the encounter when the  father was making love to the young girl—
as they were going apart, the two left behind a little semen sprinkled  down on the back and in the womb of the well-performed (sacrifice). 7. When the father “sprang on” his own daughter, he, uniting (with her),  poured down his semen upon the earth.
The gods, very concerned, begat the sacred formulation, and they  fashioned out (of it?) the Lord of the Dwelling Place, protector of  commandments.
8. Like a bull in a contest he threw off foam. Heedless, she went away,  hither and yon.
Twisting away, she hastened like the Gift-Cow on foot. [The father:]  “Now those caresses of mine have not grasped (her).”
9. Right away, like a chariot-horse (came) the trampling of the offspring  [=Agni], and he took his seat at the udder, as one naked in the cold  takes a seat close to the fire.
He gained the kindling wood and he gained the prize; he was born as  the upholder, ever doing battle with his strength.
10. Right away the Navagvas came to the fellowship of the maiden  [=Dawn] and, speaking the truth, to the yoking of truth.
Those who approached the protector [=Vala?] of doubly exalted  (Dawn?), though they lacked the Gift-Cow, strove to milk the
immovable ones [=Vala rocks?].
11. Right away they hastened anew to the fellowship of the maiden and to  the semen, which was like a bounty, which is just truth—
your blazing legacy, which they gained through sacrifice, and the milk  of the ruddy female who gives sap as milk.
12. When afterward they became aware of their separation from the  livestock, he [=Br̥haspati or Indra] speaks thus, while bestowing  (gifts) at the speaking:
“Through the goodness of the good one, the bards are blameless. He  exerts control over all movable property, all the way up to cattle.” 13. They came just then as its besiegers; sitting (a session) for many (days),  they strove to split (the fortress?) of Nr̥ṣada.
The unassailable one disclosed what was knotted together, what was  hidden, of Śuṣṇa, who was propagated in many ways.
14. “Luster” is the name (of him), to whom the gods belong, who have set  him down in his triple seat like the sun, and “Agni Jātavedas” is his name. Hear us, o Hotar, as our Hotar of  truth, free of deception.
15. And these two sons of Rudra, the Nāsatyas who possess the chant, are  to be greeted and offered sacrifice by me, o Indra—
the two who give (gifts) to him who, like Manus, provides the twisted  ritual grass; the delightful pair for whom pleasing offerings are set
out; and the two that seek sacrifice among the clans.
16. This king praised here has been extolled as a ritual adept, and as  inspired poet he crosses the waters, creating his own bridge.
He sets Kakṣīvant atremble and also Agni, as the swift-running wheel  of a steed does its wheel-rim.
17. He of two lineages, the son of Vitaraṇa, the sacrificer, is to milk the  milk-cow, which is sap-yielding but not giving birth,
when I enmesh Mitra and Varuṇa with hymns and Aryaman with
preeminent defenses.
18. The patron whose lineage this is, setting your insight in heaven,
Nābhānediṣṭha [/nearest to the navel], murmurs as he quests:
“Is this navel of ours highest or is his? I was the so-many-eth after
that one.”
19. [Agni:] “This, here, is my navel, and here is my seat. These gods here are  mine, and here am I—the whole—
having two births, first born of truth. This (earth?) here did the cow
give as her milk as she was being born.”
20. Now among these (clans) the gladdening, far-radiant spoked wheel  [=Agni] unhitches, the one having a double track, victorious within
the wood.
When the child of the house is like an upright line, right away the
mother gives birth to the sturdy one, who grows strong with
kindness.
21. And now the cows of the maiden [=Dawn] have gone forth, following  the distribution (of goods) of someone swollen (with wealth).
Listen to us, o you possessing good movable property; you, perform  sacrifice! I have grown strong through the liberal gifts of Āśvaghna
[/son of the horse-killer].
22. And now you, Indra—know us for the sake of great wealth, o lord of  men with the mace in your arms,
and guard those generous to us and protect our blameless patrons in  your charge, o possessor of fallow bays.
23. And now, o you two kings [=Mitra and Varuṇa, or the Aśvins], when  in the quest for cattle the hastening one, awakening, makes haste for  the bard,
the dearest inspired poet [=Agni?], because he has become theirs
[=patrons’], will carry them away and will bring them across.
1478 X.62
24. And now at the thriving of him [=Agni] who is well born—we, rasping  at will, now beg this: [see vs. 27]—
you, his son, are a hastening horse and an inspired poet—as also at the  winning of fame.
25. If for the sake of companionship with you two [=Mitra and Varuṇa, or  the Aśvins], for us who are his troop, he [=Agni/poet], receiving
[/providing] reverence, finds pleasure in his praise hymn—
he in whom songs in all places come together, like a route with many  parts—and he does ritual service for the sake of liberality,
26. He, being sung by the waters and with the gods on his side, is thus “of  good lineage.” With reverence and hymns,
with solemn words and speeches, he strengthens (the gods?), for now  (he has) arrived. The (ceremonial) course departs from the “milk” of  the ruddy one [=Dawn].
27. (...we now beg this:) “O gods worthy of the sacrifice, become joined  together for great help for us,
you who, (now) departing, led prizes (here), and who are observers who  are never fooled.”

Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava
11 verses: jagatī 1–4, anuṣṭubh 5, brhat ̥ ī 6, satobrhat ̥ ī 7, anuṣṭubh 8–9, gāyatrī 10,  triṣṭubh 11
Attributed to the same poet as X.61, this hymn takes up some of the same themes  as the previous hymn, but in much more straightforward fashion. The Aṅgirases,  who figured in verses 10–13 of X.61, are the subject of the first seven verses of  this hymn, with blessings heaped upon them in verses 1–4. Their lineal descent  from Agni is clearly indicated here (vss. 5–6), while in X.61 it was present pri
marily by implication (vss. 9–10). The Vala myth is treated in verses 2 and 7, and  in verse 3 the Aṅgirases are credited with cosmogonic deeds more appropriate  to Indra.
The “navel” of X.61.18–19 is also encountered in verse 4 of this hymn (loc.  nā́bhā, pāda a). Although some (e.g., Geldner) consider the navel in that verse to  be a truncation of the (supposed) poet’s name Nābhānediṣṭha, we consider it to a  reference to the sacrificial ground or the ritual fire, as in X.61.19.
The first four verses end with the refrain “Accept the descendant of Manu  (mānavá).” Geldner, who believes that the hymn conforms to the story told in  Aitareya Brāhmaṇa V.14 about Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava, considers this refrain to  be a self-reference by the poet and supplies “me” with mānavám as its appositive  (“accept me, the descendant of Manu”). But we follow Oldenberg in considering the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa story secondary and, like many Brāhmaṇa explanations of  R̥gvedic hymns, based on misunderstanding. Given that our poet’s patron is named  Manu (see vss. 8 and 11), it seems more likely that in this refrain the poet is com
mending his patron and/or his family to the protection of the Aṅgirases. The final four verses (8–11) are a dānastuti of this patron, Manu Sāvarṇi, with  the final Aṅgiras verse (7) serving as a transition to this praise of magnanimity.
1. You who, anointed with the sacrifice and the priestly gift, achieved the  fellowship of Indra and immortality,
for you, o Aṅgirases, let there be good fortune. – Accept the descendant  of Manu, o you of good wisdom.
2. The fathers who drove up the goods consisting of cows and with truth  split the Vala cave at the turning of the year,
let there be long life for you, o Aṅgirases. – Accept the descendant of  Manu, o you of good wisdom.
3. Who with truth caused the sun to mount in heaven and spread out  Mother Earth,
let there be good offspring for you, o Aṅgirases. – Accept the
descendant of Manu, o you of good wisdom.
4. This one here at the navel (of the sacrifice) speaks to you agreeably in  the house. O you seers whose sons are gods, listen to this.
Let there be good sacred formulation for you, o Aṅgirases. – Accept the  descendant of Manu, o you of good wisdom.
5. Just these seers are the Virūpas [/of various forms]; just they possess  profound inspiration.
They are the sons of the Aṅgiras; they were born from Agni.
6. The Virūpas [/those of various forms] who were born from Agni and  from heaven,
Navagva, Daśagva, the best of the Aṅgirases: in company with the
gods, (each) is generous.
7. With Indra as their yokemate, the cantors set loose the pen filled with  cows and horses.
Giving me a thousand (cows) with cut-branded ears, they made fame  for themselves among the gods.
8. Now let this Manu be propagated and let him grow like a sprout— he who is magnanimous in giving all at once a thousand (cows) along  with a hundred horses.
9. No one succeeds in taking hold of him any more than the back of  heaven.
The priestly gift of Sāvarṇya spreads out like a river.
10. And also two barbarian-slaves to perform service, each with his allotted  (gear), along with an abundance of cows,
have Yadu and Turva (each) magnanimously bestowed.
1480 X.63
11. Let Manu, giver of thousands, leader of the horde, not suffer harm. Let  his priestly gift come, aligning itself with the sun.
Let the gods extend the lifetime of Sāvarṇi, under whose auspices we,  unwearied, won the prize of victory.
The next two hymns to the All Gods (63–64) are attributed to Gaya Plāta.
## 63 (889) All Gods
Gaya Plāta
17 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 16–17
The signature word of this hymn is svastí “well-being”:  in the dative suvastáye it provides the last four syllables of verses 3–14, and its nominative opens five  consecutive pādas in the verses after that refrain (15–16a). The gods from whom  the poet solicits well-being are primarily the Ādityas and their mother Aditi, who  especially dominate the first half of the hymn. Beginning with verse 9 other gods  are also invoked, though the Ādityas keep their prominence. Not surprisingly in  a hymn devoted to well-being, the emphasis is on positive thoughts, though some  worries about potential dangers do intrude (see vss. 11–12). More surprisingly in  a hymn with such a strong Ādityan cast, our potential moral flaws are barely men
tioned (vs. 8c).
1. Those from afar who seek to establish friendship, who, gratified by  Manu, (seek to establish) the races of Vivasvant,
the gods who sit on the ritual grass of Yayāti Nahuṣya—let them speak  on our behalf.
2. For all your names, o gods, are worthy of homage, worthy of praise, and  they are worthy of the sacrifice.
You who were born from Aditi or from the waters, who from the earth,  listen to my call here.
3. Those for whom their mother swells the honeyed milk, (for whom) Aditi,  (like) unbounded heaven, massive as a stone, (swells) the beestings,
those whose gusts are hymns, bullishly bearing, rich in property—
applaud those Ādityas—for well-being.
4. Having their eyes on men, unblinking, as their due the gods have
achieved lofty immortality.
Having light as their chariot, snake-sly, blameless, they wear the height  of heaven as their garment—for well-being.
5. The very strong sovereign kings who have come to the sacrifice, who,  undeviating, have established their own dwelling in heaven—
seek to entice them here with reverence, with well-turned (hymns)—the  great Ādityas and Aditi—for well-being. 6. Who brings to success for you the praise that you will enjoy, all you  gods of Manu, however many you are?
Who will properly prepare for you, powerfully born ones, the ceremony  that will carry us across difficult straits—for well-being?
7. You for whom Manu, with his fire kindled by mind, along with the  seven Hotars, first attracted Hotrā (Libation) with sacrifice,
you Ādityas, hold out fearlessness as shelter. Make easy passages, easy  pathways for us—for well-being.
8. The forethoughtful counselors who are masters of the world, of  everything stationary and moving—
o gods, rescue us today from transgression done or not done—for
well-being.
9. In the raids we call on Indra easy to call, on the divine race of good  action that releases from difficult straits,
on Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Bhaga, for winning, on Heaven and Earth, the  Maruts—for well-being.
10. Upon Earth of good protection and faultless Heaven, upon Aditi of  good shelter, of good guidance,
(as) upon a divine boat with good oars, without defect, not leaking,
may we mount—for well-being.
11. All you worthy of the sacrifice, speak for us, for help; rescue us from the  crooked ill-going way.
With an invocation to the gods that comes true we would invoke you as  you listen, o gods, for aid—for well-being.
12. Away with disease, away with all lack of oblation, away with the ill-met  hostility of the malicious.
Gods, keep hatred at a distance from us. Extend broad shelter to us— for well-being.
13. Every mortal thrives unharmed and is propagated with progeny forth  from his foundation,
whom, o Ādityas, you lead with your good leading across all difficult  passages—for well-being.
14. Which one, o gods, you help at the contest for prizes, which one, o  Maruts, you help at the contest of champions when the stake is set,
that early-traveling, winning chariot, which suffers no harm, might we  mount, o Indra—for well-being.
15. Well-being for us on the pathways and in the wastelands, well-being in  the waters, in the precinct of the sun,
well-being for us in the wombs at the making of sons—well-being
confer (on us) for wealth, o Maruts.
16. For it is just well-being that is best on the path forward—that, (already)  rich in inheritance, sets out toward something valuable.
Let it keep guard over us at home and in a foreign place; with the gods  as its herdsmen let it be easy of access.
1482 X.64
17. In just this way has the son of Plati of inspired thought strengthened  you, all you Ādityas and Aditi.
The over-mastering superior men, the divine race, has been praised by  Amartya Gaya.

Gaya Plāta
17 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12, 16–17
Making up for his restrained focus on the Ādityas in the preceding All God hymn  (X.63), the poet Gaya Plāta here produces an expansive litany of almost every god  and goddess he can think of, major or minor. He begins with rhetorical questions  (vs. 1): which god would it be best to address? Having suggested that all of them are  potentially his targets (vs. 2), he runs through a long list of possible individuals (vss.  3–12), sometimes listing the bare name, sometimes offering further characterization.
Only in verses 13–14 do we reach something more interesting. In verse 13 he  expresses his hope that the Maruts will recognize their “common birth” with him,  presumably on the basis of their shared role as singers and poets (on this see also  I.87.5), as they meet at the “navel” (the loaded word of X.61–62, hymns attrib
uted to a different poet). The navel here must be both the sacrificial ground of the  here-and-now and the mythical point of their joint origin, before their division into  mortals and gods. In verse 14 he suggests Heaven and Earth as a model for this kin ship. Perhaps the idea is that Heaven and Earth are not divided, with Heaven taking  the gods’ side and Earth that of mortals, but they work as partners—both being  related to the gods and both accepting the sacrifice of men. In any case the kinship  that the poet has suggested he has with the Maruts as poets he asserts in another  way in verse 16, where he describes himself as a “powerfully roaring poet” (kavís tuvīrávān), the exact phrase with which he identified Br̥haspati, the wordsmith par  excellence of the gods, in verse 4.
The final two verses (16–17), in a different meter from the rest of the poem, are  the poet’s summary verses, both beginning with evā́ “in this way” and both men tioning the poet by name. The second of the two is also found at the end of X.63.
1. How shall we contemplate—of which one of the gods shall we
contemplate the name that is good to contemplate, as they listen to
my plea?
Who will be merciful; which one will create joy for us? Which one will  turn hither with help?
2. Our intentions are intent (on them), the insights in our hearts. Our  trackers follow their track and fly to (all) directions.
No dispenser of mercy other than them is found. My desires have
fastened upon the gods. 3. (Shall it be) Narāśaṃsa, Pūṣan, Agohya (the Unconcealable), or Agni  kindled by the gods that I address with a hymn,
or the Sun and Moon, (the new and) bright [=full] Moon, Yama in
heaven, Trita, Wind, Dawn, Night, the Aśvins?
4. How will the powerfully roaring poet Br̥haspati grow strong, through  what hymn with its well-twisted (ornaments)?
Let Aja Ekapād with the chanters who are easy to call, let Ahi Budhnya  harken to my call.
5. Or, o Aditi, at the birth of the skillful one [=Agni] under your
commandment, will you seek to entice here the two kings Mitra and  Varuṇa?
(Or will it be) Aryaman, whose path is not to be transgressed, who
possesses many chariots, who possesses seven Hotars, at his births in  diverse forms?
6. Let the steeds who heed the call heed our call—all the prizewinners of  measured pace,
who by themselves win thousands as if at the winning of wisdom, the  ones who have greatly borne away for themselves the spoils in the
encounters.
7. Set in front with your praises Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot,
Plenitude, and Pūṣan, for comradeship,
for at the impulsion of god Savitar they follow his will—those of one  mind (follow the will) of him who is of one mind (with them).
8. The thrice seven flowing rivers, the great waters, the trees, the
mountains, and Agni do we call upon for help—
and upon the archers in their seat—Kr̥śānu, Tiṣya (the Dog Star), and  Rudra the Rudrian among the Rudras.
9. Sarasvatī, Sarayu, Sindhu with their waves—let the great strengthening  ones come here greatly with their help—
the divine waters, the sweetening mothers. Sing their ghee-rich,
honey-rich milk for us.
10. And let the mother Br̥haddivā hear our speech, and Tvaṣṭar with the  divine ones, (namely) the Wives (of the Gods), and the Father,
R̥bhukṣan, Vāja, Lord of the Chariot, Bhaga. Let the delightful laud of  the one who labors protect us—
11. Delightful to the sight like a peaceful dwelling abounding in food.  Auspicious is the praise invocation of the Rudras, the Maruts.
May we be glorious among the peoples with our cows. May we always  be accompanied by refreshment, o gods.
12. The insight that you gave me—you gods, Maruts, Indra,
Varuṇa, Mitra—
make it swell like a milk-cow with milk. Surely you will convey the
hymns on your chariot?1484 X.65
13. Surely in some way you will take notice of this common birth of ours,  Maruts?
At the navel where we first come together, there let Aditi establish our  relationship.
14. For Heaven and Earth, the two great mothers, the goddesses worthy of  the sacrifice, proceed by virtue of their kinship with the gods.
Both support both (breeds [=gods and men]) with their supports, and  with the Fathers they sprinkle much seed.
15. Hotrā (Libation) reaches through to everything of value—as do
Br̥haspati and Aramati [/Devotion], the very admirable.
Where the honey-pressing pressing-stone is given lofty voice, the
inspired thinkers have bellowed with their thoughts.
16. In just this way the powerfully roaring poet, knowing the truth, seeking  goods, desiring goods,
the inspired Gaya here with hymns and compositions has swelled the  divine races.
17. In just this way has the son of Plati of inspired thought strengthened  you, all you Ādityas and Aditi.
The overmastering superior men, the divine race, has been praised by  Amartya Gaya.
Hymns X.65–66 are attributed to a Vasukarṇa Vāsukra, who is otherwise unknown  in the R̥gveda. But his patronymic links him to Vasukra Aindra, poet of the fiend ishly challenging and immensely clever X.27–29, as well as another poet with  the same patronymic, namely Vasukr̥t Vāsukra, one possible author of X.20–26,  another set of well-crafted hymns. Moreover, the final verse of X.65 (15) and the  final two of X.66 (14–15) mention Vasiṣṭha and the Vasiṣṭhas, and both hymns end  with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain familiar from Maṇḍala VII.
## 65 (891) All Gods
Vasukarṇa Vāsukra
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15
The poetic pedigree sketched above gives us high expectations for the hymn, which,  however, begins unpromisingly with a simple enumeration of gods. Nonetheless,  although the style never achieves the same distinction as that of the poet’s putative  relatives, there are many nice touches and twists and turns of syntax, particularly in  verses 2–8, treating the cosmogonic deeds of the gods and the praise and sacrifice  offered to them by mortals.
The hymn seems to begin anew with verse 9, which contains another straightfor ward listing of gods, continued in verse 10. A brief account of cosmogony (vs. 11) is followed by a sketch of the Aśvins’ deeds (vs. 12). Minor gods join the undifferentiated  mass of All Gods in verses 13–14, and the hymn ends with Vasiṣṭha’s summary verse.
1. Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Vāyu, Pūṣan, and Sarasvatī, of  one accord,
the Ādityas, Viṣṇu, the Maruts, the lofty Sun, Soma, Rudra, Aditi,
Brahmaṇaspati,
2. Indra and Agni, the two lords of the settlement, spurring each other on  mutually in the smashing of obstacles, sharing the same home—
they (all) filled the great midspace with their might, as did Soma,
glorious with ghee, rousing their greatness.
3. For by the greatness of these, the great and unassailable, I, recognizing  the truth, rouse my praises for those who grow strong through truth.
Let those who are bringing brilliant bounties (across) the watery flood  grant them to us. I magnify the (heavenly clans) well allied (to us).
4. They propped up (the region) of solar glory, the midspaces, the realms  of light, Heaven and Earth, the Broad One, with their might.
Magnifying (them), bringing lovely gifts like strengthening
nourishments, the gods are praised as patrons to the race of Manu.
5. Try your utmost for Mitra and for Varuṇa who does ritual service, the  two sovereign kings who do not stay distant in their thought,
whose lofty domain shines by reason of their ordinance, for whom the  two world-halves are two opposing troops in need of help.
6. The cow [=offering ladle?] that goes around the (ritual) track to the  appointed place, giving her milk, leading at the commandment (of
Varuṇa), not by choice,
she, being announced, will do ritual service to Varuṇa who (also) serves,  to the gods, and to Vivasvant with the oblation.
7. Those ruling over heaven, with Agni as their tongue, growing strong  through truth, sit stroking the womb of truth.
Having propped up heaven, they brought the waters here by their might.  Having given birth to the sacrifice, they clasped it to themselves.
8. The two parents born of old, encircling, sharing the same home, rule in  the womb of truth:
Heaven and Earth, who obey the same commandment to Varuṇa, swell  the ghee-filled milk for Varuṇa, the buffalo.
9. Parjanya and Vāta, the two overflowing bulls, Indra and Vāyu, Varuṇa,  Mitra, and Aryaman—
we summon the gods—the Ādityas and Aditi (also)—who are earthly,  heavenly, and in the waters.
10. O R̥bhus, (we beseech) Tvaṣṭar and Vāyu, who vaunts himself, the two  divine Hotars, and Dawn, for well-being;
we beseech Br̥haspati of good wisdom, the gnawer of Vr̥tra, and Soma,  destined for Indra—we who win the stakes.
1486 X.66
11. Those of good gifts, begetting the sacred formulation, the cow, the  horse, the plants, the trees, the earth, the mountains, the waters,
causing the sun to mount in heaven, loosing the Āryas’ commandments  upon the earth.
12. You rescue Bhujyu from difficult straits, o Aśvins. You gave life to  Śyāva, the son of Vadhrimatī.
You carried Kamadyū to Vimada. You let loose Viṣṇāpū for Viśvaka. 13. The daughter of Pavīru, Thunder, and Aja Ekapad, the supporter of  heaven, the river, and the waters of the sea—
all the gods will hear my words: (they and also) Sarasvatī, along with  insights [/Dhī] and with plenty [/Puraṃdhī].
14. All the gods, along with insights and with plenty, worthy of Manu’s  sacrifice, immortal, recognizing the truth,
the Escorts and the Gift-Escorts, finding the sun, should take pleasure  in the sun, the songs, the sacred formulation, and the hymn.
15. Vasiṣṭha has extolled the immortal gods, who stand out over all living  beings.
Let them grant us wide-ranging space today. – Do you protect us
always with your blessings.
## 66 (892) All Gods
Vasukarṇa Vāsukra
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15
The listing impulse found in the previous hymn is here carried further. The gods  in general, groups of gods such as the Ādityas, Vasus, and Rudras, and individual  gods both major and minor are invoked here, with conventional descriptors and  predicates and with standard prayers for help and blessing. There is little to catch  the attention in this hymn, though it is certainly competently done.
1. I call upon the gods of lofty fame for well-being—the makers of light,  attentive to the rite,
who, having all possessions, have grown even stronger, the immortals  having Indra as their chief, grown strong through truth—
2. Who, thrust forth by Indra, directed forth by Varuṇa, attained a share of  the light of the sun.
We would set our thoughts on the community having the Maruts as their  troop. In their generosity, they begot the sacrifice as its patrons.
3. Let Indra with the Vasus protect our livelihood on every side. Let Aditi  with the Ādityas extend shelter to us.
The god Rudra with the Rudras shall be merciful to us. Let Tvaṣṭar with  the Wives (of the Gods) enliven us for good faring. 4. Aditi, Heaven and Earth, great truth, Indra and Viṣṇu, the Maruts, and  the lofty Sun—
we call upon the gods for help—the Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, and
well-skilled Savitar.
5. Sarasvant along with insights, Varuṇa whose commandments are  upheld, Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, the Greatness, Vāyu, and the Aśvins,
the creators of sacred formulations, immortal, having all possessions,  they will extend to us shelter providing threefold defense from
difficult straits.
6. Let our sacrifice be a bull and those belonging to the sacrifice bulls, the  gods bulls, and those making the oblation bulls;
truthful Heaven and Earth bulls, Parjanya a bull, and those praising the  bull bulls.
7. I entreat the bulls Agni and Soma in order to win the prize, those two  bulls lauded by many.
Those two to whom the bulls have sacrificed through their sacrifice
to the gods, those two will spread out shelter providing threefold
defense for us.
8. The rulers whose commandments are upheld, who bring forth the  sacrifice, heaven-lofty ones, the full glory of the rite,
whose Hotar is Agni, who serve the truth without deceit—they let loose  the waters following on the triumph over Vr̥tra.
9. They begot heaven and earth to their commandments, and the waters,  the plants, and the trees belonging to the sacrifice.
They filled the midspace and the sun to give help. The gods clasped
their will to themselves.
10. Let the upholders of heaven, the R̥bhus with skilled hands, let Vāta and  Parjanya, (masters?) of Thunder the buffalo,
let the waters and plants advance our songs. Let Bhaga, Gift, and the  prizewinners come to my call.
11. The sea, the river, the dusky realm, the midspace; Aja Ekapad,
Thundering, the flood,
and Ahi Budhnya will hear my words, (also) all the gods and my
patrons.
12. Might we (all) be Manus [=like Manu] for you, to pursue the gods. Lead  our sacrifice forth toward the east straight to the goal.
O Ādityas, Rudras, and Vasus, of good gifts, give life to these sacred  formulations as they are being recited.
13. The two divine Hotars, the first two set in front, do I follow along the  path of truth straight to the goal.
We beseech the lord of the field, our neighbor, and all the immortal
gods, who do not stay distant.
1488 X.67
14. The Vasiṣṭhas have made speech in the manner of their father, invoking  the gods in the manner of that seer for well-being.
Like pleased kinsmen, coming here at our desire, shake good things
down upon us, o gods.
15. Vasiṣṭha has extolled the immortal gods, who stand out over all living  beings.
Let them grant us wide-ranging space today. – Do you protect us
always with your blessings.
The two hymns of Ayāsya Āṅgirasa (67–68) are particularly noteworthy treatments  of Br̥haspati and the Vala myth.
## 67 (893) Br̥haspati
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
12 verses: triṣṭubh
This is perhaps the clearest treatment of Br̥haspati’s role in the Vala myth and of  his identity with Indra, the usual hero in the Vala story. As discussed above (see  especially the introduction to IV.50), Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has clearly shown  that bŕ̥haspáti was originally an epithet of Indra in his role as priest and formulator,  a role that is highlighted in the Vala myth—since Indra opens the Vala cave and  frees the cows not with his normal power and violence but with song and correctly  crafted verbal formulae. In this hymn Br̥haspati is credited with the deed, but in  equivalence with Indra. The names are essentially superimposed upon each other,  an equation made more obvious by their positioning: the name Br̥haspati opens  the second half-verse of verses 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and the more transparent version  of his name, Brahmaṇaspati, is in the same position in verse 7. In the midst of this  sequence, in the middle verse 6, we find Indra in initial position in the verse and  credited with the same deed. The poet could hardly have made their identity clearer.  (The final verse of the hymn [12] begins with the word Indra, here as hero of other  stories, especially the Vr̥tra myth.)
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the primal finding and production of a true insight;  the unidentified “fourth one” in the second half of the verse probably refers to  the fourth, inaudible portion of speech, or the fourth formulation, which figures  prominently in Vedic speculations on the nature and power of speech (see Jamison  1991: 251–57). The second verse introduces the Aṅgirases, the crucial partners of  Br̥haspati/Indra in the opening of the Vala cave; they too find the truthful word.  The next five verses (3–8) narrate the dramatic opening of the cave and the freeing  of the cows. One notes a certain irony in the poet’s treatment of Vala: though the  cave is first depicted as a fetter (vs. 4) and a stronghold (vs. 5), it is described with  the ambiguous term “guard” in verse 6 (a term as ambiguous in Sanskrit as it is in English), and then with a more sarcastic tone “cow-nurturer” in verse 7 and “cow herd” in verse 8.
The hymn ends with four verses celebrating the god and asking for blessings.  Most interesting in this section is the final pāda of verse 10 (if we have rightly  interpreted it), which alludes to the different poetic skills and styles of the mortal  celebrants.
1. This seven-headed insightful thought here, born of truth and lofty, did  our father find.
The fourth one indeed did the irrepressible one, belonging to all men,  generate as he was pronouncing a solemn speech for Indra.
2. Pronouncing the truth, thinking straight, the sons of heaven, the heroes  of the lord,
the Aṅgirases, establishing their inspired word [/laying their inspired  track], pondered the first foundation of the sacrifice.
3. Along with his comrades, who were constantly gabbling like geese, while  he was throwing open the fastenings made of stone,
while he kept roaring to the cows, Br̥haspati both started the praise song  and struck up the melody, as knowing one.
4. With two (gates) below, with one above, the cows standing hidden in the  fetter of untruth—
Br̥haspati, seeking light in the darkness, brought up the ruddy ones, for  he opened up the three (gates).
5. Having split apart the stronghold (from front) to back, (having split  apart) the lairs, at one blow he cut out the three [=dawn, sun, cow]
from the reservoir.
Br̥haspati found the dawn, the sun, the cow, (found) the chant while he  was thundering like heaven.
6. Indra cut apart Vala, the guard over the milkers, with a roar like a tool. Seeking the milk-mixture with (his comrades) anointed with sweat, he  made the niggard wail: he stole the cows.
7. With his trusty comrades blazing, with the winners of spoils, he cleaved  apart the cow-nurturer.
The Lord of the Sacred Formulation reached through to the treasure  with his bulls, his boars, with their hot sweat [/sweating over the
gharma pot].
8. With trusty mind begging the cowherd for the cows, they compelled him  with their insightful thoughts.
Br̥haspati loosed the ruddy ones upward, with his own yokemates who  protect each other from fault.
9. With our propitious thoughts strengthening him, ever roaring in his seat  like a lion,
we would celebrate Br̥haspati the bull, victorious at the contest of
champions, victorious in every raid,
1490 X.68
10. When he won the prize of all forms and mounted to heaven, to the  higher seats.
Br̥haspati the bull (would we celebrate), strengthening him—though
each (of us) brings light with our mouth in our own way.
11. Make our hope come true, our hope for the conferring of vigor. For  you help even the weakling in your own ways.
Let all slighters be off, be behind (us). You two world-halves, who
set all in motion, hear this.
12. Indra with his greatness split apart the head of the great flood, of  Arbuda.
He smashed the serpent. He let flow the seven streams. O Heaven and  Earth, along with the gods, further us.
## 68 (894) Br̥haspati
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
12 verses: triṣṭubh
A wonderful hymn, which takes the fairly straightforward (though artful) narra tive of the Vala myth in the preceding hymn (X.67) and embroiders each part of  it with imaginative and studied imagery and verbal constructions. Most striking  is the blizzard of similes, many having two and even three points of comparison  (see, e.g., 5ab), or with simile piled on simile (see, e.g., 1c), or with complex social  content (vs. 2). By contrast X.67 contains only four similes (3a, 5d, 6b, 9b), each  with only one point of comparison—a number essentially reached in the first verse  of this hymn.
As a particularly elaborate example consider the underlying content of verse  2, whose role in the mythic narrative is simply to state that Br̥haspati reunited the  Aṅgirases with their cows. But this reunion is compared to the ceremony of mar riage and the participants are compared to the married couple and to the divinities  who preside over marriage. (If we understood Vedic marriage ceremonies better,  we might understand the verse better.) In the first half of the verse Br̥haspati leads  the unnamed Aṅgirases to reunion with the cows, just as Bhaga (Fortune or Good  Fortune) leads Aryaman, the “civilizing” god of custom, one of whose roles is  patron of marriage, to the marriage ceremony in order to preside. The ceremony  itself is performed at the ritual fire, and in the third pāda of the verse Br̥haspati is  compared to Agni, under the designation “ally among the people” (several times  used of Agni elsewhere). Just as Agni anoints the marrying couple with milk, so  Br̥haspati “anoints” the Aṅgirases (compared to the couple) with cows. The fact  that the word for “ally” (mitrá) is identical to the divine name Mitra simply intro
duces another complication into this complicated verse. Since, as the next verse  (3) makes clear, the cows are embodiments of civilization, of the social bonds that unite the Ārya peoples, this remarkable verse is not just a poetic tour de force, but  also an assertion of the centrality of social custom.
Another complex simile worth exploring is in the second half of verse 6, where  the poet exploits the ambiguity of two words (páriviṣṭam and ā́dat) to deploy two dis tinct three-term comparisons simultaneously. The past passive participle páriviṣṭam can belong to either of two roots, √viś “enter,” in which case the idiom means “sur rounded, trapped,” or √viṣ “work,” in which case the idiom means “served.” The  verb ā́dat can belong to √dā “give,” with preverb ā́, in which case the idiom means  “take,” or to √ad “eat.” Combining these possibilities, we can interpret the image  as that of the tongue worrying food caught between the teeth, or as the tongue and  the teeth eating food that has been served. Either image can be appropriate to the  removal of the cows from the cave, though we are partial to the notion of Br̥haspati  winkling out cows from every interior crevasse.
There is no need, or space, to dissect every simile; we can only invite the reader  to savor the exuberance, the precision, and often the everyday nature of the imagery  throughout the hymn and to consider the construction of these similes as forerun ners of the kāvya style in Classical Sanskrit.
1. Constantly gabbling like water birds watching out for each other, like the  sounds of booming (thunder) emanating from a cloud,
exulting like waves stiff-peaked (like) mountains, the chants bellowed  toward Br̥haspati.
2. (Bellowing) with the cows, (Br̥haspati) Aṅgiras, coming near, led (the  Aṅgirases) together with the cows, as Bhaga leads Aryaman.
As the ally among the people [=Agni] anoints the household pair, he  anoints (the Aṅgirases). O Br̥haspati, incite them like swift (horses) in  a contest.
3. (The cows—) thoroughly civilized, providing for guests, vigorous,  cherished, of lovely color and faultless form—
Br̥haspati, having brought them through, strewed the cows forth from  the mountains, like grain from sacks.
4. Spraying the womb of truth with honey, flinging (it=honey?) down like a  firebrand from heaven when the chant (sounded),
Br̥haspati, when he brought the cows up out of the stone, split asunder  the skin of the earth as if (just) with water.
5. With his light he drove away the darkness from the midspace as the wind  drives the śīpāla-plant from the water.
Br̥haspati, having (just) stroked (the skin/womb) of Vala, as the wind  does a cloud, brought the cows here as his own.
6. When Br̥haspati split the feebleness of taunting Vala with his fire-hot chants, he took (the cows) as the tongue takes (food) trapped by the teeth
[/he “ate” (the cows?) as the tongue along with the teeth eats served
(food)], and he revealed the hidden treasures of the ruddy (cows).
1492 X.69
7. For Br̥haspati brought to mind this very name of these who were  resounding (with)in the seat—(the name) that was hidden.
Having split the womb of the mountain like the eggs of a bird, he drove  up the ruddy ones by himself.
8. He caught sight of the honey enclosed by the stone, like a fish living in  shallow water.
He extracted it, like a (wooden) cup from a tree—Br̥haspati having cut  apart (the mountain) with an (ear-)splitting cry.
9. He found the dawn, found the sun, found the fire; he thrust aside the  dark shades with his chant [/ray].
Br̥haspati extracted (the cows) of Vala, whose beauty was the cows, like  marrow from a joint.
10. As the woods (lament) their leaves stolen by cold, Vala lamented for the  cows (stolen) by Br̥haspati.
He performed an inimitable (deed), not to be repeated as long as the  sun and moon will rise in alternation.
11. Like a dusky horse with pearls, the Fathers ornamented the heaven  with stars.
In the night they placed darkness and light in the day. Br̥haspati split  the rock and found the cows.
12. This act of reverence here we have performed for the one belonging to  the storm cloud, who keeps bellowing after the many (cows?):
Br̥haspati—for he shall confer vigor on us with cows, with horses, with  heroes, with superior men.
Sumitra Vādhryaśva is said to be the composer of the next two hymns (69–70), one  to Agni, one an Āprī hymn.
## 69 (869) Agni
Sumitra Vādhryaśva
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2
This hymn is discussed at length and translated in full by Proferes (2007: 40–44),  who calls it “perhaps the clearest example of a tribal fire and the ritual role of the  clans in relation to this fire. It illustrates the existence of a central fire tended by  multiple clans who affirm through it their mutual solidarity, and who see in it the  source of their domination over others” (p.  40). This particular clan-fire is that  of King Vadhryaśva (see vss. 1–2, 4, 10–12), a speaking name with a deprecatory  sense: “possessing gelded horses,” and in fact the fire itself bears the patronymic  “son/descendant of Vadhryaśva” (see vss. 5, 9, 12). The current fire is also con trasted with fire or fires kindled previously (vss. 4–5), and toward the end of the hymn this fire present here is depicted as victorious over former fires, presumably  belonging to other clans (vss. 10–11). Such victories are just an aspect of the victo ries over other peoples that the clan-fire brings Vadhryaśva and his allies, the men  who kindle and tend this fire (vss. 5–6, 9–12).
One curious detail in the hymn is found in verse 7, where various possessions are  ascribed to the fire (here called a craftsman), including “a thousand barren cows.”  The negative connotations of this property are immediately counteracted in the  next verse (8ab), in which the fire is credited with having an abundantly fertile cow  whose flow of milk is inexhaustible, but the great flock of barren cows is nonethe
less odd. It finds its explanation in a semantic pun: just as the triumphant and suc cessful Vadhryaśva bears the name “possessing gelded horses” so does his equally  triumphant and successful fire “possess barren cows.”
Stylistically there is much chaining of phraseology and repetition of syntactic  patterns.
1. Auspicious are the manifestations of the fire of Vadhryaśva; his guidance  is valuable; reverent approaches (to him) bring joy.
When the clans that are good allies kindle him at the beginning,
bepoured with ghee he awakens, flashing again and again.
2. The strengthener of the fire of Vadhryaśva is ghee; ghee is his food, ghee  his fattener.
Bepoured with ghee, he spreads out widely. He shines like the sun—his  potion melted butter.
3. Which face of yours Manu kindled, which (did) the good ally, o Agni,  that is this one here anew.
Blaze richly; take pleasure in the songs. Break out the prize; confer
fame here.
4. You whom Vadhryaśva, when reverently invoked, kindled formerly, o  Agni, do you take pleasure in this (new face) here.
Become the protector of our people and the protector of our own
bodies. Guard the gift—whatever you have for us here.
5. Become possessed of brilliance, o son of Vadhryaśva, and our herdsman.  Let the hostile intent of the peoples not overtake you.
A rouser like a bold champion, a good ally—I shall now proclaim the  name of Vadhryaśva’s son.
6. The goods of the plains and the mountains, the Dāsa and the Ārya  obstacles—you have conquered them entirely.
A rouser of the peoples like a bold champion—you, o Agni, should
dominate those who seek battle.
7. This fire here has a long thread and lofty oxen; the craftsman has a  thousand barren cows and a hundred counsels.
Brilliant among the brilliant (gods), being groomed by men, you will  shine among the good allies who seek the gods.1494 X.70
8. O Jātavedas, in you is the milk-cow, yielding good milk, milking out  nectar always in the same way, like the two [=Heaven and Earth] that  never dry up.
You, Agni, are kindled by men who receive the priestly gifts, by the good  allies who seek the gods.
9. Even the immortal gods proclaimed your greatness, o Jātavedas, son of  Vadhryaśva.
When the clans of the sons of Manu came to negotiate, you conquered  by means of the men whose strength is you.
10. Like a father his son, Vadhryaśva bore you on his lap as he served you,  o Agni.
And taking pleasure in his kindling, o youngest one, you vanquished the  former (fires), even though they were greatly arrogant.
11. Over and over the fire of Vadhryaśva has conquered rivals by means of  the men that provide the pressed soma.
You burned even the (whole) crowd, o bright-beamed one; as
strengthener you cut down even the greatly arrogant one.

Sumitra Vādhryaśva
11 verses: triṣṭubh
An eleven-verse Āprī hymn, with Narāśaṃsa in verse 2 (like II.3, V.5), where  some Āprī hymns instead have Tanūnapāt (I.188, III.4, VII.2, IX.5, and X.110).  There are otherwise few deviations from the standard Āprī hymn template, except  that r̥tvíj “priest, orderly sacrificer” is substituted for the standard Hotar in verse  7. The trimeter meter gives more scope for elaboration than some of the more  minimalist dimeter Āprī hymns (e.g., I.13). A  signature word is uśánt “eager,  desirous” (4d, 5c, 6c, 9d). As always in Āprī hymns, the key word or phrase in  each verse is italicized.
1. Take pleasure in this kindling wood of mine, o Agni; delight in the  ghee-covered (ladle) in the footprint of refreshment.
On the height of the earth, on the brightest day of days, become upright,  o very resolute one, together with our sacrifice to the gods.
2. As the lead driver of the gods, let Narāśaṃsa drive here with horses of  every form along the path of truth; with reverence the foremost of the gods will  sweeten the ritual meal for the gods.
3. The sons of Manu, offering oblations, time and again solemnly invoke Agni to act as messenger:
“With the best-conveying horses and with a smoothly rolling chariot,  convey the gods here. Sit down here as our Hotar.”
4. Pleasing to the gods, let it be spread out crosswise; long in length let it  be sweet smelling for us.
O divine Ritual Grass, with a mind without anger sacrifice to the gods,  having Indra as their chief, who are eager for it.
5. Touch the wider back of heaven, or gape open along the measure of  the earth.
Eagerly, seeking the chariot, o Doors, with your greatness and with the  great (gods) hold fast the divine chariot.
6. Let the two goddesses, the handsomely adorned daughters of Heaven,  Dawn and Night, sit down in the womb.
Let the eager gods sit here in the wide lap of you two eager ones who  possess a good portion.
7. The pressing stone is upright; the fire has been loftily kindled: their own  dear domains are in the lap of Aditi [=ritual ground?].
You two priests—placed in front at this sacrifice, win material wealth by  sacrifice, as the two who know better.
8. You three goddesses—sit here upon this wider ritual grass: we have  made a comfortable place for you.
As in the time of Manu, they—Iḷā, the goddess with feet of ghee, (and  the other goddesses)—take pleasure in our sacrifice and our properly  placed oblations.
9. God Tvaṣṭar, since you have attained loveliness and since you have  come to be in the company of the Aṅgirases,
(convey the sacrificial animal) forth to the fold of the gods, as you
know how; eagerly perform the sacrifice, as one possessing treasure,
o giver of material wealth.
10. O Lord of the Forest, harnessing it with a halter, convey it into the fold  of the gods, as you know how.
The god will sweeten and prepare the offerings. Let Heaven and Earth  aid my call.
11. O Agni, convey Varuṇa here to our liking, also Indra from heaven and  the Maruts from the midspace.
Let them all, worthy of the sacrifice, sit on the ritual grass. Let the
immortal gods bring themselves to exhilaration at the svāhā-call.
1496 X.71
The next two very well-known and often anthologized hymns are attributed to  the legendary Br̥haspati Āṅgirasa, with alternative, equally legendary, authorship  suggested for X.72. According to the Anukramaṇī, X.71 is dedicated to Jñāna  “Wisdom” or “Knowledge,” but it is knowledge in the form of sacred speech (Vāc).  (The word jñāna does not occur in the hymn, or indeed in the R̥gveda.) Hymn X.72,  dedicated simply to the gods (Devāḥ) according to the Anukramaṇī, is a cosmogony  focused on the origin of the divinities.
## 71 (897) Wisdom
Brhaspati ̥ Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9
This hymn describes the mastery of sacred speech (vā́c), which is essential for the  priests performing the soma rites. This mastery binds the priests together, establish ing their “companionship” (vs. 2). The degree of mastery distinguishes one priest  from another (vss. 4–5, 7–8), while the inability or unwillingness of some priests to  employ sacred speech in performance marks them and their mastery as useless (vss.  6, 9). Using the language of horseracing, the poet speaks of the “competition” or  “competitions” (vā́jina, vss. 5, 10) in which priests succeed through their mastery of  speech. These “competitions” could be contests to determine which priests can best  compose hymns or recite hymns and therefore which ones will be chosen to partici
pate in a ritual performance. That kind of contest occurred and is likely described  in verse 10ab. It is also true that the poem emphasizes the composer of the hymns: it  begins with a reference to Br̥haspati, the “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” and in  the concluding list of priests, the brahmán, the “formulator,” is the only one men
tioned by name. But the “competitions” could also be the sacrifices themselves,  which strive against one another for the attention and favor of the gods. If so,  sacred speech is not contained just in the hymns, but constitutes all of the speech  in the rite. This broader conception of sacred speech is implied in the reference to  the “seven husky-voiced singers” (3d), who are likely the “seven Hotars,” the seven  priests of the sacrifice (cf. II.1.2), and the reference to four types of priests in the  last verse.
The hymn begins by remembering the ancient seers (cf. vs. 3b, ŕ̥ṣi), who first  found the “hidden name.” As Schmidt (1968: 124) suggests, the reference may  be to the ancient seers who found the hidden name of the cows and so were able  to release the imprisoned cows from the Vala cave (cf. X.68.7). Their concerted  priestly action and effective priestly speech is then a model for contemporary  priests, to whom the poet shifts in verse 2. These priests have also created the  speech of the sacrifice, and their knowledge and their ability to articulate that  speech bind them together as colleagues. Because sacred speech belongs to them,  it carries their “mark” or “brand” (lakṣmī́, 2d). In verse 3 they found this speech by the sacrifice, for it was in the words of the ancient seers, who were their ances tors and forerunners. They have brought that speech into the present and dis persed it throughout the sacrifice. Not everyone who would recite or compose  is capable of doing so (vs. 4). Or, as verse 5a puts it, there are those who are  “stiff and swollen in their companionship.” This description is open to various  interpretations, but “stiff and swollen” could apply to a corpse and here meta phorically describe someone who is useless, similar to the American expression  “the guy’s a stiff.” Their talent is unproductive, “no milk-cow,” and their words  are sterile, bringing no “fruit or flower” (5d). Likewise, the uncooperative priest  betrays the speech he perceives because only the priests together can perform the  rite (vss. 6, 9). In verse 9cd the poet compares the speech in the sacrifice to the  warp-threads on which the sacrifice is woven. But someone who does not use his  knowledge and ability in the rite offers nothing more substantial than a stream  of water and produces nothing worthwhile.
This hymn and its concentration on vā́c invites comparison with the famous  self-praise pronounced by the goddess Vāc herself (X.125), though the tone of the  two hymns is very different.
1. O Br̥haspati, (this was) the first beginning of Speech: when they [=the  seers] came forth, giving names.
What was their best, what was flawless—that (name), set down in secret,  was revealed to them because of your affection (for them).
2. When the wise have created Speech by their thought, purifying her like  coarse grain by a sieve,
in this they recognize their companionship as companions. Their
auspicious mark has been set down upon Speech.
3. Through the sacrifice they followed the track of Speech. They found her  having entered into the seers.
Having brought her here, they dispersed her in many places. The seven  husky-voiced singers together cry her out.
4. And many a one who sees has not seen Speech, and many a one who  hears does not hear her.
And for another she has stretched out her body, like an eager,
well-dressed wife for her husband.
5. And they say that another is stiff and swollen in his companionship: him  they do not spur on at all in the competitions.
He moves with an artifice that is no milk-cow, having heard Speech
without fruit or flower.
6. Who has abandoned the companion joined (to him) in knowledge, for  him there is no share in Speech at all.
When he hears her, he hears in vain, for he does not know the path of  the rightly performed (ritual).
1498 X.72
7. Though all have eyes and ears, the companions are unequal in
quickness of mind.
Some seem like ponds reaching up to the mouth or up to the armpits,  and others seem like ponds good to bathe in.
8. When, in the mind’s quickness that is fashioned in the heart, brahmins  perform the sacrifice together as companions,
then they leave behind some by their knowing ways and others range  widely with their lauds and formulations.
9. Who move neither close nor far away, who are not brahmins, and who  do not perform in the soma-pressing,
they, having fallen upon speech in a bad way, stretch streams of water  as their warp-thread, producing nothing.
10. All his companions rejoice with a companion who has come in glory,  who is overpowering in the assembly,
for, rescuing them from their errors and winning sustenance for them,  he is fittingly spurred onward to the competition.
11. The one [=Hotar] sits, blooming a blooming of verses; the other  [=Udgātar] sings a song in śakvarī verses.
The one, the formulator [=Brahman], speaks the knowledge born (in  him), and the other [=Adhvaryu] measures out the measure of the
sacrifice.
## 72 (898) The Gods
Brhaspati ̥ Āṅgirasa, Brhaspati Laukya, or Aditi D ̥ ākṣāyaṇī
9 verses: anuṣṭubh
Geldner remarks that the hymn almost seems as if the poet intentionally wanted to  show the insolubility of the problem of the origin of things by setting incompat ible theories of cosmogony alongside one another. While we find greater coherence  than this, we recognize the complexities and uncertainties that caused Geldner to  come to this conclusion. At least at a very general level, the hymn does show a cos mogonic progression from “what is not existing” to “what is existing” and finally to  immortal gods and mortal humans.
The hymn also has thematic elements in common with the preceding hymn. The  most obvious is that bráhmaṇas pátiḥ, the Lord of the Sacred Formulation (vs. 2),  is Br̥haspati, who is invoked at the beginning of X.71. Then too, while it has the  appearance of a cosmogony, the hymn also makes repeated reference to sacrificial  performance. One thematic strand of this hymn is that the sacrifice embodies the  principles that gave rise to the world.
In verse 3 what Br̥haspati “smelted” is the “births” of the gods, as Sāyaṇa already  noted. Br̥haspati brings them about by means of a sacred formulation (bráhman) expressing the origins of the gods. But such a formulation can also bring about the  birth of the gods in a specific ritual place at the time of a ritual performance. In that  way, words—or the thoughts behind words—can make beings real. Perhaps this is  what the poet means when in verse 2d he says that “what exists,” what are “things”  (the world, the gods, and humans), was born from “what does not exist,” what are  not “things” (thoughts or words).
In verse 3cd “the one whose feet were opened up” gives rise to what exists, which  in turn gives rise to the regions of space. But in 4ab “the one whose feet were opened  up” gives rise to the earth, which gives rise to the regions. That is to say, between  the two hemistichs, there is a shift in the middle term: “what exists” in verse 3 and  “the earth” in verse 4.  The key to the significance of this shift is the word bhū́
“the earth.” “The earth” is only one possible translation; the word could also mean  a “form” that something assumes (cf. III.55.13b=X.27.14d) or, etymologically at  least, the act of “becoming.” If the ambiguity is intentional, then the two verses  together redefine “what exists” as that which has material substance—most broadly  the earth or more specifically what has form.
The source of “what exists” or “the earth” is the principle or entity described as  “one whose feet were opened up” (uttānápad). Falk (1994: 7–10) understands uttāná to describe something whose feet are “turned upward,” perhaps the upside-down  world tree with its roots above. We take the more common approach in seeing here  an image of birth or possibly sexual availability. But then whose feet are these? If  the answer is inside the hymn, then it might be the goddess Aditi, who appears in  verse 4 and is a mother of the gods in verses 8–9. Or again, since “what exists” (sát)  is said to have arisen from “what does not exist” (ásat) in verses 2 and 3, there is per
haps an implied identification of “the one whose feet were opened up” with “what  does not exist.” Whoever or whatever the uttānápad may be, the term also contains  an oblique reference to the lower aráṇī, one of the pieces of wood used to kindle  the sacrificial fire. See, for example, III.29.3ab addressing the priests, uttānā́yām áva  bharā cikitvā́n, sadyáḥ právītā vŕ̥ṣaṇaṃ jajāna “Attentive, bear down upon her who  is opened up (uttānā́) [=the lower fire-churning stick]. Impregnated on this day, she  has given birth to the bull [=Agni].” That is to say, the appearance of fire from the  fire-churning wood replicates the emergence of “what exists” from “what does not  exist.”
In verse 4cd the poet describes the paradoxical birth of Aditi from Dakṣa and  Dakṣa from Aditi. Aditi is not only a goddess, but also a principle, the principle of  Innocence or Offenselessness against the gods. Likewise, Dakṣa can be a god per sonifying ritual Skill. Their birth from one another may signify the mutual depen dence of freedom from offense against the gods and ritual skill, both of which are  necessary to carry out the sacrifice. Similarly, there may also be reference to the sac rifice in verse 5d, in which the gods are said to be amŕ̥tabandhavaḥ. The compound  can mean that the gods are kin of the “immortal” Soma or Agni or that they are kin  “to immortality” or that they are connected to the immortal waters (Falk 1994: 13).  There are possible references to the ritual or ritual mythology in the succeeding
1500 X.72
verses as well. Thus, in 6d tīvrá, “sharp” or “bitter,” is a typical description of soma.  Or again in 7a the Yatis are ritual priests, whose death resulted in the rains that swell  “the living worlds” (cf. Jamison 1991: 111). And finally in 7cd the sun in the waters  can be a figure describing soma (cf. Oberlies 1999: 164–65) or fire.
The last two verses describe the birth of immortals, Aditi’s “seven sons,” with  whom she went to the ancient generation of gods (vs. 9ab), and the birth of mortals,  who are born from a “dead egg” (Hoffmann 1976b [=1992: 723]), a divine miscar riage, both “for procreation” and “for death” (9cd).
As a cosmology the hymn invites comparison with X.129.
1. Now amid acclaim we will proclaim the births of the gods,
so that one in a later generation will see (them) as the hymns are recited. 2. The Lord of the Sacred Formulation [=Br̥haspati] smelted these (births)  like a smith.
In the ancient generation of the gods, what exists was born from what  does not exist.
3. In the first generation of the gods, what exists was born from what does  not exist.
The regions of space were born following that (which exists)—that
(which exists) was born from the one whose feet were opened up.
4. The earth was born from the one whose feet were opened up; from the  earth the regions of space were born.
From Aditi, Dakṣa was born, and from Dakṣa, Aditi.
5. Because Aditi was born—she who is your daughter, o Dakṣa—
following her, the gods were born, the auspicious kin of the
immortal one.
6. When, o gods, well clasped to one another, you stood there in the ocean, then the bitter dust [=spray] dispersed from you, like (the dust [=sweat?])  of those dancing.
7. When, o gods, just as the Yatis did, you swelled the living worlds,
then you brought here the sun, which was hidden in the sea.
8. Eight are the sons of Aditi, which were born from her body.
With seven she went forth to the gods. She cast away the one stemming  from a dead egg.
9. With seven sons Aditi went forth to the ancient generation.
For procreation but also for death, she brought here again the one
stemming from a dead egg.
Two hymns to Indra (73–74) are ascribed to Gaurivīti Śaktyā; the first is quite com plex, the second quite straightforward. X.73 (899) Indra
Gaurivīti Śaktyā
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A dense and difficult hymn, with many cryptic allusions to Indra’s birth and some  of his exploits. The Anukramaṇī ascribes it to the same poet as V.29, the first Indra  hymn in the Vth Maṇḍala, and indeed this hymn has links to some of the fragmen tary narratives in the early Indra hymns of V, especially V.30 and 31.
The hymn begins and ends with the birth of Indra; the unusual and difficult  nature of that birth was also the subject of IV.18. In verses 1–2ab it seems that  Indra’s mother was beset with some trouble at the time of his birth. Nonetheless,  he was successfully born but required strengthening by the Maruts. The account  of his birth at the beginning of the hymn is quite straightforward when compared  to the one given in verse 10, where several alternative sources of Indra are sug
gested. The common opinion seems to be that he “came from a (male) horse,”  though “I” (the poet) have a different view. And the last word (or non-word) is  Indra’s: “whence he was born, only Indra knows that.”
The material immediately after the birth story is extremely cryptic, and our  interpretation is quite speculative. We believe that verses 2cd–5ab combine two  motifs: a ritual situation, the early-morning sacrifice, and a mythological one, the  image of Indra as cosmic begetter and tender parent. The dawn ritual is suggested  by the Aśvins’ journey to the sacrifice with Indra (3d, 4b) and the apparent men
tion of early morning in 2d. The mythological material is harder to evaluate and  to bring into a coherent schema. In 2cd it seems that something, quite possibly the  worlds, were covered, perhaps sexually, by a “great foot(print),” and from the dark ness there came embryos, presumably engendered in this encounter. Since Indra’s  feet are mentioned in the next verse (3a), it seems likely that the “great foot” in verse  2 is Indra, covering the worlds and begetting the embryos.
Verse 4 brings us the curious image of Indra with a thousand hyenas in his  mouth. Though Geldner, for example, considers this simply a measure of how big  a mouth Indra has and specifically denies that it has anything to do with the wide spread Brāhmaṇa stories of Indra and the hyenas, this seems disingenuous. Since  the hyena word appears only twice in the R̥gveda and only once in conjunction  with Indra, it seems perverse not to explore the possible connection with these later  tales. The Brāhmaṇa narratives and the light they may shed on this passage are  discussed at length in Jamison (1991: pt 1). Suffice it to say that hyenas carry their  young around in their mouths like cats, and the image here suggests that Indra is  functioning as an attentive parent to his brood. Another aspect of Indra’s parental  role may be found in the next verse (4cd), where Indra “makes fast” thousands in  an otherwise unidentified female: “make fast” seems a reasonable euphemism for  impregnate or implant embryos. This section concerning Indra’s fatherhood seems  to come to an end in 5ab.
1502 X.73
After this we turn to Indra’s great deeds, especially the slaying of Namuci (5cd– 7), a deed also treated in the related hymn V.30.7–8. Why the abrupt switch from  Indra as parent to Indra as killer? The answer probably lies in the early-morning  context of this hymn. Indra famously vowed not to kill Namuci by day or by night,  or with a weapon dry or wet. The weapon, according to later accounts, was foam  (also glancingly alluded to in VIII.14.13), and the time of slaughter the morning  twilight—the exact time depicted in the hymn. We also consider the “darkening  mists and darkness” of 5d to be the weapon used for the slaughter (rather than the  later foam), since mist, too, counts neither as wet nor as dry. This mist, diffused like  smoke, though directed at Namuci, settles “even on the two of the same name,”  whom we identify as the Aśvins, mentioned several times previously in the hymn,  who make their journey during the early morning twilight.
Verse 8 summarizes Indra’s accomplishment of his deeds by way of his epi thets and acknowledges the applause of the gods, but it ends (8d) with a cryptic  allusion to another of Indra’s deeds, continued, in our view, in the first pāda of  verse 9. Another tale favored in the early Indra hymns of Maṇḍala V is the chariot  race between Indra and the Sun, in which Indra steals the Sun’s wheel and puts  his chariot in front of the Sun’s, though it had been behind (see, e.g., V.31.11). The  “topsy-turvy” outcome of 8d and the stuck wheel of 9a are suggestive of this myth.  The rest of verse 9 simply celebrates Indra’s fructifying of the plants and animals,  which may remind us of his parental role earlier in the hymn, and with verse 10 we  return to his mysterious birth. In the final verse (11) the poets ask Indra for aid in  their plight.
1. You were born as the strong one for powerful might, the gladdening  strongest one with manifold designs.
It was just the Maruts who strengthened Indra then, when his mother,  best at pushing (in childbirth) [/running], was going to set the hero to  running.
2. She, even though caressing (him), was sunk down because of the
activities of (demonic?) deceit. They [=Maruts] strengthened Indra
much with their laud.
These (worlds) were as if covered over [/sexually “covered”] by a
great footprint [=Indra]. From the dark, from the early morning,
embryos arose.
3. Lofty are your feet when you go forth. The Vājas and whatever (others)  were there strengthened (you).
You, Indra, took a thousand young hyenas in your mouth. You should  turn the Aśvins hither.
4. In the same way—swiftly—you drive to the sacrifice; convey the Nāsatyas  hither for fellowship.
Indra, you made fast thousands in the wife of the good one
[=impregnated her?]; the Aśvins gave bounties, o champion. 5. Becoming exhilarated, to produce progeny from truth, Indra (went) to  the goal with his vigorous comrades.
Because with these (wiles of his) he came right up to the Dasyu
[=Namuci], to his wiles, he scattered forth darkening mists and
darkness.
6. You sent the smoke for him [=Namuci] down even on the two of the  same name [=Aśvins]; you smashed (him) down, Indra, like the cart
of Dawn.
You went with your lofty, avid comrades; at one blow you smashed his  heart’s foundations.
7. You smote Namuci who sought combat, rendering the Dāsa without  wiles, for the seer.
You made the paths comfortable for Manu, as if they went straightaway  to the gods.
8. You have fulfilled your names completely; showing mastery, you have  taken (them) in your fist.
The gods cheer you on in your vast power. You turned the wooden
things [=chariots?] topsy-turvy,
9. When his wheel was sunk down in the waters. And that should seem  just honey to him,
the udder bound tight onto the earth, the milk that you placed in the  cows and in the plants.
10. When they say, “he came from a horse,” I think of him rather as born  from strength:
he came from (battle) fervor; he stayed in a secure house [=womb?]. But  whence he was born, (only) Indra knows that.
11. The fine-feathered birds have flocked to Indra—the Priyamedhas, seers  in need.
Open up the dark (place); fill our eye. Free us who are bound as if by  a snare.
## 74 (900) Indra
Gaurivīti Śaktyā
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Although attributed to the same poet as the last hymn and also dedicated to  Indra, this hymn fortunately lacks the challenges that X.73 poses—and in fact  takes awhile to get to Indra. The first three verses simply announce the poet’s  intention to praise the gods and ask them to travel to the sacrifice with goods  to bestow. The last three verses (4–6) turn to Indra exclusively, suggesting first  in verse 4, via an allusion to the Vala myth and, possibly, to the Maruts’ mother1504 X.75
Pr̥śni, the sacrificers’ desire for cows and sons. More praise for Indra follows in  verses 5–6, with the final pāda (6d) expressing the expectation that Indra will  fulfill our desires.
1. Seeking to gain (their favor), I pay tribute to the Vasus or to the two  world-halves, by inspired thought or by sacrifices,
or to the steeds that become rich at the (occasion for) winning, or to
those who hear well [=gods] who set the eager one to find good
hearing.
2. At the invocation to them the lordly one [=Agni] will reach heaven; with  a mind seeking fame he will kiss the earth,
at the time when the gods, looking for easy passage, will equip
themselves with their own choice things, like heaven (with stars).
3. Here is the song for these immortals, who in their entirety long for (it as  their) treasure.
Bringing to success both inspired thought and sacrifice, let them
establish a mass of goods for us, and not by halves.
4. The Āyus admire this (greatness?) of yours, Indra—they who will wish to  drill through to the enclosure full of cows [=Vala],
who wish to milk the great (cow [=Pṛśni?]) who gives birth only once but  has many sons, the lofty one with a thousand streams.
5. Cause able Indra to help you—the unbowable one who subdues the  battlers,
the master of the R̥bhus, liberal, who (receives) well-twisted (hymns),  the possessor of many cattle who bears the mace appropriate to
superior men.
6. When the previous victor won the latest of many, Indra the
Vr̥tra-smasher fulfilled his names:
he appeared as the powerful lord of victory. What we wish him to do,  that he will do.
The next two hymns (75–76) are attributed to different poets, at least the second  quite fancifully, by the Anukramaṇī, but clearly form a dyad (Oldenberg 1888: 236  n. 3). The first is devoted to the rivers, the second to the pressing stones.
## 75 (901) Rivers
Sindhukṣit Praiyamedha
9 verses: jagatī
This hymn celebrates the headlong glories of rivers, especially the Sindhu, here pre sented as the principal river into which all the others flow (see esp. vs. 4). As with the hymns to Sarasvatī (VI.61, VII.95–96), this one contains both naturalistic, if  hyperbolic, description of the river (vss. 3, 7) and depictions of her as a beauti ful woman and a prizewinning horse. Especially notable in the hymn is the litany  of river names in verses 5–6, which many scholars have mined for geographical  information.
1. At the seat of Vivasvant [=ritual ground] the bard will speak forth your  highest greatness, o waters,
for forth they strode in three stages, seven each time; forth (strode)
Sindhu with her strength, beyond that of the (other) flowing (waters). 2. Varuṇa dug out the paths for you to travel, when, o Sindhu, you ran to  the prizes.
You travel on a slope along the back of the earth, when you direct the  front rank of these moving (beings).
3. Her sound takes its place in heaven, above the earth. She sends up  snorting without end along with radiance.
Like rains from a cloud her “rains” thunder forth, when Sindhu goes like  an ever-bellowing bull.
4. To you, Sindhu, like mothers to their young, like milk-cows with their  milk do they [=tributary rivers] rush bellowing.
It’s you who lead them as a battling king does the two “seams” (of
the army), when you seek to reach the front rank of these sloping
(waters).
5. Here, o Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī—attend on this praise of mine, o  Śutudrī, Paruṣṇī.
With the Asiknī, o Marudvr̥dhā, with the Vitastā, o Ārjīkīyā, harken,  with the Suṣomā.
6. To travel first joined with the Tr̥ṣṭāmā, (then) with the Susartū, the Rasā,  and this Śvetyā,
you, o Sindhu, (come) with the Kubhā to the Gomatī, with the Mehatnū to the Krumu, on the same chariot (with all these), with which you go  speeding.
7. Straight in her course, mottled, glistening, in her greatness she holds  encircled the expanses, the dusky realms—
the undeceivable Sindhu, busiest of the busy, dappled-bright like a mare,  lovely to see like a beautiful woman.
8. Sindhu has lovely horses, lovely chariots, lovely garments; she is golden,  well-fashioned, rich in prize mares;
the young woman is rich in wool [=foam], in sīlamā (plants?); and the  well-portioned one puts on (a garment/plant) increasing the honey.
9. Sindhu has yoked her own well-naved, horsed chariot; with it she will  gain the prize in this contest here,
for the great greatness of it invites admiration—it undeceivable,
self-glorious, conferring abundance.

Of the three hymns dedicated to the pressing stones (X.76, X.94, and X.175), X.175  is brief and minimalist. Hymns X.94 and X.76 have a number of phrases and images  in common, but X.94 is more charming than X.76, with vivid and imaginative com parisons and a light tone, while X.76 is perhaps more rhetorically ambitious, with  some mythological and cosmic resonances, as well as some challenging syntax. The  stones are more often addressed in the 2nd person and with imperatives in X.76 (no  imperatives are addressed to the stones in X.94). This implicit attribution of agency  to the stones becomes more pronounced toward the end of this hymn, where they  seem to supplant the human pressers. The word náraḥ “superior men” is found in  verses 6–8; although the first two occurrences could be interpreted as referring to  humans, the last is a vocative addressed to the stones—which makes it clear that in  the previous two verses the “men” must be the stones as well.
1. I stretch straight toward you at the first dawn flushes of nourishment.  Anoint Indra, the Maruts, and the two world-halves,
so that both day and night, in partnership, will make every seat spacious  for us as they break out.
2. Press this as the best pressing. Like a racehorse controlled by the hands,  the stone is in (the control of) the presser.
Because it finds the masculine power that is overwhelming to the
stranger, for the sake of great wealth he [=presser] also attains to (that  masculine power), which (comes) from the steed [=stone].
3. For it has labored at just this pressing, at its task. Just as previously  (Indra) set the course for Manu
to Tvaṣṭar’s (wealth?), which was flooding with cows and arrayed in
horses, they have set ceremonies upon ceremonies.
4. Smash away the demons with their wreckage. Block Dissolution. Repel  heedlessness.
Press out wealth in hale heroes for us. Carry a tune that pursues the
gods, you stones.
5. To you, more formidable even than Heaven, swifter working even than  Vibhvan,
more soma-frenzied even than Vāyu, better food-preparers even than  Agni—sing!
6. Let the glorious ones clatter for us—let it press (soma) out of the stalk— the stones with their voice, (which is) heaven-bound, heavenly,
when the superior men milk the desirable honey for themselves, making  (Heaven and Earth) heed all about as they [=stones] cross each other  transversely. 7. The stones, the charioteers, press the soma. They milk out the juice of  him who seeks the cows.
They milk the udder, to pour it out. As superior men they groom (the  soma), like oblations, with their mouths.
8. You superior men, you have become the good workers who press soma  for Indra—you stones.
Every thing of value of yours is for the heavenly domain; every good  thing of yours for the earthly presser.
The next two hymns (77–78), attributed to Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava and dedicated  to the Maruts, share an unusual metrical structure and a rhetorical scheme.  Although according to the Anukramaṇī the meter is triṣṭubh, in fact in X.77  only the last three verses (6–8) really conform to that meter, and in X.78 only the  last (8). Most of the rest of the verses have eleven-syllable pādas, as is diagnostic  of triṣṭubh, but clear jagatī cadences, an even more diagnostic test. As Oldenberg  has shown (1888: 92–95), most such pādas have an opening of five syllables, end
ing with a light syllable (regularly ná “like”), followed by two heavy syllables,  the first of which seems to substitute for the double-light break usual after an  opening of five. (There is also often a word-break after these two heavy syllables,  seeming to produce a second caesura in the line.) The apparent equivalence of  the heavy sixth syllable with two light syllables introduces a principle of substi
tution or responsion not otherwise found in Vedic, or most Classical Sanskrit,  meters, a principle that only achieves prominence in the Āryā meter quite pos sibly deriving from Middle Indo-Aryan.
## 77 (903) Maruts
Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava
8 verses: triṣṭubh (and mangled jagatī)
On the metrical structure, see the introduction just above.
Rhetorically the hymn (through vs. 5)  is dominated by similes, often studied  and syntactically complex ones, with three or four similes in every verse. When the  dense concentration of similes ends (beginning with vs. 6), the meter returns to con ventional triṣṭubh and to conventional hymn-ending expressions of hope for favor.
Most of the descriptions of the Maruts, however contorted their syntax, belong  to the familiar repertoire of Marut characteristics: their stormy nature, their asso ciation with Indra, their beauty and ornaments, their boisterousness. However,  twice they are connected with the Ādityas (vss. 2d, 8b), a group of gods with which  they generally have nothing in common. This connection is puzzling. Thieme  (1938: 158) suggests that their common quality was “caring for the stranger” (if that  is what the disputed word ríśādas, also found twice in the hymn [vss. 3, 5], means).
1508 X.77
1. Like (the Maruts) showering (rain) from a cloud with their speech  [=thunder], I will shower goods with my speech. The sacrifices of a  discerning one [=poet] are like [=just as good as] those provided with  oblations.
I have praised the flock of them as if praising the Formulator [=Indra?],  who is well provided with Maruts—have praised them for their  worthiness (of soma), as if for their beauty.
2. For their splendor the young bloods have provided themselves with  ornaments across the many nights, just as they have made (the
Formulator) well provided with Maruts.
The sons of heaven have taken their places like antelopes; (as) Ādityas  they have grown strong like foals [?].
3. Those who by themselves project beyond heaven as beyond earth  mightily, like the sun beyond the clouds,
inviting admiration like heroes of (great) dimension, heaven-bound like  young bloods who care for the stranger.
4. At your journey—as if (resting) on a base of waters, as if going with  faltering step, the great (earth) becomes slack.
There is a sacrifice consisting of all good things close by. It is for  you. Like dispensers of ritual delight, come here to those who are  concentrated (on you).
5. With your reins [/rays] you are like (horses) hitched up to the  chariot-poles—like light-bearing (fires) at the early brightenings with  your beam—
self-glorious like falcons, caring for the stranger—when (just) launched,  (you are) like water birds, showering (drops) all around.
6. When you drive yourselves forth from afar, Maruts, you (come as) the  ones who know of the great enclosure of goods,
of goods to be realized, o good ones. Even from a distance keep hatred  far away.
7. The descendant of Manu who, like (Agni) standing up at the ceremony,  will do ritual service to the Maruts at the sacrifice when the chant is  raised,
he will acquire rich vitality abounding in good heroes. Let him be in the  protection of the gods.
8. For they are helpers worthy to receive sacrifice at the sacrifices, the best  luck-bringers, by the Ādityan name.
Let them aid our inspiration, (like a horse) that outstrips chariots, as  they take pleasure in the journey of their great (host) and in the  ceremony. X.78 (904) Maruts
Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava
8 verses: triṣṭubh and jagatī
This hymn has the same unusual meter as X.77 and, like X.77, is structured as a  series of similes. In fact, this hymn goes further than the previous hymn in both  features. The only standard triṣṭubh verse is the final one (8), which also breaks the  rhetorical pattern. And the similes not only continue throughout the hymn (until vs.  8) but are under more rigid syntactic control. It is worth discussing in some detail  how the poet has crafted his hymn and how the apparently rigid repetitive structure,  with each pāda containing exactly one simile, still allows the possibility of forward  momentum and rhetorical climax. (See also Jamison 2007: 77–79.)
Each of the first seven verses of this eight-verse hymn contains four pāda-length  similes, each marked with ná “like,” and with the point of comparison almost  always positioned at pāda-end. Since in runs of similes it is common to alternate  between the simile-markers ná and iva, the complete avoidance of iva in this hymn  is noteworthy and the regular repetition of ná contributes to the sense of regimenta
tion. Furthermore, the ná is almost exclusively in second position in the pāda and  is generally the last syllable of the opening (before an often irregular break: see the  introduction to X.77).
All of these similes are in the nominative plural masculine, with the Maruts  always the subject. This rigid syntactic structure, reinforced by its coinciding  exactly with metrical units, has an almost claustrophobic effect—an effect signifi cantly enhanced by the fact that the first six verses are entirely nominal in their  syntax:  in these twenty-four separate clausal similes there is not one finite verb  or even predicated participle. (This exclusively nominal style cannot be entirely  captured in translation.) This syntactic stasis contrasts markedly with the nature  of the subjects being celebrated, for the Maruts are the most active gods in the  R̥gveda. Moreover, many of the similes in this hymn concern the Maruts’ uncon
trollable energy, despite the motionless quality of the poetic form. The disjunc tion between content and form produces a remarkable aesthetic effect. Yet the  effect is not of complete stasis even in these verses, for the subjects of the similes  modulate from verse to verse, while the complexity of imagery increases gradu ally. For examples, the winds appear in verses 2 and 3 in different images, likewise  bride-seeking young men in verses 4 and 5, with two types of stones and two types  of mothers in verse 6.
And then finally in verse 7 the straitjacket of nominal style is broken: though this  verse, too, contains four pāda-length similes, both hemistichs end with finite verbs,  7b vy àśvitan “they have shone forth,” 7d mamire “they have measured.” While  maintaining the underlying structure that unifies the hymn, the poet manages, by  strictly grammatical means, to build to a climax. The energy kept suppressed by the  nominal style is finally released by the finite verbs of verse 7.
1510 X.78
The last verse (8), which is, as noted, the only standard triṣṭubh, abandons the  structure of the rest of the hymn, and in conventional terms asks the gods for the  usual gifts, as so often in final verses. But it is noteworthy for containing the first  and only occurrence of the name marút in the hymn. Retroactively we can see that  the hymn also functions as a very long riddle, whose answer is given only in this last  verse. This verse is linked to what precedes by a small and subtle verbal device. As  noted, twenty-five of the twenty-eight preceding pādas begin X ná, with the simile  marker in second position; verse 8 begins X no (i.e., naḥ “us”). The poet invites us  to expect yet another simile, but substitutes the phonetically similar 1st-person plu ral enclitic pronoun in its place. Thus, though the verse is cast in entirely different  stylistic terms from the rest of the hymn, its integral connection to what precedes is  signaled by the playful naḥ. (Note that the naḥ is entirely unnecessary in this verse,  since it redundantly doubles and anticipates the full pronoun asmā́n opening the  second pāda.)
1. Rich in purpose like inspired poets with their thoughts, rich in profit like  those who pursue the gods with sacrifices,
lovely to look at like brilliant kings, unblemished like the young bloods  of the settlements—
2. Who, with brilliants on their breasts, are like fire with their flash; like the  winds, their own yokemates, bringing immediate aid;
providing good guidance like elders who think ahead, providing good  shelter like soma drinks to the one pursuing truth—
3. Who like the boisterous winds are always on the move, radiating like the  tongues of fires,
vehement like armored warriors, bringing lovely gifts like the lauds of  the ancestors—
4. Who, like the spokes of chariots, have the same nave(l), heaven bound  like victorious champions,
showering ghee [=rain] as young bloods gone awooing shower (goods),  of good rhythm like those who sound a chant—
5. Who are swift like superior horses, of good gifts [/drops] like charioteers  seeking to acquire (brides),
always on the move with their moisture like the waters with their
depths, displaying all forms through their melodies like the
Aṅgirases—
6. Like pressing stones, the patrons have a river as their mother; like rocks  they always keep pounding.
Playful like little children with good mothers, like a great host (of
warriors) on their journey and with their turmoil—
7. Like the beacons of the dawns providing splendor to the ceremony,  like those in pursuit of beauty they have shone forth with their
ornaments— coursing like rivers, those with glinting spears have measured out the  stages of their journey like the distant realms.
8. O gods, make us possessed of good portions, good treasures,
strengthening us as your praisers, o Maruts, when you have been
strengthened.
Give study to our praise song, to our fellowship. For from long ago
occasions for the conferring of treasures have been yours.
The next two Agni hymns (79–80) belong together.
## 79 (905) Agni
Agni Saucīka or Agni Vaiśvānara or Sapti Vājambhara
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn begins with a 1st-person vision (“I have seen...”) and in its middle verse  (4) announces a truth, again in the 1st person—though the speaker disclaims real  discernment for himself, while ascribing it to the god Agni. Such rhetorical moves  are typical of omphalos hymns, but the mystery in this hymn seems less profound  than the structure in which it is embedded seems to promise. It is simply the com
mon trope of Agni as an insatiable eater, with a nice twist in verse 6, where the poet  commiserates with Agni for having, because of imagined sins, to eat without teeth.  Although the supposed enigma of this hymn is not particularly enigmatic, the style  is lively and the images sharp.
1. I have seen the greatness of him, the great one, of the immortal one  among the mortal clans.
His jaws are alternately opened up and closed together again. Insatiable,  gnawing, they eat amply.
2. His head is deposited in hiding; his eyes set apart. Insatiable, he eats the  wood with his tongue.
With their feet they [=priests] collect things for him to eat, their hands  outstretched with reverence among the clans.
3. Questing further and further for the hidden place of his mother like a  child, he creeps through the wide plants.
He [=priest?] found him, gleaming like ripened grain, licking within the  lap of the mount [?].
4. I proclaim this truth to you, o you two World-Halves: while being born,  the embryo eats his two mothers [=kindling sticks].
As a mortal, I do not discern the god, but Agni certainly discerns afar  and discerns ahead.
1512 X.80
5. Whoever sets out dry food for him, pours oblations with melted butter  and ghee for him, and prospers (him),
for that (man) you gaze afar with your thousand eyes. Agni, you face in  every direction.
6. What sin of omission or commission have you done before the gods?  I now ask you, Agni, since I do not know.
Whether at play or not, tawny (Agni) has to eat without teeth. You
have cut apart (the wood) piece by piece, as a knife does a cow joint
by joint.
7. Born in the wood, he has yoked his own horses that face in all directions,  controlled by reins that stretch straight.
Our well-born ally has carved up (the meal) together with the good
(gods); he has come together with (all) his parts, having grown strong.
## 80 (906) Agni
Agni Saucīka or Agni Vaiśvānara
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The most salient feature of this hymn is the form of the word agní that begins every  pāda. In the first half of the hymn (vss. 1–4) the form is almost exclusively nomina tive singular (save for the genitives in 2a and 4d), while the second half has primar ily the accusative. As so often, the final verse breaks the pattern: the first trisyllabic  form (dat. agnáye in 7a) is followed by two vocatives (ágne) in the last hemistich  (7cd), a simple grammatical switch that turns the insistently descriptive 3rd-person  cast of the rest of the hymn into a direct, 2nd-person plea to the god for help and  wealth.
The actual contents of the hymn are subordinated to this formal structure.  Most of the first half of the hymn is devoted to detailing the gifts and aid that  Agni generally provides, though verse 3 briskly mentions four mythological prec edents where Agni has aided specific individuals, somewhat in the style of the cata logues of good deeds in Aśvin hymns. (In fact, the only reasonably well-known  figure in vs. 3 is Atri [3c], whose rescue is usually attributed to the Aśvins.) Verses  5–6 establish Agni as the target of all creatures in need. In the final verse (7) the  poet both announces his hymn, produced on the model of the R̥bhus, and states  what he wants in return.
1. Agni gives a prize-bringing team; Agni (gives) a hero, worthy of fame,  outstanding through his work—
Agni roams widely through the two world-halves, anointing them
completely—Agni (gives) a woman with a hero in her belly, Plenitude  (herself). 2. Let Agni’s kindling be auspicious and of profit. Agni has entered the two  great world-halves.
Agni propels the one in battles; Agni divides up the many obstacles.
3. Agni helped this Jaratkarṇa [/ear of the old man]; Agni burned Jarūtha  out from the waters.
Agni gave freedom to Atri, (who was) within the hot vessel; Agni
brought Nr̥medha together with offspring.
4. Agni gives wealth whose ornament is heroes; Agni (gives) a seer who  wins thousands.
Agni stretches the oblation to heaven; Agni’s domains are dispersed in  many places.
5. It’s Agni whom seers vie in calling upon with their recitations; Agni (do)  men when hard-pressed on an expedition;
Agni (do) birds flying in the midspace. Agni encircles thousands of cows. 6. It’s Agni whom the clans stemming from Manu invoke; Agni (do) those  born variously from Manu and from Nahus.
Agni (has found) the Gandharvan path of truth; Agni’s pasture-land is  set down in ghee.
7. For Agni did the R̥bhus fashion their formulation; to Agni have we  spoken a great, well-turned (hymn).
O Agni, youngest one—further the singer; o Agni, win great wealth by  sacrifice.
Two hymns (X.81–82) to Viśvakarman are attributed to the dedicand himself.
## 81 (907) Visvakarman ́
Viśvakarman Bhauvana
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Viśvakarman, the “Maker of Everything” (or literally, “who has the making of  everything”), is the carpenter (vs. 4ab) and smith (vs. 3cd) of creation, who fash ioned the world. But he is also both an ancient seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and Hotar (vs. 1) and a  present companion (vs. 5cd) and help (vs. 7) to the sacrificers, for his priestly work  has continued from the ancient past into the present (vs. 1cd). This priestly work  is closely connected with his creative work. He wins heaven and earth by a sacri fice that he carries out for his own sake (vs. 6ab), and his ritual work is dedicated  to the benefit of the realms he surveys (vs. 5). In the first line the poet speaks of  Viśvakarman’s “pouring” beings “in oblation” (júhvat). It is not clear exactly what  he means by that phrase, but it likely describes a process by which Viśvakarman  sustains the living world through time or continues to make living beings his own.1514 X.81
The phrase must be significant, since the poet verbally recalls it in the last verse,  when he anticipates that Viśvakarman will enjoy the “oblations” (hávanāni) offered  to him. In 1c the description “seeking wealth with hope” refers to Viśvakarman’s  ritual activity, which carries the hope of prosperity for the sacrificer.
The first and last verses of the hymn create a frame for the hymn. In the first  verse, Viśvakarman is both a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) of hymns and a Hotar, who pours oblations  (júhvat). In the last he is the vācás páti- “Lord of Speech,” who “will take pleasure in  oblations (hávanāni).” That is, within the hymn, Viśvakarman begins as the model  of a priest who both speaks and makes offerings, and concludes as the master of  speech and the recipient of offerings, who supports the sacrificers. This movement  from divine priest to priestly divinity exalts poets and priests, who are closely asso ciated with him and whose words and deeds follow his.
One of the stylistic characteristics of the hymn is the echoing of Viśvakarman’s  name through the frequent use of víśva “every, all” (vss. 2d, 3ab, 7cd). Even more  striking is the repeated use of words containing the v-sound also extracted from  his name. Over a third of the words of the hymn contain that sound. Its repeti
tion is especially obvious in 5cd śíkṣā sákhibhyo havíṣi svadhāvaḥ svayáṃ yajasva  tanvàṃ vr̥dhānáḥ and 6ab víśvakarman havíṣā vāvr̥dhānáḥ svayáṃ yajasva pr̥thivī́m  utá dyā́m, two pādas that together have a string of twelve words containing v. The  invocation to Viśvakarman and his presence thus persist even when his name is not  explicitly mentioned.
1. The seer who took his place as Hotar, pouring all these living beings in  oblation—our father,
seeking wealth with hope, entered the later (generations while)
concealing the first ones.
2. What was the resting place? Which one was providing support? How  was it?—
that from which Viśvakarman, producing the earth, (also) uncovered the  heaven by his greatness—he who has his eyes on everything.
3. Whose eyes and face are turned in every direction, whose arms and feet  move in every direction,
producing heaven and earth, he forges them together with his arms, with  his fan(-bellows)—he, the god alone.
4. What was the wood? What was the tree?—out of which they fashioned  heaven and earth.
O you of inspired thought [=priests], in your thinking ask about that  upon which he rested, giving support to living beings.
5. What are your highest domains, what your lowest, and these that are  your midmost, Viśvakarman—
do your best for them for the sake of your companions at the oblation,  o you of independent will. Increasing your own person, by yourself
sacrifice for yourself. 6. O Viśvakarman, since you are increased through the oblation, by  yourself win earth and heaven by sacrifice.
Let the other peoples all around be left in confusion; for us here let there  be a generous patron!
7. We would today summon the Lord of Speech, Viśvakarman, swift as  thought, for help in the contest.
He will take pleasure in every oblation of ours—he who is luck for
everyone, whose work succeeds—to give us help.
## 82 (908) Visvakarman ́
Viśvakarman Bhauvana
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn complements the preceding one and may be the more interesting of  the two since it offers various hints about the various roles that Viśvakarman  plays. The first words of the hymn, which call Viśvakarman the “father of the  eye” (cákṣuṣaḥ pitā́), create the possibility of double reference. On the one hand,  as Geldner and Renou (EVP XV: 170) rightly see and the subordinate clause “for  he is insightful in mind” supports, the eye is the inspired vision of seers. On the  other hand, the “eye” can be the eye of the sun, as frequently in the R̥gveda (e.g.,  I.164.14, V.40.8, 59.5, X.10.9). This double possibility is realized in the remainder  of the verse, which describes both the sacrifice and the cosmos. In pāda b, the  primary reference is to the sacrifice, evident in the ghee that the father produced.  Because they are set in a sacrificial context, “the two that bob up and down” refer  initially to the sacrificial ladles (juhū́), bending to the fire. But the two can also  be heaven and earth, which rise and fall, a subsequent reading triggered by pāda  d. In 1cd there is a shift to a cosmic context, which then becomes primary, and  the sacrificial context is secondary. In 1c the phrase ántāḥ . . .pū́rve “ancient lim its”—the beginnings of the world—can also mean the “eastern limits,” the limits  from which the sacrificial area is measured. The reference to “heaven and earth”  in pāda d confirms the cosmic context of this hemistich but without excluding  sacrificial reference, for on the sacrificial ground heaven is represented by the  Āhavanīya or “offering fire” in the east and earth by the Gārhapatya or “domestic  fire” in the west. (Though those terms, ubiquitous in middle Vedic śrauta litera ture, are not used in the R̥gveda of those two fires, the polarity of the two fires is  clearly reflected in the R̥gveda.)
In verse 2a there is again an ambiguity: iṣṭá may mean what is offered in sacrifice  or what is wished for, and here both meanings are possible. But whose are these  “offerings” or “wishes”? The seers represented in the constellation of the Seven  Seers (vs. 2b) are the closest and best possibilities. The frame of reference would  then be the cosmos. Or those offering or wishing may be the “ancient seers,” who
1516 X.82
appear in verse 4. In that case the frame of reference is the sacrifice. That is to say,  the first verses describe both the creation of the sacrifice and the creation of the  world and thereby link the creation of the sacrifice to the creation of the world.
Whatever it is that Viśvakarman represents is central to these creations. He  is initially set beyond both the sacrifice and the cosmos as the “father” of poetic  vision and of the sun. But then in verse 2 he spreads throughout the sacrifice and  the world. Verse 2ab puns on his name Viśvakarman, repeating its first syllable by  the prefix vi- in vímanā “vast in mind,” víhāyā “vast in power,” and vidhātā́ “vast  distributor”—the last, the one who distributes widely. The opposite of vi-, literally  “apart,” is sam- “together, completely,” and the latter replaces vi- in 2bc in saṃdŕ̥ś “full manifestation,” a cosmic term, and sám √mad “fully invigorate,” a sacrificial  term. The lexical shifts create the sense that Viśvakarman first extends throughout  the sacrifice and the cosmos and then condenses in a perceptible form.
In the latter part of the poem, in verses 5–7, the poet explores the manifest forms  that Viśvakarman has taken. The best clue to the forms of Viśvakarman is the ref erence repeated in verses 5 and 6 to “the first embryo” that the waters received and  in which all the gods were manifest and gathered. That first embryo can represent  any or all of three realities. First, on the cosmic plane, it can be the sun, which rises  out of the waters. Thus Viśvakarman would be initially the father of the sun and  then, in manifest form, the sun itself. Second, on the sacrificial plane, the embryo  can be fire, or more specificially the sacrificial fire, which is the “child of the waters”  (apā́ṃ nápāt) and the form in which the presence of the gods at the sacrifice is  manifested. And third, perhaps uniting cosmos and sacrifice, the embryo can be the  king, who is reborn as the sun or as a sun-like being by means of the unction waters  in the royal consecration rite. For a clearer reference to such imagery in the royal  consecration rite, see X.121.
1. The father of the eye, for he is insightful in mind, gave birth to the ghee  and the two that repeatedly bob up and down [=two ladles/heaven
and earth].
Only when the ancient [/eastern] limits were fixed, only then did heaven  and earth spread out.
2. Viśvakarman is vast in mind and vast in power, the distributor—the vast  distributor—and the highest full manifestation.
Their offerings [/wishes] are fully invigorated by nourishment where,  beyond the Seven Seers [=the Big Dipper], they say the one is.
3. To him who is our father and progenitor, who is the vast distributor, who  knows the domains and living beings, all of them,
who is the giver of names to the gods, the one alone—to him go the
other living beings to make peace.
4. Like singers, the ancient seers together won for him wealth in abundance  by sacrifice—
they who together created these creatures after the airy realm, sunlit and  unsunlit, took its seat. 5. Was it beyond heaven, beyond this earth, beyond lords and gods?
What first embryo did the waters receive, where all the gods appeared  together?
6. Just this first embryo did the waters receive, where all the gods gathered  together:
the one fitted upon the navel of the unborn, that upon which all living  beings have taken their places.
7. You [=other priests] will not find him who gave birth to these things. For  you another thing has come between.
Covered by mist and muttering, feeding on life, they wander about,
reciting their solemn speech.
The next two hymns are dedicated to Battle Fury (Manyú) and assigned to a poet  whose name is transparently derived from the hymn itself, Manyu Tāpasa, or Battle  Fury, son of Fervor (for Fervor, see 83.2d).
## 83 (909) Battle Fury
Manyu Tāpasa
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1
This hymn begins with four verses praising Manyu for his might and victory-bring ing qualities and entreating him to use these qualities against our enemies. The  following three verses (5–7) strike a more personal note, with a 1st-person speaker,  apparently deserted by Manyu for some undetermined reason. The speaker begs  Manyu to return to his side, so that together they can smite the enemy.
1. Who has done honor to you, o Battle Fury—you mace, you missile—he  prospers in due order in all victorious might and strength.
Might we be victorious over Dāsa and Ārya with you as yokemate, with  victorious might, created by might, possessing might.
2. Battle Fury was Indra, just Battle Fury was (every?) god; Battle Fury was  the Hotar, Varuṇa, Jātavedas.
Battle Fury do the clans that stem from Manu reverently invoke. Protect  us, Battle Fury, in concert with Fervor.
3. Attack, Battle Fury, stronger than strong. With Fervor as yokemate  smite away our rivals.
Foe-smiting, obstacle-smiting, and Dasyu-smiting, bring all good things  here to us.
4. For you, Battle Fury, having overwhelming strength, are self-generated  Wrath, victorious over hostility.
Common to all domains, victorious, possessing victorious might, confer  strength on us in battle.
1518 X.84
5. Being without a portion, I have gone off far away, because of your  intention, you forceful and discerning one.
Unintentionally I have angered you, Battle Fury. In your own person  come to me to give me power.
6. Here I am—yours! Come right up here near to me face to face, o
victorious one who suckles all.
Battle Fury, mace-bearer; turn here toward me—we two shall smite the  Dasyus—and be mindful of your friend.
7. Go forth on attack: be on my right side. Then we shall keep smiting  obstacles in abundance.
I offer to you the foundation and the top of the honey. We two shall
both first drink silently.
## 84 (910) Battle Fury
Manyu Tāpasa
7 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, jagatī 4–7
Like the last hymn, this one is a simple address to Manyu “Battle Fury” asking  for his aid in our battles, as well as in the division of the spoils. Rhetorically the  hymn is characterized by verbal chaining:  almost every verse ends with a word  picked up by the very beginning of the next verse. Thus, “fire” in 1d/2a, “alone”  3d/4a, “victory” 4d/5a, “ready to hand” 5d/6a, “pour in” 6d/7a; only 2d/3a lacks  this concatenation.
1. Let them go forth on attack on the same chariot with you, o Battle  Fury, you Marut-friend—doing damage, bristling with excitement,
emboldened,
possessing sharp arrows, having honed their weapons—the superior men  with fire’s form.
2. Flaring like fire, o Battle Fury, be victorious. Be our army-leader,
victorious one, when you are invoked.
On smiting our rivals, share out their possessions. Showing the measure  of your strength, shove aside the scorners.
3. Vanquish hostility for us, Battle Fury. Breaking, crushing, crushing out,  advance on our rivals.
Formidable is your dimension: they have never confined it. Exerting your  will, you lead at will, you who are born alone.
4. You alone are reverently invoked by many, Battle Fury. Hone every clan  for battle.
O one of unbroken brilliance, with you as yokemate we raise our
heavenly cry for victory. 5. Creating victory like Indra, without talking us down, Battle Fury,  become our overlord here.
We hymn your dear name, victorious one. We know the wellspring
whence you came to be ready to hand.
6. Born together with readiness, you mace, you missile, you bear highest  victorious might, o overwhelming one.
(Born?) together with your resolve, share the fat with us, Battle Fury, at  the pouring in of great spoils, o much-invoked one.
7. The spoils, both those that have poured in and those that have been  collected, let Battle Fury and Varuṇa give to us.
Let our rivals, having set fear in their own hearts, defeated, hide
themselves away.
With X.85 begins the series of individual hymns that will last to the end of the Xth  Maṇḍala.
## 85 (911) Wedding
Sūryā Sāvitrī
47 verses: anuṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 14, 19–21, 23–24, 26, 36–37, 44; jagatī 18, 27, 43;  urobrhat ̥ ī 34
This first hymn of the single-hymn group, long and episodic, treats the domes tic ritual of the wedding. Many of the verses are found also in the Atharvaveda  (Śaunaka) wedding hymns (XIV.1–2) and are utilized in the gr̥hya sūtras (the proto cols of the domestic rituals) in the wedding rite.
It begins (vss. 1–19) with a fairly coherent account of the wedding of Sūryā,  the Daughter of the Sun, whose marriage serves as the prototype of human mar riage. She is also named by the Anukramaṇī as the author of the hymn, a clearly  fanciful ascription. The bridegroom is Soma, and the first five verses are devoted  to asserting that this is not the familiar earthly soma, the ritual drink (see esp. vss.  3–4), but rather the celestial Soma—here identified for the first time as the moon,  an identification that becomes standard later. The waning and waxing of the moon  are referred to in verse 5, and probably cryptically in the first part of verse 4, in the  puzzling adjective “those whose regulation is sheltering” (āchádvidhāna), using an  idiom otherwise used for the regulation of the months and seasons (e.g., in vs. 18).
The next verses (6–12) employ a style familiar from the Atharvaveda and from  middle Vedic prose, a structured series of identifications between cosmic and every day entities; the everyday entities here are the different features of the wedding, and  especially the wedding vehicle. Much in these verses is unclear for several reasons.  For one thing, workaday language is seldom found in these high-culture texts, and
1520 X.85
so the words for the members of the wedding party and the pieces of the bridal  finery and wedding cart are unfamiliar. Moreover, the cosmic comparanda are dif ficult to penetrate as they seem to refer to unidentified astronomical bodies and  movements. Verses 13–16 focus on a single episode in the marriage ritual, the “woo ing.” Judging from later practice, the bridegroom’s party sends several males to  the potential bride’s home, to ask her father and other male members of the fam ily for her as bride for the man they represent. This part of the ceremony begins  with the wooers identifying themselves by name and lineage—the “pointing out”  of verse 15. In this hymn the Aśvins are the wooers, arriving on their characteristic  three-wheeled chariot, whose wheels provide the topic for a series of (presumably  astronomical) riddles (vss. 15–16). (For further discussion see Jamison 1996a: 222– 24.) After a verse of homage (17), this part of the hymn ends with two further verses  of riddles about the sun and moon (18–19).
After this long, more-or-less self-contained mythological and cosmological  opening the hymn continues with verses more appropriate to the current, human  wedding. Verses 20–27 contain a somewhat jumbled treatment of the wedding,  from the wooing to the arrival in the new home, beginning with an invitation to  mount the wedding vehicle (vs. 20), perhaps placed here because it has connections  with the Sūryā section. Verses 21–22 are addressed to a Gandharva (a type of lubri
cious demigod, thought to target unmarried girls), declaring the new wife off-limits.  Verse 23 seems to collapse the earlier journey to the wooing and the journey to the  new home, while the following two verses (24–25) concern the ceremony itself: at  least in the later ritual the wife is briefly bound with a cord, as a symbolic initiation  parallel to the initiation of a young Ārya boy. (See Jamison 1996a: 42–48.) Finally,  in verses 26–27 we reach the journey to the new home and good wishes for the new  mistress of the household.
Verses 28–35 are a strange, sinister, and menacing interlude between the gener ally happy tone of the first part of the hymn and the blessings with which it closes.  These, especially verses 28–30 and 34–35, are also the most discussed and disputed  verses in the hymn. Let us dispose of the relatively unproblematic verses 31–33 first.  These concern the possible dangers of the wedding journey:  diseases emanating  from the spectators of the procession (vs. 31) and robbers and other hazards (vs.  32). In verse 33 the spectators are allowed to look at the bride and wish her good  luck, but then ordered home.
It is generally agreed that the three preceding verses (28–30) have to do with the  deflowering of the bride, though there is much disagreement about details. Verse  28, it seems, begins with the announcement of the blood-stained sheet or garment,  the all-important sign that the bride was a virgin. But the rest of this verse and the  two verses following do not treat this as an altogether positive outcome, especially  for the groom. Because the bride was a virgin, the marriage is valid, so her relatives  are pleased (28c)—but the new husband is trapped. The bride becomes a noose  (like the old sexist American slang expression “ball-and-chain” for a wife), and he is  bound in her bonds. She also becomes witchcraft embodied (28b, 29c). In our view this refers to the unnerving and dangerous hold that sex, in the person of his wife,  will exert over the husband. (Compare American English “that old black magic”  for sexual attraction and desire.) He is not only legally but also mentally bound,  and this hold is also expressed by the paradoxical “the wife enters her husband” at  the end of verse 29. Though the sexual act of course happens the other way—hus
band enters wife—symbolically she enters him: she has penetrated his defenses, got ten “under his skin.” The first half of verse 29 is unconnected with this emotional  transformation; instead it simply continues the legal and social ramifications of the  consummated marriage. With most commentators (pace Falk [1993], who thinks it  is the sable pelt worn by the groom), we interpret the śāmulyàm of 29a as the stained  garment of the bride, now to be disposed of. Pāda b treats the gifts to be given to  the priests who officiated at the ceremony. In verse 30 we return to the groom’s  compromised physical and emotional state: sex, especially this first sex of marriage,  is making him weakened and vulnerable, his naked flesh “glistening in an evil way,”  perhaps with sexual fluids. The theme of the garment found in literal terms in verses  28–29 acquires a somewhat shocking metaphorical twist in the second half of verse  30, where sexual intercourse is depicted as the husband dressing his penis in the  “garment,” that is, the body, of the bride.
After this emotional binge, the dangers of the road in verses 31–33 seem rather  minor! (The journey verses may have been interpolated here because the diseases of  vs. 31 are reminiscent of the groom’s physical state in vs. 30.) But menace returns in  verse 34, where an unidentified object is ascribed all sorts of harmful qualities. Only  a brahmin can neutralize them. Similarly, in verse 35 various violent actions are  depicted, which a brahmin can absolve. Most commentators have considered the  object in verse 34 to be the stained garment of the bride, and the actions in verse 35  to have been performed on the garment to sanitize it. We think this unlikely; instead  we consider these two verses to concern the wedding feast and in particular the  cow killed for the feast. Just as the sex of verses 28–30 involved violence, surrender,  and the breaking of taboos, so the slaughter of a cow to be eaten at the celebration  requires the same ambivalently viewed actions and in a sense is a public representa tion of the private violation of deflowering. But brahmins who understand “Sūryā,”  that is, the nature of marriage, including its negative qualities, can safely eat the  offered cow.
Verses 36–37 depict a far more benign husband than the tortured one of verses  28–30 and one more uncomplicatedly eager for sex. These verses lead into the  famous series (38–41) about the previous, divine husbands of the wife. The final  six verses (42–47) are simply expressed blessings of the married couple and of the  new wife.
1. By reality is the earth propped up; by the sun is heaven propped up. By truth do the Ādityas stand, and Soma is fixed in heaven.
2. By Soma the Ādityas are strong; by truth is the earth great.
And in the lap of these heavenly bodies Soma is set.
1522 X.85
3. A man thinks he has drunk the soma when they crush the plant. But the Soma that the formulators know—no one at all consumes that. 4. Protected by those whose regulation is sheltering, guarded by those  belonging to heights, o Soma,
you just stay listening to the pressing stones. No earth-dweller
consumes you.
5. When they take their first drink of you, god, after that you swell  up again.
Vāyu is the guardian of Soma. The moon is the model of the years.
6. Raibhī was (the female attendant) to be given along (with the bride),  Nārāśaṃsī the in-dweller.
Sūryā’s auspicious garment goes adorned with a song.
7. Perception was the pillow, the eye was the adorning salve,
Heaven and Earth were the bucket (seat), when Sūryā drove to her  husband.
8. The praise songs were the crossbars, meter the veil and headdress. The Aśvins were the wooers of Sūryā and Agni was the leader.
9. Soma was the bridegroom; the Aśvins were both wooers,
when Savitar gave Sūryā to her husband, as she pronounced (her vow)  with her (whole) mind.
10. Mind was her wagon, and heaven was her canopy.
The two glowing ones [=sun and moon] were the draft-oxen, when  Sūryā drove to her (new) home.
11. Your two oxen, harnessed by verse and tune [/r̥c and sāman], went of  one accord.
The ear was your two wheels. The path to heaven meandered back  and forth.
12. The two gleaming ones [=Heaven and Earth?] were your two wheels as  you drove. Breath was hammered in as the axle.
Sūryā mounted the wagon made of mind, as she went forth to her  husband.
13. Sūryā’s wedding proceeded, when Savitar set it going.
In the Aghā’s the cows are killed; in the two Arjunī’s she is conveyed (to  her new home).
14. When, o Aśvins, you two drove with a three-wheeled (chariot) to the  wedding of Sūryā to ask for her,
all the gods then gave assent to you two. The son Pūṣan chose you as  his two fathers.
15. When you drove, you two lords of beauty, to Sūryā to woo her, where was your single wheel; where did you stand for the pointing out? 16. Your two wheels, o Sūryā—the brahmins know (them) according to  their season.
But the one wheel that is hidden—that just the experts know. 17. To Sūryā, to the gods, to Mitra and Varuṇa—
those who are forethoughtful of creation—to them I have made this  obeisance here.
18. First in front, then behind, these two roam by their magic power. As  two playful children, they travel around their ceremonial course.
The one [=Sun] watches over all creatures; the other [=Moon] is born  again (and again) as he portions out the seasons.
19. He becomes ever new as he is born; as beacon of the days he goes at the  forefront of the dawns.
He portions out their share to the gods as he comes here. The Moon  extends his lifetime long.
20. Lovely with kimśuka flowers, (made of) śalmali wood, having all forms,  of golden color, well-turning, well-wheeled—
mount, o Sūryā, the world of immortality. Make your wedding
procession a comfortable place for your husband.
21. “Rise up from here, for this woman has a husband.” I call on Viśvāvasu  with reverence, with hymns.
“Seek some other girl sitting in (the house of) her father, adorned (for  marriage) [/smeared (with menstrual blood)]. That is your share by
nature. Know this.”
22. “Rise up from here, Viśvāvasu.” With reverence we invoke you.
“Seek some other burgeoning maiden. Send the wife to join with her  husband.”
23. Let the paths be straight and harmless to men, by which the comrades  go to the wooing.
Aryaman and Bhaga should lead us all together. Let the united
household be easy to hold fast, o gods.
24. I release you from the fetter of Varuṇa, with which well-disposed  Savitar bound you.
In the womb of truth, in the world of the well-performed (sacrifice?)  I place you unharmed along with your husband.
25. I release (her) from here, not from yonder. I have made her well bound  yonder,
so that, o Indra the rewarder, this woman here will have good sons,
good fortune.
26. Let Pūṣan lead you from here, having taken you by the hand. Let the  Aśvins convey you forth in their chariot.
Go to the house, so that you will be mistress of the house. Exerting
your will you will announce the ceremonial distribution.
27. Here let your heart’s desire be realized through children; here in this  house be vigilant for the ruling of your household.
With this husband merge your body. Then (even) as an elderly couple  you two will announce the ceremonial distribution.1524 X.85
28. It [=bride’s garment] becomes dark red. [She=bride] becomes  witchcraft, a noose. She is smeared (with blood).
Her relatives are elated; her husband is bound in bonds.
29. Hand over the stained garment; to the brahmins parcel out the goods. She herself has become walking witchcraft: the wife enters her
husband.
30. His body loses its splendor—glistening in that evil way—
when the husband is about to put on his own member the “garment” of  the bride.
31. The diseases from the people that follow after the glittering wedding  procession of the bride,
those let the gods worthy of the sacrifice lead back again whence  they came.
32. Let highwaymen who lie in wait not find the married couple. Let them cross over the hard place by easy roads. Let hostilities
run away.
33. Of good omen is this bride here: together approach her, behold her. Having given good luck to her, then scatter away home.
34. This is rough; this is sharp, barbed, poisonous: it is not for eating. The brahmin who would know Sūryā, only he deserves this thing  associated with the bride(groom).
35. Carving up, carving open, and then cutting apart:
behold the forms of Sūryā! But the brahmin makes them clean.
36. I grasp your hand for good fortune, so that with me as your husband  you will reach old age.
Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Plenitude—(all) the gods—have given you to  me for the ruling of the household.
37. Pūṣan, rouse her, most kindly disposed—(she) in whom humans scatter  their seed,
(she) who will willingly spread apart her thighs for us, (she) in whom we  can willingly thrust our penis.
38. To you at first they conveyed Sūryā along with her wedding procession. Give the wife back to her husbands, Agni, along with progeny.
39. Agni has given the wife back, along with lifetime and luster, (to him) who as her husband will live, long-lived, through a hundred autumns. 40. Soma acquired (you) first; the Gandharva acquired (you) next. Agni was your third husband. The fourth was human-born.
41. Soma gave (her) to the Gandharva; the Gandharva gave (her) to Agni. Agni has given both wealth and sons to me, and also this woman here.
42. Stay just here, (you two); don’t go apart. Attain your entire lifespan, playing with your sons and grandsons, rejoicing in your own house. 43. Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us. Let Aryaman anoint (you?) till  old age.
Without ill-omen enter the world of your husband. Be weal for our
two-footed, weal for our four-footed.
44. Be free from the evil eye, not husband-smiting, kindly to the livestock,  of good mind and good luster,
hero-bearing, god-loving, comfortable. Be weal for our two-footed,
weal for our four-footed.
45. Make this woman here, o Indra the rewarder, possessed of good sons  and of good fortune.
Confer ten sons on her: make her husband the eleventh.
46. Become sovereign queen over your father-in-law; become sovereign  queen over your mother-in-law.
Become sovereign queen over your sister-in-law, sovereign queen over  your brothers-in-law.
47. Let all the gods jointly and jointly the waters anoint our two hearts. Together Mātariśvan, together the Disposer, together the Director—let  them join us two together.
## 86 (912) Vr̥ṣākapi (Conversation of Vr̥ṣākapi Aindra, Indrāṇı, ̄ and Indra)
Indra (1, 8, 11–12, 14, 19–22), Indrāṇī (2–6, 9–10, 15–18), Vrṣḁ̄ kapi Aindra (7, 13,  23) [per the Anukramaṇī]
23 verses: paṅkti
This dialogue hymn was called by Renou “the strangest poem in the R̥gveda” (“le  poème le plus étrange du RV,” 1956: 246). The three participants in the dialogue are  Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and his raffish monkey pal Vr̥ṣākapi, who is making sexual  advances to Indrāṇī. The hymn contains startlingly explicit sexual discourse, as well  as a dazzling array of apparent non-sequiturs, all embedded in an exaltation of  Indra, signaled by its consistent refrain.
Not surprisingly its meaning and web of references have been the subject of  much controversy; we cannot discuss the many conflicting interpretations here.  However, in our opinion many of the puzzles can be solved if it is interpreted as  an oblique treatment of the Aśvamedha (Horse Sacrifice) ritual, a royal ritual in  which, according to the middle Vedic ritual texts, the chief queen copulates with  the sacrificed horse to increase and magnify the power of the king, her husband. In  this reading, the monkey represents the horse, with whom Indrāṇī must have sexual  relations. She both indignantly rejects and also encourages Vr̥ṣākapi’s advances  in the course of the hymn, and after their ritual copulation she is called “wife of  Vr̥ṣākapi” (vs. 13). The power of her husband Indra, the king, is extended by the
1526 X.86
performance of this ritual, though he has been, in effect, cuckolded. Hence the  paradoxical announcement in verse 17, which proclaims the sexual “loser” the real  master. For a detailed discussion of the hymn in the context of the Aśvamedha, see  Jamison (1996a: 74–88).
The hymn begins with Indra’s complaint that he is no longer receiving honor  or soma, a statement echoed by his wife (vss. 1–2). The falling off of ritual obser vance sets the stage for the performance of an Aśvamedha, for Indra to regain  his position. The topic then shifts to Vr̥ṣākapi (vss. 3–6), whose friendship with  Indra is clearly a bone of contention between the married couple. Indrāṇī reveals  in annoyance that he has made advances to her, but then, in a startling descent into  vulgar speech, boasts of her own sexual prowess (vs. 6). Vulgarity is matched by  vulgarity in Vr̥ṣākapi’s first entry into the conversation (vs. 7), where he responds to  her implicit invitation. These two verses may well verbally signal the sexual activ
ity between them, the climactic moment of interspecies pairing that mimics the  Aśvamedha. The next two verses (8–9), presumably spoken by Indra and Indrāṇī,  may well be a humorous reflection of this intercourse, which may appear to Indra  as spectator more like vexation than pleasure.
In our view, the next two verses (10–11) are spoken by the narrator, proclaiming  Indrāṇī’s important new ritual status, as the queen ensuring the life and prosper ity of her husband Indra. (The Anukramaṇī assigns them to Indra.) Indra then  laments the loss of his friend (vs. 12), who is going to the gods as sacrificial offer ing, but rejoices in the renewed sacrificial offerings he himself is receiving (vss.  13–14). In these verses he addresses his wife both as Indrāṇī (“wife of Indra,” vs.  12) and Vr̥ṣākapāyī (“wife of Vr̥ṣākapi,” vs. 13), for by her copulation with the  monkey she became his temporary ritual wife. The narrator affirms the renewal of  soma offering to Indra in verse 15, rectifying the lapse in ritual attentions noted  in verse 1.
The two responsive verses that follow (16–17) are the heart of the hymn and the  best support for and justification of the Aśvamedha. The first contains what would  be a universally accepted truism: the sexually successful male is the master and has  the power. But this is trumped by the paradoxical reversal: the sexually successful  male does not have the power; it’s the unsuccessful one who is master. This state
ment is beautifully applicable to the Aśvamedha: the king is cuckolded by a horse  (or, in this case, a monkey) and is witness to this humiliating act, but the king also  receives all the benefit from the ritual, which increases his power, while the sexual  partner of the queen is sacrificed.
With this pair of verses the hymn has reached its high point and conveyed its  message. The remaining verses are something of a letdown. The next five (vss.  18–22) are an extended pun, relating the yearlong journey of the horse/monkey  before the sacrifice with its journey to the gods after its sacrifice. The final puzzling  verse (23) superficially has nothing to do with the rest of the hymn, but relates a  miraculous birth from the daughter of Manu, who has the speaking name “Rib.”  The deeper connection must be the explosive fertility that the performance of the Aśvamedha should confer on its participants. For discussion of this verse in an  Indo-European context, see Watkins (2004).
The Aśvamedha is treated more directly in two hymns in Maṇḍala I, I.162 and 163.
1. [Indra:] “Because they have left off pressing (soma), they have stopped  honoring Indra as god,
(in the places) where my comrade Vr̥ṣākapi was getting high on the

– Above all Indra!
15. Like a sharp-horned bull constantly roaring within the herd, the “stirred” (soma libation), which the one desiring prosperity presses  for you, is weal for your heart, o Indra.

– Above all Indra! 22. When, o Vr̥ṣākapi, o Indra, you (all) went upward toward home, where was this beast of many misdeeds, to whom did the effacer of
men go?
– Above all Indra!
23. Manu’s daughter, Parśu (“Rib”) by name, gave birth to twenty at once. (Good) fortune indeed was there for her whose belly (labor-pain) vexed. – Above all Indra!
## 87 (913) Agni Demon-Smiter
Pāyu Bhāradvāja
25 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 22–25
A departure from the usual themes of Agni hymns (though quite reminiscent of the  second half of I.36 and to a lesser extent X.118), this long hymn is entirely devoted  to Agni as “demon-smiter” (rakṣohán), the first word of the hymn, and especially  to his violent pursuit of “sorcerers” (yātudhā́na). The language is gleefully and cre
atively bloodthirsty, crediting Agni with a large arsenal of weapons, mostly based  on the shape of his flames, and of means of violent destruction of the enemy (pierc ing, crushing, shattering, disemboweling, etc.). The vividness of the language is  enhanced by the fact that, after the first verse, Agni is always addressed in the 2nd  person and almost always with imperatives. (Only vss. 15 and 18 lack direct address  to Agni, though he is lurking in the background. These two verses are also the only  ones in which any other gods are allowed a part of the action.)
Agni’s connection with ritual is barely mentioned in the hymn. In verse 1 the  poet sprinkles him with ghee, addresses him, and kindles him, in order to ensure his  protection, and in verse 4 it is made clear that the murderous power of Agni’s weap ons comes from the sacrifice and the associated ritual speech. That Agni’s fierce and  aggressive protection of us stems from our ritual behavior toward him should be  kept in mind—though it must be admitted that the poet seems to forget this fact for  long stretches of the hymn.
Lexical repetition and phonological figures, both simple and complex, are  important features of the style of the hymn. To mention only one of the complex  figures, the unusual participle sphūrjáyan “sizzling” (the only occurrence of this  verb in the R̥gveda) in 11c is echoed phonologically by śaphārújam “hoof-breaking”  in 12b (and to a lesser extent by dhū́rvantam “damaging” in 12d).
The sheer exuberance of the hymn is contagious, at least to its translators.
1. The demon-smiter—I besprinkle him as the prizewinner; I beseech him  as Mitra [/an ally] for broadest shelter.
Agni, sharpening himself, fully kindled according to (our) intentions— let him protect us from harm by day, let him by night.
1530 X.87
2. Possessing jaws of metal, (first) brush the sorcerers with your flame, o  Jātavedas, when fully kindled.
(Then) with your tongue seize hold of those who have fools for gods.  Having wrenched the flesh-eaters, stick them in your mouth.
3. You who have (teeth) in both, bring both jaws close together, the upper  and the lower, as you sharpen (them), with murderous intent.
Encircle (them) in the midspace, o king, and set upon the sorcerers  altogether with your fangs.
4. Fitting your arrows to the bow with sacrifices, o Agni, and smearing  their shafts along with their points with speech,
with these pierce the sorcerers in the heart. Break their arms, turned  against (us), in turn.
5. Agni, split the skin of the sorcerer. Let the murderous (arrow-)point  smite him with its blaze.
Cleave his joints, Jātavedas. When he is hewn apart, let the flesh-eater,  craving his bloody flesh, open him up.
6. When now you see him standing still or moving about, o Agni Jātavedas, or flying along the paths in the midspace, as archer pierce him with  your missile, sharpening it.
7. And, Jātavedas, with your spears recover what was seized, from the  sorcerer who seized it.
Constantly blazing in front, o Agni, smite him down. Let the mottled  vultures that eat raw meat eat him.
8. Proclaim here, o Agni, whichever is the one who is the sorcerer who  does this.
Seize him with your firebrand, o youngest one. Make him subject to the  eye of the one with his eye on men.
9. With your sharp eye, Agni, guard the sacrifice. Lead it forth to the east  for the good (gods), o forethoughtful one.
Let the sorcerers not deceive you, ever blazing against the demonic  powers with your murderous intent, o you with your eye on men. 10. With your eye on men, look all over for the demonic among the clans.  Shatter his three points.
Agni, with your blaze cleave his ribs, and hew the root of the sorcerer  into three parts.
11. Three times let the sorcerer who smites truth with untruth meet your  onslaught, o Agni.
Sizzling him with your flame, o Jātavedas, wrench him down for the  singer before his very eyes.
12. O Agni, in the hoarse-voiced (singer) fix that eye with which you see the  hoof-breaking sorcerer.
Like an Atharvan fire-priest, with your divine light burn down the  unobservant (sorcerer) who injures the true. 13. What today two opponents will utter as curses (at each another), o Agni,  what harshness of speech those with hoarse voices will give birth to,
what missile is born from the mind’s fury, with that pierce the sorcerers  in the heart.
14. Pound away the sorcerers with your heat; pound away the demonic with  your blaze, o Agni.
Pound away those who have fools for gods with your flame and away  those who steal life, ever blazing against them.
15. Let the gods pound away the crooked man today, and let his harsh  curses come back on him.
Let their missiles reach the man thieving with speech at his vulnerable  spot. Let the sorcerer meet the onslaught of every (god).
16. The sorcerer who anoints himself with the bloody flesh of men, who  (does so) with horseflesh,
who carries off the milk of the fertile cow—chop off their heads with  your blaze, o Agni.
17. A year’s worth of the milk of the ruddy cow: let the sorcerer not eat of  that, o you with your eye on men.
Whoever seeks to gorge himself on [/steal] the beestings, with your
flame pierce him face-to-face in his vulnerable spot, o Agni.
18. Let the sorcerers drink cows’ poison. Let those of evil ways be cut down  before Aditi [/Innocence].
Let the god Savitar hand them over. Let them be despoiled of their
portion of plants.
19. From of old, Agni, you crush the sorcerers; demonic powers have never  conquered you in battles.
Burn up the flesh-eaters together with their roots [/with their fools (for  gods)]. Let them not escape your divine lance.
20. Guard us from below and from above, Agni, from behind and from in front. Let these unaging, hottest (flames) of yours, ever blazing, burn against  the man who speaks evil.
21. From behind, from in front, from below, and from above—as a poet  with your poetic skill protect us all around, o king.
O comrade, (protect) your comrade, as an unaging one (protect him to  attain) old age. O Agni, as an immortal (protect) us who are mortal.
22. We would set you, the inspired poet, all around (us) as our fortress, o  mighty Agni,
displaying bold color every day, smiter of (the demonic powers) along  with their wreckage—
23. With poison (smite) them along with their wreckage. Burn against  the demons
with your sharp flame, Agni, and with your spears with their
scorching tips.
1532 X.88
24. Burn against the pair of sorcerers, the two worm-eaters.
I sharpen you, the undeceivable—awaken!—with my thoughts, o
inspired poet.
25. Shatter his blaze with your blaze in all directions, o Agni.
Break apart the strength of the demon sorcerer and his manliness.
## 88 (914) Sūrya and Vaiśvānara
Mūrdhanvant Āṅgirasa or Vāmadevya
19 verses: triṣṭubh
Two simultaneous superimpositions structure this hymn. On the one hand, the  present-day sacrifice involving the establishment of the ritual fire and the pouring  of oblations into it is contrasted with the primal production of the sacrificial fire  by the gods. The present-day sacrifice begins (vs. 1ab) and ends (vs. 19) the hymn,  and periodically surfaces throughout (vss. 3, 5, 14). However, the dominant strain  is the primordial one, which begins in the second half of verse 1; the role of the  gods in creating the original sacrifice and “begetting” the sacrificial fire is especially  emphasized in verses 4 and the long sequence of 7–13, where the phrase “the gods  begot” appears four times (vss. 8–10, 13), alongside similar expressions. This the matic strain is especially striking because the gods are also regularly identified as  “worthy of the sacrifice” (vss. 3, 6, 11, 13; see also 5, where Agni is so called), that  is, worthy of receiving the sacrifice, while they are in fact performing the sacrifice.
The other theme of superimposition is the identification of Agni, especially  under the epithet Vaiśvānara “belonging to all men,” with the sun. At first the sun’s  dependence on and complementarity with Agni is mentioned (vss. 1b, 2, 6):  the  sun only becomes visible and begins to shine when Agni is also visible. But the  cosmos-filling radiance and heat of Agni (see vss. 3, 5, 7, 9) leads gradually to the  premise that the gods created Agni as the sun, expressed clearly in verses 10–13.  The poet then acknowledges Agni as the sun (vs. 14) and in enigmatic language  describes the two paths between heaven and earth along which the sun / cosmic fire  moves (vss. 15–16).
The last three verses (17–19) seem to provide a simultaneous transition  from the cosmic and primordial elements in the superimposed structures to the  present-day everyday—by way of a dialogue between two unnamed participants.  Most interpreters (e.g., Geldner and Renou) identify the speakers as two priests,  probably the Brahman and Hotar who are explicitly mentioned in the last pāda of  the last verse (19d). But the words that introduce the speakers in verse 17, ávara and pára, are ambiguous. They can mean “nearer” and “farther” (referring to the  positions of the priests on the sacrificial ground), but they can also mean “lower”  and “upper” / “below” and “above,” as derivatives of these words do in verse 14.  In verse 17 they can therefore refer to cosmic elements. It is our view that in verse 17 the dialogue is first presented as a debate between Earth and Heaven (which  appear at the end of vs. 15 as the defining poles of the cosmos) about their roles  in sacrifice, but the dialogue participants unobtrusively become transformed into  present-day priests.
The final verse anchors us firmly in the here-and-now of the sacrifice, but also  asserts that as long as the morning fire will be kindled and the dawns will dawn, the  sacrifice as we know it will be performed. This assertion may involve a bit of propa ganda. The term brāhmaṇá as the technical designation of a priest appears in this  verse; this term was only introduced in the late R̥gveda (as opposed to the earlier  brahmán “formulator”), presumably as part of a codification and partial reorgani zation of the sacrificial system. The poet may then be claiming a long future for the  new system, and implicitly suggesting its long history, stretching back to the origins  of the world—cloaking a religious innovation in a garment of imagined tradition,  as so often.
1. The oblation, the drink, unaging and delightful, has been poured into  Agni, the one who finds the sun and touches heaven.
For him to bear and support the world, the gods spread out (the world)  by their autonomous power.
2. The world was swallowed and hidden away by darkness; (then) the sun  became manifest when Agni was born.
The gods, Earth and Heaven, and the waters and plants took pleasure in  the fellowship of this one, of him.
3. Now urged on by the gods worthy of the sacrifice, I shall praise Agni,  unaging and lofty,
who with his radiance stretches through earth and this heaven, through  the two world-halves and the midspace.
4. He who was the first Hotar, delightful to the gods, whom they anointed  with melted butter upon choosing him (as priest),
he made what flies and what goes (on foot), the still and the moving, to  wax strong—Agni Jātavedas.
5. When, o Agni Jātavedas, you stood at the head of the world together  with your light,
we spurred you on with thoughts, songs, and recitations. You became  worthy of the sacrifice as the one filling the two world-halves.
6. Agni becomes the head of the world by night; thence is the sun born,  rising early in the morning.
(Behold) this artful contrivance of those worthy of the sacrifice, that the  swift one pursues his work, knowing the way.
7. He who shone brightly, beautiful to see in his greatness when fully  kindled, the radiant one whose womb is in heaven—
in him, in Agni did all the gods, the protectors of bodies, pour the
oblation with well-spoken speech.1534 X.88
8. The gods first begot well-spoken speech, after that the fire [/Agni], after  that the oblation.
This became their sacrifice, the protector of bodies. That does Heaven  know, that does Earth, that the waters.
9. The fire [/Agni] whom the gods begot, in whom all beings poured  oblations,
aiming straight, he heated earth and this heaven with his flame in his  greatness.
10. For with a praise song, with their powers the gods begot in heaven the  fire [/Agni] that fills the world-halves.
And, for the sake of the world, they made him threefold. He ripens the  plants of all forms.
11. When the gods worthy of the sacrifice set him in heaven as the Sun, the  son of Aditi,
when the wandering pair [=Sun and Moon?] came into existence, only  after that did all living beings see in front of (them).
12. For the sake of the whole world the gods made Agni Vaiśvānara the  beacon of the days.
He who extends through the radiant dawns uncovers the darkness as he  goes with his flame.
13. The gods, poets worthy of the sacrifice, begot unaging Agni Vaiśvānara, the primordial star, wandering but not confounding (the divine
commandments), the mighty and lofty overseer of the wondrous  apparition.
14. With mantras we address the poet Agni Vaiśvānara shining everywhere, the god who by his greatness encompasses the two wide (worlds) from  below and from above.
15. I have heard from the forefathers that there are two routes, (that of) the  gods and (that of) mortals.
Along those two everything that moves goes together, whatever is  between the father [=Heaven] and the mother [=Earth].
16. Conjoined, the two carry the one that wanders, born from the head,  stroked by mind.
He stands facing all beings: not keeping his distance, as, gleaming, he  makes his transit.
17. When the lower [/nearer] one and the higher [/farther] one debate with  each other, (they ask) “Of the two leaders of the sacrifice, which of  us two knows it through and through?”
Have our comrades been able to achieve joint revelry? Have they  realized the sacrifice? Who can proclaim this here?
18. “How many fires are there and how many suns? How many dawns, and  how many waters?
O forefathers, I am not saying something two-faced to you: o poets,  I am asking you in order to know.” 19. For as long as the fine-feathered (mares [=flames?]) clothe themselves as  if in the face of Dawn, o Mātariśvan,
for that long the Brahmin establishes (the fire), approaching the
sacrifice and taking his seat near to the Hotar.
## 89 (915) Indra
Reṇu Vaiśvāmitra
18 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet’s patronymic links him to the Viśvāmitra clan of the IIIrd Maṇḍala, and  indeed the final verse (18) is the Viśvāmitra refrain, found in many of the Indra  hymns of III (III.30.22, etc.). The penultimate verse (17d) mentions the Viśvāmitras,  though that half-verse seems to have been borrowed from the Bharadvājas (VI.25.9).  The poet appears to take his legacy quite seriously, for the hymn strikes one as  self-consciously old-fashioned, a well-crafted Indo-Iranian praise poem, celebrat
ing Indra’s high cosmogonic deeds in carefully balanced rhetoric and beginning  classically with the 1st-person subjunctive announcement “I shall praise Indra”  (índraṃ stavā). The poet has also inherited the verbal cleverness appropriate to a  proper r̥ṣi: his similes and figures of speech are aptly deployed, and he knows how  to mislead his audience and withhold information for surprise effect. This particu
lar skill is clearest in verse 5, which appears to continue the praise of Indra, until  we encounter as the first word of the second hemistich sómaḥ, the real subject of  the verse.
In the second part of the hymn, beginning in verse 8, we encounter another  theme dear to the Indo-Iranians: the punishment to be meted out to those who  break or play false to their alliances or have no alliances at all. The word mitrá “alli ance, ally, deified Alliance,” alone or in compounds, appears seven times in verses  8–15, and is, of course, an element of the poet’s ancestral name. Indra is repeatedly  urged to punish the transgressors on behalf of the gods whose task is to maintain  the proper relationships among men, namely Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman (see  vss. 8–9). It is striking that, unlike in many Indra hymns, we don’t simply call for  Indra’s aid in battle against whatever enemies oppose us; in this hymn our enemies  are characterized as moral failures.
There is another way in which the poet appears to show his consciousness of  his tradition—one that we might hesitantly call “intertextuality.” In verse 14 the  poet seems to be consciously citing, with some variation, the famous Indra-Vr̥tra  hymn I.32. He asks that after Indra’s exercise of vengeance the enemies “will lie”  in a certain way: pr̥thivyā́ āpŕ̥g amuyā́ śáyante “will lie there . . . in the (same) way  (as) the embracer of the earth.” It is difficult not to see this as a deliberate con
flation of two famous phrases describing Vr̥tra from I.32: 5d . . .śayata upapŕ̥k  pr̥thivyā́ḥ “will lie as the embracer of the earth” and 8a . . . amuyā́ śáyānam “lying  in that way.” This quotation and conflation of phrases from a particular, and no
1536 X.89
doubt well-known, poem seem quite different from the standard formulaic varia tion of our traditional poets, and it is perhaps not surprising to encounter it in  the Xth Maṇḍala, as the practice of traditional poetic composition was drawing  to a close.
1. I shall praise Indra, the most manly, who by his greatness forced apart  the realms of light, apart the ends of the earth,
who, maintaining their boundaries, filled (them) in their expanses,
projecting beyond the rivers in his greatness.
2. (As) the sun (turns) around the wide expanses, Indra should cause to  turn here, like chariot wheels,
the one [=the sun?] that like a busy surge never stands still. He has
smashed the black shades of darkness with his flaring.
3. Chant to him in the same old way a new sacred formulation that never  turns away, without equal on earth and in heaven—
to Indra, who has distinguished the races of the stranger, like the
(straight and crooked) backs (of horses), and need not seek (further
for) a comrade.
4. For Indra I have raised my songs, (like) waters in restless surges from the  depths of the sea,
for him who propped asunder earth and heaven with his powers, like  wheels with an axle.
5. He who provides battle fury in his drink, whose first impression is sharp,  the boisterous, vehement one with his arrows, who possesses the
silvery drink—
Soma! All the bushes and trees have not deceived Indra as
near-equivalents (of soma).
6. (To him [=Indra]), of whom neither heaven and earth, nor the dry land,  nor the midspace, nor the mountains (are the equal), soma has flowed. When his battle fury is being drawn forth, he cleaves the hard and
shatters the firm.
7. He smote Vr̥tra, like an axe the trees. He shattered the fortresses. He dug  channels as if for rivers.
He split the mountain, just like a new pot. Together with his own
yokemates, Indra made the cows his own.
8. It’s just you, Indra, who are the insightful requiter of debts. As a knife  does joints, you cleave the crooked (ways of those)
who violate the ordinances of Mitra and Varuṇa, as people violate a  bound alliance.
9. Those of evil ways who transgress against Mitra [/an alliance] and  against Aryaman, against agreements and against Varuṇa—
grind your bulging bullish ruddy weapon of death down on those
without alliance (to us), o bullish Indra. 10. Indra is master of heaven and Indra of earth, Indra of the waters and  Indra of the mountains,
Indra of the strong and Indra of the wise; Indra is to be called upon in  peace and Indra in war.
11. Indra, the strong, projects beyond the nights and beyond the days,  beyond the midspace and beyond the wellspring of the sea,
beyond the spreading of the wind and beyond the end of the earth,
beyond the rivers and beyond the settlements.
12. Like the beacon of the ever-blazing dawn, let your insatiable missile go  rolling forth, Indra.
Like a stone being launched from heaven, pierce with your hottest
weapon those whose alliances are deceitful.
13. The months gave way to (him), the trees gave way, the plants gave way,  the mountains gave way;
the two world-halves eagerly gave way to Indra; the waters gave way to  him as he was being born.
14. When will vengeance be yours, Indra, such that you will rend the  demonic power of the evil one, which besets (us),
and that those who bloody their allies will lie there like cows at
slaughter, in the same way as (Vr̥tra), embracer of the earth?
15. Those who, seeking to rival us, have battered at us, being greatly  arrogant and powerful, o Indra—
let those without alliance (to us) keep company with blind darkness.  The nights with their good lights should prevail over them.
16. Because the many soma-pressings of the peoples and the sacred  formulations of the singing seers exhilarate you,
heeding this common call, with your help drive nearby, across all
(others) as they chant.
17. In just this way, Indra, might we know your new favors that bring benefits. And with your help, Indra, might we Viśvāmitras know this, as we sing  just now at dawn.
18. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.
## 90 (916) Purusạ
Nārāyaṇa
16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 16
This is one of the best-known and most influential hymns of the R̥gveda. Its central  symbol is the púruṣa, the “man,” “person,” or “human being.” On the surface, this
1538 X.90
hymn tells of the sacrifice of a giant man, from whose parts the world was created.  The theme of creation through a cosmic sacrifice is widespread, but this hymn is  not simply the retelling of an ancient tradition. The púruṣa here serves as a symbol  of the sacrifice itself, which especially in the middle Vedic tradition is a locus of cre
ative power. The púruṣa is thus similar to the later divine figure Prajāpati, who in the  Brāhmaṇas personifies the sacrifice. Indeed this late hymn represents a verse com mentary on the sacrifice that prefigures the prose commentaries of the Brāhmaṇas.  This hymn is also notable because it is the only R̥gvedic mention of the four varṇas,  the hierarchical division of the social order that forms the theoretical basis for the  caste system. One reason that the hymn may have been included in the R̥gveda to  provide a R̥gvedic charter for such a division of society.
The identity of the Man and the sacrifice is established in the opening verse, for  his thousand heads, eyes, and feet recall Agni, the sacrificial fire, and his macro cosmic equivalent, the Sun (cf. Brown 1931: 109–10). The Man comprehends the  earth and extends beyond it. As Mus (1968: 549) has pointed out, the “ten-fingers’  breadth” by which he exceeds the world measures from the Man’s hairline to his  mouth. The Man’s mouth represents speech, which marks the boundary between  the imperceptible world of thought and the perceptible world created by speech. His  mouth is also associated with eating, and in verse 2 the Man rises beyond the world  “through food,” that is, by making the world his food. In later texts the “eater” is the  master and the “eaten” is one who benefits the master (cf. Rau 1957: 34–35). The  image may therefore reflect the Man’s dominance over the world. See also X.125,  in which the mouth is similarly both the locus of speech and the locus of eating.
This theme of dominance or rule continues also in verse 5 in the mutual genera tion of the Man and the Virāj. The word virā́j can mean either “brilliant” or “ruling,  rule.” The latter is the more likely sense here, and therefore this word connects the  hymn to Vedic ideals of the king, who in his consecration encompasses the world in  a similar way that the Man does here (Proferes 2007: esp. ch. 3). Since the term virā́j is grammatically feminine, it complements púruṣa, which is masculine in grammar  and connotation.
The Man is the “offering” (vs. 6), the sacrificial victim (vs. 15), but more espe cially he is the sacrifice itself that the gods, the Sādhyas, and seers performed  (vs. 7). Through this sacrifice the elements of subsequent sacrifices emerged: the  “clotted-mixture” (vs. 8), the verses, chants, meters, and sacrificial formulae (vs.  9), and the sacrificial animals (vs. 10). The parts of the sacrifice also became the  three upper varṇas (vss. 11–12): his mouth the brahmins, masters of knowledge and  speech; his arms the rulers, the possessors of power; and his thighs the freemen or  clansmen, who are the productive support of society. These three classes form parts  of the sacrifice because they can participate in the sacrifice. The śūdras or “servants”  are not part of the sacrifice but rather emerge from the feet of the Man, a symbol  of their low social status and their exclusion from the sacrifice. Finally, the elements  of the cosmos and gods themselves come forth from the sacrifice (vss. 13–14). This  primeval sacrifice thus establishes the “first foundations” for the performance of the sacrifice or even for the ritual, social, divine, and visible worlds more generally (vs.  16ab), and it creates access to heaven (16cd).
The identity of the Sādhyas (in vss. 7 and 16) is not clear. Their name means  “those to be brought to success,” and they appear to be ancient sacrificers whose  proper ritual performance has “perfected” them and who have attained god-like  status or the status of gods.
1. The Man has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. Having covered the earth on all sides, he extended ten fingers’ breadth  beyond.
2. The Man alone is this whole (world): what has come into being and  what is to be.
Moreover, he is master of immortality when he climbs beyond (this
world) through food.
3. So much is his greatness, but the Man is more than this:
a quarter of him is all living beings; three quarters are the immortal in  heaven.
4. With his three quarters the Man went upward, but a quarter of him  came to be here again.
From there he strode out in different directions toward what eats and  what does not eat.
5. From him the Virāj was born; from the Virāj the Man.
Upon his birth, he reached beyond the earth from behind and also from  in front.
6. When, with the Man as the offering, the gods extended the sacrifice, spring was its melted butter, summer its firewood, autumn its offering. 7. On the ritual grass they consecrated that sacrifice, the Man, born at the  beginning.
With him the gods sacrificed, (also) the Sādhyas and those who
were seers.
8. From that sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the clotted-butter  mixture was collected.
It [=the sacrifice] was made into the animals: those of the air (and
both) those that belong to the wilderness and those that belong to
the village.
9. From this sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the verses and chants  were born.
Meters were born from it. The sacrificial formula—from it that was born. 10. From it horses were born and whatever animals have teeth in both jaws. Cows were born from it. From it were born goats and sheep.
11. When they apportioned the Man, into how many parts did they  arrange him?
What was his mouth? What his two arms? What are said to be his two  thighs, his two feet?
1540 X.91
12. The brahmin was his mouth. The ruler was made his two arms.
As to his thighs—that is what the freeman was. From his two feet the  servant was born.
13. The moon was born from his mind. From his eye the sun was born. From his mouth Indra and Agni, from his breath Vāyu was born.
14. From his navel was the midspace. From his head the heaven developed. From his two feet the earth, and the directions from his ear. Thus they  arranged the worlds.
15. Its enclosing sticks were seven; the kindling sticks were made three  times seven,
when the gods, extending the sacrifice, bound the Man as the
(sacrificial) animal.
16. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice for themselves: these  were the first foundations.
These, its greatness, accompanied (it) to heaven’s vault, where the
ancient Sādhyas and the gods are.
## 91 (917) Agni
Aruṇa Vaitahavya
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15
This hymn is reminiscent of X.89 in style: a well-crafted, self-consciously rhetorical  praise of the god utilizing standard tropes and traditional images. The poet of this  hymn is especially fond of etymological figures (especially in the first few verses)  and chaining between verses (note, e.g., vss. 8d/9a, 10/11).
The hymn covers many familiar themes, contrasting the physical fire (e.g., vss.  5–7) with the deified fire and his ritual roles, but it is the latter aspect of Agni that  is dominant.
1. Awakening, he is kindled by the wakeful ones, the household master in  the house, becoming refreshed in the footprint of refreshment,
the Hotar of every oblation, worthy to be chosen, far-ranging,
far-radiant, a good comrade to one who acts as comrade.
2. He, with beauty lovely to see, a guest in every house—in every (piece of)  wood he is set like (a bird) of swooping pursuit in the woods.
Belonging to the people, he does not overlook any people. Belonging to  the clan, he dwells among the clans—each and every clan.
3. Very skillful through your skills, through your will you are strong-willed.  O Agni, you are the all-knowing poet through your poetic craft.
As good one, you alone hold sway over goods, which both Heaven and  Earth foster. 4. Foresightful, o Agni, you have settled down seasonably to your
ghee-rich womb, in the footprint of refreshment.
Your arrivals show brightly like those of the dawns, your reins spotless  like the rays of the sun.
5. Your beauties, brilliant like the lightning flashes of a rain-bearing  (cloud), show brightly like the beacons of the dawns,
when, set loose toward the plants and woods, you encompass them
yourself as food in your mouth.
6. The plants conceived him as their embryo at the proper season; the  waters as his mothers begot this Agni.
Both the woody (plants) and the sprouts (become) pregnant and give  birth to him who is just the same everywhere.
7. When whipped up by the wind, aroused, you spread yourself out,  constantly worrying the dry food at will,
your unaging troops [=flames] take up their places separately like
charioteers, as you go burning, Agni.
8. Creator of wisdom, furtherer of the rite, Agni, the Hotar, best
encompassing thought,
just him at the small oblation, just the same for the great one—just him  they choose—no other than you.
9. Just you do they choose here—the ritual adepts devoted to you—as  Hotar at the rites, o Agni,
when seeking the gods they provide pleasurable offerings for you—the  men with their oblations, with their twisted ritual grass.
10. Yours, Agni, is the office of Hotar; yours that of Potar in its turn; yours  that of Neṣṭar; you are the Agnidh [=fire-kindler] of the one who
follows truth.
Yours is the office of Praśāstar; you act as Adhvaryu; you are both the  Brahman-priest and the Houselord in our home.
11. The mortal who for you, the immortal, o Agni, will perform pious work  with the kindling stick or by the preparation of the oblation,
for him you become the Hotar; his mission do you undertake. You
speak on his behalf; you perform sacrifice, you act as Adhvaryu
for him.
12. These here—the thoughts, speeches, verses, songs, and good praises  from us—have come together for him,
for Jātavedas the good one—goods-seeking (praises) in which he will  take pleasure as their strengthener, though they are (already) strong.
13. I would proclaim this good praise here, a newer one, to him, the  age-old, who is eager for it: let him hear us.
May it come very close, to touch his heart, like an eager wife, richly
dressed, to her husband.
1542 X.92
14. (For him) into whom horses, bulls, oxen, mated cows, rams, once  released, are poured out [=offered],
for the kīlāla-drinker who has soma on his back, for the ritual adept
I generate with my heart a pleasing thought—for Agni.
15. An oblation has been poured into your mouth, Agni, like ghee into a  ladle, like soma into a cup.
Place in us prize-gaining wealth, rich in heroes, celebrated,
glorious, lofty.

Śāryāta Mānava
15 verses: jagatī
A generally disorganized and often puzzling hymn, it nonetheless begins with three  well-turned verses to Agni, using some of the same lexicon and imagery as the pre ceding Agni hymn. This initial similarity may account for the placement of the hymn
in the maṇḍala. Two Agni verses also close the hymn (14–15) in a ritual context. What lies between seems to lack structure and logical progression. Some verses  contain an odd assortment of divinities and semi-divinities (e.g., vss. 4–5, 11–13);  Rudra and/or the Maruts recur in several verses (5–6, 9). Fragments of familiar  myths appear without further development—for example, Indra’s interference with  the horses of the Sun in verse 8—and other verses contain apparent references to  other stories of which we know nothing (e.g., vs. 10). In short, despite some pleas ing passages, the hymn mostly yields frustration.
1. (I invoke) for you the charioteer of the sacrifice, the clanlord of clans, the  Hotar, the guest by night, rich in radiance.
Blazing in the dry (sticks), flickering in the golden (plants), the bullish  beacon, worthy of the sacrifice, has reached heaven.
2. This one here, who drinks directly, have both (sides [=gods and men])  made their own: Agni the supporter, the furtherer of the rite.
The dawns kiss the youthfully exuberant one like the night, the one set in  front, the descendant of himself, of ruddy (fire).
3. Yes indeed! we discriminate between his counsels and those of a niggard.  Twigs have been bepoured for his eating.
When the fearsome ones [=Aṅgirases] reached immortality, just after  that did they pay tribute to the divine race.
4. For heaven, the broad expanse, is the trajectory of truth. (There there is)  Reverence and great Devotion, the very admirable.
(There) Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa perceive with like mind, and Bhaga and  Savitar—(all) possessing refined skill. 5. The rivers go forth with the journeying Rudra; across great Devotion  they have run—
those with which the earth-circling one [=Parjanya?], going around
the broad expanse, constantly rumbling in his belly, besprinkles
everything.
6. Busy are the Rudras, the Maruts belonging to all communities, the  falcons of heaven, nestlings of the lord.
Through them Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman make their observations, and  Indra hastening with the hastening gods.
7. Having labored to exhaustion, they have obtained their benefit in Indra,  in the sight of the sun, and in the masculine nature of the bull—
the bards [=Aṅgirases?] who fashioned as his due the mace, his
yokemate, at the sessions [=sacrifices] of men.
8. He [=Indra] brought to a halt even the golden (horses) of the Sun, his  very own. Anyone feels fear before Indra the stronger,
before the snorting from the belly of the fearsome bull. Day after day  the victorious one thunders, unrepellable.
9. With reverence show forth your praise today to Rudra the skillful, who  rules over heroes,
(and to those [=Maruts]) with whom he, the well-disposed, very helpful,  self-glorious one, keeps company—with those of heaven who travel
their ways, the avid ones.
10. Because they disseminated their fame to their progeny—Br̥haspati, the  bull, and those akin to Soma—
the first Atharvan (priest) distributed it through sacrifices. The gods  and the Bhr̥gus perceive with like mind through their skills.
11. For Heaven and Earth of abundant seed, Narāśaṃsa, the four-square,  Yama, Aditi,
god Tvaṣṭar, treasure-giver, the masters of the R̥bhus, Rodasī [/the two  World-Halves], the Maruts, Viṣṇu are deserving.
12. And of us, the fire-priests, our sage poet [=Agni?] (is) widely
(perceptible). Let Ahi Budhnya listen to his call;
let Sun and Moon, the heaven dwellers wandering separately. O you two  Nahuṣī [=Manu and Nahus?], through visionary thought and ritual  labor take cognizance of this one.
13. Let Pūṣan, belonging to the All Gods, let the Child of the Waters, let  Vāyu help us forward to seek our movable (goods=livestock).
Chant to Vāta, the lifebreath, all the more. O Aśvins, easy to invoke,  hear this on your journey.
14. Him who presides over these fearless clans, the self-glorious one, we  hymn with hymns;
Aditi without assault, along with all the Wives (of the Gods), and the  youthful lord of the night (do I?), the manly minded, (hymn).1544 X.93
15. Here crackles the foremost Aṅgiras [=Agni] from birth. The pressing  stones, aloft, look upon the ceremony,
(those stones) by which the wide-gazing (soma) became widely
extended. The (livestock) pen is well-grounded, the axe in the
wooden (tree).

Tānva Pārtha
15 verses:  prastārapaṅkti, except anuṣṭubh 2–3, 13, paṅkti? 9, nyaṅkusāriṇī 11,  purastādbrhat ̥ ī 15 [per Anukramaṇī]
Even more so than the previous hymn, X.92, this hymn to the All Gods poses more  challenges to the interpreter than it yields rewards. This opinion seems to be almost  universally shared (see, e.g., Geldner, Renou, Gonda [1975: 212]), and it is generally  agreed that some of the problems may be due to faulty transmission.
The poem is composed in a variety of meters, with verses of mixed twelve/ eleven- and eight-syllable pādas, at least in principle—though often these pādas  do not conform, by syllable count, caesura, or cadence quantities, to their models.  (On the meter see Oldenberg 1888: 101, 117.) The syntax of the hymn is also quite  sketchy, with many verbs missing and with nominal forms often apparently merely  juxtaposed rather than being linked by normal case relations, and the identity of  the referents in many verses is obscure.
The reasons for the choice of the gods honored and their sequence are also not  clear. The hymn begins with a verse to Heaven and Earth, who recur in verse 10.  Verses 2–3 treat the gods in general, while verse 4 begins to name names, starting  with the Ādityas. The next three verses (5–7) form a relatively well-organized unit,  with a focus on the Aśvins and a shared opening (utá naḥ “and us”). The end of  verse 7 provides a transition to verse 8, with the R̥bhus and their master, Indra, who  also appears in verses 9 and 11. The poet summarizes his poem in verse 12 (with  more pride than we would perhaps allow him). Verses 13–15 constitute a dānastuti,  mentioning a number of patrons. Note that the name that the Anukramaṇī supplies  for the poet has simply been extracted from the name(s) of one or more patrons in  verse 15.
1. Become greatly wide, o Heaven and Earth; the two world-halves are  always like exuberant young women for us.
With these (gods?) protect us from one more powerful; with them protect  us when (he is) swollen with strength.
2. At every sacrifice that mortal honors the gods
who, of longest fame, seeks to entice them here with benevolent
thoughts. 3. O you who have control over them all, the shield of the gods is mighty, for they all possess all might; all are worthy of the sacrifice at the
sacrifices.
4. The kings of immortality are gladdening: Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa,  and the Earth-Encircler [=Wind?]—
and what about Rudra praised of men?—the Maruts, Pūṣan, Bhaga.
5. And for us by night (and by day), o you two of bullish goods [=Aśvins],  the Sun and Moon are our joint guides toward the seat of the waters, when in company with them Ahi Budhnya [/the Serpent of the Deep]  has been set in the depths.
6. And for us let the two gods, the Aśvins, lords of beauty, let Mitra and  Varuṇa make broad space through their domains.
He hastens toward great riches, across difficulties as if across wastelands. 7. And to us let the Aśvins, though Rudras, be merciful—and all the gods,  the Lord of the Chariot, Bhaga,
R̥bhu, Vāja, o Masters of the R̥bhus, the Earth-Encircler, o you who  afford all possessions.
8. Craftsmanly is the Master of the R̥bhus [=Indra]; craftsmanly is the  exhilarating drink of the one who does honor—(let) your two
prizewinning fallow bays (come) hither, as you speed—
of the one whose melody is also difficult to surpass, (whose) separate  sacrifice is like (a sacrifice) stemming from Manu.
9. Make for us immoderation (of wealth), god Savitar. I will praise (you?)  in company with our patrons.
Along with his draft-horses, Indra keeps hitching up (wealth) for these  (patrons) of ours and keeps hold of “the wheel of the domains” like  a rein.
10. On them, o Heaven and Earth, confer great fame reaching to all  domains, and on the heroes among us,
(and confer) strengthening nourishment for the winning of the prize,  strengthening nourishment for victory through wealth.
11. O Indra, inclined toward us, (come?) to this laudation, wherever it may  be, for our dominance, mighty one.
Always protect (us) for our dominance. Let our acquisition fatten, o  good one.
12. This praise of mine for the superior men, the praise whose course is  dazzling as if by its stretching to the sun, they have strengthened,
as a carpenter strengthens a horse-“conciliator” [=piece of horse tack?],  (so) it cannot be budged.
13. They whose (priestly gift) comes rolling, their (priestly gift) is golden,  yoked with wealth—
(it is) like manly forces when facing the other side, like one whose ends  have been accomplished [?] at will.
1546 X.94
14. I proclaim this in front of Duḥśīma, Pr̥thavāna, Vena, in front of Rāma  the lordly, in front of the patrons
who, having yoked five hundred, (sent) them along the path, destined  for us, (so that) their (priestly gift) has become widely famed.
15. In addition here and now seven and seventy
at once did Tānva assign (to us), at once did Pārthya assign, at once did  Māyava assign.
## 94 (920) Pressing Stones
The snake Arbuda Kādraveya
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5, 7, 14
This second hymn to the pressing stones (for the relations among the three press ing-stone hymns, see the introduction to X.76) is a playful and imaginative praise  of these implements for extracting the soma juice from the plant. The stones are  animatized throughout—as human workers, as hungry bulls, as birds, as antelopes,  as horses. But there is special emphasis on them as speakers. The first four verses  begin with “speaking” verbs (and often continue with them), with a variant phrase  beginning verse 5, and the last two verses (13–14) echo these verbs. These last two  verses treat the unhitching of the stones, their task completed, and the last pāda of  verse 14 rather poignantly not only releases them but de-animatizes them: they are  now perceived as just stones.
1. Let them speak forth; let us speak forth. Speak a speech to the pressing  stones that are speaking,
when, o stones, o mountains, all together you swift ones possessed of  soma bear your signal-call, your cry to Indra.
2. They speak as if in hundreds, in thousands. They roar with their golden  mouths.
Having toiled at their good work, the good workers, the stones, have  achieved the eating of the oblation even before the Hotar.
3. They speak; in this way they found the honey. They growl over the  cooked flesh.
Gnawing at the branch of the reddish tree, the gluttonous bulls have
bellowed out to it.
4. They speak loftily by reason of the delighting delightful (soma).
Shrieking to Indra, in this way they found the honey.
(Fit) to be clasped by the sisters [=fingers], the clever ones have danced,  making the earth heed with their trampling.
5. The eagles have raised their speech up to heaven. In their lair the black  antelopes have danced vigorously. Down they go downward to the rendezvous with the lower one. They  have themselves produced much semen from the sun-bright one.
6. Like powerful draft(-horses), they have held fast, yoked together, the  bulls bearing the chariot-poles.
When panting and gulping they have bellowed, their snorting sounds  like that of chargers.
7. To those who possess ten tracks, ten girthbands, ten yoking cords,  ten yokes,
ten reins—sing to the unaging ones pulling ten chariot-poles, ten yoked  ones [=fingers?].
8. These swift stones have ten fastening straps. Their delightful harness  encircles (them).
They have taken as their share the beestings of the pressed somian stalk  of the first plant.
9. The soma-eaters kiss the two fallow bays of Indra. Milking the plant,  they sit on the cow(hide).
Having drunk the somian honey milked by them, Indra grows strong,  spreads out, plays the bull.
10. Your plant is a bull. You will certainly not suffer harm. You are always  possessed of nourishment, (well-)fed.
You are pleasing to him whose ceremony you have enjoyed because of  your grandeur, as if because of a richly endowed (daughter, given to  him in marriage?), o pressing stones.
11. Drilled or undrilled, you stones are unwearying, unslackened,
immortal,
unailing, unaging, unbudgeable, very stout, unthirsty, unthirsting.
12. Firmly fixed are your fathers [=mountains] in every age. Desirous of  repose, they do not hitch themselves up from their seat.
Undecaying, companions of the golden (soma), (like) golden trees, they  have made Heaven and Earth listen by their bellowing.
13. Just so do the stones speak at their unhitching, *or on their course they  speak with their tramplings—the stones as they drink (the soma)
directly.
Like grain-producers [=farmers/millstones] strewing seed, strewing
their “seed” [=semen] they engorge the soma. They do not diminish
him though they gnaw at him.
14. When (the soma) was pressed in the ceremony they raised their voice,  like playful (boys) jostling their mother.
Unhitch (the stones) that have pressed it and release the inspired
thought of the (priest) who has pressed it. Let them roll away, being  (now) perceived as (just) stones [/the stones no longer being held in
harness].

## 95 (921) Purūravas and Urvaśı̄
Dialogue between Purūravas Aiḍa and Urvaśī
18 verses: triṣṭubh
This very famous and much-discussed hymn contains the dialogue between the  Apsaras Urvaśī and her discarded mortal husband Purūravas. He accosts her on her  journey (presumably back to her fellow Apsarases) and demands that they discuss  what went wrong with their marriage (vs. 1). He reminisces about her beauty (vs.  3) and her good wifely ways (vs. 4), while she impatiently dismisses him (vs. 2) and  provides her own view of her service as wife (vs. 5). The next verses (6–11) primarily  concern the crowd of Apsarases who attended Urvaśī when she gave birth to her  and Purūravas’s son Āyu. Purūravas evinces some jealousy about (as well as some  physical attraction to) these females with whom he competed for Urvaśī’s attention  and to whom she is returning, while Urvaśī here implies that Purūravas should have  his mind on more manly matters than love, such as military protection (esp. vss. 7  and 11; see also the ironic vocative “hero” in 5).
Urvaśī attempts to dismiss Purūravas again (vs. 11). He tries another tack to keep  her from leaving: how can she separate him from his loving son (vs. 12)—to which she  briskly replies that she’ll send him the kid, chillingly referred to in the neuter, back to  him (vs. 12). The second half of this verse forms a ring with the second half of verse  2, her first speech: she seems thus to be trying to bring the conversation to a close.  But Purūravas raises the stakes: with masterfully expressed self-pity he then suggests  that he may disappear or die (and won’t she be sorry then...?, vs. 14). Urvaśī wearily  talks him out of it (vss. 15–16). He tries one more time (vs. 17), using a grander and  more solemn linguistic register. The hymn ends with a somewhat enigmatic summary  verse (18) containing the gods’ address to Purūravas at the end of this affair. Because  Purūravas’s connection with the immortal Apsaras (note that Apsarases are called  “immortal” in vs. 9) was severed and his son was returned to him, the mortal, he is  bound to death, and his offspring will relate to the gods as mortals do, by sacrifice.  But he will nonetheless later receive a joyous afterlife in heaven. (It is noteworthy that  this is the only occurrence of the word svargá “heaven” in the R̥gveda.)
One of the many extraordinary features of this brief masterpiece is the way  it replicates the shifting emotional logic, the abrupt changes of tone and subject,  and the twisting of the other’s words characteristic of a genuine marital quarrel of  whatever era and culture, while presenting us with pictures of great beauty, however  difficult the language is to interpret in many places. It is also uncompromising in its  depiction of a resolute and hard-hearted female, unmoved by the abject pleas and  emotional blackmail of her former lover who is still in love with her, anxious to  return to her carefree life with her fellow Apsarases, and happy enough to abandon  her child in order to get free.
There are several well-known later versions of this story. The Śatapatha  Brāhmaṇa XI.5.1 embeds many of the R̥gvedic verses into a prose narrative, which seems to have misunderstood, deliberately or not, several of the crucial verses. And  one of the three surviving plays of the great Classical Sanskrit poet Kālidāsa is a  much expanded treatment of the pair’s love affair. No subsequent version can toler ate the radical portrait of the emotionally detached Urvaśī found in the R̥gveda; in  all cases the separation of the former lovers is not the result of the female’s decision,  but of a curse. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, a creative misreading of verse 3—involv ing bleating pet lambs tied to a bedpost, a thunderstorm, and the provision that  Urvaśī never see Purūravas naked—results in Urvaśī’s disappearance. In Kālidāsa’s  play the curse has no connection to anything in the R̥gvedic hymn: a love-besotted  Urvaśī brings it on herself by uttering her beloved Purūravas’s name at the wrong  time. (In both versions the portrayal of Purūravas does retain his own passion for  Urvaśī; in fact in Kālidāsa’s play he goes mad after she disappears and asks birds,  beasts, and trees, in the late Middle Indo-Aryan language variety Apabhraṃśa,  about her whereabouts.) It is an interesting commentary on the changing fortunes  of female figures that the hard edges of the R̥gvedic Urvaśī must be softened to  make her acceptable in later literature.
1. [Purūravas:] “Woe, wife! Thoughtfully—stand still, fearsome woman!— let us two now exchange words.
These thoughts, if unuttered, will not bring us joy even on a distant day.” 2. [Urvaśī:] “What shall I do with this speech of yours? I have marched  forth, like the foremost of the dawns.
Purūravas—go off home again. I am as hard to attain as the wind.”
3. [Purūravas:] “...as an arrow from the quiver of beauty, a shot winning  cows, as a charge winning hundreds.
Under the will of no man, she will keep flashing forth like (lightning);  like a lamb its bleating, so are her tumultuous (tempests) displayed.” 4. [Purūravas:] “She was (always) imparting energy, a good thing, to her  father-in-law—every dawn, whenever he wants it, from the house
opposite.
She attained a home in which she took pleasure; day and night she was  pierced by my rod.”
5. [Urvaśī:] “Three times a day you used to pierced me with your rod, and  you ‘filled it up’ [=had an erection] for me, who did not seek it.
Purūravas, I followed your will. You were then the king of my body, you  ‘hero.’”
6. [Purūravas:] “The beautifully glowing rank (of Apsarases), friends in good  favor, interlaced like a pond’s-eye [=lotus], (always) on the move—
these flowed like reddish salves; like milk-cows they bellowed for beauty.” 7. [Urvaśī:] “When this one [=the son of Purūravas and Urvaśī] was being  born, the women were in attendance, and the rivers, gurgling to
themselves, strengthened him,
(just) as for great battle, for the smiting of Dasyus, the gods made you  strong, Purūravas.”
1550 X.95
8. [Purūravas:] “When I, a human, drew near to those nonhuman women  when they were taking off their robes,
like a shy antelope they shied away from me, like horses that have  brushed against a chariot.”
9. [Urvaśī:] “When a mortal, going to caress immortal women, mingles  (with their bodies) amid their cries, as if by his intentions,
like ducks they preen their own bodies, like horses playful and
constantly nipping.”
10. [Purūravas:] “She who in her flight kept flashing like lightning, the  watery (maiden) bringing me the delights of love—
(a son) belonging to men, nobly born, was born from the water— Urvaśī extends Āyu his lifetime long.”
11. [Urvaśī:] “You were born just so: to afford protection. (But instead) you  have exerted this force on me, Purūravas.
I, knowing, instructed you on that very day. You did not listen to me.  Why will you speak without profit?”
12. [Purūravas:] “When will my begotten son seek his father? (When) will he  let a tear roll like a wheel, on recognizing (him [=his father])?
Who keeps apart a married couple joined in mind as long as the fire will  (still) blaze in (the house of) the parents-in-law?”
13. [Urvaśī:] “I’ll give him an answer when he lets his tear roll. Like a wheel  he screeches for kindly care.
I will send it [=child] to you, that thing of yours that’s with us. Go away  home. For you will not attain me, you fool.”
14. [Purūravas:] “And if the gods’ pet should fly away today, never to  return, to go to the most distant distance ...
Then he might lie in the lap of Dissolution. Then again the ravening  wolves might eat him...”
15. [Urvaśī:] “O Purūravas, don’t die. Don’t fly away. Don’t let the unkindly  wolves eat you.
There exist no partnerships with women: they have hyenas’ hearts.” 16. [Urvaśī:] “When in different form I roamed among mortals and spent  the nights (with you?) for four autumns,
once a day I ate a drop of ghee. Just from that I continue to be sated now.” 17. [Purūravas:] “She who fills the midspace, who is the measurer of the  dusky realm, Urvaśī—I, the best (of men?), seek to bring her under  my sway.
Since the granting of a good deed will stand you in good stead, turn  back: my heart is scorched.”
18. Thus these gods here say to you, Aiḍa [=Purūravas]: “As it (turned out)  this way, you have a bond to death.
Your progeny will sacrifice to the gods with an oblation, but you will  also rejoice in heaven.” X.96 (922) Praise of Indra’s Horses
Baru Āṅgirasa or Sarvahari Aindra
13 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12–13
Like III.44 the design of this hymn is an extended pun between the words  hári/hárita “gold-colored, tawny” (used regularly for soma and for Indra’s “fallow  bay” horses) and the verb hárya “enjoy” and its derivatives. As in III.44 we have  rendered the former as “golden,” even in reference to the horses, and the latter as  “gladden(ing),” as a close English equivalent of this play on words. A subsidiary  pun is persistent through the hymn, involving the golden mace and the golden soma  (see, e.g., vs. 3); the referent of the adjective is often not expressed, and the audience  is free to fill in either or both. The context often allows either, and since they are  identical in gender, there is no grammatical obstacle. Similar ambiguity is found  between the golden horses and the golden soma (e.g., vs. 10). In other verbal twists  the “wrong” qualifier is used, but the underlying pun evokes the “right” one. Thus  in verse 4 the “gladdening” mace is compared to the sun, which should really be  “golden.”
1. I proclaim your two golden (horses) at the great rite of distribution.  I prevail over the gladdening, exhilarating drink for you who are eager  for it,
the drink which, like ghee, drips with golden (drops). Let the songs enter  you, whose form is golden.
2. For those who have cried out together toward the golden womb are  the ones spurring on the two golden (horses) toward it as toward a
heavenly seat.
(To him) whom they fill with golden (soma drops) as milk-cows do
with golden (drops of ghee)—to Indra chant a fortifying (hymn),
accompanied by golden (soma).
3. This is his gold-colored mace, which is made of metal. The golden (mace/ soma) is eager; the golden one is in his two fists.
Brilliant and fair-lipped is he who has as the missile of his battle fury the  golden (mace/soma). The golden forms are fixed fast in Indra.
4. Like the beacon in heaven [=sun], the gladdening (mace) has been set  in place; the (golden) mace will take wide compass like a golden
(racehorse) with its charge.
The golden-lipped (mace), which is made of metal, thrust against the  serpent. The bearer of the golden (mace) became thousand-flamed.
5. It was just you who were gladdened when you were praised by the  ancient sacrificers, o golden-haired Indra.
You are glad (now): yours is every bounty, complete and gladdening,  worthy to be hymned, o golden-born one.
1552 X.97
6. These two gladdening golden (horses) convey in his chariot the
mace-bearing, exhilarating, praiseworthy Indra in his exhilaration.
For him who is glad for the many soma-pressings, for Indra, the golden  soma juices have run.
7. Sufficient for his desire, the golden ones have run; the golden ones spur  on the surpassing pair of golden (horses) for the steadfast one.
Who speeds as he pleases with his golden steeds, he has attained his
desire that provides the golden (soma).
8. Golden-bearded, golden-haired, made of metal, who, drinking the  golden (soma), has grown strong on the drink of surpassing,
who with his golden steeds, rich in prizewinning mares, will deliver his  two golden (horses) beyond all difficult ways,
9. Whose golden lips, which are like two (golden) spoons, have flown  apart, as he sets his two lips to twitching for the prize,
when, after the cup is done, he will groom his two golden (horses),
upon drinking of the exhilarating drink, the gladdening stalk.
10. And the seat of the gladdening (soma) is in both dwelling places. The  possessor of golden (horses/soma) has roared toward the prize like a  racehorse.
Because even the great (Earth), the Holy Place, was gladdened by your  might, you took on lofty vigor—yourself also gladdening.
11. You, being gladdened, (filled) the two world-halves with your greatness.  You now become glad at every new dear thought.
O lord, reveal forth to the golden sun the gladdening dwelling place of  the cow.
12. Let the advance teams of the peoples convey you here in your chariot— you, the golden-lipped, in your gladness, o Indra,
so that you will drink of the honey that is offered, finding gladness in  the ten-armed sacrifice at the joint revelry.
13. You have drunk of the earlier soma-pressings, o possessor of the golden  (horses/soma), and this pressing here is yours alone.
Find exhilaration in the honeyed soma, Indra. Rain it utterly into your  belly, o bull.
## 97 (923) Plants
Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa
23 verses: anuṣṭubh
Atharvan in character, this hymn is addressed to the healing plants, which are  praised for their lineage and their powers and implored to provide remedies for  particular sick men. The 1st-person speaker is presumably not merely the poet but also the healer, and he calls on the plants to lend their power to his verbal healing  spells (see esp. vs. 14).
1. The plants that were born earlier, the third generation before the gods— I shall now call to mind the one hundred and seven forms of those
brown (plants).
2. One hundred are the forms of you all, o mother, and a thousand are  your shoots.
So then, o you all who possess a hundred strategies, make this (man)  here to be free of disease for me.
3. Rejoice, o plants, since you are blooming and fruitful.
Like victorious mares, the sprouts deliver.
4. O mothers, called “plants,” o goddesses, I implore you in this way: “Might I gain a horse, a cow, a garment, (in gaining [=curing]) your
very self, o man.”
5. Your seat is in the aśvattha-tree; your nest is made in the parṇa-tree: you will surely get a share in the cow when you will gain [=cure]
the man.
6. When the plants have come together, like kings at an assembly,
that inspired poet is said to be a healer who smites the demons and
banishes affliction.
7. The “horse possessor,” the “soma-possessor,” the “strengthener,” the  “overpowering one”—
all these plants have I acquired for this (man) here not to be harmed. 8. The unbridled forces of the plants rise up like cows from the cowpen as they seek to gain the stake and your very self, o man.
9. Your mother is the “Restorer” by name, and you all are “Expellers.” You are streambeds [=stalks] with wings [=leaves]. You expel what
causes affliction.
10. They have stepped over the fences like a thief over a barricade.
The plants have driven forth whatever malady of the body there is.
11. When I take these plants in my hand, invigorating them,
the very self of the sickness perishes, as if before being captured alive. 12. Him whose every limb, every joint you slither over,
from him thrust aside the sickness, like a mighty (man) lying in the middle. 13. Fly forth, o sickness, together with the cāṣa-bird and the kikidīví-bird. Perish together with the swoop of the wind and together with the
blizzard [?].
14. Let one of you help the other. Give help to one another.
All of you, being in agreement—help this speech of mine.
15. Those that bear fruit and those without fruit, those without flowers and  those that have flowers—
impelled by Br̥haspati, let them release us from distress.1554 X.98
16. Let them release me from (the shackle) of a curse, and also from (the  shackle) of Varuṇa,
and from the shackle of Yama—from every offense against the gods.
17. Flying down from heaven, the plants spoke:
“The man whom we will reach (while he is still) alive, that man will not  suffer harm.”
18. The many plants, having a hundred appearances, whose king
is Soma—
of those you are the highest—sufficient for our desire, weal for our heart. 19. You plants whose king is Soma, spread wide along the earth—
impelled by Br̥haspati, jointly give heroic power to this one here
[=medicinal plant].
20. Let your digger not suffer harm, nor him for whom I dig you.
Let our two-footed and four-footed all be free of affliction.
21. Both those who hear this nearby and those who have gone far into the  distance —
all of you, having coming together, o sprouts—jointly give heroic power  to this one here [=medicinal plant].
22. The plants come to an agreement with King Soma:
“For whom the brahmin acts, him, o king, will we deliver.”
23. You are the highest, o plant. The trees are your subordinates.
Let him be subordinate to us, whoever assails us.
## 98 (924) Devāpi’s Plea for Rain
Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa
12 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn contains a prayer for rain, set in the context of a similar (successful)  prayer in legendary time. The protagonists of this legend are Devāpi, a priest and  poet, in fact the Hotar and Purohita (at this late stage in the R̥gveda this latter  priestly role seems to have become established) for Śaṃtanu, presumably a king,  and the god Br̥haspati. The first four verses consist of a dialogue between Devāpi  (vss. 1, 3), Br̥haspati (vs. 2), and, in our view, Śaṃtanu (vs. 4, though some schol
ars consider this verse the speech of Br̥haspati). Devāpi requests Br̥haspati to act  as intermediary for him, asking the appropriate god to send rain. Devāpi must  have made this request standing by the ritual fire, for in verse 2 Br̥haspati identifies  Agni as their go-between and then provides Devāpi with a speech, presumably a  charm that can provoke rain. Devāpi acknowledges this gift in verse 3, and in verse  4 Śaṃtanu asks Devāpi to perform sacrifice.
The next three verses (5–7) summarize the successful outcome of this story. With  verse 8 the hymn turns to present time and to the god Agni, who carried the original plea from Devāpi to Br̥haspati. The present poet again asks Agni to send rain (vss.  8, 10, 12), while mentioning somewhat wistfully the many sacrificial gifts we might  receive (vs. 9)—gifts that he then offers to Agni (vs. 10) to present in turn to Indra  (vs. 11).
1. [Devāpi:] “Br̥haspati, confront (the appropriate) divinity for me,  (saying): ‘whether you are Mitra or Varuṇa, or Pūṣan,
or whether you are the companion of the Maruts [=Indra], or are with  the Ādityas or the Vasus, make Parjanya rain for Śaṃtanu.’”
2. [Br̥haspati:] “The quick messenger god [=Agni], taking cognizance,  went from you, Devāpi, to me.
Turn here, face to face in front of me: I place heaven-bright speech in  your mouth.”
3. [Devāpi:] “Place heaven-bright speech in us, in our mouth, o Br̥haspati,  speech that is invigorating and free from affliction,
by which we two will win rain for Śaṃtanu. The honeyed drop of
heaven has entered (me).”
4. [Śaṃtanu?:] “Let the honeyed drops enter us. O Indra, give a thousand  (cows) with a chariot in addition.
Sit down to the office of Hotar; sacrifice according to the ritual
sequence. O Devāpi, honor the gods with an oblation.”
5. The seer Devāpi, the son of R̥ṣṭisena, sitting down to the office of  Hotar, cognizant of the favor of the gods —
he sent the heavenly rainwaters gushing from the higher to the
lower sea.
6. In this higher sea the waters stood still, confined by the gods.
They ran, sent gushing by the son of R̥ṣṭisena, impelled by Devāpi in  currycomb tracks [=rivulets].
7. When Devāpi, installed as Purohita for Śaṃtanu and chosen for the  office of Hotar, reflected with longing,
Br̥haspati, bestowing, gave him speech audible to the gods,
winning rain.
8. O Agni, you whom Devāpi kindled—the son of R̥ṣṭisena, belonging to  Manu’s line, himself blazing—
cheered on by all the gods, rouse forth Parjanya who brings rain.
9. To you the ancient seers came with their songs; to you (now) all (come)  at the ceremonies, o much invoked one.
For us there are thousands (of cows), with a chariot in addition. Drive  here to our sacrifice, o you of the chestnut horses.
10. These nine and ninety thousand, along with a chariot in addition, are  offered in you, Agni.
With them strengthen your many bodies, o champion. Aroused, grant  us rain from heaven.
1556 X.99
11. These ninety thousand, o Agni—present them to the bull Indra as  his share.
Knowing the paths leading to the gods in proper order, set Aulāna
among the gods in heaven.
12. Agni, thrust away scorners, away difficult depths; ward off affliction, off  demonic forces.
From this sea of lofty heaven for us send an abundance of waters
gushing upon us.
## 99 (925) Indra
Vamra Vaikhānasa
12 verses: triṣṭubh
In this very obscure hymn the exact contents and referents in each verse are almost  impossible to interpret and identify, and much of the translation is therefore provi sional. On the other hand, the structure and progression of the hymn are surprisingly  clear. Although it is an Indra hymn, at least according to the Anukramaṇī, the name  Indra does not appear until the very last verse, the poet’s summary verse (12b), and  then only once. In fact the hymn contains almost no divine names: Rudras (in the  plural, perhaps of the Maruts, perhaps not, in vs. 5) and Varuṇa in a simile in verse  10. The first four verses contain no names at all, and though subsequent verses do  contain a number of them, most of these are names of enemies or of mortals aided  by the gods. As in many other difficult hymns the avoidance of names seems to be  meant to keep the referents deliberately unclear, and the contorted phraseology and  allusions to otherwise unknown stories, especially in the earlier parts of the hymn,  seem designed to keep the audience guessing and in some cases to deliberately mis
lead them. As the hymn goes on, Indra’s identity becomes clearer, as in verse 9 with  the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa saga. (On this obscure verse see also Jamison 2009d [2013].) The grammar mirrors this gradual progress toward the recognition and perhaps the  epiphany of Indra. The hymn begins in verse 1 with questions about the identity of  the referents, an indication of maximal uncertainty. The next seven and a half verses  (2–9ab) display an advance toward certainty: almost every half-verse begins with the  pronoun sá “he,” suggesting that the poet has a definite referent in mind, however  vague it may be to the audience. But sá is a discourse pronoun: it does not indicate  where the referent is located. Starting with the second half of verse 9 the next four  half-verses begin with a form of the deictic pronoun ayám “this one here,” strongly  pointing to a referent in the immediate vicinity of the speaker. These ayám forms may  signal the actual presence, the epiphany, of Indra, arrived at the sacrificial ground.
1. Which bright bellower of ours do you, taking cognizance, send speeding  along the broad earth for strengthening?
What is his share of strength at the break of dawn? He fashioned the  mace that overcomes obstacles; he made it swell. 2. For he pursues the melody with his flashing, with his lightning. He has  taken his seat upon the broad womb through his lordliness.
Together with the nest-mates and not without his brother, he is the one  who prevails over the magic tricks of the seventh.
3. He is the one who drives to the prize, though going with a (horse?)  whose “off” foot is lame [?]. At the winning of the sun, intending to  win he laid siege to it,
when, unassailable, smashing the phallus-worshipers, with his form he  prevailed over the property of (the place?) with a hundred doors.
4. He pours out the youthful streams, while as charger running for the  cows that are at stake,
when those in harness, though lacking feet and chariots, having wooden  cups as horses, move toward the ghee, the water.
5. Together with the Rudras, the Craftsman, whose wish is unpraiseworthy  but who keeps disrepute at a distance, has come here, abandoning
his house.
This reminds me of the ant couple who were away from their lair,
and (someone), approaching and stealing their food, made
(them) weep.
6. Just he, the household lord, subdued the mightily roaring Dāsa, with his  six eyes and three heads.
Grown strong through his might, Trita smashed the boar with his
metal-tipped poetic inspiration.
7. Rising up for Manu, he will propel his arrow at the deceitful Arśasāna. He, most manly, well-born from Nahus and from us, split the fortresses  at the smashing of the Dasyus, as was his due.
8. He, like a storm-cloud streaming water upon the pasture-land, finds a  way to a peaceful dwelling for us.
When he reverently approaches the (soma-)drop with his limbs, the
falcon with claws of metal smashes the Dasyus.
9. Along with his (men) swelling with strength, (he smashed) the arrogant  ones. He handed Śuṣṇa over to Kutsa for the Karpan [?].
This one here led the poet who was being praised, who won his cloak  and was the winner among superior men.
10. This one here, showing his favor along with his manly (men), wondrous  together with the gods, is a master of magic power like Varuṇa.
This one here, the lad who drinks according to the ritual sequence,
has been found. He gave his (full) measure against Araru, who was
four-footed.
11. Auśija R̥jiśvan, through his praises to him, burst the cowpen of Pipru  together with the bull.
When the one worthy of the sacrifice possesses the pressed soma and  the song will shine, (then), being implored, with his form he (will)
prevail over the fortresses.
1558 X.100
12. In just this way, o lord, for the increase of the great one, Little Ant  [/Vamraka, the poet] on his many feet crept up to Indra.
He, being implored, will create well-being for him. Refreshment,
nourishment, a good dwelling—all that has he brought.
## 100 (926) All Gods
Duvasyu Vāndana
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12
The most salient characteristic of this hymn is its full-pāda refrain, found in the  first eleven of its twelve verses: “we choose wholeness (sarvátātim) and innocence  (áditim).” (Geldner takes the latter as the proper name of the goddess Aditi, from  whom we wish to obtain our choice, but not only is there no Ādityan flavor to this  hymn, but such a double accusative construction is otherwise unknown with the  root √vR̥“choose.”) At first, with its abstract and somewhat moral cast, this refrain  seems unrelated to the content of the verses in which it is placed, but as the hymn  proceeds its relevance becomes clearer.
The hymn begins with a celebration of the soma sacrifice and the gods who par take of it, especially Indra (vs. 1) and Vāyu (vs. 2)—the latter marking the ritual as  the Morning Pressing—with Savitar, the “Impeller,” providing the impetus to the  ritual activity (vss. 1, 3). But it slowly becomes clear that the sacrifice is not simply  a physical procedure, but is intimately bound up with our emotional well-being (see  esp. vss. 5c and 6c). Moreover, in verse 7 it becomes the site of our declaration of  innocence before the gods, a sort of “truth formulation,” though without all the  formal marks of the truth formulation. At this point the refrain becomes an integral  part of the verse to which it is attached. Having thus affirmed our blamelessness, we  can now ask for the dangers that beset us to be banished (vss. 8–9) and for prosperity  and healing to attend us (vs. 10). That the soma sacrifice is the setting for these pleas  and that the elements of the ritual facilitate their fulfillment is shown by the promi
nence of the pressing stones (vss. 8–9) and the mixing milk for the soma (vs. 10). The happy conclusion of the sacrifice is depicted in verse 11, the last verse with the  refrain. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is a somewhat curious mixture. The first  half is addressed to an unidentified referent—quite possibly Agni, since the compound  “having bright radiance” is ordinarily used of him (though once of Indra and once  of Savitar)—with a slightly sinister reminder slipped into the second pāda that there  are still enemies around who are thriving. The second half looks like a fragment of a  dānastuti, but there are no further clues as to how it might fit into the rest of the hymn.
1. O Indra, stand fast, bounteous one. A thing like you is to be enjoyed.  Praised as the soma-drinker, be here for our strengthening.
Let Savitar, along with the gods, further our (speech, so it is) heard. – We  choose wholeness and innocence. 2. Bring forward for the taking a portion at the proper time, for Vāyu who  drinks the pure soma, roaring in his quest,
who has attained the drinking of the gleaming milk. – We choose
wholeness and innocence.
3. May God Savitar impel vitality here to our sacrificer, the soma-presser  who aims straight,
so that we may attend upon the gods guilelessly. – We choose wholeness  and innocence.
4. Let Indra be benevolent toward us always; let King Soma stay mindful  of our welfare,
in the same way that (pacts) concluded by allies bind (them [=allies])  together. – We choose wholeness and innocence.
5. Indra with his vast power has appropriated the articulation (of the  sacrifice?) along with our hymn. O Br̥haspati, you are the lengthener  of lifetime.
The sacrifice is Manu, for it is solicitude, is certainly a father to us. – We  choose wholeness and innocence.
6. Indra’s is the well-made divine might; Agni is the singer in the house,  the wise poet.
And the sacrifice has become our dear intimate at the rite of
distribution. – We choose wholeness and innocence.
7. Neither in secret nor in the open have we done to you much ill-doing,  angering to the gods, you good ones.
Let no one of us be of the shape of untruth, o gods. – We choose
wholeness and innocence.
8. Away and downward may Savitar impel affliction; even more widely let  the stones drive it away,
when the honey-pressing pressing-stone is given lofty voice. – We
choose wholeness and innocence.
9. Let the pressing stone be upright when the soma-presser is there, o good  ones; keep all hatreds away at a distance.
God Savitar is to be reverently invoked as our protector. – We choose  wholeness and innocence.
10. O Cows, eat nourishment in the pasture, eat fat, you who are anointed  in the cup, at the seat of truth.
Let just this body be medicine for the body. – We choose wholeness and  innocence.
11. The singer bringing to fulfillment his conception is a help for each and  every one; Indra himself is auspicious solicitude for those who have
pressed the soma,
whose heavenly udder is full for pouring. – We choose wholeness and  innocence.
1560 X.101
12. Bright is your radiance—your superiority brings your conception to  fulfillment. (But still) there exist unassailable opponents who bring
their own old age to fulfillment.
The one offering friendship seeks to rush in the straightest line to round  up the foremost of bovine stock.
## 101 (927) Priests
Budha Saumya
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 4–6, brhat ̥ ī 5, jagatī 9, 12
Addressed to the priests of the soma sacrifice, this charming hymn first likens their  ritual activities to various kinds of manual labor, especially farm labor (vss. 3–4).  The preparation of soma is then compared to raising water from a well (vss. 5–7)  for livestock. The preparation of the soma advances through a series of changing  images (vss. 8–10), ending with a surprisingly eroticized pair of verses (11–12).
1. Wake up of one mind, o comrades. Kindle the fire together, you who are  many, but from the same nest.
I call down Dadhikrā, Agni, and goddess Dawn, all accompanied by  Indra, to aid you.
2. Make things delightful; stretch out your insightful thoughts (on the  loom); make a boat that crosses (the water) with its oars.
Set your weapons in order; prepare them right. Lead the sacrifice forth  to the east, comrades.
3. Hitch up the plows; stretch the yokes across; in a prepared womb strew  the seed here.
If the hearing will be commensurate with our song, the ripe (grain)
should come even closer to our sickles.
4. The poets hitch up the plows; they stretch the yokes across separately— the insightful ones in search of favor among the gods.
5. Bring out the buckets; fasten the cords together.
Let us dip out the watery wellspring that is easy to dip, unfailing.
6. The wellspring with its buckets prepared, with good cords, easy to dip, watery, unfailing do I dip.
7. Make the horses happy: you will win the (prize that is) set. Just make  your chariot one that brings well-being.
Dip out the wellspring whose buckets are the wooden (soma) cups, its  wheel the (pressing) stone, its cask the (sheep’s fleece) sheathing, and  which gives drink to men.
8. Make a pen (for it), for it gives drink to your men. Stitch (for it) (suits of)  armor, ample and broad.
Make (for it) fortresses, metal and unassailable. Let the beaker not
leak: make it solid. 9. I turn toward you an insightful thought worthy of the sacrifice, for aid,  o gods—a sacrificial goddess worthy of the sacrifice here.
She should yield her milk to us like a great cow with her milk in a
thousand streams who has gone to the pastures.
10. Pour out the tawny (soma) into the lap of wood. Fashion (it [=wooden  cup]) with axes made of stone.
Embrace (him [=Soma]) with ten girthbands. Yoke the draft-horse to  the two chariot-poles.
11. The plodding draft-animal goes between the two chariot-poles like a  man with two wives in bed [/into the vulva].
Make the lord of the wood [=tree/soma] stand in the wood. Set (it)
down well, without digging out the spring.
12. The penis, the penis—raise it up, men. Rouse (it), stick (it in), to win  the prize.
Hurry the son of Niṣṭigrī hither, for help, urgently (hurry) Indra here  for soma-drinking.
## 102 (928) The Race of Mudgala and Mudgalānı̄
Mudgala Bhārmyaśva
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except brhat ̥ ī 1, 3, 12
We two translators have differing interpretations of some of the details and more  especially of the ritual application of this hymn. These contrasting views are set out  in separate signed discussions in the following introduction.
SWJ
This famous and famously enigmatic hymn presents an intriguing scenario: a char iot race (or a chariot drive) in which a man named Mudgala decisively wins the  stakes, with the help of Indra, despite using unorthodox equipment and personnel  that seem destined to fail him. His charioteer is his wife Mudgalānī (see vs. 2) and  the team drawing the chariot seems to consist of a boisterous and ill-controlled bull  yoked with an inert piece of wood (see esp. vss. 9–10). Or so is our best guess; the  depiction of the race is oblique and narratively shattered.
Not surprisingly the hymn has provoked much discussion, both about the bare  “facts” of the chariot race and about the meaning and purpose of the hymn as a  whole. There are two major and interconnected thematic strands motivating the  hymn, and these converge in the figure of Mudgalānī and are expressed especially  clearly in verse 11, where Mudgalānī recovers her husband, and the pair burgeon  with apparent fertility—he “dripping” and she “swelling.” She is there also identi
fied as a “(once) avoided wife,” in later śrauta ritual a technical term for one of the  king’s wives, avoided presumably because she failed to produce offspring. So, on
1562 X.102
one level the hymn depicts the recovery of fertility and the future production of  offspring in Mudgala’s line. The hovering presence and aid of the hyper-virile Indra  and the emphasis throughout the hymn (see esp. vss. 4–6) on his animal stand-in,  the bull pulling the chariot, reinforces this message. Mudgalānī’s sexual nature is  suggested by our first glimpse of her, with the wind lifting her garment (vs. 2a), and  in a particularly startling verse (6) the droppings of the defecating bull keep hitting  the woman who is driving him—an image that suggests, as it subverts, sexual con
tact between the bull and the woman. If this bull stands in for Indra, its yokemate,  the wooden club, may represent an impotent Mudgala, and the announcement in  verse 10 that the wooden club has now been “made to mount” may signal that  Mudgala has, paradoxically, recovered his sexual potency by association with the  bull/Indra.
The other thematic strand is a ritual one. In my opinion this hymn takes part in  the disguised dialogue in the late R̥gveda about the ritual innovation, the introduc tion of the Sacrificer’s Wife, the ritual patnī, into solemn sacrificial practice. As  we have discussed elsewhere, various hymns and sections thereof seem to favor or  oppose this innovation, but always in the guise of another discourse. This hymn  seems strongly in favor of the introduction of the patnī. It begins with a pun, whose  implications are worked out through the rest of the hymn. The first pāda of the  hymn introduces Mudgala’s chariot, which is mithūkŕ̥tam. This word is generally  translated “wrongly functioning, falsely made” or the like, and that is surely one of  its implications here: the chariot is defective. But it can also mean “making/forming  a sexual pair,” and this is a very apt description of the new ritual model, with the  Sacrificer and his Wife the pair associated with the chariot, a common metaphor for  the sacrifice. The rest of hymn can be read as an extended metaphorical treatment  of the new ritual model, using the same image of the sacrifice as chariot—with the  Wife is charioteer, not yokemate of the Sacrificer as in some other contributions  to the discussion (see, e.g., VIII.33.18). The emphasis throughout the hymn on the  unorthodox and makeshift nature of the equipment and the surprising outcome  in victory signals that the ritual partnership between husband and wife is a new,  untried model, which nonetheless brings even more success than the old one. The  happy outcome of the hymn, the recovery of her husband and the swelling fertility  of Mudgalānī (vs. 11), reminds us of the relentless stress on the Wife’s raison d’être  in classical śrauta ritual as representative of sexuality and fertility in all their forms  (see Jamison 1996a: esp. ch. 3, sect. C–E).
JPB
Alternatively, the hymn may have been composed to accompany a rite of niyoga,  in which a surrogate is appointed as a substitute for an impotent or dead husband.  Mudgala is the dead or impotent husband, but Mudgalānī has been able win off spring for him by finding a “bull,” a potent man, who can impregnate her and secure the continuation of Mudgala’s lineage. In this interpretation, the “wooden club” in  verse 9 is a symbol of the potency of the surrogate, rather than the impotence of  Mudgala, especially if the “racecourse” in the middle of which it lies is a figure for  the body of Mudgalānī. Verse 6 provides a possible clue to the application of this  hymn. If the praise of Indra in verse 12 is taken as extra-hymnic, verse 6 is the center  of the hymn, the place where the secrets of hymn are often disclosed (or buried even  more deeply). It begins kakárdave vr̥ṣabhó yuktá āsīt. Unfortunately, as noted below,  the meaning of kakárdave is uncertain. (It might be dative “for making kaka” as  translated below, but it might also be locative “in the creaking one,” referring to the  cart driven by Mudgalānī.) But the rest of the pāda is simple and clear: “the bull was  yoked.” Again in pāda c, the poet repeats that the bull was “yoked.” The reason for  poet’s insistence on this detail may be that yuktá “yoked” in this key verse points to  the etymologically related “niyoga,” the hymn’s ritual context.
For further discussion of this hymn see Brereton (2002) and Jamison (2011 and  forthcoming a).
1. Let Indra advance your chariot boldly (though it be) wrongly made  [/forming a sexual pair].
In this race in pursuit of fame and at the apportioning of spoils, help us,  o much-invoked one.
2. The wind kept lifting up her garment when she won a thousand (cattle)  and a chariot in addition.
Mudgalānī was the charioteer in the quest for cattle; as “weapon of
Indra,” she pulled out the perfect (“hand” of dice) at the match.
3. Hold in check the mace of the assailant who seeks to smite (us), o Indra. Keep far away the murderous weapon, whether of the Dāsa or of the  Ārya, o bounteous one.
4. Growing ever more excited, he drank a lake of water. The “hammer”  kept going, crushing hostility.
The (bull) with balls, seeking fame, striving to win, stretched out his  forelegs vigorously.
5. Coming at him, they made him bellow; they made the bull piss in the  middle of the race.
(Yet) through him Mudgala won a thousand plus a hundred
well-nourished cattle in the contest.
6. The bull was yoked for making “kaka” [=defecation] [?]. Its long-haired  charioteer dodged and dodged,
but the droppings of the frenzied bull, yoked and running with the cart,  kept hitting Mudgalānī.
7. Understanding (the situation), he struck away the outer piece of its  wheel, and he yoked up the bull there, working hard.
Indra helped out the husband of the prized cows: the hump-backed bull  sped with his strides.1564 X.103
8. Whip in hand, the man with braided hair achieved good fortune by  binding the piece of wood to the strap.
Performing manly deeds for the many folk, keeping an eye on the cows,  he [=bull?] assumed his powers.
9. “Look at it here, the yokemate of the bull, the wooden club lying in the  middle of the race course,
with which Mudgala won a thousand plus a hundred cattle in the
battle-drives.”
10. “Troubles begone! Who has ever seen such a thing? The one whom they  yoke, they (now) make him mount (the chariot/his wife?).
They bring him neither grass nor water. The higher (end) of the
chariot-pole draws (the chariot), directing (it) ever forward.”
11. She has accomplished the recovery of her husband, like a (once)  avoided wife: she swelling, he dripping, as if (working) with a poor
(water) wheel.
Might we also be victorious with a charioteer who is quicker than
quick. Let the winnings bring good luck and possessions.
12. Indra, you are (the eye) of the entire moving world, the eye of the eye, when, a bull yourself, you strive to win the race with a bull, driving
(him) with a steer as (his) yokemate.
## 103 (929) Indra (1–3, 5–11), Br̥haspati (4), Āpva (12), Indra or  the Maruts (13)
Apratiratha Aindra
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 13
A martial hymn, dense with expressions of overwhelming power and victorious might.  The early parts of the hymn present Indra as the unconquerable conqueror. Stylistically  this part is marked by repetition and especially by the chaining of key lexical items  from the end of one verse to the beginning of the next. Curiously, X.84, a hymn to  “Battle Fury,” also shows this type of concatenation, and so it may be that stitching  verses together in this way creates a sort of magically impenetrable verbal armor.
In the course of the hymn the focus shifts from exclusive concentration on Indra  to our warriors and the inspiration Indra’s model should provide for them to per form heroically in battle. Our men are first addressed already in the second half of  verse 2, but it is in verse 6 and then in verses 10–13 that the application of Indra’s  behavior to that of our men and the transference of his skills and courage to them  really come to the fore.
1. Swift, honing himself as a fearsome bull (does its horns), smiting again  and again, the agitator of the settled domains who makes them cry out together, the unwinking lone hero—he
conquered a hundred armies all at once—Indra.
2. With him, who makes (them) cry out together, who is unwinking,  conquering, combat-creating, difficult to shake, bold—
with Indra now conquer, now overwhelm the combatants, o men—with  the bull with arrows in his hand.
3. He together with those with arrows in their hands, he together with  those having quivers, willful Indra, with his throng, who is the one to  send the combatants surging together,
conquering those sent surging together, drinking the soma, arrogant in  his arms, the archer of mighty bow having his (arrows) aimed.
4. Br̥haspati, fly around with your chariot, as demon-smasher repelling  those without alliance.
Shattering the armies, pulverizing them, conquering in combat, be the  helper of our chariots.
5. Recognizable by his power, stalwart, a hero at the fore, a prizewinner  with overwhelming strength, overwhelming and mighty,
a hero on attack, a warrior on attack, born of overwhelming
strength—o Indra, mount the conquering chariot as the finder of
cattle.
6. The splitter of the cowpen, the finder of cows, the one with the mace in  his arms, winning the course, pulverizing with his might—
show your heroism in imitation of that one, you kinfolks; pull
yourselves together in imitation of him, you comrades.
7. Plunging toward the cowpens with overwhelming strength, the hero  without mercy, Indra of the hundredfold battle-fury,
difficult to shake, overwhelming in battle, impossible to combat—let  him further our armies in the combats.
8. Let Indra (go in front) as their leader, let Br̥haspati, the priestly gift, the  sacrifice, the soma go in front;
let the Maruts go to the forefront of the shattering, conquering armies  of the gods.
9. Of Indra the bull and of Varuṇa the king—mighty their troop of  Ādityas and of Maruts—
of the great-minded, earth-shaking, conquering gods the battle-cry has  arisen.
10. Make our weapons bristle up, o bounteous one—up the minds of my  own little warriors,
up, o Vr̥tra-smasher, the competitive spirits of the competitors. Up let  the battle-cries of the conquering chariots go.
11. Ours is Indra when the battle flags clash. Our arrows—let them conquer. Our heroes—let them have the upper (hand). Help us amid the calls (to  you), o gods.
1566 X.104
12. Confusing the perception of those yonder, seize their limbs, o Lady  Panic, and go away.
Go forth against them; with flames burn them in their hearts. Let those  without alliance keep company with blind darkness.
13. Go forth and conquer, o men. Let Indra offer you shelter.
Let your arms be mighty so that you will be unassailable.

Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet of this hymn is identified as a descendant of Viśvāmitra, and the hymn  ends (vs. 11) with the Viśvāmitra refrain found in most of the Indra hymns of the  IIIrd Maṇḍala (III.31.22, etc.). Like X.89, another Indra hymn of the Xth Maṇḍala  ascribed to a Vaiśvāmitra and ending with the same refrain, this hymn seems like  a self-consciously old-fashioned composition, falling squarely into the genre of  “journey” hymn, in which Indra is invited to come with his horses to the soma
pressing. That praise poetry is at least equally important as soma at the sacrifice is  made abundantly clear throughout the hymn. Toward the end (starting with vs. 8),  the hymn turns to the topic of the Vr̥tra myth and, especially, Indra’s freeing of the  waters after his defeat of Vr̥tra.
1. The soma has been pressed for you, o much-invoked one. With your pair  of fallow bays, drive swiftly to the sacrifice.
The songs, having poets for heroes, making their way, have run to you,  Indra. Drink of the pressed soma.
2. You of the fallow bays, drink here of (the soma) rinsed in the waters,  pressed by our men—fill your belly!—
which the stones have trickled for you, Indra. With these (soma drinks)  increase your exhilaration, o you whose conveyance is hymns.
3. I rouse forth the drink of pressed soma, mighty and true, for the bull— for you to drive forth, o possessor of the fallow bays.
Indra, make yourself exhilarated here with our nourishing streams, while  being ably hymned with all our insightful thoughts.
4. By your help, able one, and your heroic might, the fire-priests who know  the truth, acquiring the vigor
that brings offspring, have taken their place in the house of Manu, o  Indra, singing and sharing in the exhilaration.
5. Through your guidance—you of good praise, of good favor, and of  much radiance, o master of the fallow bays—the peoples,
your praisers, are acquiring your most bounteous help to bring them  across—and through your liberal gifts, Indra. 6. O you of the fallow bays, drive near to our sacred formulations with  your pair of fallow bays to drink of the pressed soma.
Indra, the sacrifice has reached you, patiently waiting. You are the
pious sign of the rite.
7. The bounteous one having a thousand prizes, vanquishing hostility,  delighting in the pressing, (receiving) well-twisted (hymns)—
unopposable Indra do the songs attend upon. In the singer’s desire to  do homage they express wonder at Indra.
8. Seven are the divine waters, very delightful and unharmable, by which  you, Indra, the stronghold-splitter, crossed the boundary river,
the ninety and nine streaming streams. You found the way for the gods  and for Manu.
9. You freed the great waters from their curse, and you, the god, alone  kept watch over them.
Indra, those (waters) that you made at the overcoming of Vr̥tra, with  these you should thrive in body throughout a whole lifetime.
10. The resolve proper to a hero—that’s Indra, who (receives) good
praises; (the good praise) as well as the (soma-)stream summon the
much-invoked one.
He shook Vr̥tra to pieces; he made wide space; as the able one, as
superiority (itself), he vanquished the battle arrays.
11. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this  raid, at the winning of the prize of victory,
the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him  who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes.

Durmitra Kautsa or Sumitra Kautsa
11 verses: predominately uṣṇih (per Anukramaṇī)
The meter of this hymn is, to say the least, highly irregular and variable from verse  to verse. Despite the Anukramaṇī analysis it is better analyzed as consisting mainly  of verses with a seven-syllable middle pāda, and one or more triṣṭubh pādas before  and/or after. See Oldenberg (1888: 158–59).
The hymn also poses many problems of interpretation, and the metrical and ver bal anomalies have led many commentators to consider the text corrupt—a judg ment by which we are tempted. Even if not corrupt, the text is stylistically abrupt,  contorted, and compressed, and many puzzles remain unsolved. The hymn also  appears to be jocular in places, making sly fun of Indra and cutting him down  to size. This is especially clear in the section devoted to Indra’s pair of fallow bay  horses (vss. 2–5), where the poet implies that without his horses Indra is nothing
1568 X.105
much: it’s the horses that give him prestige (see esp. vss. 3–4). The sections concern ing his weapon (vss. 6–7) and the sacrifice (vss. 8–10) accord Indra more of his usual  glory, but still in oblique phraseology.
1. When, o good one, for (you) who yearn for praise, will your beard  descend to the water,
to the (soma) long pressed for (you) whose friendship is sought
[/befriended by the wind]?
2. You who pursue your two fallow bays, well yoked but possessing  separate commandments, the steeds *with slender penises,
the two with manes like two lines—you, the houselord—
3. Apart from which two Indra stays stock-still, like an exhausted mortal  overcome by fear.
(But) when he, the forceful, has yoked them for beauty,
4. Together with them Indra will ever be famed—(though) he’s (just) their  sidecar and providing (them) service—
together with the two roarers with their separate commandments Indra  (will be famed) as a champion.
5. He who has mounted on the maned pair, as if on the two of broad  expanse [=Heaven and Earth?], to prosper,
the fair-lipped one wins (the soma?) with his pair of lips.
6. He of lofty might has struck up the praise song with the lofty ones. The  champion fashioned it with his swelling strength,
like an artisan [/R̥bhu] in accord with his intentions, (like?) Mātariśvan. 7. Who made his own mace, to smash the Dasyu easily—he,
golden-colored, golden,
with unbroken jaw, is like the infallible airy realm [?].
8. Grind down the crooked things for us. By our verse might we vanquish  those without verses.
Not without sacred formulations is our individual sacrifice, while you  are taking pleasure in it.
9. When the threefold one has become upright for you upon the yokepoles  of the sacrifice, in its place,
then, jointly with these two [=horses?], (make?/board?) a boat that has  its own glory.
10. For splendor is your dappled pourer, for splendor your spotless ladle, with which you pour up into your own vessel.
11. Whether a hundred are counter(part) to you, lordly one, Sumitra has  praised (you) in just this way, Durmitra has praised (you) in just
this way,
in that you helped Kutsa’s son in the smashing of Dasyus, in that you  furthered Kutsa’s kid in the smashing of Dasyus. X.106 (932) Aśvins
Bhūtāṃśa Kāśyapa
11 verses: triṣṭubh
There is no question that this is the most frustrating hymn in the R̥gveda. Structured  like another Aśvin hymn, II.39, it presents a blizzard of similes—generally one each  pāda, four to a verse—with the two gods compared to all manner of animals, people,  body parts, and cosmic features. Unfortunately the style goes far beyond the recon
dite to the utterly incomprehensible, with impossible hapaxes of unusual morpho logical structure, seemingly in part driven by phonological play. These words may  be archaic or dialectal or slang or belong to specific technical fields or borrowed/ adapted from a substrate language or playfully generated from morphological tem plates—or, as has been suggested, the middle section may be written in a kind of
code, with phoneme-by-phoneme substitution. Or all of the above, and more. In any case, following the eminently sensible lead of Geldner (implicitly endorsed  by Oldenberg and Renou), we have simply left the middle verses (5–8) untranslated,  while attempting to wring sense from the outer frame. Although many ingenious  attempts have been made to interpret the baffling lexical items in this hymn and  more could have been made, such attempts remain just that—exercises in ingenuity.  It seems more honest, as well as truer to the spirit of the hymn, evidently designed  to challenge the decoding skills of the most proficient and experienced hearers, to  acknowledge its impenetrable center. From this several observations emerge. First,  this appears to be the ultimate omphalos hymn. In most omphalos hymns the center  holds the mystery, but the mystery is expressed in words whose purport can be puz zled out. Here that mysterious center deliberately defies analysis by being expressed  in words that are tantalizingly close to familiar word-types, but whose code cannot  be cracked—and rendered all the more frustrating by the presence of real, analyz able words in the midst of the semi-gibberish. The hymn takes the notion of an  omphalos and carries it as far as it can go, suggesting that many mysteries will  remain beyond our apprehension, or at least our apprehension by verbal means. The outer verses (1–4, 9–11) reveal further traces of poetic structure, espe cially when compared with II.39 mentioned above. The parallels between the two  hymns seem to be deliberate and self-consciously generated. They begin almost  identically:  the first pāda of II.39.1 (minus the opening simile) reads. . .tád íd  árthaṃ jarethe “you two awaken to just this aim,” in sense and verbal expression  almost identical to our ubhā́ u nūnáṃ tád íd arthayethe “Now you both have just  this as your aim,” with the “awaken” postponed until pāda c. The final verses of  both hymns (II.39.8, X.106.11) are summary verses, announcing the hymn just  completed (interestingly called a mantra in this hymn) and urging the Aśvins to  drive to the hymn and the sacrifice. In between are a varying number of verses,  constructed as webs of similes, most of which are more complex and clever than  the general run of R̥gvedic similes. It thus seems that this hymn-type provides a
1570 X.106
template, which could generate within it an unlimited number of inventive com parisons. It is not hard to imagine this process as a competitive one, with poets  vying to use the most outré words and over-strained and mannered images, all  contained and controlled by the overall structure of the template. In our hymn we  return to discipline from the unruly center via several verses of reasonably com prehensible similes (vss. 9–10) to reach, with some relief, the safe shore of verse  11. (It may not be entirely fanciful to suggest that the first simile in the return  verses [9a] promises “firm standing in the depths”—something the audience has  surely been seeking, in vain.)
1. Now you both have just this as your aim: you stretch out insights like  workers their cloths.
It has awakened you two to drive toward a common goal. You haul
provisions here as you do the day-bright (days).
2. Like plow-oxen [?] you are fixed in [/to] the pharvara; like brawny  lead-horses [?] you follow instructions.
Because you are like messengers who acquire glory among the peoples,  do not stay away like buffalo from a waterhole.
3. Joined together like the wings of a bird, conspicuous like livestock,  come here to our sacrificial formula.
Shining like the fire of a man who seeks the gods, like two encircling the  earth you perform sacrifice in many places.
4. (I call upon you,) who are like friends to us, as sons do their parents— like powerful (Heaven and Earth) with their light, like kings for
triumph,
like energetic (herdsmen) for prosperity, like the two labia for
enjoyment. Like obedient (servants), come here to my call.

## 107 (933) Daksiṇ ̣ā (Priestly Gift) or Its Givers
Divya Āṅgirasa or Dakṣiṇā Prājāpatyā
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4
These extravagant praises of the dakṣiṇā (“priestly gift”), which is given by the  sacrificer to the various priests who officiate at his sacrifice, are clearly in the poet’s  interests, as he stands to receive a portion of the sacrificer’s largesse. The hymn sel dom strays from its point—that a dakṣiṇā, once given, brings untold benefits to the  giver, both material and spiritual, far exceeding the value of the original gift. It is a  persuasive, if somewhat monotone, piece of work.
1. Their great generosity has been revealed. All life has been freed from  darkness;
the great light, given by the forefathers, has come. The wide path for the  priestly gift has become visible.
2. High above in heaven have they taken their stand—those providing the  priestly gift. Those who give horses, they (come) together with the sun; those giving gold receive a share in immortality; those giving garments  extend their own lifetime, o Soma.
3. The priestly gift is the divine bestowal, a sacrificial offering to the gods; it  is not for the stingy, for they do not bestow.
But many men who present priestly gifts bestow through fear of disgrace. 4. Those with manly sight see (it as) the wind with its hundred streams (of  rain), (as) the chant that finds the sun; they see (it as) the oblation.
Those who bestow and present at the (sacrificial) assembly, they milk the  priestly gift with its seven mothers.
5. The provider of the priestly gift goes as the first invited; the provider of  the priestly gift goes to the front as the leader of the horde.
I think just he is the lord of peoples—the one who first sought out the  priestly gift.
6. They say that just he is the seer, he the creator of sacred formulations,  the leader of the sacrifice, the singer of chants, the reciter of
solemn words.
He knows the three bodies of the blazing one—he who first found
success with the priestly gift.
1572 X.108
7. The priestly gift gives the horse; the priestly gift the cow; the priestly  gift the lustrous and what is golden.
The priestly gift wins the food that is our very lifebreath. He who
understands makes the priestly gift his armor.
8. The benefactors have not died, nor have they gone to a failed end; the  benefactors are not harmed, nor do they falter.
What is this whole world and the sun, all this does the priestly gift give  to them.
9. The benefactors at first won the sweet-smelling womb; the benefactors  won a bride who is richly dressed.
The benefactors won the right to the inner drinking of liquor. The
benefactors won (against those) who come forward uninvited.
10. For the benefactor they groom the swift horse; for the benefactor the  maiden sits waiting, making herself beautiful.
This dwelling of the benefactor is like a lotus-pond, adorned and
shimmering like the palaces of the gods.
11. The steadily conveying horses convey the benefactor. Rolling easily, the  chariot of the priestly gift rolls on.
O gods, help the benefactor in the raids. The benefactor will win against  his rivals at the encounters (with them).
## 108 (934) Saramā and the Paṇis
Saramā and Paṇis
11 verses: triṣṭubh
In the interpretation of this well-known and delightful dialogue hymn we follow the  compelling study by Hanns-Peter Schmidt in his Br̥haspati und Indra (1968: 185– 89). This dialogue takes place in the midst of a narrative whose outlines are clear,  even if its details are not. The Paṇis have entrapped cattle in a cave. Indra and the  ancient Vedic seers wish to release the cattle. Therefore, Indra sends his dog Saramā to track down the Paṇis and to demand the release of the cattle. She crosses the  Rasā, the river at the border of the world that separates heaven and earth, and finds  the Paṇis. The Paṇis refuse to surrender the cattle, however, and at the end Indra  and the seers—the Aṅgirases and Navagvas—themselves come to the place where  the Paṇis have hidden the cattle. They break open the cave through the power of  the hymns they compose and chant. Because Indra’s weapon in this story is not the  vajra, the mace with which he destroys Vr̥tra, but the truth embodied in the hymns  that Indra and the seers recite, Indra is here called Br̥haspati, “Lord of the Sacred  Formulation.”
The story also tells of the coming of the dawns, since the power of Indra’s and  the seer’s words lies in the secret truth that the cattle are the dawns. Note that at the end, the poet uses the power of this truth for his own ends: through the truth of his  hymn, he should acquire or recover cattle.
Despite the seriousness of the theme, it is hard to believe that the audience did  not relish the depiction of a talking dog, especially one as saucy and forthright as  the faithful Saramā, who resists the offered blandishments of the Paṇis, to remain  loyal to her master Indra.
1. [Paṇi:] Seeking what has Saramā arrived here, for far is the road,
swallowing up (the traveler) in the distance?
What is your mission to us? What was the final turn (bringing you here)?  How did you cross the waters of the Rasā?
2. [Saramā:] Sent as the messenger of Indra I travel, seeking your great  hidden treasuries, Paṇis.
With a fear of leaping across—that helped us!—in that way I crossed the  waters of the Rasā.
3. [Paṇi:] Of what sort is Indra, Saramā? What is his appearance?—he as  whose messenger you raced here from afar?
If he will come here, we will make an alliance with him, and then he will  become the cowherd of our cattle.
4. [Saramā:] I know him not as one who can be deceived. He will deceive!— he as whose messenger I raced here from afar.
Deep flowing rivers do not hide him. Smashed by Indra, Paṇis, you will  lie still.
5. [Paṇi:] These cattle that you sought, Saramā, as you were flying around  the ends of heaven, fortunate one—
who will release them to you without a fight? And our battle weapons  are sharp!
6. [Saramā:] Your words are no weapons, Paṇis! Let your evil bodies be  impervious to arrows
or let the path to you be impossible to follow—either way, Br̥haspati will  have no mercy on you!
7. [Paṇi:] This treasury with its foundation of rock is overflowing with cows,  horses, and goods, Saramā.
The Paṇis, who are good herdsmen, guard it. In vain have you come on  an empty track.
8. [Saramā:] The seers, sharpened by soma, will come here to this
place: Ayāsya [=Indra], the Aṅgirases, and the Navagvas.
They will divide up this pen of cattle. Then will the Paṇis just vomit this  speech (of theirs)!
9. [Paṇi:] Even though you have come in this way, Saramā, compelled by  divine power,
I shall make you my sister. Do not go back. We will give away a portion  of the cows to you, fortunate one.1574 X.109
10. [Saramā:] I know no brotherhood and no sisterhood. Indra and the  terrifying Aṅgirases, they know (these things).
They seemed to me desirous of cattle when I came. Go away from here,  Paṇis, a very long way!
11. [Narrator:] Go far from here, Paṇis, a very long way! Exchanging places  with the truth, let the cows come up
which Br̥haspati found hidden—he and the soma, the pressing stones,  and the inspired seers.
## 109 (935) All Gods
Juhū Brahmajayā or Ūrdhvanābhan Brāhma
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 6–7
This short hymn has provoked much discussion, but, in our opinion, it has not  been well served by its commentators. The topic of the hymn is the “Brahmin’s  wife,” mentioned explicitly in verses 2–7, and in particular the “giving back” of  the Brahmin’s wife. The currently prevailing opinion about the hymn (see espe
cially Geldner and Doniger O’Flaherty) is that it represents an early version of  the story in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa (IV.6.5) in which King Soma abducts the wife of  Br̥haspati, the guru of the gods, and ultimately is forced to return her. Needless  to say, the chronological difference—the several millennia intervening between  the R̥gveda and the Viṣṇu Purāṇa—should make this connection a disfavored one  unless no other possible interpretations can be found. And it is also the case that  the R̥gvedic hymn lacks almost all the salient features of the purāṇic story, includ
ing the abduction.
We instead believe that the hymn relates to the much-debated issue in the late  R̥gveda about the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife into ritual performance (see,  e.g., nearby X.102), and that the poet both recognizes the perils of this new ritual  practice and reassures his audience that all will be well. The hymn has an omphalos  structure: the first and last verses (1 and 7) concern the “offense” (kílbiṣa) implicitly  done to the Brahmin (husband of the woman in question) by separating him from  his wife and placing her in the ritual arena, where she interacts with the gods and  acts as conduit of the fearsome forces unleashed by the sacrifice. Her contact with  the gods is potentially adulterous, and, given the power of the gods, there is also  the danger that they will not want to release her at the end of the ritual. But these  possible dangers do not arise: the inner ring of the hymn (vss. 2, 6) emphatically  states that the gods have given her back without rancor, and the kílbiṣa is expiated  in the final verse (7).
The middle verses (3–5) concern the wife’s activities on the ritual ground and  their importance. It is she who “places what is difficult to place in the highest dis tant heaven” (vs. 4), in our view a reference to her role in mediating between the earthly and divine realms especially in the animal sacrifice: she figuratively depos its the oblation in heaven by touching and ritually preparing the sacrificed ani mal. The most difficult verse is 5, which also contains the only R̥gvedic occurrence  of the word brahmacārín (already in the Atharvaveda a word for “Vedic student”  and later a standard way of referring to a man practicing chastity). Although the  verse remains enigmatic, it is possible that it suggests that a single ritual performer  (reciter of formulations) is necessary but not sufficient, and it is for this reason that  the Wife has been introduced into ritual practice.
The hymn is also saturated with wedding vocabulary (“grasp the hand,” “lead,”  etc.). This domestic ritual, in which man and wife participate jointly, provides a  reassuring model for the wife’s foray into the more solemn and serious realm of  śrauta ritual.
For more detailed discussion, see Jamison (forthcoming b).
1. These were the first to speak at the offense against the
Brahmin: boundless Ocean, Mātariśvan,
powerful ascetic Fervor, staunch in rage but joy itself, the divine Waters,  first born by their truth.
2. Soma the king first gave back the Brahmin’s wife, without being angry. Varuṇa as ally was her escort; Agni, the Hotar, having grasped (her) by  the hand, led (her) here.
3. The deposit is to be grasped only by her hand, just when they have  announced: “Here is the Brahmin’s wife.”
She does not stand for sending a messenger. In this way is the kingship  of the ruler protected.
4. The ancient gods and the seven seers, who settled down to ascetic fervor,  conversed about her:
“Fearsome is the wife of the Brahmin, when she is led close [/initiated];  she places what is difficult to place in the highest distant heaven.”
5. The one who practices formulations keeps constantly laboring at his  labors. He becomes (just) one limb of the gods.
With him Br̥haspati discovered the (Brahmin’s) wife, who was led by  Soma, as (you found) the sacrificial ladle [/tongue (=Agni)], o gods.
6. The gods, verily, have given (her) back, and the sons of Manu (have given  her) back;
the kings [=Ādityas], making it come true, have given back the
Brahmin’s wife.
7. Having given back the Brahmin’s wife, having made expiation of offense  along with the gods,
having shared in the nourishment of the earth, they reverently approach  wide-ranging (space).

Jamadagni Bhārgava or Rāma Jāmadagnya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the ten Āprī hymns in the R̥gveda, structured litanies to be recited at the  animal sacrifice, each verse with its own key word. This hymn follows the stan dard Āprī pattern of course, but is notable for the amount of internal recycling of  phraseology (see the echoes between vss. 2 and 10; 3 and 9; 4, 7, and 10; 4 and 8).  As usual, the key words are italicized.
1. Kindled today in the dwelling of Manu, as god you sacrifice to the gods,  o Jātavedas.
And as observant one convey them hither, you possessing Mitra’s might.  You are the messenger, the prescient poet.
2. Tanūnapāt, anointing with honey the paths traveling to truth, sweeten  them, you of lovely tongue.
And bringing to fulfillment our mental concepts and our sacrifice
through (your) hymnic visions, make our ceremony (be) among
the gods.
3. Being libated, as one to be solemnly invoked and to be extolled, travel here  in concert with the good ones, Agni.
You are the Hotar of the gods, youthful one. Sacrifice to them when
prompted, as superior sacrificer.
4. Facing east along the forward direction of the earth, the ritual grass is  twisted at the dawning of this (dawn), in the vanguard of the days.
It spreads out further, more widely, as a comfortable place for the gods,  for Aditi.
5. Let the expansive ones gape open widely, beautifying themselves like  wives for their husbands—
you Divine Doors, lofty, setting all in motion, become easy for the gods  to approach.
6. Richly fertile, worthy of the sacrifice—let Dawn and Night sit down here  close together in the womb—
heavenly maidens, lofty, with lovely ornaments, assuming brilliantly
adorned splendor.
7. The two Divine Hotars, foremost, eloquent, measuring out the sacrifice  of Manu to sacrifice it—
the two bards at the rites, spurring on, directing the east-facing light
along the forward direction (of the earth) [/at their direction].
8. Let Bharatī come straightaway to our sacrifice, and Iḍā, making (us)  perceive here [=instructing us] as she did Manu.
Let the three goddesses, (those two and) Sarasvatī, the good workers, sit  here on this ritual grass, a comfortable place. 9. He who (adorned) Heaven and Earth, these two begetters, and who  adorned all the creatures with their forms,
to him today, to god Tvaṣṭar, o Hotar, superior sacrificer, perform
sacrifice here when prompted, as the knowing one.
10. Send the oblations downward to the fold of the gods at the proper  season, having anointed them by yourself.
Let the Lord of the Forest, the Butcher, and god Agni sweeten the
oblation with honey and ghee.
11. Just born, he measured out the sacrifice at once. Agni became the leader  of the gods.
At the direction of this Hotar, at his word of truth, let the gods eat the  oblation, prepared with the svāhā-cry.

Aṣṭrādaṃṣṭra Vairūpa
10 verses: triṣṭubh
On the one hand, this hymn simply recites, in straightforward but artful fashion,  some of Indra’s most celebrated deeds: the Vala myth and the freeing of the cows/ dawns (vss. 3–4, possibly 2), the Vr̥tra myth and the freeing of the waters (vss. 6,  8–10), with several others glancingly referred to: the propping of heaven and fixation  of the earth (vss. 4–5), the smashing of Śuṣṇa (vs. 5). As often, the Vala and Vr̥tra  myths are sometimes superimposed upon each other, with the cows/dawns of the  former conflated with the waters (also female) of the latter. For example, the first  pāda of verse 8 seems to continue the travels of the Dawns found in verse 7, but the  next pāda makes it clear that the referent is actually the waters of the Vr̥tra myth.
On the other hand, and especially in its first few verses, the hymn concerns itself  with the interaction between poems and deeds. In verse 1 we poets rouse Indra by  making his deeds real, that is, by celebrating them in poetry. In verse 2 the poetry  almost seems to precede and stimulate the deed, and verse 3 provides us a picture  of Indra whose knowledge of his own deeds seems to derive from hearing about  them from poets. If our understanding of verse 4 is correct, the power of poetry to  provoke the deeds it celebrates is put into the mythic past, with the Aṅgirases bring
ing Indra’s feats to realization by their hymns. Although this theme disappears in  the rest of the hymn, to a poetically acute audience its resonances would probably  still be felt in the more conventional treatment of Indra’s deeds that follows.
1. Inspired ones, bring forth an inspired thought, in whatever (manifold)  ways men’s thoughts are.
We will rouse Indra here with his deeds made real [=as hymns]. For he is  a hero known to long for song.
1578 X.111
2. Because the hymnic vision flashed out from the seat of truth, the bull,  born from a heifer, came together with the cows [=Dawns/hymns]. He arose with a powerful roar. He entirely encompassed the dusky  realms, though they are great.
3. Indra certainly knows of this, from hearing it. For he was the victorious  path-maker for the sun,
and after that, making a wife from a cow [=Dawn], he became the  husband of the cow and lord of heaven, immovable, ancient born,  unopposable.
4. Indra by his greatness confounded the commandments of the great  Flood [=Vala], while being hymned by the Aṅgirases.
He rooted the dusky realms, though they are many—he who buttressed  their buttress by means of (their [=Aṅgirases’] poetic?) realization. 5. Indra is the counterpart of heaven and of earth. He knows all the  pressings; he smites Śuṣṇa.
With the sun he stretched through heaven, though it is great. He also  propped it up with a prop, (himself) a better prop (than the prop). 6. Because with your mace as Vr̥tra-smiter you laid Vr̥tra low, (laid low)  the wiles of the godless one swollen with strength,
you then, bold one, boldly hewed him apart, and so you became  arm-strong, bounteous one.
7. When the Dawns kept company with the Sun, their beacons found his  glittering gift,
the heavenly body that appeared here from heaven. No! No one really  knows about its going (away) again.
8. Certainly the first of these females have gone into the distance, the  waters that flowed at the impulsion of Indra.
Where is their top, where their bottom? Waters, where is your middle,  where now your end?
9. You let loose the rivers that had been swallowed by the serpent. Right  after that they roiled forth at speed—
those seeking release and those that had been released. Then they did  not rest, once pointed down.
10. Converging, they went to the river like willing girls. From of old the  stronghold-splitter has been acknowledged as their lover.
To your house have come the earthly goods; to us your many
liberalities, Indra. X.112 (938) Indra
Nabhaḥprebhedana Vairūpa
10 verses: triṣṭubh
A conventional invitation to the soma-drinking, specifically that of the Morning  Pressing (see esp. vs. 1). As usual, Indra is urged to travel to our sacrifice with his  pair of horses (esp. vss. 2, 4) and to drink the soma, whose serving is described. Also  as often, the rival sacrificers who try to tempt Indra to their soma are mentioned  and the superior charms of our offerings are touted (vs. 7). The poet also promises a  verbal performance celebrating Indra’s deeds to accompany the soma offering (vs. 8,  also vs. 1), and a very abbreviated précis of the Vala myth is given in the second half  of verse 8. The final verse (10) expresses our hopes for Indra’s reciprocal generosity.
1. Indra, drink of the pressed soma at your pleasure, for the Early-Morning  Pressing, the first drink, is yours.
Excite yourself, to smite the rivals, o champion. With hymns we shall  proclaim your manly deeds.
2. Your chariot that is swifter than thought, Indra, with it drive here for  soma-drinking.
Straightaway let your fallow bays run forth here, with which bullish ones  you drive while in exhilaration.
3. Cause your body to be touched by the golden luster of the sun, by its  fairest forms.
When you are invoked by us, your comrades, Indra, in common with us,  become exhilarated upon sitting down—
4. You, in the raptures of exhilaration, whose greatness these two great  world-halves did not encompass—
Indra, drive here to this home with your yoked fallow bays, to the dear  food with the dear ones.
5. Having drunk of it time after time, Indra, you have done in your rivals,  have done inimitable joyous [/martial] (deeds).
It rouses your plenitude and power; Indra, it is pressed for your
exhilaration—the soma!
6. Here is your cup acquired of old, Indra: drink soma with it, you of a  hundred resolves.
The trough is full of exhilarating honey, which all the gods delight in. 7. Because the peoples, with their pleasurable offerings set forth, vie in  invoking you in many ways, bullish Indra,
ours will become the most honeyed ones for you—these pressings here.  Delight in them.
8. I will proclaim your previous heroic deeds, proclaim now those first  performed.
1580 X.113
You, of real battle fervor, made the stone give way; you made the cow  easy to find, for the sacred formulation.
9. Sit down, Lord of Throngs, amid the throngs. They call you the most  inspired of the wise poets.
Without you, at a distance from you, nothing whatever is accomplished.  Chant a great brilliant chant, bounteous one.
10. By watching over us, who are in need, bounteous one, become a
comrade to your comrades, o lord of goods.
Do battle, you battle-doer [/make joy, you joy-maker] whose impetuous  powers are real. Give us a portion of wealth, even in what is (as yet)  unapportioned.

Śataprabhedana Vairūpa
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
Indra’s great deeds, especially the smiting of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–3, 6–8), are once again  the subject of this hymn, but the emphasis is on the other gods who contributed to  the success of Indra’s exploits: Heaven and Earth (vs. 1), Viṣṇu (vs. 2), Mitra and  Varuṇa (vs. 5), and especially the Maruts (vss. 2–3, 6). In depicting these various  partnerships between Indra and various gods, the poet is establishing the model  for a similar relationship between Indra and the present poets and sacrificers. In  verse 8 he attributes to “all the gods” the ritual strengthening of Indra by means of  praise poetry and soma—an exact parallel to mortals’ standard activity on behalf  of Indra. In the first half of verse 9 in rather labored language he then addresses  his fellow priest-poets, urging them to spell out to Indra their mutual acts of  partnership—and providing in the second half of the verse a mythic example of  Indra’s aid to a mortal in return for hospitality. (Dabhīti’s hospitality to Indra and  Indra’s requital of it by rendering Dabhīti’s enemies Dhuni and Cumuri powerless  are recounted elsewhere; see, e.g., VI.20.13 and VI.26.6.) Finally in verse 10 he  addresses Indra directly, requesting goods from him. Interestingly, it seems that  the poet is not asking for these goods for himself, but presumably for his patron,  so that the patron in turn will consider the poet a successful wordsmith and reward  him appropriately.
1. Heaven and Earth, of one mind with all the gods, assisted his
impetuous force.
Creating his own greatness and Indrian power as he went, upon drinking  the soma the resolute one increased.
2. Viṣṇu with his strength (assisted) his [=Indra’s] greatness, having run to  the plant [=soma]. It teems with honey.
Upon smiting Vr̥tra with the gods [=Maruts] as fellow travelers,
bounteous Indra became worthy to be chosen. 3. When, bearing weapons, you stood with Vr̥tra the serpent, for battle, to  acquire a laud,
all the Maruts together in person there increased your greatness and  Indrian power, strong one.
4. On just being born, he thrust aside the challengers. The hero looked  forward to his masculine power, to battle.
He split the stone; he discharged the flowing streams downward. He  propped the broad firmament with his skillful work.
5. Thereupon Indra was entirely master of his powers. He thrust apart  more widely heaven and earth.
Emboldened [/bristling with excitement], he brought down the metal  mace, agreeable to Mitra and to pious Varuṇa.
6. The teeming ones [=Maruts] hastened there for the powers of Indra, for  the battle fury of the mettlesome one,
when the strong one split apart Vr̥tra with strength—Vr̥tra, who was  holding the waters but was himself enclosed by darkness.
7. The two who together approached the heroic deeds first to be
performed, taking their (battle) places with their great powers—
smoky darkness dusted down on (the one), when he was smashed.
Indra by his greatness became lord over the early invocation.
8. All the gods then increased your bullish powers with eloquence
accompanied by soma.
He ate the serpent Vr̥tra subdued by Indra’s blow, as fire does dry food  with his jaws.
9. With skillful words accompanied by chants, by reason of your (acts of)  comradeship (for him), proclaim the many (acts of) comradeship (for us). Indra is famed as subjugating Dhuni and Cumuri for Dabhīti by reason  of his [=Dabhīti’s] mind of trust (in ritual hospitality).
10. You—bring hither many (gifts of) good horses, because of which I shall  be considered one who pronounces efficacious enigmas.
Along ways easy to travel may we traverse all difficult passages. Find a  ford for us today in wideness.

Sadhri Vairūpa or Gharma Tāpasa
10 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4
A mystical treatment of the sacrifice, whose mysteries unfortunately remain for the  most part unsolved, despite many attempts to identify the referents and relation ships of the striking images presented. We will not here add another, most likely  doomed, experiment in exegesis, although some possible referents are inserted in  brackets below. What is clear is that the elements in the ritual and elements in the
1582 X.114
cosmic world are identified with each other (in the style of the bandhus, or mysti cal identifications, so characteristic of middle Vedic literature), but by way of a  mediating esoteric image that can apply to both (at least to “those who know”).  This style is especially evident in the first verses of the hymn, while numerology  comes more and more to dominate the later verses. Indeed, significant numbers are  found from the very beginning (the two heats of vs. 1, the three dissolutions of vs.  2, the four braids and two eagles of vs. 3), but the manipulation of numbers begins  in earnest with verses 4–5. These same two verses contrast the poet with his “simple  mind,” who sees only one entity (vs. 4), with the inspired ones and sage poets (vs.  5), who use their words to make that single entity manifold. Even though many of  the details of this enigmatic hymn remain obscure, we can see in this contrast the  inherent message of the hymn, that insight and its verbal product, poetry, have the  power to give shape and multiplicity to the perceptible world.
1. The two contiguous heat (sources) [=fire and sun/gharma pots/or chant  and melody] have pervaded the threefold (world) [/Trivr̥t Stoma].
Mātariśvan has come to enjoyment of the two.
Seeking to acquire the milk of heaven, they have toiled: the gods know  the chant provided with melody.
2. Three (Goddesses of?) Dissolution reverently approach to be pointed  out, for the conveyors (of songs?) who hear from afar recognize them. The sage poets discern the connection of those (goddesses), (although  they dwell) among the distant hidden commandments.
3. The well-ornamented, ghee-faced young woman with four braids [=vedi  (“altar”)/night sky?] clothes herself in the (ritual) patterns.
Two bullish eagles have settled down on her, where the gods have
acquired their share.
4. The eagle is (really just) one—it has entered the sea; it surveys all this  creation.
With my simple mind I saw it nearby: the mother licks it, and it licks the  mother.
5. The inspired ones, the sage poets configure the eagle, though it is just  one, in many ways with their words.
And arranging their meters at the ceremonies, they measure twelve
cupfuls of soma.
6. Configuring the four as thirty-six and arranging the meters up to twelve  (syllables?),
having measured out the sacrifice with their inspired thought, the poets make  the chariot [=sacrifice] roll forth with r̥c and sāman [/verse and tune].
7. Fourteen are the other powers of this one [=chariot of the sacrifice].  Seven wise ones [=priests] lead it forth with their speech.
The opulent ford—who will here proclaim it: the path by which they take  the first drink of the soma? 8. Thousandfold are the fifteen ukthas. As great as heaven and earth, so  great is that.
Thousandfold are the thousand powers. As far as the sacred
formulation is spread out, so far is speech.
9. Who is the wise one who knows the yoking of the meters? Who has  undertaken the holy speech?
What champion do they call the eighth of the priests? Who indeed has  discerned the two fallow bays of Indra?
10. Such ones circle around the end of the earth, (while) they have stayed  yoked to the poles of the chariot.
They [=gods?] distribute the legacy of their labor to them, when Yama  becomes established in his secure habitation.
## 115 (941) Agni
Upastuta Vārṣṭihavya
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8, śakvarī 9
This hymn mixes dense and syntactically contorted descriptions of Agni in his nat ural and ritual aspects with simple declarations of praise of the same god, such that  the hymn gives the impression of ending several different times. For example, verse  5 appears to fit the type of a hymn-ending summary verse, calling on the god for  aid, but it interrupts the two most complex verses (vss. 4, 6) characterizing Agni as  fire, which appear to belong together, however unclear some of the details are. The  last three verses of the hymn (7–9), each in a different meter, provide three alterna tive endings to the hymn, each with overt signals of a final summary verse: verse 7  (in the same meter as the first six verses) evā́...stave “thus he is praised”; verse 8 ...  íti tvā ... vandate ... vā́k “so does the speech extol you”; and verse 9 íti tvā ...avocan “so have they proclaimed you.” It is difficult to know what to do with this overabun dance of finales.
The descriptive verses (1–4, 6) repay attention, with bold images and multiple  puns (e.g., druṣád in verse 3, literally “wood-sitting,” which is equally applicable  to Agni sitting on firewood and to the two associated similes: a bird sitting in  a tree and the soma-drop sitting in the wooden cup). As noted above, verses 4  and 6 are especially complex, and they have been variously interpreted. In our  view these two verses concern Agni and his flames. In verse 4 he is surrounded  by his flames, cleverly compared both to the very active winds and to immovable  mountains, and they urge him, here identified, as sometimes elsewhere, as Trita,  to mount an expedition. But in verse 6 his own flame concedes to his superior  power, even as he seeks food in inhospitable places. But other interpretations are  certainly possible.1584 X.115
1. Brilliant is the waxing of the tender babe, though he does not approach  his two mothers to suck.
When the udderless one has begotten him, even then has he waxed  strong in an instant, undertaking a great mission.
2. He has been established in the house, as “Agni” by name, as the  best workman, who wrests together the (pieces of) wood with his  gnawing tooth,
with his grinding tongue—he of good ceremony, snorting like a powerful  bull in a pasture.
3. Him (I invoke) for you—the god sitting on the wood like a bird in a tree,  (like) the drop from the stalk in the wooden cup, snorting, shaving  (the ground), undulating,
the conveyor (of the oblations) with his mouth like a draft-horse,  abundant with flame, like someone with a great commandment racing  along the ways.
4. O unaging one, you whose (flames), as you spread out eager to burn, like  winds, (like) immovable (mountains), encircle (you)—
battle-lusty they reach Trita [=Agni] like combatants a consummate  warrior, commanding him to seek.
5. Just this Agni, best of the Kaṇvas, comrade of the Kaṇvas, overcomer of  the distant stranger and the one close by—
let Agni protect the singers, Agni the patrons; let Agni give us  their help.
6. O you of good ancestry, to the best prizewinner, the mightier one, to  Jātavedas (does) the (flame?) stirring thirstily con(cede),
to him who acts boldly when he is by choice even in a waterless place, to  the greatest one, the one who seeks greedily for food even through a  wasteland.
7. Thus is Agni praised along with the mortal patrons as the good one, the  spirited (son) of strength by men—
(the patrons) who, well-installed like allies, truth-seeking, like the  heavens with their heavenly brilliance surmount the (other)
descendants of Manu.
8. “O child of nourishment, mighty one”—so does the bullish speech of  Upastuta extol you.
We shall praise you—we who are rich in heroes because of you,  establishing a longer lifetime further for ourselves.
9. So have the sons of Vr̥ṣṭihavya, the Upastutas, seers, proclaimed you,  o Agni.
Protect them—both singers and patrons. Saying “Vaṣaṭ, vaṣaṭ,”
(standing) upright they have reached (you); saying “Homage,
homage,” (standing) upright they have reached (you). X.116 (942) Indra
Agniyuta (or Agniyūpa) Sthaura
9 verses: triṣṭubh
A fairly straightforward hymn that remains focused on its insistent themes: the  invitation to Indra to drink the soma, and the expectations we have of him after  he has done so. The first four verses issue the invitation; verses 5–6 ask Indra to  use the strength imparted by our soma to defeat our enemies, while the invita
tion is reiterated in verses 7–8. The hymn proceeds in part by verses paired in  theme and language, though verses 3–4 do not show the repetitions and patterned  variation in the other three pairs. The final verse (9) summarizes the poet’s work  while ending with a striking image of the gods as dice, giving (and presumably also  withholding) luck.
1. Drink the soma for great Indrian strength. Drink for Vr̥tra-smashing,  most powerful one.
Drink for wealth and for power while you are being called. Drink of the  honey; drench yourself in it, to satiety, o Indra.
2. Drink of this pressed soma, presented along with the (sacrificial)  animals, according to your wish, Indra.
Giving well-being, bring yourself to exhilaration in your mind, being  inclined our way for our rich good fortune.
3. Let the heavenly soma exhilarate you, Indra; let what is pressed among  earth-dwellers exhilarate you.
Let that exhilarate you by which you made wide space; let that exhilarate  you by which you melt down your rivals.
4. Doubly lofty, undiminishing, let Indra the bull drive here with his two  fallow bays to the stalk that is poured around.
As smasher of the non-luminous, (smashing) the hammer utterly, drench  yourself in the honey, pressed on the cow(hide) and brought forth.
5. Blunt the sharpened points, slacken the taut (bowstrings) of those incited  by sorcerers.
I give power and strength to you who are mighty. Confronting your
rivals, hew them down amid the contesting voices.
6. Loosen the fame of the stranger, Indra, and his might and hostilities like  the taut (strings) of a bow.
Turning toward us, having grown strong in your powers, unblunted,
make your body strong.
7. This oblation is given to you, bounteous one. Accept it, being without  anger, o universal king.
It is pressed for you, bounteous one, and cooked for you: eat and drink  of it when it is presented, Indra.
1586 X.117
8. Eat just these oblations presented here, Indra. Take your delight in the  cooked foods and the soma.
Bringing the pleasing offerings, we enjoy you. Let the desires of the
sacrificer come true.
9. I send forth my eloquent speech to Indra and to Agni; like a boat upon a  river I sent it forth with my chants.
Like dice, the gods whirl around—they who give the stakes to us and get  the lucky break.
## 117 (943) Praise of Generosity [dhanānnadānaprasaḿ ̣sā]
Bhikṣu Āṅgirasa
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2
Unusual in both subject matter and tone. This hymn has no divine dedicand, but in  the Anukramaṇī is termed a “praise of the gift of wealth and food.” There is, in fact,  almost no mention of divinities or divine powers in the hymn, an almost unique situ ation in the R̥gveda; the gods figure only in the first verse and there only obliquely.  The emphasis is instead on the mutual relations between humans (comradeship; see,  esp., vss. 3–4, 6) and the obligation of the fortunate to provide for those in need.  Insofar as the R̥gveda treats the ethical responsibilities of men, ethical behavior is  ordinarily mediated through the gods, especially Mitra and Varuṇa, but here there  is no such mediation: the admonitions to behave properly to one’s fellow men are  direct and no gods are represented as observing and judging human behavior.
The argument for generosity is twofold and is couched not in purely ethical  terms, but in terms of self-interest. On the one hand, giving does not do the giver  any harm, as his stores do not become depleted. This sentiment is expressed most  clearly in verse 1c, but it seems also to underlie the maxim-like verses 7 and 8. Verse  7 seems to be a version of the slightly vulgar English expression “use it or lose it,”  while verse 8 suggests that sheer quantity isn’t the measure of power and effective
ness: the more “feet” an entity has, the less its autonomy and power. On the other  hand, not giving does the ungenerous man actual harm. In part, the harm is simply  the isolation produced by not acting in a comradely manner. As verse 6 says suc cinctly, “who eats alone has only evil.” But it is also the case that one’s fortunes can  change (see esp. vs. 5). Those who are rich and well fed today may find themselves  in need in the future, and it is best to forge comradely ties by giving now, in case the  situations of giver and receiver are reversed.
The tone of the hymn is colloquial and conversational. A  number of verses  deploy what appear to be old sayings or popular adages, distilled folk wisdom,  whose pertinence to the topic at hand is indirect and requires some figuring out.  Because of their rarity in the high-register texts of early Vedic, such expressions are  very precious, though they can be hard to penetrate. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet as Bhikṣu (“beggar”) Āṅgirasa, a name pre sumably suggested after the fact by the subject matter, especially since the word  bhikṣu, though very common and culturally important in later times, does not occur  in the R̥gveda or indeed any Vedic text that we know of.
1. Truly the gods did not give hunger as the only deadly weapon, and the  forms of death do come upon him who is well fed.
Moreover, the wealth of one who gives does not become exhausted, and  the non-giver finds no one to show mercy.
2. Whoever—when a man, weak and broken, has approached desiring  nourishment—though he has food,
hardens his heart, though he always used to be his friend, he also finds  no one to show mercy.
3. Just he is a benefactor who gives to the beggar who, emaciated, goes  roaming, desirous of food.
He becomes sufficient for him at his pleading entreaty, and he makes him  his companion in the future.
4. He is no companion who does not give of his food to a companion, who,  being in his company, accompanies him.
He should turn away from him; this is not a home. He should seek
another who gives, even a stranger.
5. The stronger man should give to one in need. He should look along the  longer path,
for riches turn like chariot-wheels: they come up to one man after
another.
6. The undiscerning man finds food in vain. I speak the truth: it is just a  deadly weapon for him.
He does not prosper in compatriot, nor in companion. Who eats alone  has only evil.
7. It’s just when it plows that a plowshare makes a man well fed. It’s just  when he goes that a man “wraps up” the road with his feet.
The formulator who speaks is more a winner than the one who doesn’t; a  friend who gives would be superior to one who doesn’t.
8. The one-footed [=sun?] has stridden farther than the two-footed
[=man?]; the two-footed overtakes the three-footed [=old man?] from  behind.
The four-footed [=dog?] comes at the call of the two-footed ones as it  watches over the fivefold ones [=herds?], staying by them.
9. Two hands, even though the same, do not accomplish the same. Even two  (cows) with the same mother do not yield the same milk.
The heroic deeds even of twins are not the same. Two men, even though  they are kin, do not give the same.

## 118 (944) Agni Raksohan ̣
Urukṣaya Āmahīyava
9 verses: gāyatrī
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the hymn to Agni Rakṣohan “Demon-Smiter,”  this aspect of the god is very muted in the hymn—found only in verses 1, 7–8 and  rather tamely even there. The exuberantly and ingeniously violent punishments  envisaged in the other Rakṣohan hymn in X (X.87) are entirely absent. Instead the  dominant picture is of a peaceful sacrificial hearth in which the fire responds happily  to the attentions, and especially the butter oblations, of his worshipers. Stylistically  the hymn is characterized by chaining: the repetition of a word or phrase from one  verse in the next, with a different word or phrase from that verse repeated in the  following one.
1. O Agni, you strike down the devourer as you shine here among
mortals
in your own dwelling place, o you of blazing commandment.
2. You stand up when you are well bepoured. You rejoice in response to  the ghee,
when the ladles have converged on you.
3. When bepoured, he shines widely. Agni is to be reverently invoked with  a hymn;
his face is anointed with the ladle.
4. Honey-faced Agni, when bepoured, is fully anointed with ghee,
bringing radiant goods as he shines.
5. Awakening, you become fully kindled, o you who carry the oblations to  the gods;
upon you do mortals call.
6. O mortals, serve immortal Agni with ghee,
the undeceivable lord of the household.
7. With undeceivable flame, o Agni, burn demonic power.
Shine as the herdsman of truth.
8. With your face, o Agni, flame against the sorceresses,
as you shine among those dwelling far and wide [/the Urukṣayas].
9. With their hymns those dwelling far and wide [/the Urukṣayas] have fully  kindled you, the oblation-carrier,
the best sacrificer among the people descended from Manu. X.119 (945) Self-Praise of the “Lapwing” [laba]
Laba Aindra
13 verses: gāyatrī
A famous and often translated 1st-person account of the experience of soma-drink ing. Who the 1st-person speaker is meant to be has generated much discussion. The  Anukramaṇī calls this the ātmastuti “self-praise” of a laba (a word that does not  appear in the hymn or in the R̥gveda), a particular type of bird, the lapwing—while  commentators have generally identified the speaker either as the poet or as a par ticular god, usually Indra or Agni. We are inclined toward a version of the interpre tation of George Thompson (2003). Thompson situates the hymn in the genre of  ātmastuti, with its boastful self-assertion and the impersonation, or role-playing, by  a poet of “a divine agent.” Under this interpretation, the speaker is fundamentally  the poet, but the poet consciously taking on the voice and identity of another entity
or entities—in our view, both that of a bird and that of a god, indeed of Indra. The presence of the poet is clearest in his claims about his mind and the thought  that approaches him and that he shapes (vss. 1, 4–5). It is even possibly visible in  the spirited refrain—“Have I drunk of the soma? Yes!”—in which the speaker inter rogates himself and only after this internal verbal exchange asserts that he has con sumed soma. (One might suggest, only partially in jest, that Indra would not need  this verbal self-reassurance.) To characterize the soma-drinking experience the poet  borrows the identity of a bird, suggesting that the overwhelming sensation is that of  flight, lifting him up (vss. 2–3), making the people on the ground seem impossibly  small and insignificant (vs. 6) and his own wings large enough to cover the cosmos  (vss. 7, 11). But this prodigious creature cannot be only a bird, for the speaker boasts  of his control of the cosmic spaces and his ability to move the earth at will (vss. 8–10).  These boasts are most appropriate to Indra, who commonly manipulates cosmic enti ties, who is most likely to engage in self-vaunting ātmastuti (cf., e.g., X.48–49), and  who is the archetypal soma-drinker among the gods. The hymn ends (or almost ends)  with the apparent epiphany of Indra in verse 12, triumphantly announced by “here  I am” (ahám asmi) and calling attention to his presence in the ritual arena. The final verse (13) seems an anticlimax, and its contents also sit uneasily in the rest  of the hymn. The identity that this 1st-person speaker claims, that of oblation-carrier  (havyavā́hana), is responsible for the view that the speaker throughout the hymn is  Agni, for havyavā́hana and its variant havyaváh are always epithets of that god. But  the fact that Agni speaks this verse does not require that he be the speaker in the rest  of the hymn. In our view this verse, like many final verses, marks a shift of subject or  a coda. The speaker is indeed Agni. It seems possible that Indra’s epiphany in the pre ceding verse has brought him face to face with the principal god of the ritual and the  ritual ground, namely Agni, and that Agni borrows the rhetoric of Indra to make his  own counter-boast and assert the importance of his own role—though his somewhat  pedestrian self-comparison to a well-equipped household contrasts almost comically  with the soaring and exuberant language of the rest of the hymn.

## 120 (946) Indra
Brhaddiva ̥ Ātharvaṇa
9 verses: triṣṭubh
For most of its length this hymn is a fairly straightforward praise of Indra, his pow ers, and his victories. There is special emphasis also on the relation between Indra  and his verbally active “helpers.” The relationship is hierarchal—Indra is supreme— but also reciprocal, in that the helpers cheer him on and fortify him for his exploits  (esp. vss. 1–4). The helpers are not named; the two most prominent Indra myths,  Vr̥tra and Vala, both feature a troop aiding or encouraging Indra: the Maruts and the  Aṅgirases respectively. It is thus possible that either or both groups are meant here,  and, further, that human poets are assimilated to these divine choruses (see vs. 4). The encouragement becomes more personal in verse 5, where a 1st-person  speaker assumes the role of verbal inciter. This is surely the poet himself, but, we  will claim, not a mere human poet. The last two verses of the hymn (8–9) summa rize the performance context of the hymn. Verse 8 begins “Br̥haddiva speaks these  sacred formulations to Indra,” and Br̥haddiva is named again as the poet in verse 9  (as well as being so identified by the Anukramaṇī). But verse 9 introduces a puzzle  or a surprise, for it begins, “In this way Br̥haddiva addressed his own self—that is,  Indra.” It is difficult to read the sentence in any other way, though many have tried,  but if Indra is the same as Br̥haddiva, who is Br̥haddiva?
A way to a solution to this conundrum has been presented by Hanns-Peter  Schmidt, though he himself does not discuss this hymn. As Schmidt convincingly  argues (1968), Br̥haspati was originally an epithet and aspect of Indra, especially  in the Vala myth, in which Indra uses not brute strength but verbal skill to open  the Vala cave and release the stolen cows. Br̥haspati becomes detached from Indra  and treated as a separate god, but this process is a protracted one and can be  observed happening in the R̥gveda. We suggest that this hymn reflects an awareness  of their original identity and their growing separateness, with the verbally adroit  Br̥haspati, master of sacred formulations (bráhman; see vss. 5d and 8a), praising  his other self, the king and victorious warrior Indra. The name Br̥haddiva (lit.,  “possessing lofty heaven”) is reminiscent of Br̥haspati, and the sacred formula tions he addresses to Indra in verse 8 precisely concern the Vala myth, the locus of  their identification.
1. Just this was the foremost among living beings, from which the mighty  one of vibrant manly spirit was born.
As soon as he is born, he melts down his rivals, while all his helpers cheer  him on.
2. Having grown strong through his swelling power, he of much might, as  rival to the Dāsa, creates terror for him.
On your winning the animate and the inanimate, (your helpers) bellow to  you together at the presentation (of the soma), at the revels.
3. All bend their will toward you, even when these helpers are twice or three  times as many.
“Send the sweeter than sweet surging together with the sweet. With
honey, battle for that honey yonder.”
4. For it is even in those words that at every revel the inspired poets cheer  you on as you win the stakes.
Stretch your mightier (bow) taut, bold one. Let the sorcerers of evil ways  not deceive you.
5. Through you we have become exultant in our battles, as we see before us  the many fights to be fought.
I rouse your weapons with my words; I hone your vital powers with my  sacred formulation.
1592 X.121
6. (I praise) him who is worthy of praise, the craftsman possessing many  forms, the strongest Āptya of Āptyas.
He will shatter the seven Dānus with his swelling strength; he will
overcome the many opposing forces.
7. You deposited this, both the nearer and the farther, in the house in which  you helped with your help.
You cause the two parents [=Heaven and Earth], who were in motion, to  stay still, and then you spur on many deeds.
8. Br̥haddiva speaks these sacred formulations fortissimo to Indra: “the first  to win the sun,
he has dominion over the great cowpen of the sovereign king, and he  opened up all the doors that are his own.”
9. In this way, great Br̥haddiva, the Atharvan, addressed his own self—that  is, Indra.
The stainless sisters, who stay by their mother, speed him with swelling  strength and make him strong.
## 121 (947) Ka “Who?”
Hiraṇyagarbha Prājāpatya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn takes the form of a cosmogony, but here the creative principle is  unnamed or has no name. Rather than declaring its deity, the hymn’s refrain is  a question: “Who is the god to whom we should do homage with our oblation?”  Although without a name, the deity has a form. In the first verse the poet calls it  hiraṇyagarbhá “the golden embryo” (vs. 1a), the yolk of an egg (cf. Lommel 1939),  thus anticipating later myths of creation from a world-egg (e.g., Vāmana Purāṇa  Saromāhātmya XXII.17). But the “golden embryo” is also the sun, which here is  born as the center of the cosmos. Toward the end of the hymn, in verse 7, the poet  gives the still unnamed principle a second identity not just as a god but as “the  life of the gods” (devā́nām...ásuḥ). The last verse finally attaches a name to the  unnamed principle, but this verse is a later addition (Oldenberg 1888: 248), reflect ing a redactional effort not to leave the mystery of this principle unresolved. In  that verse the deity is revealed to be Prajāpati, the “Lord of Creatures,” who in  the Brāhmaṇas is both the creator god and the archetype of the sacrifice. Later  tradition confirms the identity of this principle by understanding the constantly  repeated ká “who?” to be a name of Prajāpati. Accordingly the Anukramaṇī desig nates Ka as the deity of this hymn.
In a very perceptive interpretation of the hymn Proferes (2007: 140–41) shows the  relation of this hymn to the ideology of kingship. In the royal unction ritual the king  is reborn by means of the unction waters as a being with the power and brilliance of  the sun. This hymn reproduces the elements of that rite: the conception of an embryo (vss. 1, 7) and a ruler (vss. 1, 2, 3), the waters (vss. 7, 8, 9) that bear an embryo (vs. 7),  and the birth of fire (vs. 7). The unnamed principle encompasses the entire world (vss.  4, 5, 10), and its power extends in every direction (vs. 4) and over every being (vss. 2,  3, 8), as the king (ideally) is the master of the world, whose power extends everywhere.  Likewise, the unnamed principle supports the world—making it firm (vs. 5) and steady  (vss. 5, 6)—and gives it life (vss. 2, 7), as the king maintains and preserves the world.
Structurally, the hymn is organized as an almost unbroken series of dependent  clauses. The first series of relative clauses, hanging off the main clauses in verse 1,  lasts from verses 2 through 6. Verse 7 then re-establishes the pattern, for it has a  main clause, on which the relative clauses in verse 8 depend. The phrase “he alone  existed” in verses 1b and 8c create a ring, which defines the boundaries of the main  body of the hymn. Outside this ring and outside the main body of the hymn, verse  9 repeats in miniature the pattern of preceding verses. It has a main clause in 9a,  which is followed by three more relative clauses and concluded by the refrain. The  verse is an appeal to the unnamed deity to do no harm, making it also thematically  distinct from the main body of the hymn. Like verse 10, it too may have been a later  addition, as Thieme (1964: 69) has asserted.
1. The golden embryo evolved in the beginning. Born the lord of what came  to be, he alone existed.
He supports the earth and the heaven here— – Who is the god to whom  we should do homage with our oblation?
2. Who is the giver of breath, the giver of strength; whose command all  honor, whose command the gods honor;
whose shadow is immortality, whose shadow is death— – Who is the god  to whom we should do homage with our oblation?
3. Who became king of the breathing, blinking, moving world—just he  alone by his greatness;
who is lord of the two-footed and four-footed creatures here— – Who is  the god to whom we should do homage with our oblation?
4. Whose are these snow-covered mountains [=the Himalayas] in their  greatness; whose is the sea together with the world-stream, they say;
whose are these directions, whose (their) two arms [=the zenith and
nadir?]— – Who is the god to whom we should do homage with our  oblation?
5. By whom the mighty heaven and earth were made firm; by whom the sun  was steadied, by whom the firmament;
who was the one measuring out the airy realm in the midspace— – Who  is the god to whom we should do homage with our oblation?
6. Toward whom the two battle lines [=heaven and earth] looked, steadied  with his help, though trembling in mind,
(those) upon which the risen sun radiates. – Who is the god to whom we  should do homage with our oblation?1594 X.122
7. When the lofty waters came, receiving everything as an embryo and  giving birth to the fire,
then the life of the gods evolved alone— – Who is the god to whom we  should do homage with our oblation?
8. Who by his greatness surveyed the waters receiving (ritual) skill (as an  embryo) and giving birth to the sacrifice;
who, the god over gods, alone existed. – Who is the god to whom we  should do homage with our oblation?
9. Let him not do us harm—he who is the progenitor of earth or who,  with foundations that are real, engendered heaven,
and who engendered the gleaming, lofty waters. – Who is the god to
whom we should do homage with our oblation?
10. O Prajāpati! No one other than you has encompassed all these things  that have been born.
Let what we desire as we make oblation to you be ours. We would be  lords of riches.
## 122 (948) Agni
Citramahas Vāsiṣṭha
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 1, 5
Attributed to a Vasiṣṭhid by the Anukramaṇī, this hymn ends (vs. 8) with a men tion of the Vasiṣṭhas and with the Vasiṣṭha refrain from Maṇḍala VII. It is a fairly  standard praise of Agni, deploying a wide range of his standard epithets and ritual  roles and titles. The ritual is the complete focus of the hymn, and the rewards that  the sacrificer will receive from properly performing it and serving Agni are also at  the forefront. There is much recycling of vocabulary.
1. Him, of brilliant might like a Vasu, will I hymn—the precious, kindly  guest, not to be despised.
He will bestow all-nourishing riches—Agni the Hotar, the Houselord— and an abundance of heroes.
2. Taking pleasure, Agni, delight in my speech, knowing all the (ritual)  patterns, o very effective one.
You with your cloak of ghee—set the course for the sacred formulation.  Following your commandment the gods begot (it).
3. As you, the immortal, circle the seven domains, as you do pious work for  the pious, be generous to the one who performs (rituals) well
with wealth rich in heroes ready to hand, o Agni. Whoever has reached  toward you with a kindling stick, take pleasure in him. 4. The beacon of the sacrifice, the foremost one set in front do the seven  (priests) offering oblations reverently invoke as prizewinner—
Agni who hears them, the bull with ghee on his back, the god who gives  to the giver an abundance of heroes.
5. You are the foremost messenger, worthy to be chosen. Being summoned  for immortal (soma?), become exhilarated (on it).
You did the Maruts groom in the house of the pious; you did the Bhr̥gus  illuminate with praises.
6. In milking all-nourishing refreshment out of the good milker for the  sacrificer who is pleasing to the sacrifice, o very effective one,
and in making the circuit three times around the truths, around the
sacrifice, while shining ghee-backed, o Agni, you well display your
effective power.
7. Just to you, at the brightenings of this dawn, did the sons of Manu  perform sacrifice, on making you their messenger.
You have the gods strengthened to be magnified, rubbing melted butter  down (on your body) at the ceremony, o Agni.
8. The Vasiṣṭhas have called you down, the prizewinner, as they hymn you,  o Agni—the ritual adepts at the rites.
Uphold among the sacrificers the thriving of wealth. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
## 123 (949) Vena
Vena Bhārgava
8 verses: triṣṭubh
A famous and mystical hymn, whose opacity still defies complete comprehension  although its main features are clear. The subject is announced in the first words of  the first verse: “this Seeker” (ayám vénaḥ), and the Anukramaṇī also attributes the  hymn to the same figure, or his multiform: Vena Bhārgava. This poet is also cred
ited with the soma hymn IX.85 by the Anukramaṇī, and the last four verses of that  hymn (9–12), which contain phraseology quite similar to X.123 and which we might  term “Vena without Tears,” help clarify X.123. What is at issue is the common iden tification of Soma and the Sun, united in the Seeker figure, who is also identified as  a Gandharva (vss. 4 and 7) and as a bird (vss. 5–6). Most verses are applicable to  either Soma or the Sun, and, as is common in hymns with such dual referents, the  effort of fashioning phraseology that works for both referents accounts for many  of the enigmas in the hymn, beginning with the birth and first appearance of the  Seeker in verses 1–2.
It is noteworthy that the Seeker is also eagerly sought: the inspired poets pursue  him (vss. 1, 4, probably 6), as do women seeking a husband (vs. 2) and mothers (vs.
1596 X.123
3)—both feminine references probably standing for the hymns produced by these  poets. Needless to say, both Soma and the Sun are regularly the object of such  poetic attentions, and the intimate bond between poets and what they celebrate is a  prominent theme in the hymn.
Less prominent, but perhaps not less important, is the theme of name-and-form.  This first surfaces explicitly in verse 4, where it is their recognition of the form of  the Seeker that inspires the poets’ longing for him. In the same verse the Seeker, as  Gandharva, finds “the immortal names.” Later, in verse 7, this same Gandharva  engenders his own names. These verses seem to adumbrate the later preoccupation  with name and form as representing the creation of the multiplicity of objects in the  world by the division of the formless into “forms” and the assignment of “names” to  each in order to differentiate them. This theme is treated with great skill and subtlety  also in III.38. In this hymn here the Gandharva’s engendering his own names in the  penultimate verse of the hymn leads to a climax of sorts in the final verse (8), though  one that is quite downplayed. In that final verse the undifferentiated figure of Soma/ Sun is actually divided into its two constituent parts, though neither is mentioned by  name. The first half of the verse concerns the drop (drapsá), a word regularly used of  Soma, while the second half has as its subject bhānú “radiance,” which is especially  characteristic of the Sun. Through the power of the poets’ perception of the true  “form” of things and their ability to assign them “names,” Sun and Soma emerge at  the end of the hymn as separate, though mutually dependent, entities.
1. This Seeker here spurs on those females whose embryo is the dappled  one—he whose afterbirth is light—in the measuring out of the
airy realm.
At the union of the waters and the sun, the inspired poets lick him with  their thoughts like an infant (calf).
2. The Seeker raises up a wave from the sea. The cloud-born one, the top of  the delightful one has been sighted,
as the glint on the back of truth, on its upper surface. (All) the
“brides-to-be” have roared toward the same womb.
3. The mothers of the calf, who are many though stemming from the same  nest, stand there bellowing [/yearning] toward the same (womb).
Having stridden onto the back of truth, the voices lick at the
immortal honey.
4. Recognizing his form, the inspired poets longed (for him). Because they  came toward the cry of the wild buffalo,
approaching with truth they mounted onto the stream. The Gandharva  found the immortal names.
5. The Apsaras, the maiden smiling coyly at her lover, bears him in the  highest distant heaven.
He roamed among the wombs of the dear one [masc.], himself being  dear; he sat on a golden wing—he is the Seeker— 6. When they, seeking with their heart, gazed upon you, an eagle flying to  the vault,
the golden-winged messenger of Varuṇa, the (omen-)bird fluttering in  the womb of Yama.
7. The Gandharva stood erect upon the vault, facing outward, bearing his  dazzling weapons;
wearing a fragrant cloak, (lovely) to be seen like the sun, he engendered  his own dear names.
8. When the (soma-)drop goes to the sea, seeing with the eye of a vulture in  the spreading expanse,
the (sun’s) radiance with its bright blaze, finding pleasure (in it [=drop]),  has created its own dear (names) in the third realm.
## 124 (950) Various Gods
Agni (2–4), Agni, Varuṇa, and Soma (1, 5–9)
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7
SWJ
This dialogue hymn may be one of the most discussed poems in the R̥gveda, and the  number, variety, and contradictory nature of its interpretations are truly astound ing—far too many and too diverse to be summed up here. (For a brief characteriza tion of many of these treatments see W. E. Hale [1986: 86–92], and for a recent and  intriguing interpretation see Proferes [2007: 121–27].)
The hymn begins with an address to Agni by Indra (vs. 1); Agni answers in verse  2 and, in many interpretations, continues to speak in verses 3 and 4—though I fol low the opinion that Varuṇa and Soma are the speakers of those two verses. Indra  returns as speaker in verses 5 and 6, addressed to Varuṇa and Soma respectively.  The last four verses (7–10) appear to be the words of the poet.
In his speech Indra is attempting to coax the other gods addressed to join him  in his new sacrifice, leaving behind their old ways and their old kin group. The gods  need little persuasion. After Indra promises to make him the oblation-bearer in  verse 1, Agni agrees with alacrity to go “as a god, from the non-god” and “from my  own fellowship to an alien lineage” (vs. 2). In verse 3 Varuṇa (if he is the speaker;  otherwise Agni again) echoes this proposed journey, in the expression “I go from  the non-sacrificial to the sacrificial portion,” while in verse 4 Soma (again, if he is  the speaker) “chooses Indra” and “leaves the father,” ending the verse with the ring ing declaration: “the kingship has made a revolution.”
Thus the subject of the hymn seems to be nothing less than a radical politi cal and religious reconfiguration, with shifting alliances leading to a fundamental
1598 X.124
realignment of the major divinities and to a new sacrificial order and a new rule.  What has intensified the scholarly debate about this hymn is the assumed identity  of the losing side. In verse 3 we find “Father Asura” (or “the lordly father”), pre sumably the same father that Soma leaves after choosing Indra in verse 4. In verse  5 Indra asserts that the Asuras (or “lords”) have lost their māyā or “magic powers,”  while the first divinity to leave, Agni, begins verse 2 with the emphatic ádevād deváḥ “from a non-god (I) a god...” It has thus been difficult not to consider this hymn  in the context of the vexing question about the Asura–Deva rivalry so prominent in  Vedic prose, mirrored in the Avestan Ahura–Daēuua split, but complicated by the  R̥gveda, which shows almost no signs of such a rivalry or even of a defined group of  Asuras distinct from the Devas. Despite these R̥gvedic lacunae it was still tempting  to see in this hymn a depiction of the overthrow of the Asuras by the Devas and  a number of scholars have done so, although there are important counterindica tions—not least the passage just cited where Agni asserts his identity as a god even  as he is leaving his own kin-group, supposedly the Asuras.
I will not pursue this particular question further, for want of space (and a  disinclination to engage in a debate unlikely ever to be satisfactorily resolved).  I will, however, point out a striking feature of the hymn that seems not to have  been sufficiently noted. Whoever the two opposing parties in this revolution were,  the power shift from one to the other was remarkably peaceful, especially for  the R̥gveda, where most conflicts have violence as their defining characteristic.  This peacefulness is emphasized throughout the hymn. Agni refers to the non-god  he left as “being kindly disposed” (śivá), apologetically describing himself as  “unkind” (áśiva) in leaving (vs. 2c). Varuṇa seems to counter this in verse 3c by  proclaiming to Father Asura that Agni was indeed kind (śéva) (in my interpreta tion: this pāda has been variously interpreted). In verse 7 Varuṇa is said to have  released the waters “without an excess of power,” and the waters thus released  “make peace with each other.” In verse 8 Indra “dwells peacefully” amid his sub
jects. The only violence in the hymn is prospective: the smashing of Vr̥tra fore seen by Indra in verse 6, once Soma has allied himself with Indra. The hymn is  all about negotiation and a sort of sacrificial horse-trading: see Indra’s offers of  important roles to Agni (1c), Varuṇa (5d), and Soma (6d). Indra even begs Varuṇa  to “love” him (5b). The principal figures “choose” their side and their ruler (Soma  in 4b and even the female rivers in 8b) and make their own moves, as emphasized  by the repeated verbs of motion (“come!” 1a; “going . . .I go, . . .I leave, . . .I go”  2; “I go” 3d; “I leave . . .they bestir themselves. . .(I) coming here” 4; “come!” 5d;  “come forth!” 6c). The peaceful and voluntary nature of the change in alliances—
the lack of retaliation by the deserted side, the lack of interest in pursuing their  advantage and crushing their opponents by the winning side—distinguishes this  episode not only from almost every other such situation in the R̥gveda but also  from the perpetual conflict and reflexive hostility between Asuras and Devas in  middle Vedic literature—an indication, perhaps, that that rivalry is not the con
text in which to interpret this hymn. Although, given the apparent failure of so many R̥gvedic interpreters to iden tify the deserted party successfully, it is foolhardy to suggest my own candidate,  I will make an unemphatic essay in that direction. Note first that the figure most  clearly left behind by the deserting gods is a “father”—qualified once as Father  Asura/lordly father (3c), once just as father (4b). Note also the first half of verse  6, where Indra points to the sun and its previous preeminence on the scale of  value, but suggests that it is now eclipsed or rivaled by the light of the broad  midspace. Let us also remember the heads of the pantheons in Greek and Roman  mythology, Zeus Patēr and Iuppiter respectively, and the curious fact that the  cognate figure in ancient India, formulaically transparent Dyaus Pitar “Father
Sky/Heaven,” has no comparable prominence in Vedic mythology though he is  reasonably well attested in the texts. On putting these clues together, it seems  possible that the old sky-centered religion focused on the inherited paternal  divinity Dyaus quietly gave way to one located in realms closer to men, where  divinities concerned themselves with issues important to mankind, such as the  release of the waters (vss. 7–8), and actively sought the praise and sacrificial  offerings of men (vs. 9 and, by implication, throughout the hymn). Dyaus Pitar  remained a revered figure but played little role in the sacrificial system. There  was thus no violent rupture in the social or religious fabric, just a peaceful fad ing into well-but-perfunctorily-honored irrelevance for Dyaus, displaced by  ritual-centered gods like Agni and Soma and those deeply involved with men’s  affairs, ethically (Varuṇa) or martially (Indra).
JPB
In the introduction above, SWJ expresses well-considered doubt about the possibil ity of ever resolving the interpretive difficulties of this hymn. In trying once again to  understand the narrative and situation behind it, I know I risk adding yet another  not quite convincing interpretation to an already large stack of not quite convinc ing interpretations. But this hymn is difficult to avoid, because it is central to one of  the more intriguing questions of Vedic religious history: When and how does the  story of the conflict of Devas and Asuras develop? There is little possible evidence  and still less likely evidence in the R̥gveda for this narrative staple of the later Vedic  and classical traditions. We have pointed out several passages that might reflect it,  but even these are not certain (see, for example, X.53.4 and 157.4). However, as my  colleague pointed out above, a number of scholars have cited X.124 not only as  evidence for the definition of the Asuras as a group of deities distinct from and in  opposition to Devas but also as evidence—the only evidence—for an elaborate nar rative in which former Asuras shift to the side of the Devas (see, for example, Brown  1919: 100, Kuiper 1975, Oberlies 1998: 391).
In Brereton (forthcoming b), I have proposed a different approach to the hymn.  I try to show that this hymn asserts a human claim of succession after the death of a  previous ruler. The hymn is indeed a dialogue, but I identify the speakers differently
1600 X.124
from their assignment below. Verse 1, I believe, is not in the voice of Indra, but in  that of the sacrificer, in whose rite the hymn was recited. The first three pādas are  a fairly standard invitation to Agni to come to the sacrifice. It is only in the last  pāda that the verse takes an unexpected turn: “For a long time,” it states, Agni has  “lain in long darkness.” That is to say, the ritual fire has been extinguished. The  later Veda prescribes that the ritual fire be extinguished at the death of a sacrificer,  and therefore at least one possibility is that this summons to Agni is a summons to  return after such a death. Verse 2 is Agni’s response: he has departed from one who  was a mortal, a “non-god,” but he now returns to his new life as the sacrificial fire  of a living sacrificer. In verse 3 the new sacrificer welcomes Agni, who previously  was the guest of the old sacrificer, to the “many domains of truth,” the places where  the new sacrificer has now installed the sacrificial fires. The sacrificer then proclaims  a kindness for his “lordly father,” the deceased sacrificer, thus identifying the old  sacrificer as both his own father and a “lord,” a ruler. The kindness he offers is the  continuation of his father’s ritual performance, which will guarantee his father’s life  in the realm of the ancestors, and in this way he converts Agni’s “unkindness” in  deserting his father to an act of kindness. In verse 4 Agni once again speaks. For  many years he acted “within it”—if antár asmin refers to the sacrifice obliquely  mentioned in verse 3—or “within him,” within the sphere or authority of the old  sacrificer. But now Agni chooses “Indra.” As in IV.42, the coronation hymn of King  Trasadasyu, “Indra” here is the new king. “The kingship has made a revolution,”  Agni declares, for there is a new king, and Agni promises to do what he can to help  in the institution of that king’s rule. To this the new sacrificer and king replies, now  addressing Varuṇa, who has been made present by Agni. He says that rival lords  lack the ability to rule, and therefore Varuṇa should come and govern with him and  in support of him.
In my view the dialogue ends with verse 5. In verse 6 the sacrificer and new king  makes a final declaration, in which he explicitly identifies himself with Indra, here by  assuming Indra’s most characteristic deed, the destruction of Vr̥tra. The final three  verses are in the voice of the priestly narrator. In verse 7 he identifies the new king with  Varuṇa by attributing to him the deeds of Varuṇa, and in verse 8 the new king once  again becomes Indra. Finally in verse 9 the sage poets “discern” Indra. And where do  they discern him? In the king, who acts in accordance with the praise that follows him!
Thus, the hymn parallels IV.42, in which Trasadasyu acts as both Varuṇa and  Indra in peace and in war. Unlike Trasadasyu, however, the claimant here seems to  have had opposition, which would have made the ritual affirmation of his rule all the  more essential. In this interpretation, ásura “lord” or “lordly” dissolves as a designa
tion for a group of gods. In its two occurrences, in the singular in verse 3 and in the  plural in verse 5, ásura refers to human lords, not to gods or antigods or old gods.  And not only does it refer to humans, but also to quite different humans: in verse 3  to the predecessor of the sacrificer and in verse 5 to the sacrificer’s enemies or rivals.
1. [Indra:] Come right up to this sacrifice of ours here, Agni, with its five  tracks, three circles, seven threads. You will be our oblation-carrier and the one who goes in front of us. For  a long time indeed you have lain in long darkness.
2. [Agni:] Going in concealment and hiding, I go, as a god, from the  non-god, foreseeing immortality for myself.
When I unkindly leave (him), though he is kindly disposed, from my own  fellowship I go to an alien lineage.
3. [Varuṇa:] Seeing (him [=Agni]) as the guest of the other branch,
I measure out the many domains of truth.
I proclaim (him [=Agni]) as kindly to the lordly father [/Father Asura].  From the one without sacrifice I go to a sacrificial portion.
4. [Soma:] I have “done” many years within him. (Now) choosing Indra,  I leave the father.
Agni, Soma, Varuṇa—they bestir themselves. The kingship has made a  revolution; I help it (along), by coming here.
5. [Indra:] These lords [/Asuras] have lost their magic powers. And if you,  Varuṇa, will love me,
sifting untruth out from truth, o king, come here to the overlordship of  my kingdom.
6. [Indra:] Here is the sun—it alone used to be the thing of value. (But now)  there is this coming to light—the broad midspace.
Let us two smash Vr̥tra—come forth, Soma. We shall sacrifice to you  with an oblation, though you yourself are an oblation.
7. The poet with his poetic craft has fastened the form (of the sun?) in  heaven. Without excess of power Varuṇa released the waters.
Making peace with each other like (co)wives, the rivers, (though) clear,  each variously bear his color.
8. They follow his preeminent Indrian power. He dwells peacefully among  them who delight in their independent power.
They, on choosing him as clans choose a king, recoiling turned away  from Vr̥tra.
9. They say that a goose is the yokemate of those who recoiled, a goose  roaming in the fellowship of the heavenly waters.
The one roaming hither and yon in pursuit of the verse of praise have  the sage poets discerned to be Indra through their inspired thought.
## 125 (951) Speech
Vāc Āmbhrṇ̥ a
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 2
Another very famous hymn, to the goddess Speech (Vāc), it is couched as an  ātmastuti or “self-praise,” and this aspect is certainly quite insistent. The 1st person speaker uses the word “I” (ahám) fifteen times (not counting other cases
1602 X.125
of this pronoun), along with numerous 1st-person present-tense verbs. With the  fame of the hymn comes a certain carelessness on the part of its many transla tors, who have tended to smooth out the rough and puzzling places. See, for  example, verse 3d, where a more fluent and expected expression might be “I have  many stations and enter many things” (compare Doniger O’Flaherty’s “I dwell  in many places and enter into many forms” and Maurer’s “with many a place  and entering upon many a form”), but the undoubted causative verb form in the  second phrase makes that easy rendering impossible. The praises that Speech  heaps upon herself are not necessarily for the things that we expect her to boast  about, and as translators and interpreters we must follow the lead of her own  grammatical choices.
She begins by asserting her companionship with, indeed her support for, the  primary gods and groups thereof (vss. 1–2), as well as for the mortal sacrificer. In  verse 3 she sounds the common theme of the divisions of speech, though not in the  usual way; in the phrase noted above (3d), she asserts that not only is she found in  many places—that is, she has been much subdivided—but that many things enter  her—that is, she also encompasses the many entities that make up the world. These  contrastive, mirrored images are part of her totalizing project.
Verse 4 and 5 are the center of the hymn and its crux, defined as an ompha los by the framing forms of ā́-√viś “enter” in 3d and 6d and by the repeated  vadāmi “I speak / tell” of 4d and 5a. In the first three pādas of verse 4 she depicts  speech as that on which the other operations of life depend, but in a curiously  oblique way—not through speech directly but through eating. She identifies eat ing as the central operation and herself as the instrument and facilitator of eat ing (“through me he eats food”), with the other senses (“who sees, who breathes,  who hears. . . ”) dependent on the eating. (Other translators tend to elide the  distinction between the main clause “he eats food” and the subordinate clauses  “who sees,” etc., but the contrast is too marked to ignore.) What can she mean  by this odd statement? If we are right, (at least) two different things. On the one  hand, she is laying claim to the mouth, the organ that engages in both eating  and speaking. The other sense organs—eyes (sight), nose (breathing), ears (hear ing)—are not involved with either operation. Eating is essential to life: one can’t  see, breathe, or hear without being alive, which requires food, and so, by their  joint location in the mouth, Speech can assert her primary role in eating and thus  in staying alive. By this argument, all other sense activities depend on Speech.  But we think there is also another, more pointed message here, about the poet,  whom she is about to address. The poet makes his livelihood (“eats his food”)  by producing poetic speech from the inspiration of the goddess Speech, and his  sense activity, including the ways in which he receives inspiration, by seeing and  hearing especially, as well as his life depends on her.
In the final pāda of verse 4 she addresses the poet directly, with a tour de force  of phonological play, much remarked upon in scholarly literature: śrudhí śruta  śraddhiváṃ te vadāmi “Listen, o you who are listened to: it’s a trustworthy thing I tell you.” The poet is the one who is “listened to” in the world: his verbal products  have a privileged status, and she makes him a conduit of her own message. In the  following verse (5) she explains how she chooses and anoints her choice as poet and  what qualities she invests him with.
After the omphalos verses she returns (vss. 6–8) to a more general and wider  focus, asserting her pervasion of Heaven and Earth, indeed of all the worlds, both  horizontally and vertically, and even beyond them. Quite striking, and also super ficially unclear, is her statement in verse 7a, literally “I give birth to the/a father on  his head” (aháṃ suve pitáram asya mūrdhán). In contrast to most interpretations  of this statement, we interpret it in light of a common use of the phrase “the head  of heaven” in the R̥gveda as an epithet for Agni (e.g., III.2.14 agním mūrdhā́naṃ diváḥ). The father is “Father Heaven” (Dyaus Pitar), but “his head” is then actually  a reference to fire, most particularly the ritual fire in its deified form Agni. If we  are correct, Vāc is returning to the notion of sacrificial speech found earlier in the  hymn, implying that speech produced on the ritual ground beside the sacrificial fire  in a sense creates and sustains the cosmos. From this restricted space, namely the  locus of the sacrifice, speech spreads across all realms and up to heaven. (Under this  interpretation, the womb in the waters of 7b could refer to the waters of the soma  sacrifice, though this is not necessary.)
In sum, our version of a beloved hymn to a beloved goddess is stranger and  perhaps less lovable than its usual interpretations, but also reflects the crafty indi rection of the goddess herself.
1. I roam with the Rudras and the Vasus, I with the Ādityas and the  All Gods.
I bear both Mitra and Varuṇa, I Indra and Agni, I both the Aśvins.
2. I bear the swollen soma, I Tvaṣṭar and Pūṣan and Bhaga.
I establish wealth for the man offering the oblation, who pursues (his  ritual duties) well, who sacrifices and presses.
3. I am ruler, assembler of goods, observer foremost among those deserving  the sacrifice.
Me have the gods distributed in many places—so that I have many
stations and cause many things to enter (me).
4. Through me he eats food—whoever sees, whoever breathes, whoever  hears what is spoken.
Without thinking about it, they live on me. Listen, o you who are
listened to: it’s a trustworthy thing I tell you.
5. Just I myself say this, savored by gods and men:
“Whom I love, just him I make formidable, him a formulator, him a seer,  him of good wisdom.”
6. I stretch the bow for Rudra, for his arrow to smash the hater of the  sacred formulation.
I make combat for the people. I have entered Heaven and Earth.1604 X.126
7. I give birth to Father (Heaven?) on his (own?) head [=Agni?]; my womb  is in the waters, in the sea.
Thence I spread forth across all worlds, and yonder heaven with its
height I touch.
8. I, just like the wind, blow forth, grasping at all worlds,
beyond heaven, beyond this earth here—of such size in my greatness  have I come into being.

Kulmalabarhiṣa Śailūṣi or Aṃhomuc Vāmadevya
8 verses: upariṣṭādbrhat ̥ ī, except triṣṭubh 8
A simple hymn whose contents are shaped in great part by its meter. The first seven  verses are in upariṣṭādbr̥hatī, technically 8 8 8 12. But the last four syllables of the  final pāda are a refrain, “beyond hatreds” (áti dvíṣaḥ), giving the impression of an  anuṣṭubh verse (8 8 8 8) with a decorative flourish at the end. The principal dedi
cands of the hymn are the Ādityas, or rather the trio Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman.  These appear in scrambled order in verse 1cd, but for the rest of the upariṣṭādbr̥hatī verses (2–7) occupy the entire second pāda in fixed order. This punctuation of each  verse with two fixed phrases, each at the end of its hemistich, subordinates the mes sage of each verse to its structure. Fortunately the message is elementary: the gods
in question should lead us out of difficulties and to shelter and safety. A few other gods appear in the hymn: Rudra with the Maruts, and Indra and  Agni in verse 5, and Agni in the appended and metrically distinct final verse (8), but  their presence barely registers in the very Ādityan atmosphere.
1. O gods, neither narrow straits nor difficult passage reach that mortal whom Aryaman, Mitra, and Varuṇa lead of one accord—beyond
hatreds.
2. For we choose that—o Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman—
by which you rescue a mortal from narrow straits and lead him—beyond  hatreds.
3. They are here to aid us now—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman—
the best leaders in leading us and the best deliverers in delivering us— beyond hatreds.
4. You protect everyone all around—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.
May we be in the dear shelter of you, o you of good guidance—beyond  hatreds.
5. The Ādityas (lead) beyond failures—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.
We would call on powerful Rudra along with the Maruts, on Indra and  Agni, for well-being—beyond hatreds. 6. They are our leaders across—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman—
beyond all difficult passages—the kings of the settled domains—beyond  hatreds.
7. Let them extend blessing to us to aid us—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman— and broad shelter—the Ādityas, when we implore them—beyond hatreds. 8. Just as then you released the buffalo-cow bound by the foot, you good  ones worthy of the sacrifice,
so release constraint from us. (Let) our lifetime be further lengthened,  o Agni.
## 127 (953) Night
Kuśika Saubhara or Rātri Bhāradvājī
8 verses: gāyatrī
In contrast to the numerous hymns dedicated to the lovely and welcome Dawn,  Night is barely celebrated in the R̥gveda, only in this one hymn. The night described  here is not that of the frightening and formless darkness so often mentioned in the  text, but rather starry night, who has beauties of her own. In fact, she is described  in places (see vss. 2 and 3c especially) with phraseology more appropriate to Dawn,  whose own advent is anticipated in verse 7.
1. Goddess Night, while coming hither, has looked about in many places  with her eyes.
She has laid on herself all beauties.
2. The immortal goddess has filled the broad (midspace), its depths and  heights;
with light she repels the darkness.
3. She has expelled her sister, Dawn—she, the goddess, while coming hither— and darkness will race away.
4. (Be) here for us today—you at whose journey we have settled down, like birds on their nest in the tree.
5. Down have settled the roving bands, down the footed, down the winged, down even the falcons in their busyness.
6. Keep away the she-wolf and the wolf; keep away the thief, o Night. But for us become easy to traverse.
7. Darkness, fully ornamented, black, smeared all over (with stars), has  approached me.
O Dawn, settle it like debts.
8. Right up to you have I driven (this hymn), like cows (to their pen).  Choose it, o Daughter of Heaven,
o Night—like a praise song for a victor.

Vihavya Āṅgirasa
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9
Anxiety about rival sacrifices, a common preoccupation of the R̥gveda, begins  and informs this hymn. The first two verses situate the performance of the hymn  “at the competing invocation(s)” (vihavá, a derivative of which provides the poet’s  name, Vihavya, in the Anukramaṇī)—a moment when sacrificers all over the Ārya  lands are inviting the same gods to their own separate sacrifices. The poet urges his  own case with a series of emphatic fronted 1st-person singular pronominal forms  (“mine,” “to me,” etc.) in the first four verses. The potential competing sacrificers in  these early verses are transformed into even more threatening figures as the hymn  progress—haters (vs. 5), violent challengers in battle (vs. 6), rivals (vs. 9). The poet  then asks for the aid of the gods in repulsing them and in protecting him.
The grammar and diction of the hymn are straightforward and spring no  surprises.
1. Mine be the luster at the competing invocations, o Agni. Might we thrive  in our body as we kindle you in your body.
To me let the four quarters bow. With you as our overseer might we win  battles.
2. Mine be all the gods at the competing invocation: the Maruts together  with Indra, Viṣṇu, and Agni.
Mine be the midspace, providing a broad place. For me, at my desire, let  the wind purify itself [=blow].
3. To me let the gods bring material wealth through sacrifice. In me be the  prayer; in me the invocation to the gods.
The ancient divine Hotars acted with zeal. Might we be free from harm  in our body and possessed of good heroes.
4. For me let them sacrifice (with) the oblations that are mine. Let the  purpose of my mind come true.
Let me not fall into any kind of offense. All you gods, speak for us!
5. You six broad goddesses, create broad (space) for us. All you gods, act as  heroes here.
May we not be bereft of offspring, nor of our own bodies. May we not  become subject to him who hates us, o King Soma.
6. O Agni, repulsing the battle fury of the others [=the enemy], as an  undeceivable herdsman, protect us on every side.
Let the challengers bearing down turn back: at home their intention will  disappear when they awaken.
7. He who is the Ordainer of Ordainers, the lord of creation—him, the god  Rescuer, who vanquishes hostility (do I invoke). Let both the Aśvins and Br̥haspati (protect) this sacrifice here; let the  gods protect the sacrificer from failure.
8. The buffalo of broad expanse will offer shelter to us at this invocation— he who is invoked by many, who provides many cattle.
Show mercy to our offspring, o you of the fallow bays. Do not harm us  nor hand us over.
9. Whoever are our rivals, let them keep away: with Indra and Agni we will  thrust them down.
The Vasus, Rudras, and Ādityas have made me one who touches on high,  a formidable observer, an over-king.
## 129 (955) Creation
Prajāpati Parameṣṭhin
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This is one of the most famous hymns of the R̥gveda, and one of the most signifi cant for later Indian cosmogonies. Because it is elusive and suggestive rather than  directly narrative, it has given rise to a wide variety of interpretations. The interpre tation we offer here follows the more extensive discussion in Brereton (1999), which  also refers to earlier literature and alternate interpretations.
If this is a cosmogonic hymn, it is certainly a strange one, because the last verse  does not come to a conclusion but ends with a question. This incompleteness is  formally marked by both metrical and syntactic irregularities. The meter of verse  7b is two syllables short, leaving the its hearers to anticipate two beats that are not  there, and the syntax of 7d is incomplete since the poem ends with a relative clause  without a main clause. A close look at the rest of the hymn explains the reason for  these poetic strategies.
In verse 1 there is a progression from negations—what existed was neither exist ing nor nonexisting and neither space nor heaven existed—to questions (1c) to  possibilities (1d). Verse 2 also begins with negation, here the negation of death,  deathlessness, and the signs of night and day. The only narrative progress is the  greater specificity in verse 2 about what is negated: there are no mortals or immor tals, there is no moon or sun. But whereas 1cd continued with questions and pos sibilities, 2cd provides an answer to the question of what existed: there existed “that  One,” which “breathed without wind.” In 1c the poet asked what “stirred,” or more  literally what “moved back and forth,” and in 2c the implicit answer is that the  “breathing” of the One moves back and forth. If 2c answers the question of 1c and  indeed if verse 2 defines what verse 1 suggests, then “that One” in verse 2 is the pre viously undefined thing that was neither existent nor nonexistent in verse 1.
Verse 3 sharpens the sense that nothing is happening, nothing material at least. It  apparently starts over once again: 3a ends “in the beginning” (ágre) just as 1a ends
1608 X.129
“at that time” (tadā́nīm) and 2a “then” (tárhi). But where verses 1 and 2 asked ques tions or only hinted at answers, 3a asserts that there was something, namely “dark ness” covered by darkness, and 3c describes a “thing coming into being” (ābhú) covered by “emptiness.” In verse 3, therefore, “that One” still does not have sub stance, but it is beginning to have shape, since there is something that is “covered”
by something. As Thieme (1964: 66–67) has observed, that shape is the shape of  an egg, and it is this egg-like shape that in 3d “was born” or hatched through heat. Thus far there has been little development of substance, although there has been  an evolution of concept. An unidentified subject that neither exists nor does not  exist is introduced in verse 1. It has taken conceptual form as the “One” in verse  2, and finally assumed an egg-like shape in verse 3. In verse 4 there is a shift that  apparently breaks the continuity of the hymn. According to 4ab, thought gives rise  to desire, which is concretized as the “primal semen,” the origin of beings. However,  there is one thing that connects verses 3 and 4 and maintains the hymn’s continu ity: “desire” in 4a corresponds to “heat” in 3d. If so, then “thought” in 4b should  correspond to the “One” in 3d. And so it does, for “thought” is the hidden metaphor  in verses 1–3. In verse 1 it is thought that neither exists nor does not exist, because  thought is something real but at the same time something not real, since it is not  externally perceptible. Or, to put it another way, thought has shape but no sub stance, as verse 3 says. This hymn, therefore, shows an omphalos structure, in which  the middle verse, in this case verse 4, contains the key to the hymn. Here that key is  the revelation that thought is the One, which is the ultimate source of creation. It  is not surprising, therefore, that the “connection” (bándhu) between “existing” and  “not-existing,” the connection that is thought, was discovered by poets “though  inspired thinking” (manīṣā́, 4d). In verse 5 this “connection” also becomes a divid ing “cord” (raśmí) and through it there emerges the distinction between males (the  placers of semen and the offering) and females (“greatnesses,” i.e., pregnancies, and  independent will).
But even if thought is the ultimate and primal creative act, the origin of the  world is still unknown, even by the gods (vs. 6c). If there is an overseer of the world,  he might know, or he might not (vs. 7cd). The lack of an answer means that “think ing” will not come to an end. The poem ends with metrical and syntactic irresolu tion and with a question in order that its hearers are left thinking and in that way  left repeating the fundamental act of creation, the act of thinking.
1. The nonexistent did not exist, nor did the existent exist at that time.  There existed neither the airy space nor heaven beyond.
What moved back and forth? From where and in whose protection? Did  water exist, a deep depth?
2. Death did not exist nor deathlessness then. There existed no sign of night  nor of day.
That One breathed without wind by its independent will. There existed  nothing else beyond that. 3. Darkness existed, hidden by darkness, in the beginning. All this was a  signless ocean.
What existed as a thing coming into being, concealed by emptiness—that  One was born by the power of heat.
4. Then, in the beginning, from thought there evolved desire, which existed  as the primal semen.
Searching in their hearts through inspired thought, poets found the
connection of the existent in the nonexistent.
5. Their cord was stretched across: Did something exist below it? Did  something exist above?
There existed placers of semen and there existed greatnesses. There was  independent will below, offering above.
6. Who really knows? Who shall here proclaim it?—from where was it born,  from where this creation?
The gods are on this side of the creation of this (world). So then who  does know from where it came to be?
7. This creation—from where it came to be, if it was produced or if not— he who is the overseer of this (world) in the furthest heaven, he surely  knows. Or if he does not know...?
## 130 (956) Creation of the Sacrifice
Yajña Prājāpatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1
In its first three verses the hymn depicts the creation of the acts of the sacrifice  through the image of weaving. The form of the sacrifice was instituted by the gods  (vss. 1, 3)  and first carried out by the “fathers,” the ancient seers who were the  ancestors of the current priests (vs. 6). Indeed, these fathers are at the present rite  as well (1cd). In verse 2 it becomes complicated because it is difficult to know who  the actors are. In 2ab the subject may not be “a man,” but “the Man,” a figure  similar to the Puruṣa of X.90. That is how Sāyaṇa and others have understood it.  But it might also refer simply to “a man” in the sense of “a human” and imply that  humans have taken up the weaving of the gods and ancestors, and in doing so their  activity reaches to heaven. Again in 2cd it is not clear who “they” are who have sat  down to weave the sacrifice. They might be the fathers after 1cd, the human priests  in continuation of 2ab, or the gods in anticipation of verse 3. Since any of these  could have been so described, the ambiguity may be intentional.
Verse 3ab completes the weaving image, although the terminology reflects the  ritual as much as it does weaving. The “model” and “image” could be for a woven  cloth or a ritual performance. The nidā́na, a “connection” or a “rope,” might fit  weaving but does not fit the ritual very well. Since according to X.114.2 poets are
1610 X.130
able to see the hidden “connection,” in a ritual context it may describe knowledge  that a priest has. On the other hand “melted butter” and a “frame” could find a  place in either weaving or ritual. In 3cd the imagery is all from the sacrifice. In 3c  the poet mentions the Praügaśastra, which is the second recitation of the Morning  Pressing in the classical Agniṣṭoma. The recitation comprises I.2–3, which names  the deities who receive soma in the three pressings in an Agniṣṭoma, and may have  been singled out because of that. The last line could also be translated “when all  the gods sacrificed to the god,” but we have understood it as an echo of 6d and  X.90.16a (=I.164.50a) yajñéna yajñám ayajanta devā́ḥ “with the sacrifice the gods  offered the sacrifice.”
The ritual frame described in verses 1–3 is then filled with gods in verses 4–5,  verses that link the various meters of Vedic poetry with the major gods of the sacri ficial day. There are various associations between a particular meter and a particu lar god: The sacrificial fire, Agni, begins the sacrificial day, and the gāyatrī meter is  associated with the morning soma-pressing. The name of the br̥hatī-meter is similar  to the name of Br̥haspati, and Indra hymns are characteristically composed in the  triṣṭubh meter. And, balancing Agni and the gāyatrī, the All Gods and the jagatī meter are associated with the evening soma-pressing.
The last two verses recall the ancient sages who ordered the sacrifice and affirm  that the priests today follow the path that has been set for them. As Geldner notes,  the “courses (of the ritual)” refer to the actions of the ritual to which the recitations  are attached.
1. The sacrifice, which is extended in every direction by its warp threads and  stretched out by a hundred and one acts of the gods—
these fathers who have traveled here weave that. They sit at the warp,  saying, “Weave forth, weave back.”
2. A man extends it [=the warp] and pulls it up (with the heddles); a man  has extended it out upon the vault of heaven here.
Here are their pegs; they [=the gods?] sat down upon their seat and made  the sāman-chants the shuttles for weaving.
3. What was its model, its image? What its connection? What was its melted  butter? What was its frame?
What was the meter? What was the Praüga-recitation, what the hymn?— when all the gods offered the god [=the Sacrifice].
4. The gāyatrī meter became the yokemate of Agni. Savitar has united with  the uṣṇihā meter
and Soma with the anuṣṭubh meter, gaining greatness through the
hymns. The br̥hatī meter helped the speech of Br̥haspati.
5. The virāj meter is the full glory of Mitra and Varuṇa, and the triṣṭubh  meter is here Indra’s portion of the (sacrificial) day.
The jagatī meter entered the All Gods. According to this did the seers,  the sons of Manu, arrange (the ritual). 6. The seers, the sons of Manu, our fathers, arranged (the ritual) according  to this, when the sacrifice was born in ancient times.
Seeing with my mind as my eye, I think of the ancient ones who offered  this sacrifice.
7. The courses (of the ritual were) joined with the praise songs, joined with  the meters. The heavenly Seven Seers were joined with the model (of  the rite).
Looking along the path of the ancients, the insightful ones [=the present  priests] have taken hold of the reins (of the sacrifice) like charioteers.
## 131 (957) Indra (1–3, 6–7), Asvins (4–5) ́
Sukīrti Kākṣīvata
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 4
The Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to a descendant of Kakṣīvant, the clever  wordsmith of I.116–26, and, although the poem is framed by conventional prayers  for help to Indra (vss. 1, 6–7), there is more than a flash of Kakṣīvant’s brilliance  in the intermediate verses, especially 2–3. Moreover, almost half of Kakṣīvant’s  output consists of Aśvin hymns (I.116–120), indeed, more than half by verse count,  and verses 4–5 of our hymn allude to a myth not otherwise found in the R̥gveda but  prevalent in later Vedic, in which the Aśvins figure prominently.
Verses 2 and 3 have a slightly folksy air, using homely images to provide a model  for Indra’s behavior toward us. In verse 2 the model is the harvesting and threshing  of grain; if our interpretation is correct, the poet compares the threshing of the  grain, which gets rid of the chaff and keeps only the wholesome grain, to deci
sions Indra should make about how to distribute goods he has acquired. The goods  should come only to us [=the good grain], not to those [=the chaff] who neglect  their sacrificial tasks. This image has the type of twist that Kakṣīvant enjoys: the  audience thinks at first that the grain is being compared to the “goodies” to be  distributed, and when that interpretation doesn’t work, they must dig deeper to  redistribute the metaphorical roles.
Verse 3 is not as conceptually complex, but it displays a virtuosic density. The  first pāda contains the entire metaphorical model: a one-horse vehicle won’t suc ceed, or in an expanded and more literal paraphrase, “there is nothing that, when  drawn by a single animal, has traveled in the right way.” The implications are then  worked out: pāda b suggests that relying on oneself alone will not bring fame; the  last half of the verse provides the solution: seek Indra as helper and yokemate.
This message, that everyone needs a helper, is then projected onto the mythologi cal plane, indeed onto the greatest hero—often presented as acting triumphantly  alone—Indra. The little snatch of the Aśvin story found in verses 4–5 emphasizes  how they and Sarasvatī “helped” Indra in his need. This myth has been much
1612 X.131
discussed in the literature (see especially Bloomfield [1893] and Oldenberg [1893], as  well as Jamison [1991: 98–103]), especially in its relationship to the later Sautrāmaṇī ritual, which in fact utilizes some of the verses in this hymn and which owes its  name to the epithet of Indra found in verses 6–7, sutrā́man “of good protection.”  We will not pursue the issue in detail here. In brief summary, Indra became sick  after drinking an excess of soma, and in order to heal him the Aśvins and Sarasvatī
had him drink the usually forbidden alcohol surā, which they obtained in one way  or another (the methods are different at different periods in Vedic) from the asuric  Namuci. The surā was not pure but mixed, and both the Aśvins and Indra are here  depicted as performing the singular feat of separating the two mixed liquids in the  course of drinking them.
If even Indra occasionally needs helpers, we need feel no shame in seeking one  ourselves, and in the last two verses (6–7) we express the hope that Indra will fill  this role for us.
1. O overpowering Indra, thrust away all the eastern foes, away the
western ones,
away the northern ones, o champion, and away the southern ones, so  that we might rejoice in your broad shelter.
2. Surely it is like barley-growers and their barley—how they cut it,
threshing it according to the old ways—
(so), here, just here (with us [=grain]) put the goodies of those [=chaff]  who have not come for the reverent twisting of the sacred grass.
3. Because a “one-horse” carriage doesn’t drive well, so fame has never  been acquired (thus) at the encounters.
Inspired ones, seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking prizes, (seek) the  bull Indra for partnership.
4. O Aśvins, having separated the surā-soma by drinking it in company with  the asuric Namuci,
you helped Indra in his deeds, o lords of beauty.
5. Like parents their son, both the Aśvins helped (you), Indra, through  their wondrous skills and sage words.
When with your powers you separated the surā-soma by drinking it,
Sarasvatī healed you, bounteous one.
6. Let Indra be of good protection, of good help with his help, very  gracious, affording all possessions.
Let him thrust away hatred; let him create fearlessness. Might we be
lords of good heroes in abundance.
7. May we be in the favor of him who deserves the sacrifice, in his
propitious benevolence.
Let Indra of good protection, of good help to us keep hatred away even  from a distance. X.132 (958) Mitra and Varuṇa
Śākapūta Nārmedha
7 verses: nyaṅkusāriṇī 1, prastārapaṅkti 2, 6, virāḍrūpā 3–5, mahāsatobrhat ̥ ī 7
This metrically messy hymn is, one must say, a mess in every other way as well.  Given the serious disturbances in the meter, it is quite possible that many of the  problems in the hymn result from faulty transmission, but we must translate what  we have, not what we wish we had. At this point it is impossible to produce a satisfy
ing account of the purport of the whole hymn and of its many puzzles of detail, but  it is also not possible to supply even a tentative translation without having a prior  hypothesis about the underlying aim of the composition. Geldner suggests that a  specific political story lies behind it, full of sin, murder, and regal intrigue, but his  sketch of this scenario is not convincing.
Our own hypothesis is less dramatic, though perhaps equally unconvincing.  We believe that it reflects the ritual innovation happening during this late R̥gvedic  period that split the earlier role(s) of sacrificing priest-poet into what in classical  śrauta ritual are the “Sacrificer” (Yajamāna, lit. “the one sacrificing for himself”),  who actually has little active participation in the sacrifice but provides the mate
rial support for it, and the working priests who are the actual physical and ver bal performers of sacrifice. The new “Sacrificer” in part takes over the old role of  “patron” (sūrí), but maintains a more organic connection to the sacrifice. In this  hymn this new type of Sacrificer is celebrated, as is his largesse to us, the working  priests. Divine models for this split role with complementary duties are provided in  the hymn—primarily by Mitra and Varuṇa, the ostensible dedicands, but also by  Heaven and Earth (vss. 1 and 6, with Heaven also paired with Varuṇa in vs. 4) and  the Aśvins (vs. 1).
Perhaps the best support for our views is the first verse, which contains three  fronted repetitions of the perfect middle participle ījāná “having performed sacrifice  for himself,” the perfect-stem equivalent of the present middle participle yájamāna “sacrificing for himself” that is substantivized to become the title Sacrificer. This  figure is the object of the ministrations of both Heaven and Earth (ab) and the  Aśvins (cd). The first half of verse 2 contrastively introduces “us,” the priests who  are sacrificing (in the active voice, yajāmasi) at the prompting, presumably, of the  Sacrificer, who appears in the second half of the verse, in the guise of another mid
dle participle, krāṇá “performing (ritual) for himself.” Mitra and Varuṇa bestow  their favors on both parties and assure their joint victory over demonic forces. Verse 3 is particularly challenging and has received numerous clashing interpre tations, but we believe that it continues the theme of complementary roles and in  fact introduces the motif of the Sacrificer’s gifts to the priests. In our view “we,”  in our priestly role, are seeking to attract Mitra and Varuṇa to the sacrifice (pāda  a), while the Sacrificer is represented as the giver in pāda c, with pāda d express ing the hope or expectation that no one can disrupt his gifts to us. Complicating1614 X.132
the interpretation is the rare and rather charged word réknas “legacy.” However,  réknas is several times used of what we gain from the gods at the sacrifice (e.g.,  I.31.5, 121.5, VI.20.7); in keeping with its etymology (from the root ric “leave”), it  can be viewed as what was “left behind” by the gods at the sacrifice, and both the  priests and the Sacrificer should receive it, as they both seem to in pādas b and c  respectively.
Serious impediments to our (or anyone else’s) interpretation arise in the follow ing verses, especially the second half of verse 4 through the first half of verse 5. The  first half of verse 5, in a twist on the classic “the one ...the other” (anyá ... anyá)  construction typically used to depict the complementary functions of two indi viduals, posits the shared or successive kingship of Heaven and Varuṇa. In pāda 4c  Varuṇa, addressed in the 2nd person, or Varuṇa or someone else, presented in the  3rd person (the verb is ambiguous), “takes pleasure in the chariot.” The chariot  could be the chariot of the sacrifice, found also in verse 7b, or the war chariot.  The latter seems more likely in the context of the next pāda and the first hemistich  of verse 5 and gains resonance from other features of the god Varuṇa. Pāda 5d  states that “It is not by such a transgression that (a man) is (called) ‘oath-breaker’”  (following the reading āntakadhrúk of Eichner-Kühn [1982], who connected it  to the seṭ root am “pledge, swear,” rather than the previously standard interpre tation antaka). What transgression? If it is what is found in the previous pāda,  taking pleasure in the chariot, it might be a very oblique reference to Varuṇa’s  standard functions. It is well known that Varuṇa and Indra often share kingship  (see the famous dialogue hymn IV.42), with Indra functioning as king in times of  war, Varuṇa in times of peace. If Varuṇa is taking pleasure in the war chariot, his  behavior is uncharacteristic and could indeed be considered transgressive, but, the  poet tells us, it would not be sufficiently serious to constitute a breach of his nor mal duties, would not be an oath-breaking infraction. His unaccustomed behavior  points to the theme of the hymn, by implication: each member of a pair has his  own sphere and venturing out of that sphere may invite suspicion or even blame.  (Alternatively, if the subject of pāda c is an unidentified third person, the pleasure  that person/god takes in the war-chariot would not brand him as one who has  violated his oath to Varuṇa.)
What would be a sufficient transgression is laid out in 5ab and attributed to an  individual derogatorily named “Shit-purified” (Śakapūta)—namely, treacherously  continuing to attack fallen warriors after a peace-treaty has been concluded. Even  if our speculations about the meaning of 4cd–5ab are correct (and there are alterna
tive interpretations; for example that 4ab refers to the passing of power from Father  Sky [Dyaus Pitar] to gods such as Varuṇa and Indra possibly depicted in X.124), it  is difficult to understand why this bitter little anecdote was inserted into the hymn  at this point and just as quickly dropped. Note, by the way, that the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Śakapūta, but it is almost certainly the case that this name  was simply plucked from the hymn itself. The Anukramaṇī’s patronymic Nārmedha  has a better chance of conforming to fact, as the name Nr̥medha is found in the final verse, where poets typically name themselves, and a Nr̥medha Āngirasa is the  supposed poet of several other hymns (VIII.89–90, 98–99; IX.27, 29; VIII.90 shows  some parallels to our hymn).
The rest of verse 5 and all of verse 6 appear to concern the present sacrifice,  where the pair Mitra and Varuṇa are to be found, as well as Heaven and Earth  (in a simile)—in addition to Agni and Aditi, for good measure. Again, there are a  number of difficulties in the details. The first half of the final verse (7) also takes  place at the sacrifice, and it seems to reaffirm the split roles of Sacrificer and priest  that we claim provide the subject for the hymn. The “two ruling over property” in  pāda a are, of course, Mitra and Varuṇa, but they also represent the Sacrificer-patron  figure, while the unnamed subject of pāda b is the actual priestly officiant who will  direct the chariot of the sacrifice.
We would be perfectly happy if the hymn had ended with 7b, for the last hemis tich presents yet another unsolvable challenge. As noted above, the poet (if that’s  who it is) Nr̥medha names himself in this half-verse, also under the punning desig nation Sumedha. But the nature of the exploit he boasts of—the rescue of a certain  set of females (or feminine-gender items)—must remain opaque, because the word  characterizing the rescued is an impossible hapax, a plural present participle to  an apparent denominative verb meaning “seek/behave as/perform kaṇūka,” a word  with no etymology or apparent relatives. Following Sāyaṇa, most modern transla tors render it as “lamenting,” but this was clearly a desperate, though contextually  plausible, guess on the part of Sāyaṇa, and it seems better to leave the poet’s pun ning wordplay or contemporary reference untranslated.
1. The man who has sacrificed for himself—Heaven with its welcomed  goods (is occupied in tending) just to him; Earth is (occupied in)
tending to him who has sacrificed for himself.
The two gods, the Aśvins, with their favors have strengthened him who  has sacrificed for himself.
2. By reason of the (ritual) prompt we sacrifice to you two, o Mitra and  Varuṇa, who uphold the communities and offer good favors.
By your comradeship for the man who performs (ritual) for himself
might we prevail over demons.
3. And even now, when we seek to establish you two here, while coming into  possession of our own dear legacy,
or when the giver prospers with regard to his legacy, no one shall bring  his bounties (for us) into collision [=destroy them].
4. The one, yonder Heaven, was consecrated (as king), but (the other,  namely) you, lord Varuṇa, are (now) king of all.
As head (of all), you take pleasure in the chariot [=war chariot? chariot  of the sacrifice?]. It is not by such a transgression that (a man) is
(called) “oath-breaker,”
1616 X.133
5. But on this (man), on “shit-purified” Śakapūta, is this transgression: even  though a (peace) alliance was concluded, he keeps smiting the heroes  who have gone down.
When the charger [=Agni?] has placed the help of *you two in his own  dear bodies worthy of the sacrifice—
6. Because, o discerning ones, Aditi, the mother of you two is, like Heaven  and Earth, (occupied) in purifying with her milk—
(all of you,) allot things dear (to us); wash (us) with the rays of the sun. 7. Because you two who rule over property have taken your seats, he [=the  priest?] has mounted, like a chariot, the one [=sacrificial fire] sitting at  the chariot-pole (of the sacrifice), sitting on the wood.
Those females of ours, seeking [/behaving like] kaṇūka [?], has Nr̥medha  rescued from narrow straits, has “very wise” Sumedha rescued from
narrow straits.
## 133 (959) Indra
Sudās Paijavana
7 verses: śakvarī 1–3, mahāpaṅkti 4–6, triṣṭubh 7
The most salient feature of this hymn is the refrain of the first six verses, “let the  little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows,” an elaboration on the  Nābhāka Kāṇva refrain of VIII.39–42 “let all the other squirts burst,” though  there is no apparent connection between the two poets. Our hymn is attributed  to Sudās Paijavana; Sudās is the name of the leading king in the Battle of the  Ten Kings, on whose side Indra fought, and it is perhaps not an accident that  the first three verses in this hymn are in a form of śakvarī meter (here seven  pādas of eight syllables). In VII.33.4 “a lofty cry in śakvarī” is what attracted  Indra to fight on the side of Sudās in this battle. It is meter that also provides  the possible connection with the Nābhāka Kāṇva hymns just mentioned: the rare  śakvarī meter is also found in VIII.40.2, and the likewise rather rare mahāpaṅkti  meter (six pādas of eight syllables) of the second three verses of our hymn (4–6)  is also the meter of the Nābhāka hymns VIII.39, VIII.40 (save for vss. 2 and 12),  and VIII.41.
The hymn celebrates the martial deeds and powers of Indra and urges the god to  use his powers against our enemies, both within and without.
1. Chant forth to him a leading chariot (of a hymn), a fortifying (hymn)  to Indra.
As a maker of wide space even in close quarters, a Vr̥tra-smiter in
combat and conflicts, become our inciter.
– Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
2. You sent the rivers surging downward; you smashed the serpent. You were born without a rival, Indra; you foster everything of value. We  embrace you.
– Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
3. All the hostilities of the stranger will disappear, while our poetic insights  will reach beyond (those) of the stranger.
You are wont to shoot the murderous weapon at the rival who wishes to  smite us, Indra. Your generosity—(that is just) giving goods.
– Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
4. Indra, the folk all about who, acting the wolf, will set their sights on us, set them beneath our feet. You are an overpowering oppressor.
– Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
5. Indra, whoever of the same lineage assails us and whoever outside the pale— bring his power low. (You are) like great Heaven in your own person. – Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
6. We, seeking you, seize hold of your companionship, Indra.
Lead us along the path of truth, across all difficult passages.
– Let the little bowstrings of the other squirts burst on their bows.
7. O Indra, for us exert your power over her who will milk out a choice  thing for the singer—
so that the great cow with unsplit udder will swell with milk for us, in a  thousand streams.
## 134 (960) Indra
Māndhātar Yauvanāśva (1–6a), Godhā (6b–7)
7 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except paṅkti 7
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns X.133 and X.134 to different poets, they seem to  be companion pieces. The latter hymn shares its meter, mahāpaṅkti, with the second  triplet (vss. 4–6) of X.133; both hymns are dedicated to Indra and share phraseol ogy (e.g., 133.4bc and 134.2cd); and 134 also has a refrain in its first six verses,  though one without the slangy sassiness of 133.1–6.
Like the last hymn, this one asks Indra for help against our enemies and also  for bounties. These are of course standard requests, but the imagery toward the  end of the hymn (vss. 5–6) is both precise and quirky, particularly the picture of  Indra using his ability like a long crook to pull down a high branch and shake down  its fruit, an image in turn compared to a goat doing the same with his forefoot.  (Anyone familiar with goat behavior will recognize this picture instantly.)
1. When, Indra, you filled the two world-halves, as Dawn does,
as the great sovereign king of the great domains
did the goddess Begetter beget you, did the auspicious Begetter
beget you.
1618 X.135
2. Make slack the taut (bow) of the evilly angry mortal.
Set him beneath our feet—whoever will set his sights on us.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 3. Shake down these lofty all-glittering refreshments, you foe-smiter,
through your abilities, able Indra, along with all your forms of help.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 4. Since you shake down all these, o Indra of a hundred resolves,
like wealth for the presser, together with thousandfold forms of help,
the goddess Begetter begot (you), the auspicious Begetter begot (you). 5. Like beads of sweat let the missiles fly down, scattered all around
like blades of dūrvā grass. Let malevolence go away from us.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 6. Because you carry your ability like a long crook, you rich in counsel, you will hold (it) as a goat (does) a branch with its forefoot,
bounteous one.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 7. O gods, never do we confound, never do we efface (them):
we practice obedience to your solemn utterances.
We grab onto (you) here by the sides, by the shoulders.
## 135 (961) Yama
Kumāra Yāmāyana
7 verses: anuṣṭubh
Both baffling and deeply engrossing, this hymn has given rise to a multitude  of interpretations, none of which produces a completely satisfactory reading.  Without discussing previous interpretations in detail, we will add our own,  with no expectation that it will meet with any more acceptance than those that  preceded it.
It is generally (but not universally) agreed that it concerns a death, either that of  a boy or that of his father, and the journey to (or from) the realm of Yama, the ruler  of the dead (see, e.g., X.14). Both a boy (kumārá, vss. 3–5) and a father (vs. 1) are  explicitly mentioned in the hymn, and we follow those who consider the dead man  to be the father. The pleasant place over which Yama has domain is described in the  first and last (7) verses; in the first verse the dead person is traveling there, while in  the last he seems to have reached it successfully.
The first two verses appear to be spoken by the boy whose father has just died.  He imagines his father’s journey to Yama (vs. 1), and in verse 2 he displays a psy chologically plausible ambivalence: he longs to see his father again, but recoils from  even the thought of following him on his road to the realm of the dead. The solu tion to his psychological dilemma seems to be given in verses 3–4: the boy creates a mental chariot without wheels that he mounts without seeing it, and presum ably this vehicle carries him to his father without the rigors of the journey. To us  this mental conveyance suggests a dream, and many of us have experienced such  reunions with the beloved dead in dreams. But the chariot can also be (and in vs. 4  more likely is) the ritual, quite possibly the correctly performed funeral service for  his father.
The real problems in this hymn are found in verses 5–6 and in particular the  word anudéyī, found in both verses (5d, 6a) in identical phrases. Although the  word is a transparent gerundive, in the feminine, formed to the lexeme ánu-√dā “hand over, concede” and should therefore mean “to be handed over, conceded,”  its exact usage is completely unclear. Its only other occurrence is in the wedding  hymn (X.85.6), where it appears to refer to a bridesmaid or female servant of the  bride, who is to accompany her to her new home. Interpretations of the word in  this hymn vary wildly, an indication of the problems it poses: Grassmann “Braut”  (bride); Geldner “Amme” (nurse); Renou “viatique” (provisions for a journey;  EVP), but “chargement” (cargo; Hymnes spéculatives [1956]); Oldenberg (following  Caland) “Anustaraṇīkuh” (cow to be killed at the funeral rite); Griffith “funeral  gift”; Macdonell “equipment”; Doniger O’Flaherty “gift for the journey.” Our own  interpretation is informed by the use of the lexeme ánu-√dā in an Atharvaveda pas sage (AVŚ VI.118.1–2), a passage found in various versions also in the Paippalāda  recension of the Atharvaveda, in the Maitrāyaṇa Saṃhitā, and in the Taittirīya  Āraṇyaka. In this passage the speaker asks for his offenses, his debts (r̥ṇá), to be  forgiven, using the verb ánu-dā (vs. 1: “let the two Apsarases forgive this r̥ṇá of  ours today”), and he seeks for this to happen before he enters “Yama’s world.” The  part of the passage concerning Yama’s world is read variously in the various texts  and has clearly been subject to corruption, but in most readings the person in ques tion fears entering Yama’s world “with a rope on” (ádhirajju), a rope presumably  imposed by his debts.
Reading our passage with these passages in mind, we may speculate that verses  5 and 6 find the father arriving at Yama’s world with the same anxiety apparent in  the passages just referred to: that he will be called to account for the debts he owes  and must prove that they have been repaid or forgiven (ánu-√dā) before he enters  that realm. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā (VI.3.10.5) already knows the three debts (also  r̥ṇá) with which a brahmin is born: studentship to the r̥ṣis, sacrifice to the gods, and  sons for his ancestors. Although we see no trace of studentship in this hymn, the  two questions in the first half of verse 5 provide implicit answers about the other  two debts: the dead man begat a son, and he (and/or the son) also sent forth the  chariot of sacrifice. Satisfactory answers about these debts clear the way for the  father to enter Yama’s realm in verse 6, and it may in fact be Yama who is asking  the questions.
Several questions remain, however. Since r̥ṇá “debt” is a neuter noun, why is  ánudeyī feminine in gender? There are no obvious feminine referents in this hymn  that could underlie this adjective. For this problem the Atharvaveda passage
1620 X.135
provides a clue. As was noted above, the protagonist in that passage fears entering  Yama’s world “with a rope on,” with the rope representing his unpaid debts. The  word rájju “rope” is feminine, and we suggest that this symbolic representation is  the referent of ánudeyī. A more literal rendering than that given in the translation  below would be “(the rope/fetter of debt) to be forgiven.”
Even in this interpretation verse 6 remains somewhat puzzling, though the over all impression made by the last three pādas is that of the enlargement of space.  Here the clue is found in the final pāda, in the word niráyaṇam “coming forth.” The  lexeme nír-√i (and closely related nír-ā́-√i) is almost entirely confined in the R̥gveda  to birth contexts, to “coming forth” from the womb or a womblike container. In  X.60.7 it is used not of an original birth, but of a symbolic rebirth, recalling a  sick man to life. We suggest that here, too, a rebirth is at issue, but this time it is  the rebirth into a happy life in Yama’s world, where the dead man will be reunited  with his body and partake of the pleasures hinted at in verses 1 and 7, as well as  in, for example, X.14 (esp. vss. 7–9). The reuniting with the body after death in a  distant realm is treated at length in X.56, where it is also likened to birth (X.56.1).  The rebirth in our verse is somewhat graphically depicted, with the top (the head  of the infant) coming out first, then the rest of his body, until the coming forth is  completed. (Or, alternatively, the nirayaṇam may actually refer to the afterbirth.)
The last verse announces the dead and now reborn man’s arrival at Yama’s  delightful seat, with the emphatic annunciatory pronouns idám (7a), iyám (7c),  ayám (7d), all meaning “here is, this one right here.” The promise of verse 1 has  finally been fulfilled.
For a detailed presentation of this interpretation of X.135, see Jamison  (forthcoming d).
1. [Boy:] The leafy tree where Yama holds symposium with the gods,
toward there the clanlord, our father, follows the track of the
ancient ones.
2. [Boy:] Him following the track of the ancient ones, wandering along  yonder evil way,
did I keep looking for reluctantly, but I was longing for him again.
3. [Father?:] The new chariot without wheels that you made with your  mind, lad,
the one that has a single shaft but faces in all directions—without seeing  it, you mount it.
4. [Father?:] The chariot which you, lad, sent rolling forth from the
inspired poets,
following it the sāman melody rolled forth from here, set onto a boat. 5. [Yama? Poet?:] Who begat the lad? Who sent the chariot rolling out? Who could tell us this today, how the (debt) came to be forgiven?
6. As (the debt) came to be forgiven, after that the top was born;
the base was stretched out in front and the “coming forth” was made behind. 7. Here is the seat of Yama, which is called the palace of the gods.
Here is his pipe blown; here is he adorned with hymns.
## 136 (962) Muni [the Kesins “Long-Haired Ones”] ́
Vātaraśana’s seven sons, the munis Jūti 1, Vātajūti 2, Viprajūti 3, Vrṣḁ̄ ṇaka 4,  Karikrata 5, Etaśa 6, R̥śyaśrṅ̥ ga 7
7 verses: anuṣṭubh
This short hymn about the long-haired (keśin) ascetic (muni) has gained a certain  measure of fame as an apparent precursor of later extreme ascetic practices and  of the Rudra-Śiva cult (based especially on the mention of Rudra in the last verse,  where the ascetic drinks an apparent cultic substance in company with Rudra).  From the R̥gvedic point of view its closest analogue is the Labasūkta (X.119),  describing the sensations of a soma-drinker, with its refrain “Have I drunk of the  soma? Yes!” Both hymns depict the experience as flight, especially flight sped by the  wind (here see vss. 2–6) and affording a bird’s eye view of the earth and its inhabit ants (here vs. 4–5), and also emphasize the subject’s sense of power over cosmic  entities (here esp. vss. 1, 5).
The difference seems to be the identity of the drink that produces these sensa tions: soma in I.119, “poison” (viṣá) in this hymn. The mention of the latter sub stance begins and ends this hymn (vss. 1a, 7c) in ring composition. It is unclear what  the liquid in question is. However, it should be noted that the drinker himself/itself  is provided with characteristic somian vocabulary (“sweet, most exhilarating”) in  the last pāda (6d) before the final verse depicting the preparation and drinking of  the poison, and furthermore that the preparation of this poison by churning/stir ring (√manth) and crushing (√piṣ) seems to mimic the preparation of soma: “crush”  is semantically close to “press” (√su), and a certain type of soma, mixed with meal,  is technically called manthín. The prominence of the wind-god Vāyu (vss. 5, 7) is  also reminiscent of the soma sacrifice, for Vāyu, along with Indra, is the first recipi ent of the soma drink. Thus, the cultic practice here is either being presented as a  mirror-image analogue of the orthodox soma sacrifice, or in fact is the soma sacri fice, but in esoteric guise.
1. The long-haired one bears fire, the long-haired one poison, the
long-haired one the two world-halves.
The long-haired one (bears) the sun for all to see. The long-haired one is  called this light here.
2. The wind-girt ascetics wear tawny rags.
They follow the swooping of the wind when the gods have entered (them). 3. “Roused up to ecstasy by our asceticism, we have mounted the winds. You mortals see only our bodies.”

4. He flies through the midspace, gazing down on all forms.
The ascetic has been established as the comrade of every god for good  action.
5. The horse of the wind, the comrade of Vāyu—so sped by (that) god, the  ascetic
presides over both seas, the eastern and the western.
6. Ranging in the range of the Apsarases and the Gandharvas, of the  wild birds,
the long-haired one is their sweet, most exhilarating comrade, who
knows their will.
7. Vāyu churned it for him; Kunannamā kept crushing it,
when the long-haired one drank of the poison with his cup, together  with Rudra.
## 137 (963) All Gods
Bharadvāja 1, Kaśyapa 2, Gotama 3, Atri 4, Viśvāmitra 5, Jamadagni 6, Vasiṣṭha 7 7 verses: anuṣṭubh
The Anukramaṇī attributes these seven verses to seven different authors, and it is a  distinguished group of poets indeed: the same foundational r̥ṣis in the same order as  in IX.67, a hymn that seems intended to bring together the separate poetic lineages  into a unified pan-Ārya assemblage for political purposes.
It is difficult to discern such a grand design in this hymn, which, moreover, shows  no signs of composite nature. Six of the seven verses (all but vs. 6) are found together in  single hymns in both the Śaunaka and the Paippalāda recensions of the Atharvaveda  (IV.13 and V.18 respectively), and the contents form a unity. Not surprisingly, given  its Atharvaveda parallels, it is a simple Atharvan healing spell, calling on the gods, the  wind, and the waters to bring a remedy for the disease afflicting the object of the spell.  The poet-officiant is the actual effector of the healing, however, and in the last verse  of the hymn (7; see also vs. 4) he deploys both his hands and his voice to bring about  the cure—the usual pairing of action and speech characteristic of Atharvan practice.
1. O gods, the one who has been put down, o gods, you lead him up again. and, o gods, the one who has committed an offense, o gods, you make  him live again.
2. These two winds blow from the river to the far distance.
Let the one blow skill here for you; let the other blow far away what is  malady.
3. O Wind, blow healing here; o Wind, blow away what is malady,
for you, possessing all healing, speed as the messenger of the gods. 4. I have come to you with beneficial things, and also with noninjurious  things.
I have brought auspicious skill for you; I drive your disease far away.
5. Let the gods bring rescue here; let the troop of Maruts bring rescue; let all beings bring rescue, so that this one here will be without malady. 6. These very waters are truly remedies; the waters banish affliction.
The waters are remedies for everything. Let them create a remedy
for you.
7. With two hands with their ten branches—my tongue is the lead-cow of  speech —
with the two that free you from affliction, with these two, we touch you.
## 138 (964) Indra
Aṅga Aurava
6 verses: jagatī
This short hymn celebrating a number of Indra’s great deeds is surprisingly obscure.  It begins without much difficulty, with two verses devoted to the opening of the  Vala cave, though even here there are some puzzles. The second verse ends with the  triumphant appearance of the sun after the cave is opened.
This appearance seems to set the theme for the remaining verses of the  hymn: though these four verses treat several different deeds of Indra (the destruc tion of Pipru’s fortresses in vss. 3–4, the Vr̥tra smashing in at least part of vs. 5),  they share a preoccupation with what we might call the deregulation of cosmic time  and Indra’s participation in and repair of these problems. In 3a the Sun “unhitched  his chariot in the middle of heaven,” an image that seems to suggest that the normal  daily progress of the sun through the sky stopped abruptly and time stood still.  This may, or may not, be a version of Indra’s stealing the wheel of the Sun (see,  e.g., V.29, 31; IV.30.4–5). Two factors favor the identification of the two mythic  allusions. On the one hand, Kutsa generally appears associated with Indra’s theft of  the Sun’s wheel, and he appears in our verse 1. On the other, the final pāda of our  hymn (6c) may refer, very indirectly, to the restoration of the Sun’s wheel in heaven  (see below).
Similar to the stopping of the Sun’s chariot in 3a is the striking incident in 5cd,  also referred to elsewhere (though rarely; see esp. II.15.6, IV.30.8–11), in which  Indra smashes the cart of the goddess Dawn, and she runs away in fear. Again, this  seems to involve a perturbation of the ordinary progress of time. In between, 4c  presents the sun and the moon in some relationship, which is entirely unclear but  which does not seem entirely positive.
The second half of the final verse (6) seems to show Indra remedying the situa tion, perhaps restoring both nightly and daily cosmic time. In 6c he places in heaven1624 X.139
“the apportioner of the months,” presumably the moon, while in 6d “the father”  (pitā́, the final word of the hymn), presumably Father Heaven, “bears the circlet  split apart by you [=Indra].” If we are correct that the stopping of the Sun’s chariot  in 3a is a preliminary to the stealing of his chariot-wheel, then the “wheel-segment”  borne by Heaven could be the disc of the Sun now restored to its proper place.
However, much remains unclear in this hymn, and the interpretations given here  are quite tentative.
1. In partnership with you, Indra, these conveyors (of songs), conceiving  the truth, thoroughly split apart the Vala cave,
when, showing favor to the dawns, making the waters flow, you exerted  your wondrous power (on them) and on the fertile cows, for the sake  of Kutsa and at his thought.
2. You released the fecund females, and you made the mountains bend. You  drove up the ruddy ones, and you drank the dear honey [=soma].
By your wondrous power you made the wooden (cups) strong for it. The  Sun blazed forth with the song born of truth.
3. The Sun unhitched his chariot in the middle of heaven. The Ārya found a  match for the Dāsa.
The firm fortifications of the crafty lord Pipru did Indra throw open,  having acted together with R̥jiśvan.
4. Defiant, he threw open the undefiable (fortifications); the unbridled one  pulverized the ungodly treasure-houses.
Like the Sun with the Moon, he took for his own the goods found in the  fortress. Being sung, he shattered his rivals with his flashing (weapon). 5. Possessing weapons that cannot be combatted, the far-ranging
Vr̥tra-smasher, doing his pious work by means of his splitting
(weapon), sharpens (the weapons) to be brandished.
She feared to be battered by Indra’s mace. The preening female ran
away: Dawn left her cart behind.
6. These (deeds) worthy of fame are yours exclusively, in that you alone  made him alone to be one lacking the sacrifice.
You set the apportioner of the months [=moon] in heaven. The father  [=Heaven] bears the segment of the wheel that was split off by you.
## 139 (965) Sūrya (1–3), Visvá ̄vasu (4–6)
Viśvāsu Devagandharva
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a companion piece to the previous one (X.138), though the Anukramaṇī ascribes them to different poets and assigns different deities to them. The evidence for their connection includes shared vocabulary and close lexical variants—e.g.,  mádhye ...diváḥ 138.3 and divó mádhye 139.2  “in the middle of heaven”; pradhí (“wheel segment”) 138.6 and paridhí (“encirclement”) 139.4; ahī́ “fertile cow”  138.1, 139.6; daṃsáya / dáṃsas 138.1, 2 “wondrous skill” and dákṣa 139.6 “skill,  capability”—as well as ring composition:  138 begins with two verses about the  opening of the Vala cave and the release of the fertile cows, and the final verse of  139 (vs. 6) returns to exactly this theme.
More subtle is their shared thematic concern. As noted in the introduction to  138, that hymn seems to treat disturbances to the orderly progress of cosmic time  and the heavenly bodies that measure it, the sun, the moon, and dawn. By contrast  X.139 focuses on the sun, in part through its (partial) representations: Savitar (vss.  1, 3) and the heavenly Gandharva (see also I.123, the Vena hymn, where Vena and  the Gandharva represent an amalgam of the sun and Soma). The hymn also depicts  the sun as holding its proper place and performing its proper functions. Though in  this hymn (vs. 2) as in the last one (vs. 3) the sun stands still in the middle of heaven,  in 138 this stoppage seemed ominous, whereas in this hymn the sun’s position seems  designed to give him the best view of the whole phenomenal world. It is repeatedly  emphasized (vss. 1d, 2a, c, 3b) that he (or his representatives) sees everything, and  as heavenly Gandharva he measures the airy realm (5b), again displaying proper  cosmic progress.
It must be admitted, however, that many things remain unclear in this hymn,  particularly verse 4.
1. With the rays of the sun, with golden hair, Savitar has raised up the  unaging light from the east.
At his instigation Pūṣan travels—the knowing cowherd surveying all  beings.
2. With his eye on men, he sits in the middle of heaven, having filled both  world-halves and the space between.
He watches over (his mares? the ladles?) facing toward ghee, facing in all  directions, between the eastern and the western beacon.
3. The foundation of wealth, the assembler of goods, he watches over all  forms with his powers.
Like god Savitar’s, his ordinances hold true; like Indra, he stands at the  confluence of spoils.
4. O Soma, the waters, having seen Viśvāvasu the Gandharva, then went  apart by their truth.
Indra, hastening, went down following that (truth?) of theirs. He looked  around the encirclements of the sun.
5. Let Viśvāvasu sing it [=truth] to us—the heavenly Gandharva, the  measurer of the airy realm—
whether we know it to hold true or not. Spurring on insights, he should  help just our insights.
1626 X.140
6. He found the winner in the current of the rivers. He opened the doors for  those with a rock as their pen.
The Gandharva proclaimed their immortal (names). Indra came to know  all about the capability of the fertile cows.

Metrically varied but unremarkable in contents, this hymn recycles and enchains its  vocabulary and phraseology while staying close to its core message: the ritual fire is  lovely and brilliant, and it brings—or should bring—precious prizes to the humans  who tend it.
1. O Agni, yours are fame and vitality; your beams flash greatly, o you with  radiant goods.
You of lofty radiance, with your power you establish a praiseworthy
prize for the pious, o sage poet.
2. Of pure luster, of gleaming luster, of unfailing luster, you rise up with  your radiance.
As a son wandering between your two mothers, you approach (them)  helpfully. You fill both world-halves.
3. O Child of Nourishment, Jātavedas, delight yourself with good lauds,  when you are roused by hymnic visions.
In you have those of brilliant help assembled precious-born refreshments  of manifold forms.
4. O Agni, exerting control, have yourself extended by the (human)
kinsmen. In us (be) riches, o immortal one.
You rule over a wonder lovely to see. You (ful)fill your resolve that
brings gain.
5. (You,) the preparer of refreshment for the ceremony, forethoughtful,  holding sway over great benefit, (have they set in front)—
you establish the well-portioned gift of a precious thing: great
refreshment and wealth that brings gain.
6. (You) the truthful one, the buffalo lovely for all to see: Agni have the  peoples set in front for benevolence—
you with listening ears, of greatest extent, the divine one have the human  generations (set in front) with a hymn.

## 141 (967) All Gods
Agni Tāpasa
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This simple hymn continues the message of the immediately preceding one, but  with far less subtlety. The poet calls upon Agni (vss. 1, 3, 6, and implicitly 5) and  an array of other gods, particularly Br̥haspati (vss. 2–5), to ensure that he and his  fellow officiants are well rewarded for their ritual service. The focus on Agni and  Br̥haspati clearly reflects the ritual orientation of the hymn, with Agni representing  the physical activity of sacrifice and Br̥haspati the verbal portion.
1. O Agni, address us here; facing us, become well-disposed to us.
Provide for us, Lord of the Clan. You are a prize-giver to us.
2. Let Aryaman provide for us, let Bhaga, let Br̥haspati,
let the gods and let Liberality. Let the goddess give riches to us.
3. On King Soma for help, on Agni we call with hymns,
on the Ādityas, on Viṣṇu, on Sūrya, and on Br̥haspati the formulator. 4. On Indra and Vāyu, easy to call, on Br̥haspati we call here,
so that every person will be well-disposed to us on meeting.
5. Spur on Aryaman, Br̥haspati, and Indra to give—
Wind, Viṣṇu, Sarasvatī, and Savitar the prizewinner.
6. You, Agni, with your fires, strengthen our sacred formulation and the  sacrifice.
You, spur on the divine assemblage to give wealth to us.
## 142 (968) Agni
The four Śārṅgas: Jaritar 1–2, Droṇa 3–4, Sārisrkva 5–6, Stambamitra 7–8 ̥ 8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2, anuṣṭubh 7–8
Though short, this hymn displays both a well-articulated structure and intricate pat terns of repetition and phonological echoes. The first six verses, in trimeter meter,  have an outer ring (vss. 1, 6) and an inner, thematically contrasting core. Verse 1  praises the protective, ritual fire, and verse 6 returns to this prize-giving fire and  the divine attendance upon it. In between, verses 2–5 describe fire as an ever-more dangerous substance. Though in verse 2 the danger is confined and contrasted with  the poets’ successful productions, the following verses give free rein to the destruc
tive power of wildfire with vivid descriptions of its progress through the land. The final two verses, in a different meter, append a magical charm, to banish  dangerous fire from the land and make that land the abode of water and plants. The Anukramaṇī identifies “the four Śārṅgas” as the poets of the hymn. This is  an allusion to an episode in the Mahābhārata (Śārṅgopākhyānam, MBh I.220–25),
1628 X.143
in which four birds, sons of an ascetic, are spared by Agni during the otherwise  complete burning of the Khāṇḍava Forest. This tale almost certainly postdates the  composition of our hymn.
1. O Agni, this singer here has come to abide in you, for there exists no  other friendship, o Son of Strength—
for auspicious is your shelter, providing threefold defense. Put away in  the distance the injurious missile.
2. Your birth, Agni, is a headlong plunge as you seek nourishment. You  seem to bear down on all creatures at once.
Our teams, our insightful thoughts shall gain the lead. They proceed in  front like cowherds, by themselves.
3. And truly you bend around, snapping at the abundant brush, o Agni of  independent power.
And there come to be waste-places in the fields. Let us not antagonize  your missile, your power.
4. When you travel to the heights and the depths, snapping, you go in all  directions, like an army in greedy pursuit.
When the wind fans your flame, like a barber a beard you shave the
ground.
5. His ranks have appeared opposite—many chariots (along) a single  downward course—
when, o Agni, continually stroking your two arms, you go, bending
downward, along the upstretching earth.
6. Let your blasts rear up, let your beam; let your prizes, Agni, for the one  who labors for you.
Arch up, bow down, as you grow. Let all the Vasus attend upon
you today.
7. Here is the descending course of the waters, here the settling down of  the sea.
Make yourself another path from this one here. Proceed along it at will. 8. On your course hither and your course away let flowering dūrvā
grass grow,
and ponds and lotus blossoms. Here is the house of the sea.
## 143 (969) Aśvins
Atri Sāṃkhya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
The poet of this hymn is presumably one of the younger Atrids, not the Atri who  is the eponymous poet of the Vth Maṇḍala, and the whole hymn is devoted to requests for help from the Aśvins for him and his fellows. In the first two verses he  asks that the Aśvins aid him as they did others in past times. The third verse offers  recompense for their aid: if they help him to produce insightful poems, these poems  will be for them alone. Verses 4 and 6 expand the targets of the aid from Atri alone  to his ritual companions, while verse 5 offers the mythological example of Bhujyu,  often mentioned elsewhere as a client whose life the Aśvins saved, as a model for  what we ourselves hope for.
1. (Make) also this Atri, grown old in the truth, (new again), to drive like a  horse to his goal,
when you two make Kakṣīvant new again, like a chariot.
2. (Unloose) also this one, like a prizewinning horse, to which the dustless  (paths) have stretched themselves;
unloose the youngest Atri, like a tight knot, (to stretch) across the
airy realm.
3. You two most wondrous, resplendent men, seek to win insights  for Atri,
for then, o men of heaven, your praise song will never again (need) to be  carved up [=shared with other gods].
4. O very bountiful Aśvins, your generosity and benevolence are to be  noted in this:
that you will bring us safely across to the broad seat and the (festive)  assembly (of the sacrifice), o men.
5. Bhujyu, pitched and tossed in the sea at the far end of the airy realm— you drove to him with your winged ones. O Nāsatyas, make (our
insight?) to win.
6. O most munificent ones possessing all property, (attend upon us) with  your favors, like (parents) wishing (our) welfare;
attend to refreshments for us that swell like a spring, o men.
## 144 (970) Indra
Suparṇa Tārkṣyaputra or Ūrdhvakrś̥ ana Yāmāyana
6 verses: gāyatrī 1, 3–4, brhat ̥ ī 2, satobrhat ̥ ī 5, viṣṭārapaṅkti 6
Although the Anukramaṇī names Indra as the divinity of this hymn, it is dominated  by Soma. Indra appears only in the first and last (6) verses as the recipient of the  soma drink, represented ring-compositionally by the “drop” (índu) in both verses.  His return to the hymn is anticipated by the minimal te “for you” in the penultimate  verse 5. In between the poet first describes Soma’s talents (vss. 1–2), and then nar
rates (or alludes to the narrative of) the famous theft of Soma by the falcon. This  account is highly poeticized, with vocabulary deployed in obscure metaphors. In  our view both 3a and 4c refer, in very different ways, to the fortresses in which Soma
1630 X.145
was confined (see IV.27.1 and IV.26.3 for the hundred fortresses, also keeping in  mind that “fortress” [púr] is grammatically feminine). Since Soma is being guarded  in heaven, when he looks down (vs. 3c) in search of his falcon rescuer he sees clouds,  again metaphorically represented.
The vivifying effects of Soma are treated in verses 5–6, as is his role in reinforc ing the relationship (bandhútā “family tie,” 5d) between gods and men, by means of  the sacrificial offering. Verse 6b may contain the first occurrences of the later notion  of sacrifice as “surrender” (tyāgá, found here in a different nominal derivative of  the same root, tyájas). Indra takes the oblation surrendered by men and places it  among the gods.
1. Because this deathless drop here, like a courser, displays his mastery as lifelong skill for you, the ritual adept,
2. He is a craftsman in poetic art among us and a mace for the one
generous with gifts.
Like a craftsman, he brings the exhilarating drink with pearls [=bubbles]  on top—the exhilarating drink that gets results.
3. Eager for the energetic falcon, the bull among his own females
[=fortresses?]
looked down at those puffing up like snakes [/swelling like fertile cows]  [=clouds?] —
4. He whom the fine-feathered (bird), the son of the falcon, brought  here from afar— him who had a hundred wheels [=concentric
fortresses?]—who is the track of the fertile cow—
5. Whom the falcon brought here for you with his foot, the cherished  one who keeps the wolf away, who is the ruddy housing of
the stalk—
by him is vitality, is lifetime lengthened for living; through him does our  family tie stay vigilant.
6. Thus, by the drop Indra will secure that great surrender (of the offering)  also among the gods.
By your will is vitality, is lifetime lengthened, o you of strong will; by  your will has this soma here been pressed from us.
## 145 (971) Against Cowives
Indrāṇī
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6
Attributed to Indra’s wife, Indrāṇī, this hymn is spoken in the 1st person by a  woman conjuring against her cowife for the affections of their joint husband. In  Atharvan style (and with an Atharvaveda correspondent, AVŚ III.18), it combines  ritual/magic action with a verbal spell. The speaker digs the efficacious plant (vss. 1–2) and applies the plant to her husband (vs. 6), while confidently proclaiming  her victory over her rival (esp. vss. 3–5). A similar hymn against cowives is found  at X.159.
1. This plant do I dig, most powerful shoot,
with which (a woman) repels her cowife, with which (she) acquires her  own husband completely.
2. You with outstretched leaves, luck-bringing, god-sped, possessing  victorious might—
blow away my cowife, make my husband my own.
3. Higher am I, o higher one, higher even than the higher ones.
But she who is my cowife, she is lower than the lower ones.
4. I do not take [=mention] her name, nor does she rest by this person  [=husband].
To the farthest farness we (all) make my cowife go.
5. I am gaining victory, and you [=plant] are victorious.
Both having become victoriously mighty, we two shall be victorious over  my cowife.
6. On you [=husband] have I laid the (plant) that wins victory; I have  harnessed you with an even more victorious one.
Let your mind run forth after me, like a cow after a calf, like water along  its path.
## 146 (972) Lady of the Wilderness (Araṇyānı)̄
Devamuni Airammada
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This lovely and evocative hymn has been much translated. It is dedicated to the  spirit of the araṇya, the wild place, and the contrast between the wild place and  the settled one, an opposition that runs throughout Indian literature, dominates  the hymn. Despite the ostensible dedication, the poet tries as much as possible  to evade the wilderness and conjure up the safety of the village. From the start,  in the first verse he expresses surprise that the Lady of the Wilderness herself  doesn’t inquire for a village or settlement (grā́mam); he is surprised that she is  not afraid of her own domain. The strange sounds that accompany the Lady in  her progress and the strange (and unidentified) animals that make those sounds  in verse 2 clearly unsettle the poet, and in verses 3 and 4 the poet, seeming him self to be in the wilderness at nightfall, attempts to transform the threatening  sights and sounds of the wild into reassuring domestic scenes—cows grazing  and lowing, woodsmen, the creak of a cart—though this cheerful self-deception  does not last. The poet abruptly breaks off the sequence with “(something) has  shrieked!” The final two verses of this short hymn contain a formal praise of
1632 X.147
Araṇyānī, but even this begins with the negative, and slightly nervous, reassur ance that she doesn’t kill unless she’s attacked; the positive portions of the praise  come second.
1. O Lady of the Wilderness, Lady of the Wilderness, you there, who seem  to be lost just ahead.
How is that you don’t ask for the village? Does fear not find you at all? 2. When the ciccika (bird?/bug?) helps out the bull-roarer [=frog? bird?] as it  speaks,
the Lady of the Wilderness displays her greatness like (a king?) who
hurtles along amid the clash of cymbals.
3. And it’s as if cows are eating and as if a settlement is seen,
and the Lady of the Wilderness at evening—it’s as if there’s a cart
creaking.
4. Surely it’s someone calling his cow; surely another has been
splitting wood.
But staying by the Lady of the Wilderness at evening, one imagines
“(Something) has shrieked!”
5. In truth, the Lady of the Wilderness does no slaughter, if someone else  does not attack.
Having eaten sweet fruit, one settles down at pleasure.
6. Fragrant with ointments, sweet-smelling, providing much food though  she does no plowing,
the Mother of wild beasts, the Lady of the Wilderness have
I proclaimed.
## 147 (973) Indra
Suvedas Śairīṣi
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5
The poet begins his hymn (vs. 1, 2ab) by proclaiming his trust in Indra’s “battle  fury” (manyú), on the basis of the god’s deeds and his dominance over the cosmic  spaces. It turns out that the poet has something more than simply praise on his  mind. Indra and his battle fury are much in demand among men in search of vic
tory and its spoils (vs. 2cd), and the poet recommends his patrons to Indra’s atten tion and care (vs. 3). He realizes, however, that securing Indra’s help requires proper  ritual observance (vs. 4). The hymn ends (vs. 5) with explicit requests for Indra’s aid  and bounty, such desires having been only indirectly expressed earlier in the hymn.
1. I put my trust in your foremost battle-fury, in that you smashed Vr̥tra  and labored at the manly work,
in that both world-halves yield to you and even earth trembles from your  tempest, o possessor of the stone. 2. You, faultless one, with your wiles shook wily Vr̥tra to pieces, with your  fame-seeking mind.
Just you do superior men choose in their quests for cattle, you when all  sacrifices are to be offered.
3. Take pleasure in these patrons, o much-invoked one, the strengtheners  who have attained to your bounty, bounteous one.
They chant to (you) the prizewinner when kith and kin (are at issue), in  (hostile) encirclements, at the winning of wisdom, when immoderate  stakes (are set).
4. Just that man will find pleasure in wealth that is easy to bear away who  will realize that the exhilaration of this one [=Indra] is to be hastened. With you as his strengthener, bounteous one, one who performs pious  ceremonies quickly bears away the prize, the stakes, along with
his men.
5. You—being sung, make wide (space) for the troop with your greatness,  bounteous one; show mastery over wealth.
You are an ally [/Mitra] to us, wily like Varuṇa. You distribute (wealth)  like an apportioner of food, wondrous one.
## 148 (974) Indra
Prthu Vainya ̥
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn offers some tricky bits of syntax and phraseology in what is otherwise  a standard praise of Indra and request for his aid. The poet seems especially  aware that Indra bestows his aid on those whom he likes (see esp. vss. 1c, 3b,  4c) and so emphasizes men’s need to offer abundant praise and oblations with a  cheerful spirit.
1. After having pressed soma we praise you, Indra, and also after having  won the prize, you powerfully manly one.
Bring us well-being (for him) in whom you take pleasure. Through
ourselves and our lineage may we win, aided by you.
2. Lofty were you when you were just born, o champion Indra. Along with  the sun, you should overcome the Dāsa clans,
(as you did) the one placed in hiding, fit to be hidden, hidden in the
waters [=Vr̥tra]. We offer soma as if in a gushing (stream).
3. Or, (Indra,) chant in response to the hymns of the stranger—as the wise  one, inspired poet among the seers, taking pleasure in good thinking. May we be the ones who find enjoyment by means of the soma drinks— through this and through the portions for you, who are conveyed on a  chariot.1634 X.149
4. These sacred formulations here have been recited to you, Indra. Give the  might of men to men, o champion.
Be of the same resolve with those in whom you take pleasure. And
protect the singers and their people.
5. Hear the call from Pr̥thī, o champion Indra, and you will be praised by  the chants of Venya,
who has roared toward your ghee-filled womb. Like a wave along the  depths, (his chants) run (there) billowing.
## 149 (975) Savitar
Arcat Hairaṇyastūpa
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet of this hymn is identified by the Anukramaṇī as a descendant of  Hiraṇyastūpa, and in the last verse (6) the poet compares his own invocation of  Savitar with that of Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, who, in fact, appears in the Anukramaṇī as the author of I.31–35 and IX.4 and 6—with I.35 also a hymn to Savitar. Thus this  hymn may be making a cross reference to another hymn in the samḥitā. Although  there are no blatant links between the two hymns, both are concerned with the  divisions of the cosmos and Savitar’s relationship to them. In this hymn especially  Savitar’s cosmogonic role is highlighted.
1. Savitar brought the earth to rest with his fastening straps; in the place  with no prop Savitar made heaven fast.
Savitar has milked the boisterous midspace like a stallion, (has milked  out) the sea bound within the unfathomable (realm).
2. Where the propped-up sea flooded forth—Savitar knows that, o Child of  the Waters—
from there was the world, from there was the airy realm arisen; from  there heaven and earth spread out.
3. After this (world) here there came into being the other one [=heaven],  deserving the sacrifice, with its fill of immortal creation.
Certainly the fine-feathered Garutmant(-bird) of Savitar [=sun] was
born earlier, and it (was born) in accordance with his support.
4. Like cows to the village, like a warrior to his horses, like a bellowing,  benevolent milker to her calf,
like a husband to his wife—let him come down to us, the supporter of  heaven, Savitar bringing all desirable things.
5. Just as Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa called on you, Savitar, when this prize  (was in question),
even so, chanting to you for help, extolling you, I stay wakeful facing  toward you, as if toward the plant of soma. X.150 (976) Agni
Mrḍ̥ īka Vāsiṣṭha
5 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1–3, upariṣṭājjyotis or jagatī 4, upariṣṭājjyotis 5
A simple hymn with a rigid skeletal structure, despite the variety of meters. The last  pāda of every verse begins with a form of mr̥ḍīká “grace, mercy,” in all but verse  4 the dative mr̥ḍīkā́ya. (This repetition is clearly responsible for the Anukramaṇī’s  ascription to a poet with the given name Mr̥ḍīka.) The object of the poet’s address  throughout is the god Agni; for the first half of the hymn (through vs. 3ab) he is  unnamed though easily identifiable from his attributes; from then on a form of  his name opens every hemistich. The contents of the hymn are quite straightfor
ward: Agni is urged to come to our sacrifice, bringing the gods along. In the final  verse (5) his aid to various legendary humans is recalled, and the poet names him self as Vasiṣṭha (or “best one”)—again, no doubt responsible for the Anukramaṇī’s  patronymic Vāsiṣṭha, although the distinctive clan refrain of the Vasiṣṭhas is not  present.
The final two verses also contain the epithet puróhita, literally “set in front,”  applied first to Agni (4a) and then to the poet Vasiṣṭha (5cd). Ritually speaking  the sacrificial fire is indeed “set in front”:  the offering fire is established on the  eastern edge of the ritual ground. However, there is no clear ritual reason to refer  to the poet as “set in front,” and it seems likely that in this late hymn the term has  already become the designation of a particular type of priest, in later times the  king’s “house-priest.”
1. Even when you have been kindled, you are kindled (again), o
oblation-bearer for the gods.
With the Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, come to us here. For grace
come to us here.
2. This sacrifice here—having delighted in this speech, come near to it. We mortals call you, kindled one; for grace we call.
3. You, Jātavedas, granting all wishes, do I hymn with my insightful  thought.
O Agni, bring here to us the gods whose commandments are dear, for  grace (bring) those whose commandments are dear.
4. Agni, the god, became the one set in front [/Purohita] of the gods; Agni  have the human seers kindled.
Agni do I invoke greatly at the winning of the stakes; (I invoke) his grace  for the winning of the stakes.
5. Agni helped Atri, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, helped Kaṇva and Trasadasyu  for us at the challenge.
Agni does Vasiṣṭha, set in front [/Purohita], call; for grace does the one  set in front [/Purohita] (call).

## 151 (977) Śraddhā
Śraddhā Kāmāyanī
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
The word śraddhā́, often translated “faith,” has a long and culturally freighted his tory in Indic religion. In its Vedic origins it refers not to “faith,” at least in the  Western, Christian sense (cf. its Latin cognate credō), but rather to “trust”—espe cially in the efficacy of cultural institutions, and there especially in hospitality and  the sacrifice, itself a specialized type of hospitality. (For further discussion see  Jamison [1996a: 176–84].)
In this hymn its close ties to the sacrifice are quite clear. Note especially the  last verse (5), which makes not-so-veiled reference to the three soma-pressings; the  appearance of Vāyu in the previous verse probably refers to the fact that he receives  the first soma offering at the Morning Pressing. One of the important facets of  trust in the sacrifice is the certainty that a properly performed sacrifice will produce  material rewards for the performer, and this belief is reflected throughout the hymn;  see especially verses 2–4.
1. With trust is the fire kindled; with trust is the oblation poured.
We at the head of good fortune make known our trust with speech.
2. O Trust, this (speech) spoken by me: make it dear to him who gives, dear  to him who intends to give,
and dear among the benefactors who offer sacrifice, o Trust.
3. Just the gods created trust in themselves among the powerful lords, so among the benefactors who offer sacrifice make what has been spoken  by us trust(ed).
4. Trust do the gods revere, sacrificing for themselves with Vāyu as their  herdsman—
trust, with a purpose that comes from their heart. By trust one gains  possession of goods.
5. Trust do we call early in the morning, trust at midday,
trust at the setting of the sun. O Trust, place a trusting heart
here in us.
## 152 (978) Indra
Śāsa Bhāradvāja
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
The martial Indra, the “commander,” is called upon here to destroy our various  enemies. A  surprising amount of attention is given to “the scornful” (vss. 2–4).  Although verbal abuse may not seem to modern mentalities to pose the same sort of threat as more physical assaults, the ancient Indian belief in the power of speech  to inflict real harm is on view here. At issue may also be ritualized exchanges of  insults before battle.
1. As commander, you are great in just this way: as the infallible devourer  of foes,
whose comrade is not slain nor is he ever conquered.
2. As the lord of the clan who gives well-being, the Vr̥tra-smasher,
(smasher) of the scornful, exerting his will—
let the bull Indra go before us, the soma-drinker, the creator of
fearlessness.
3. Smash away the demon, away the scornful; break apart the jaws of Vr̥tra. O Indra, Vr̥tra-smasher, (smash) away the battle fury of the foe who  assails us.
4. Smash away the scornful for us, Indra. Hold down those who battle us. Who assails us, make him go to lower darkness.
5. Away with the thought of him who hates (us), Indra; away with the  deadly weapon of the one who seeks to despoil (us).
Extend shelter (to us) from battle fury. Keep the deadly weapon a wide  way away.
## 153 (979) Indra
Devajāmaya Indramātaraḥ
5 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn presents a tender image of unidentified females rocking  the baby Indra, and verse 2 continues with a more conventional treatment of his  birth. But the birth motif disappears (except for an attenuated version in vs. 5c): the  hymn then continues with standard praise of his powers—the word ójas “might” is  positioned prominently in four of the five verses (2–5).
1. Rocking (him), the busy women attend upon the new-born Indra,
receiving (him) as their share of the abundance of heroes.
2. You, Indra, were born from power, from strength, from might.
You, bull, are really a bull.
3. You, Indra, are the smasher of Vr̥tra. You spread out the midspace. You propped up heaven with your might.
4. You, Indra, carry in your arms the chant for joint enjoyment,
while sharpening your mace with your might.
5. You, Indra, dominate all created things by your might.
You came into being throughout all the worlds.

## 154 (980) To a Dead Man
Yamī
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn has a parallel in the Atharvaveda (XVIIII.2.14–18), where it is found  among the funeral verses, and in the ritual sūtras it is used at the burning of the  corpse. Each verse describes the character and habits of the distinguished fore fathers now resident in the other world, and ends with a refrain urging the dead  man to go and join them there.
1. Soma purifies himself for some; others reverently approach ghee.
Those for whom honey flows forth—right to them let him go now.
2. Those who were unassailable because of their fervor, who have gone to  the sun because of their fervor,
who have made their own fervor into greatness—right to them let him  go now.
3. Those who fight in prize-contests, who as champions abandon their  bodies,
or who confer a thousand priestly gifts—right to them let him go now. 4. Also those ancients who were servers of truth, truthful, strong
through truth,
the forefathers full of fervor, o Yama—right to them let him go now.
5. The poets of a thousand devices who protect the sun,
the seers full of fervor, o Yama—to those born of fervor let him go now.
## 155 (981) Spell to Remove Misfortune (1, 4), Brahmaṇaspati  (2–3), All Gods (5) [Against a Witch]
Śirimbiṭha Bhāradvāja
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
A type of female demon known as the Sadān(u)vā is the target of this Atharvan type hymn; the Sadānvā is found only here in the R̥gveda, but is well represented  in the Atharvaveda (AVŚ II.14, AVP II.4, V.1 and 9, VI.8.1, etc.; see further dis cussion and references in Zehnder 1999, Lubotsky 2002, Griffiths 2009 ad locc.).  The Sadānvās are monumentally ugly (vs. 1) and seem to pose a threat especially  to unborn children (vs. 2) and, in the Atharvaveda passages, to the household and  livestock in general. In this hymn they are also sexually menacing and sexually  repulsive (vs. 4).
In the first three verses the Sadānvā is attacked and sent away in good Atharvan  fashion, but the hymn takes another rhetorical turn starting in verse 4, which  announces the defeat of Indra’s rivals in the high style of a victory paean, to the apparent accompaniment of the Sadānvās beating their breasts in stylized mourn ing. And in verse 5 the defeat of the hostile forces has been effected not by an  Atharvan-like charm, as in the earlier parts of the hymn, but by ritual activity on the  sacrificial ground and by the creation of “fame” among the gods—both features that  are associated with the more solemn R̥gvedic priestly and martial ethic. This shift in  diction and attitude is striking, and it may have been felt necessary (or at least desir able) to “R̥gvedify” the charm when it was incorporated into the R̥gveda collection.
1. You one-eyed, deformed demoness, go to the mountain—you Sadānvā. With the warriors of Śirimbiṭha, with them we banish you.
2. She is banished from here, banished from yonder, having assailed all  fetuses.
Go at the demoness, o sharp-horned Brahmaṇaspati, and gore her.
3. That piece of wood over there that floats to the farther shore of the river  with no man at the helm,
grab hold of that, you with your evil jaws: with it go in the farther
distance.
4. When you women with rusty “boxes” [=genitals], leaning forward, *beat  your breast,
slain were all the rivals of Indra—with their ejaculations [“spurts”]
(dissipated like) bubbles.
5. These (men) here have led the cow around; they have taken the fire  around.
They have made themselves fame among the gods. Who will venture  against them?
## 156 (982) Agni
Ketu Āgneya
5 verses: gāyatrī
The ritual setting for this hymn is given in verses 4–5: the kindling of fire at sunrise.  The first three verses express the hope that this kindling of the fire will bring goods  to the ritual participants, an oblique reference to the distribution of the priestly  gifts at the Morning Pressing. This blatant desire for reward is somewhat camou
flaged by couching it in terms of contests (vs. 1), cattle raids (vs. 2), and chariot  racing (vs. 3).
1. Let our thoughts spur Agni on, like a swift span in the contests;
with him might we win prize after prize.
2. The weapon with which we will make the cows our own by your help,  o Agni,
spur that on—to give us bounties.
1640 X.157–158
3. Agni, bring here brawny wealth, broad and rich in cows and horses. Lubricate the wheel-nave, make the niggard roll.
4. Agni, you make the unaging heavenly body, the sun, mount in heaven, as you establish light for the peoples.
5. Agni, you are the beacon of the clans, dearest, fairest lap-child.
Awaken, as you establish vitality for your praiser.
## 157 (983) All Gods
Bhuvana Āptya or Sādhana Bhauvana
5 verses: dvipadā triṣṭubh
Short and simple, this hymn calls for help and cooperation from Indra and a variety  of gods in the first three verses. The last two verses are notable for what is probably  the only reflection in the R̥gveda of that corporate entity, the Asuras, and of the  eternal hostility between them and the Devas (“gods”), ubiquitous in middle Vedic  and providing a major mythological cycle in those texts. Elsewhere in the R̥gveda  the word ásura generally means “lord” and is applied to gods as well as to humans,  viewed positively or negatively. It is only in this very late hymn that we see the germ  of the later division of divine beings into the two inimical moieties of Devas and  Asuras. For further on this question, which has important implications for Indo Iranian as well as Vedic religion, see Wash Edward Hale (1986) as well as the discus
sion in our introduction and passim.
1. These living worlds here let us bring to success—we and Indra and all  the gods.
2. Our sacrifice and our own body and our offspring may Indra, along with  the Ādityas, set in order.
3. Along with the Ādityas, let Indra, flocking with the Maruts, be the helper  of our bodies.
4. The gods upon having smashed the Asuras when they came—the gods  guarding their own godhood—
5. Led the ray [=sun] to face toward (us) with their skills. Just after that  they surveyed their vigorous self-power.
## 158 (984) Sūrya
Cakṣus Saurya
5 verses: gāyatrī
The sun as the eye in heaven, which enables us to see ourselves and the world, is  the theme of this hymn, especially of the last three verses (3–5). The first verse is a request for universal protection in all parts of the cosmos; the ablative (“from”)  phrases are ambiguous: they may refer to hostile forces located in the various parts  of the cosmos, or to the locations from which the protectors are exercising their  function. The second verse to Savitar continues the protection theme, but otherwise  ill fits the hymn and may be here because of Savitar’s role in verse 3.
The given name assigned to the poet by the Anukramaṇī, Cakṣus, is simply  adopted from the common noun cákṣus “eye” found repeatedly in verses 3–4; his  patronymic means “Son of Sūrya.”
1. Let the Sun protect us from heaven, the Wind from the midspace;
let Agni (protect) us from the earthly ones.
2. I shall find pleasure in you, o Savitar, whose flaring is worth a hundred  impulsions [/soma-pressings].
Protect us from the heavenly missile as it flies.
3. The eye [=sun] (let) god Savitar (place) for us, and the eye (let) the  Mountain;
the eye let the Placer place for us.
4. Place the eye for our eyeing, the eye for us to see for ourselves.
May we look at this (world) both whole and distinct.
5. May we look toward you, wholly good to see, o Sun.
May we, (though) we have the eyes of men [/(because) we possess the  “eye of men” (=sun)], see distinctly.
## 159 (985) Against Cowives
Śacī Paulomī
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
Like X.145 this hymn is in the voice of a woman, speaking in the 1st person, against  her cowives. But, whereas in X.145 she was in the act of performing the spell with  which she hoped to vanquish her cowife, in this hymn her triumph is complete. She  recites a victory paean, in the appropriate high rhetorical style—albeit with some  dips into the vernacular, such as the diminutivized derivative of the personal pro
noun in verse 1, māmaká “li’l ole me.” It is worth noting that in verse 3 she extends  her triumph to her sons and her daughter; as the early parts of the Rāmāyaṇa teach  us, one of the most important reasons that cowives plot against each other is to  secure preferment for their children.
1. Up has gone yonder sun; up this good fortune of li’l ole me.
I, a cunning woman, now have gained victory over my husband, (so that  I am) victorious.
2. I am the beacon; I am the head; I am the powerful debater.
Only my will should my husband follow, when I am victorious.
1642 X.160
3. My sons are rival-smiters, and my daughter is a wide ruler.
And I am a complete conqueror. To my husband my signal-call is the  highest.
4. The oblation through which Indra, when he performed it, became the  highest brilliant one,
that (oblation) I have now performed, o gods: I have therefore become  without cowives.
5. Without cowives, smiting cowives, conquering, overcoming—
I have ripped off the luster of the other women, like the gifts of the
feckless.
6. I have completely conquered them, overcoming the cowives,
so that I will rule widely over this hero and over his people.
## 160 (986) Indra
Purāṇa Vāiśvāmitra
5 verses: triṣṭubh
A straightforward invitation to soma-drinking, also expressing the usual fear that  Indra will attend another sacrifice (vs. 1) and the usual smug awareness that a non presser will be punished (vs. 4). According to the Anukramaṇī, the poet is a descen dant of the Viśvāmitras, and the last two words of the hymn, śunáṃ huvema “for  blessing we would invoke” are the first two words of the Viśvāmitra clan refrain,  found in most of the Viśvāmitra triṣṭubh Indra hymns (III.30.22, etc.).
1. Drink of this sharp vitalizing (soma). Here unhitch your two fallow bays,  chariot and all.
O Indra, let the other sacrificers not stop you: yours are these pressed  (soma drinks) here.
2. Yours are those (already) pressed and yours are those to be pressed. You  do the swelling hymns call hither.
O Indra, enjoying this pressing today, knowing everything, drink the  soma here.
3. The man who with willing mind, with his whole heart, with desire for the  gods, presses soma for him,
Indra does not give away his cows. He [=presser] makes (his soma)
acclaimed and dear to him [=Indra].
4. That one becomes spied out by him—the rich man who does not press  soma for him.
The bounteous one holds him out by the elbow [=at arm’s length?].
The one without precedent [=Indra] smites the haters of sacred
formulations.
## 161–162 1643
5. Seeking horses, seeking cows, seeking prizes, we call upon you to come  right up to us.
Attending to your new benevolence, we would invoke you for
blessing, Indra.
## 161 (987) Against Disease
Yakṣṃanāśana Prājāpatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 5
With Atharvaveda parallels (AVŚ III.11.1–4, VIII.1.20; AVP I.62), this charm  announces the restoration to life, indeed long life, of a man who has succumbed to  some disease or other (vs. 1).
1. I release you, with an oblation, to living, from the unknown disease, from  the kingly disease.
Or if a Grabber has truly grabbed him in this way, from her, o Indra and  Agni, release him.
2. If his lifetime is exhausted, or he is (already) departed, or if he has just  gone down to the face of death,
I bring him here from the lap of Dissolution. I have redeemed him for a  hundred autumns.
3. With an oblation with a thousand eyes, conferring a hundred autumns  and a hundred lifetimes, I have brought him here,
so that Indra will lead him through a hundred autumns to the far shore  of all difficult going.
4. Live in strength for a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a  hundred springs.
For a hundred (years) let Indra and Agni, Savitar, and Br̥haspati restore  him, with an oblation conferring a hundred lifetimes.
5. I have brought you here; I have found you. You have come here again, o  you who are new again.
O you with hale limbs, I have found your eye hale and your
lifetime whole.
## 162 (988) Against Miscarriage
Rakṣohan Brāhma
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This charm is meant to deflect the dangers of miscarriage or harm to the embryo  in any stage, including immediately after birth. The stages of pregnancy are nicely1644 X.163
laid out in verse 3, a good example of the indirect means by which we can gain  information about Vedic people’s knowledge and conceptualization of “real life.”  The methods by which the “ill-named affliction” might gain access to the fetus are  graphically depicted in verses 4–6. In verse 5 it is somewhat startling that masquer
ading as a brother (in addition to husband or lover) would give intimate access to  the pregnant woman; this whiff of incest is reminiscent of the situation between the  siblings Yama and Yamī in X.10.
1. In concert with a sacred formulation let Agni, demon-smasher, repel  from here
whatever evil-named affliction lies on your embryo, in your womb.
2. Whatever evil-named affliction lies on your embryo, in your womb, Agni, along with a sacred formulation, has banished the flesh-eater.
3. Who smites your (embryo) as it flies, when it is emplanted, as it squirms, who intends to smite your (embryo) when it is just born, that one we  banish from here.
4. Who pries apart your thighs, lies between the married couple,
who licks within your womb, that one we banish from here.
5. Who, having become brother, husband, lover, goes down on you,
who intends to smite your offspring, that one we banish from here.
6. Who, having stupefied you with sleep, with darkness, goes down on you, who intends to smite your offspring, that one we banish from here.
## 163 (989) Against Disease
Vivrhan K ̥ āśyapa
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
Like X.161, this is another charm against disease with Atharvan parallels (AVŚ II.33, AVP IV.7). This hymn provides us with what we might term a body-part  litany. The officiant declares the removal of disease from a series of related body  parts in each verse, each associated with a particular area of the body—another  valuable window on how Vedic peoples divided up and named reality. Although the  names of the more standard body parts (eyes, ears, etc.) are well known and have  well-established cognates, the identification of some of the more obscure terms is  uncertain, though the locational association narrows the range of possibilities.
1. From your eyes, your nostrils, your ears, your chin,
I tear the disease of the head out of you—from your brain, your
tongue.
2. From your neck(bones?), the (bones of the?) nape of your neck, your  vertebrae, your backbone,
I tear the disease of the torso out of you—from your shoulders, from  your arms. 3. From your entrails, your guts, your rectum, your heart,
I tear out the disease—from your kidneys, your liver, your intestines.
4. From your thighs, your knee-sockets, your heels, the front of your feet, I tear out the disease—from your hips, your backside, your buttocks. 5. From your urinator, your love-maker, your hair, your nails,
I tear this disease here out—from your whole body.
6. From every limb, from every hair, what is born in every joint,
I tear this disease here out—from your whole body.
## 164 (990) Against Nightmare
Pracetas Āṅgirasa
5 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, 2, 4, triṣṭubh 3, paṅkti 5
The Anukramaṇī labels this hymn duḥsvapnaghnam, literally “destroying bad  dreams,” while Geldner titles it “Absolution from Sins” and Renou simply  “Expiation.” None of these characterizations quite captures the varied semantic  field of this brief hymn. It begins with the curt dismissal of an otherwise unknown  “Lord of Thought” (or “Lord of Mind”), ordering him to go far away and speak  to the goddess Dissolution (Nirr̥ti), who presides over chaos and calamity. The  Lord of Thought is to provide her with some examples of men’s thoughts, in verse  2. These examples seem to be the sort of harmless self-delusions whereby people  reassure themselves that all is going well for them. But in verses 3 and 4 the verbal  behavior becomes less innocent—culminating in one of the worst offenses in Vedic  India (and indeed Indo-Iranian), deceit (vs. 4). We ask various gods, including  Indra “Lord of the Sacred Formulation” (voc. brahmaṇas pate), presumably Indra  in his role as Br̥haspati, to distance these offenses from us. The final verse celebrates  the success of this request and expresses our desire that all such offenses be visited  on our enemy.
The unifying theme of the hymn is thus all sorts of mental and verbal action,  whether harmless or hostile, whether done consciously (awake) or not (asleep), or  even both (the “waking dream” of vs. 5).
1. Go away, o Lord of Thought—stride away; move far away.
(When) far away, announce to Dissolution: “Of many kinds is the
thought of the living.
2. “Lucky is the choice they make; lucky the right (horse) they yoke; lucky the eye (they keep) on the son of Vivasvant [=Yama] (—or so they  think). In many places is the thought of the living.”
3. Whatever pass we’ve reached by hope, by blame, by curse, when awake or  sleeping.
let Agni put away, at a distance from us, all those things ill-done and  unpleasing.
1646 X.165
4. O Indra, lord of the sacred formulation, if we practice deceit,
let the attentive Āṅgiras protect us from the coercion of those who
hate us.
5. We have conquered today, and we have won: we have become without  offense.
The waking dream, the evil intent—let it land on him whom we hate, let  it land on him who hates us.
## 165 (991) All Gods (Bird of Ill Omen)
Kapota Nairrtḁ
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Though the Anukramaṇī identifies the dedicands as the All Gods, the hymn is  entirely devoted to countering the possible evil effects of a bird of ill-omen, the  dove of death, sent as a messenger from Yama, the lord of the dead. Not surpris ingly, given their style and contents, the verses of this hymn are found in variant  form in the Atharvaveda (AVŚ VI.27, 29.1, 28.1).
1. O gods, when the dove, sent as a messenger of Dissolution, has come  here to seek,
we will chant to it, and we will perform expulsion. Let there be weal for  our two-footed, weal for our four-footed.
2. Let the dove that has been sent be kindly to us; o gods, let the omen-bird  be without offense in our house.
Let Agni, the inspired poet, take pleasure in our oblation, and so let the  winged missile avoid us.
3. The winged missile will not take us by deception. In the corner [?] it sets  its footprint in the fireplace.
Let there be weal for our cattle and for our humans. Let the dove not  harm us here, o gods.
4. When the owl screeches, that comes to nothing; likewise when the dove  set its footprint in the fire.
The one for whom it was sent forth as messenger—to that one let there  be reverence: to Yama, (who is) Death.
5. With (this) verse give the dove a push. Rejoicing in refreshment, lead  your cow around,
effacing all difficulties. Having left for us our strengthening nourishment,  it will fly away the fastest in flight.
## 166–167 1647
## 166 (992) Against Rivals
R̥ṣabha Vairāja or R̥ṣabha Śākvara
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except mahāpaṅkti 5
The extremely aggressive 1st-person speaker of this hymn proclaims his triumph  over his rivals and their utter humiliation. Using the well-nigh universal tropes of  high and low, he repeatedly emphasizes the spatial (and thus conceptual) position  of his defeated enemies, who are literally beneath his feet (vss. 2, 5; see also vss. 3–4).  Verse 4 is notable for the trio of attributes that the speaker seizes from his rivals,  a set that easily accommodates a trifunctional (Dumézilian) analysis: “cognition”  as the higher mental power appropriate to the priestly First Function, “command
ment” representative of the warrior-ruler Second Function, and “company, assem bly” the Third Function mass of followers. Although we are not over-sympathetic  to the Dumézilian paradigm, this particular passage gains resonance from such an  analysis.
1. Make me bull over my equals, widely victorious over my rivals,
smiter of my rivals, wide-ruling cattle-lord of cattle.
2. I am a smiter of rivals, like Indra, unharmable, invulnerable.
Beneath my feet are my rivals: all these here have been stood upon.
3. Right here I bind you, like the two ends of a bow with a bowstring. O Lord of Speech, drive these down, so that they will speak lower
than me.
4. I have come here on top, with Viśvakarman as my foundation.
I take for myself your cognition, your commandment, and your
assembled company.
5. Having taken for myself your yoking up [=war] and your peace, might  I become the highest. I have trampled on your head.
From beneath my feet, lift up your speech to me, like frogs from the
water, like frogs from the water.

A fairly conventional invitation to the soma sacrifice. One of Indra’s great deeds,  the conquering of the sun, is alluded to (vss. 1–2), and already in verse 1 he is asked  for wealth. The final verse is spoken by Indra himself, who accepts both the soma  and the praise while recognizing that he is entitled to these offerings only if he  provides good things in return. One noteworthy feature is the poet-priest’s claim to  have himself consumed copious amounts of soma (vs. 4).
1648 X.168
1. This honey is poured around for you, Indra: you rule over the tub of  pressed soma.
Make for us wealth consisting of many heroes. Having heated up your  heat all around, you conquered the sun.
2. The conqueror of the sun who finds great exhilaration in the soma-stalk  do we call here to the pressings—the all-around able one.
Take notice of this sacrifice of ours here. Come here! We beseech the  bounteous one who conquers his opponents.
3. Under the ordinance of King Soma and King Varuṇa and under the  protection of Br̥haspati and Anumati,
today at our praise invocation of you, bounteous one, I consumed tubs  (of soma), you establisher and regulator.
4. [Indra:] Urged on, I have done my own consuming at the vat, and as the  foremost patron, I sweep up this praise song,
if at the pressing I have come back to you two, Viśvāmitra and
Jamadagni, in your house with the winnings.
## 168 (994) Vāyu
Anila Vātāyana
4 verses: triṣṭubh
As with X.186, the Anukramaṇī identifies the deity of the hymn as Vāyu, the god of  wind who has been integrated into the ritual system, as the first god, with Indra, to  receive the soma drink at the Morning Pressing. But again, as in X.186, the hymn  only mentions Vāta, a god of wind with more physical and natural characteristics of  wind than Vāyu and little or no ritual profile. Nonetheless, Vāta is given full-dress  eulogistic treatment in this little hymn: The first verse begins with his name, and  the opening, “now the greatness [acc.] of Wind... ” (vā́tasya nú mahimā́nam...),  recalls celebratory openings like I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi... “now the heroic deeds  of Indra ... ”). The final pāda (vs. 4d) is a standard formula of homage, with the  recipient in the dative (“to him, to Wind... ”) and an instrumental of the type of  offering (“with our oblation”), ending with the 1st plural optative vidhema “might  we do honor”); see numerous parallels, including VIII.48.12–13, I.121.1–9.
In between the swift progress of Wind, his chariot, and his retinue (which we  consider to be the eddies and gusts that are characteristic of any strong wind) is  nicely described.
1. Now (I shall proclaim) the greatness of Wind and of his
chariot: shattering as he goes; thundering is his sound.
Touching heaven as he drives, turning things red, and tossing up dust  from the earth as he goes. 2. The dispersed eddies of the Wind press forward together following (him).  They go to him, like girls to a festive gathering.
Yoked together with them on the same chariot, the god speeds on as  king of this whole world.
3. Speeding along the paths in the midspace, he does not settle down on any  single day.
Comrade of the waters, the first-born abiding by truth—where was he  born? from where has he arisen?
4. The breath of the gods, the embryo of the world, this god wanders as he  wishes.
Only his sounds are heard, not his form. To him, to the Wind, we would  do honor with our oblation.
## 169 (995) Cows
Śabara Kākṣīvata
4 verses: triṣṭubh
For the protection, thriving, and safe return of the cows, invoking a formidable  range of gods to ensure these goals. In later ritual the first two verses are spoken  when the cows go to pasture, the latter two when they return home.
1. Let the wind, joy itself, blow to the ruddy ones. Let them crop plants full  of nourishment.
Let them drink (waters) full of fat, providing riches to the living. Setting  them loose, Rudra, be merciful to our food on the hoof.
2. Those who are of the same color, of different colors, of one color, whose  names Agni knows because of the sacrifice,
whom the Aṅgirases brought here by their fervent heat—to those, o
Parjanya, extend great shelter.
3. Who raised their own body up among the gods (as oblation), of whom  Soma knows all the colors,
swelling with milk, rich in offspring, grant them to us in our stable, Indra. 4. Prajāpati, having given them to me, in concord with all the gods and the  forefathers,
has sent them here, being well-disposed, to our stable. Might we reside  together with their offspring.
1650 X.170–171
## 170 (996) Sūrya
Vibhrāj Saurya
4 verses: jagatī, except āstārapaṅkti 4
This hymn celebrates the god Sun, or more specifically his light, in terms more usu ally applied to heroic warrior-gods like Indra.
1. Let the lofty (light) blazing forth drink the somian honey, imparting an  unswerving lifetime on the lord of the sacrifice—
he who, sped by the wind, stands guard by himself, he fosters the
creatures; he rules [/shines] widely in many places.
2. The lofty (light) blazing forth, well supported, best winner of prizes, real,  is fitted into the foundation, the buttress of heaven.
Smasher of foes, smasher of obstacles, best smasher of Dasyus, the light  has been born, the smasher of lords, smasher of rivals.
3. Here is the fairest, the highest light of lights: the lofty one is called  all-conquering, wealth-conquering.
The all-blazing, greatly blazing Sun spreads his broad might, his
unshakeable strength to be seen.
4. Flashing forth with your light, as the Sun you went to the luminous  realm of heaven,
you by whom all these worlds are supported here, you who accomplish  all work, who possess all that is proper for gods.
## 171 (997) Indra
Iṭa Bhārgava
4 verses: gāyatrī
This brief hymn makes allusion to four unknown or little-known myths involving  Indra, one per verse. All four verses begin with t(u)vám “you,” and three of the four  (not vs. 2) contain a vocative addressed to Indra—repetitions that provide some  unity to a hymn made up of fragments.
1. You, Indra—you furthered this chariot of Iṭat the presser.
You heard the call of the one who has soma.
2. You pulled the head of the raging Battler off from his skin.
You went to the house of the one who has soma.
3. You, Indra—this mortal Venya
you made slack in an instant, for Āstrabudhna, who had it in mind.
4. You, Indra—set this sun in front, though it is behind,
even athwart the will of the gods.
## 172–173 1651
## 172 (998) Dawn
Saṃvarta Āṅgirasa
4 verses: dvipadā virāj
Although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as Dawn, only the  last verse (4) clearly belongs to her, and, at least in verse 2, the masculine adjectives  preclude Dawn as subject. Commentators have suggested other deities: Dawn (vs.  1), Sūrya (vs. 2), Agni (vs. 3), Dawn (vs. 4), or Sūrya (vss. 1–3). These particular  identifications cannot be confirmed, but it is clear that this is a hymn appropriate to  early morning. In verse 2 the subject awakens mortals. Though verse 1 is less clear,  the cows there are on the move after giving milk (in our interpretation):  as real  cows, they are going to pasture after the morning milking; as dawn cows they are  following the track of the sun out of the east and across the sky, having filled the  sky with their milky light. In the third verse the sacrifice is begun, as is appropriate  at dawn. And finally in verse 4 Dawn makes an explicit appearance upon her birth.
1. Drive here along with your longing. The cows follow your track, when  (they have given milk) with their udders.
2. Drive here with good insight, as the most bounteous one, along with those  of good gifts, as you awaken the bountiful while aging the combatants. 3. Like those bringing food, having good gifts we lay out the thread (of  sacrifice): let us perform sacrifice.
4. Dawn (rolls) out of the way the darkness of her sister (Night), rolls her  track up in a ball, because she has been well born (just now).
## 173 (999) Praise of the King (Royal Consecration)
Dhruva Āṅgirasa
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn has long been seen as part of a royal consecration (Rājasūya, a term first  found in the Atharvaveda), whatever that rite would have looked like in late R̥gvedic  times. The keyword of the hymn is dhruvá “firm”—firmness being the quality most  desired in the royal candidate—and in fact the Anukramaṇī has extracted this word  for the name of the poet. The affirmation of the chosen king by both the human clans  (viś, vss. 1, 6) and various gods is required. Among the gods we find Indra, the arche
typal warrior king (vss. 2, 5–6), and Varuṇa, the archetypal peacetime king (vs. 5). (For  these two aspects of kingship, divided between the two gods, see especially IV.42.) In  addition there are the ritually connected gods, who would officiate at the consecration  ceremony: Brahmaṇaspati (vs. 3)/Br̥haspati (vs. 5), who represent the verbal portion,  and Agni (vs. 5) and Soma (vs. 3), who participate in the physical portion. Soma, as  ritual substance, is found in verse 6, which effects the king’s installation. The hymn  has parallels in both recensions of the Atharvaveda, and elsewhere in Vedic literature.
1652 X.174–175
1. I have brought you here: be among (us). Stand firm, without wavering. Let all the clans want you. Let kingship not fall away from you.
2. Be only here; do not budge—unwavering like a mountain.
Like Indra, stand firm here; here uphold your kingship.
3. This one here has Indra upheld—firm with a firm oblation.
For him Soma will bear witness; for him Brahmaṇaspati.
4. Firm is heaven, firm the earth, firm these mountains here.
Firm all this animate world, firm right here this king of the clans.
5. Firm let King Varuṇa, firm let God Br̥haspati,
firm let both Indra and Agni uphold your kingship—firm!
6. We touch firm soma with a firm oblation.
And now Indra will make the clans bring tribute only to you.
## 174 (1000) Praise of the King
Abhīvarta Āṅgirasa
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
A companion piece to the preceding consecration hymn, but one that focuses only  on the combative and confrontational aspects of kingship. Here the signature idiom  is abhí-√vr̥t “roll over,” again providing the Anukramaṇī’s poet’s name. The king’s  ability to “roll over” and crush his opponents as Indra did, leaving him the only one  standing, is celebrated and ritually effected with an oblation named with the idiom  and associated with Indra (vss. 1, 4).
1. The Over-rolling oblation with which Indra rolled over (his enemies), with that, o Brahmaṇaspati, make us roll to kingship.
2. Having rolled over the rivals, over those who are hostile to us,
stand over the one who gives battle, over the one who is envious of us. 3. God Savitar has made you—Soma has made you roll over—
made you roll over all creatures, so that you will be an Over-roller.
4. The oblation through which Indra, when he performed it, became the  highest brilliant one,
that (oblation) I have now performed, o gods: I have therefore become  without rivals.
5. Without rivals, rival-smiting, (rolling) to kingship, widely victorious— so that I will rule widely over these creatures and over the people.
## 175 (1001) Pressing Stones
Ūrdhvagrāvan Āṅgirasa
4 verses: gāyatrī
This third hymn to the pressing stones (the others being X.76 and X.94) has none  of the rhetorical ambition or vividness of the other two. It begins and ends (vss. 1,
## 176–177 1653
4) with an appeal to the god Savitar, literally “the Impeller,” to provide the impul sion to set the stones to pressing.
1. Let god Savitar propel you forth according to his ordinance, o pressing  stones.
Yoke yourselves to the chariot-poles. Press!
2. O pressing stones, ward off misfortune, off ill-will.
Make the ruddy ones [=soma plants] into a remedy.
3. The pressing stones joined in fellowship display their greatness on the  lower (stones),
providing bullish power to the bull.
4. O pressing stones, let god Savitar now propel you according to ordinance for the sacrificer who presses (soma).
## 176 (1002) Agni [or, according to the Anukramaṇı, R̄ ̥bhus (1),  Agni (2–4)]
Sūnu Ārbhava
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2
A simple hymn treating the ritual fire on its first appearance. The only real difficulty  is found in verse 4. Although the precise meaning of the first hemistich is disputed,  it seems to these readers that this verse almost paradoxically frees Agni from his  birth as a god in order to situate him firmly in the mortal sphere, where human life  takes place: the theme of Agni’s “dual citizenship” is a common one in the R̥gveda.
1. The sons of the R̥bhus [=flames], their circles, bellow out loftily— they who, deriving all nourishment, feed upon (heaven and) earth as if  on a mother cow.
2. Bring forward the god Jātavedas with a godly insight.
He will convey our oblations in their proper order.
3. This Hotar right here, seeking the gods, is led forth to sacrifice.
Decked out like the chariot of a traveler, he comes into view, glowing  with heat, in his own person.
4. This Agni delivers himself from his immortal birth, as it were.
Stronger even than strength, the god was created for living.
## 177 (1003) Pataṃga
Pataṃga Prājāpatya
3 verses: jagatī 1, triṣṭubh 2–3
An enigmatic hymn, mystically representing inspired poetic thought and vision ary knowledge as a bird, clothed in light, seen inwardly by enlightened poets and1654 X.178
priests. The images, though not always clear, echo many found in similarly mystical  treatments of poetic inspiration, such as the famous Vena hymn (X.123), and make  a powerful impression.
1. The bird, anointed with the magic power of the lord, do those attentive  to poetic inspiration see with heart and mind.
The sage poets espy it within the sea; the ritual experts seek the footprint  of the light beams.
2. The bird carries speech by mind. The Gandharva spoke it within
the womb.
The sage poets protect the flashing, reverberating inspired thought in the  footprint of truth.
3. I saw the cowherd who never settles down, roaming back and forth along  the paths.
Clothing himself in those that (alternately) converge and diverge [=light  beams?], he keeps rolling along within the living worlds.
## 178 (1004) Tārksyạ
Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
A being named Tārkṣya is found in a few other places in Vedic literature, with  varying identities. Here it seems to be the name of a prodigious and mythical  racehorse, much like Dadhikrā(van) (see IV.38–40); indeed verse 3 here is a vari ant of the Dadhikrā verse IV.38.10. Both horses are associated with Trasadasyu,  leader of the Pūrus: his association with Dadhikrā is announced directly in the first  Dadhikrā verse (IV.38.1), whereas his association with Tārkṣya is mediated through  the horse’s name, which is a vr̥ddhi derivative of Tr̥kṣi, himself a descendant of  Trasadasyu (see VIII.22.7, see also VI.46.8).
1. This god-sped prizewinner, victorious overtaker of (other) chariots, him whose wheel-felly cannot be damaged, the swift one driving to
battle—Tārkṣya would we summon here for our well-being.
2. Summoning his generosity again and again, like that of Indra, we would  board him like a boat for our well-being.
O you two who are broad like the two wide (worlds), voluminous and  deep—let us not suffer harm of you in our coming nor in our going.
3. Who just in a single day stretches across the five peoples with his vast  power, like the sun across the waters with his light,
his is the charge that wins thousands, that wins hundreds. They do not  block him, anymore than a youthful arrow.
## 179–180 1655
## 179 (1005) Indra
Śibi Auśīnara (1), Pratardana Daivodāsi (2), Vasumanas Rauhidaśva (3) 3 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, triṣṭubh 2–3
This hymn is later used for the dadhi-gharma (sour milk and hot milk) oblation at  the midday libation associated with the Pravargya ritual, and indeed, unlike many  R̥gvedic passages pressed into service in middle Vedic śrauta rituals, it seems to have  been composed for just this purpose. The first verse invites the priests to assess the  readiness of the libation; the second and third verses, later the Puro'nuvākyā and  Yājyā respectively, invite Indra to the midday service and offer him the cooked por
tion, clearly identified in verse 3c.
1. Stand up, (you priests)! Look down on Indra’s portion which is due. If it is cooked, pour it! If it is uncooked, wait!
2. The oblation is (now) cooked. Indra, fare forth here; the sun has arrived  at the middle of its road.
Your comrades await you with servings (of food), as a housekeeper
awaits the master of the barnyard who is making his rounds.
3. (The oblation) in the udder is cooked, I think, and the one in the fire is  cooked. Well cooked, I think, is also this newer truth [=hymn].
O mace-bearing Indra, you who do many deeds—drink of the sour milk  of the Midday Pressing, taking enjoyment of it.
## 180 (1006) Indra
Jaya Aindri
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Indra’s victories over his (and our) enemies are the special focus of this hymn, but  the poet does not fail to mention our interest in his gifts as well (vs. 1).
1. O much-summoned one, you have vanquished your rivals. Your
tempestuous power is preeminent. Now let your giving be here:
Indra, bring good things here along with the priestly gift. You are the  master of rich rivers.
2. Like a fearsome wild beast, living in the mountains and roaming
wherever it wants, you have come here from the farther distance.
Having honed sharp your fang and your wheel-rim, Indra, carve apart  your rivals. Shove aside the scornful.
3. Indra, you were born to dominion and to might worth winning, you bull  of the settled domains.
You drove away the people that are not allies. You made a wide
wide-place for the gods.
1656 X.181–182
## 181 (1007) All Gods
Pratha Vāsiṣṭha (1), Sapratha Bhāradvāja (2), Gharma Saurya (3)
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Like X.179 this hymn is tightly tied to the Pravargya ritual—in this case celebrating  the great sāmans associated with that ritual, the Rathantara and the Br̥hat, and the  gharma, the hot milk offering that is its high point.
1. Whose name is “Spread” and “Wide-spread,” which is the oblation of the  oblation in anuṣṭubh meter:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu has Vasiṣṭha
carried here the Rathaṃtara.
2. They found what was placed beyond, what was the highest hidden  domain of the sacrifice:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from Agni, has  Bharadvāja brought here the Br̥hat.
3. They found, as they reflected with their mind, the yajus that sprang forth  first, going the way of the gods:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from the sun,  have they carried here the hot milk (gharma).
## 182 (1008) Br̥haspati
Tapurmūrdhan Bārhaspatya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Br̥haspati, the master of ritual speech, is called upon to aid our speech, but also to  punish all forms of evil speech and their speakers.
1. Let Br̥haspati lead (our thought) across the difficult depths, but for the  utterer of evil he will lead his thought back (against him).
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.
2. Let Narāśaṃsa help us at the Fore-offering; let the After-offering be luck  for us at the invocations.
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.
3. Let him of scorching head scorch those who are demons; those who hate  the sacred formulation are for his arrow to smite.
– He hurls aside malediction and smites away ill-will; then he will create  luck and life for the sacrificer.
## 183–184 1657
## 183 (1009) For the Birth of a Son [To the Sacrificer (1), the  Sacrificer’s Wife (2), and the Hotar (3)]
Prajāvat Prājāpatya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
The first two verses present a fragment of dialogue, with patterned repetition,  between a wife and a husband, preparatory to attempting to conceive a son. As  Geldner points out, the situation seems to be similar to that depicted in I.179 (the  Agastya–Lopāmudrā dialogue), with the husband ending a period of asceticism  (see vs. 1b) and the wife eager for sex and its product, children. It thus conforms to  the pattern common throughout Indian literature of the reluctant ascetic and the  sexually aggressive female (see Jamison 1996a: 15–17 and passim), but in the short  exchange here the husband seems more amenable than usual, and the rhetorical  responsions between the two verses make the pair seem more attuned to each other.  The final verse (3) is spoken by an unidentified spirit responsible for all sorts of  fertility, who promises sons.
1. [Wife:] I saw you with my mind, as you became ever more cognizant with  yours, you born from fervor, developed from fervor.
Bestowing progeny here, wealth here, progenerate yourself with progeny,  o you who desire sons.
2. [Husband:] I saw you with my mind, as you became ever more intent  with yours, being in distress in your own body at your period.
Up here, near to me. You should become a young woman (again).
Progenerate yourself with progeny, o you lady desiring sons.
3. I placed the embryo in the plants, I within all creatures.
I generated progeny on earth, I (will generate) sons for wives in the
future.
## 184 (1010) Pregnancy/Birth Charm [To Assorted Divinities]
Tvaṣṭar Garbhakartar or Viṣṇu Prājāpatya
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This little charm follows naturally on the immediately preceding hymn. There a  married couple prepares to have sex in order to conceive; here a range of gods and  goddesses responsible for conception and safe pregnancy are called upon to ensure  conception followed by a full-term birth.
1. Let Viṣṇu arrange the womb; let Tvaṣṭar carve the forms.
Let Prajāpati pour out (the semen); let the Placer place the embryo
in you.
1658 X.185–186
2. Place the embryo, Sinīvālī; place the embryo, Sarasvatī.
Let the Aśvins, the two lotus-garlanded gods, place the embryo for you. 3. The one that the Aśvins churned out of the two golden kindling sticks, that embryo of yours we call, to be born in the tenth month.
## 185 (1011) Aditi
Satyadhrti V̥ āruṇi
3 verses: gāyatrī
This brief appeal for the help of the three most prominent Ādityas, Mitra, Varuṇa,  and Aryaman, may have been placed here, after the two pregnancy charms, because  it mentions their mother Aditi (vs. 3), whose prodigious pregnancies were legend ary. Certainly the Anukramaṇī seems to have concluded something of the sort, since  it identifies the divinity of the hymn as Aditi, though she appears only obliquely.
1. Great be the heavenly help of the three—of Mitra, of Aryaman,
of Varuṇa—help difficult to assail.
2. For neither at home nor on wild ways
does an evil-speaking cheater hold sway over them—
3. For whom the sons of Aditi hold forth inexhaustible light,
for the mortal to live.
## 186 (1012) Vāyu
Ula Vātāyana
3 verses: gāyatrī
As with X.168, although the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of this hymn as  Vāyu, he is only called Vāta “Wind” here. He is credited with the ability to provide  healing (vs. 1) and, in all three verses, to keep us alive and prolong our lifetimes.  This strong association between life and the wind must be mediated through the  latter’s identification (bandhu) with breath, although this identification is not made  explicit in the hymn.
1. Let the wind blow hither a remedy, which is luck itself, joy itself, for  our heart.
He will lengthen our lifetimes.
2. O Wind, you are father to us, and brother, and comrade to us.
Make us live.
3. What deposit of immortality has been deposited yonder in your house,  o Wind,
give us of that for us to live.
## 187–189 1659
## 187 (1013) Agni
Vatsa Āgneya
5 verses: gāyatrī
Found in AVŚ VI.34, this unremarkable hymn contains a refrain that suggests the  militant Agni, but only verse 3 develops this theme.
1. Rouse forth speech for Agni, for the bull of the settlements.
He will carry us across hatreds.
2. Who from the distant distance shines across the wastelands,
he will carry us across hatreds.
3. Who grinds down the demonic forces, the bull with flaming flame, he will carry us across hatreds.
4. Who looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole,
he will carry us across hatreds.
5. Who on the far shore of this airy realm was born as flaming Agni, he will carry us across hatreds.
## 188 (1014) Agni Jātavedas
Śyena Āgneya
3 verses: gāyatrī
Another slight hymn to Agni, this time with his common epithet Jātavedas. The  focus of this hymn is the sacrifice and Agni’s role in it.
1. Spur forth now Jātavedas, the prizewinning horse,
to sit here on this ritual grass of ours.
2. For this Jātavedas here, whose heroes are poets, who grants rewards, I rouse forth a great praise hymn.
3. The bright beams of Jātavedas that convey the oblation among the gods, with them let him impel our sacrifice.
## 189 (1015) Sārparājñı or Su ̄ ̄rya
Sārparājñī
3 verses: gāyatrī
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Sūrya or to the shadowy figure  Sārparājñī ([female] descendant of the Queen of the Snakes), who is also said to  be its author. The former identification seems far more likely, or, rather, the hymn  appears to be set at the dawn sacrifice and to play with the various sources of light
1660 X.190–191
that compete and combine at that time: the sun and the ritual fire, as well as Dawn  (vs. 2ab). The fire, and in part its counterpart the sun, is portrayed as a variety of  animals: a (male) cow (vs. 1), a buffalo (vs. 2), and a bird. The association of speech  with the bird is also found in the Pataṃga hymn (X.177) and probably reflects the  importance of ritual speech at the dawn sacrifice. There are no signs of snakes,  much less their queen.
1. This dappled cow has stridden here and sat in front of its mother
and its father, as it goes forth toward the sun.
2. She moves within the realms of light, breathing in from his
breathing-out.
The buffalo has looked out across heaven.
3. He shines [/rules] over the thirty domains. Speech is established for  the bird
at each dawn and throughout the days.
## 190 (1016) Bhāvavr̥ttam (“Cosmogonic”)
Aghamarṣaṇa Mādhuchandasa
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn presents a cosmogony with tápas “ascetic heat, fervor” as the ultimate  origin of everything. The entities created and the order and source of their cre ation are curious and thought-provoking, but unlike the famous cosmogonic hymn  X.129, there are no puzzles to decode.
1. Both truth and reality were born from heat when it was kindled.
From that, night was born, and from that the undulating sea.
2. From the undulating sea was born the year,
which distributes the days and nights and exerts its will over everyone  who blinks [=mortals].
3. The Ordainer arranged, according to their proper order, sun and moon, heaven and earth, midspace and sunlight.
## 191 (1017) Agni (1), Unity (2–4)
Saṃvanana Āṅgirasa
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 3
This last hymn in the R̥gveda has a programmatic and propagandistic agenda.  The R̥gveda Saṃhitā (“Collection”) has assembled the poetic products of numer ous separate clans, who also had their own cultic practices and who presumably coexisted in an uneasy vacillation between semi-hostility and wary cooperation.  This hymn collection was produced under the new circumstances of a centralized  (or centralizing) sociopolitical regime, generally considered to be the Kuru kings,  which sought to impose (or encourage) a standardized, shared ritual culture—the  R̥gveda collection being its most enduring product—that would also support the  political unification.
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with the ritual fire, which brings all the Ārya together,  including those who don’t seem to want it (1b), and is the most visible representa tion of the underlying unity of their ritual praxis. There’s an implicit warning in  this verse: the ritual fire itself will appropriate the goods of any hold-outs. Verse 2  then provides a positive model: like the gods, who put aside their differences to take  their common shares in the sacrifice, we should make a common sacrifice (which,  implicitly it is said, will make us more successful, once we no long have to compete  among ourselves all the time). Verse 3 outlines the results of the program to devise  a standardized ritual shared by all. The second half of this verse is a virtual speech  act: the speaker performs the two fundamental components of the ritual—ritual  speech (the mantra) and ritual action (the oblation)—thus by this announcement  effectively creating the new, shared ritual. Verse 4 promises that the results will be  worth the effort. For further discussion, see Proferes (2007: 11 and passim).
1. Over and over, o Agni, you bull, you wrest together all things from the  stranger.
You are kindled in the footprint of refreshment. Bring goods here to us. 2. Come together, speak together; together let your thoughts agree,
just as the gods of long ago, coming to an agreement together, reverently  approach their sacrificial portion.
3. Common to them all is the solemn utterance, common the assembly,  common their thought along with their perception.
I (hereby) utter an utterance common to you all on your behalf; with an  oblation common to you all I offer on your behalf.
4. Common is your purpose; common your hearts;
let your thought be common, so that it will go well for you together.

Maṇḍala VIII is organized into small groups of hymns attributed to a single poet  or a set of closely related poets. Within each group, the hymns are organized by  divinity and meter and length of hymn. As noted in the general introduction, two  poetic lineages predominate, that of the Kāṇvas, especially in the first two-thirds of  the maṇḍala, and that of the Āṅgirases in the last third, although the Anukramaṇī attributes some hymns to poets belonging to neither lineage and in addition Kāṇva  hymns appear in the Āṅgirasa section and vice versa. The Kāṇva/Āṅgirasa identifi
cation links Maṇḍala VIII with Maṇḍala I, where poets of these families are promi nent. Inserted in the middle of the maṇḍala are the apocryphal or “half-apocryphal”  Vālakhilya hymns (VIII.49–59), appearing between the sixth and seventh anuvākas  of the maṇḍala. Although these were supplements to the R̥gveda collection, they  were transmitted with it and transmitted with accents, unlike the other khilāni, the  other appendices to the saṃhitā text. For further on the structure and affiliations of
VIII, see especially Oldenberg (1888: 209–19) and Hopkins (1896). Many of the hymns in VIII are made up of strophes consisting of two or three  verses (pragāthas and tr̥cas respectively), in various meters. Quite long hymns can  be thus assembled, and there is often more coherence within the strophes than  between the strophes. These strophic structures were especially associated with the  sung portions of the ritual, whose principal priest in the classic śrauta ritual was  the Udgātar, the priest of the Sāmaveda, into which many of the verses of Maṇḍala  VIII were borrowed. Thus the VIIIth Maṇḍala seems to have a liturgical function  somewhat separate from the rest of the saṃhitā.
Unlike the rigid divinity order in the Family Books, where Agni hymns always  precede Indra hymns, the ordering within the hymn groups is more various, with  Indra often leading off. Indeed Indra is the dominant god of the maṇḍala: of the  ninety-two non-Vālakhilya hymns, exactly half, forty-six, are dedicated to him alone,  with a further two to Indra and Agni jointly. Moreover, six of the eleven Vālakhilya  hymns are Indra’s, in addition to a joint Indra-Varuṇa hymn. Agni is, by con
trast, rather muted in the book: only fourteen hymns belong to him alone. The  Aśvins are relatively well represented, with eleven hymns and parts of several oth ers. The Ādityas also have a presence, with three hymns to them as a group, one to  Mitra and Varuṇa, and one to Varuṇa alone, as well as a substantial part of the
1020 VIII.1
composite hymns VIII.42 and 101 and of the All God hymns VIII.27 and 83. The  Maruts receive three hymns, Soma two (of the few Soma hymns outside of IX), but  the minor gods are almost invisible in this maṇḍala except in incidental mentions  in All God hymns.
There are many high points and striking features in this sprawling maṇḍala, of  which we can mention only a few. From a ritual point of view, VIII.31, which treats  the household pair, provides the only clear R̥gvedic mention of the Sacrificer’s Wife,  whom we consider a ritual innovation in late R̥gveda. Another likely sociocultural  innovation, the explicit organization of the three Ārya varṇas, the social classes of  brahmin, kṣatriya, and vaiśya, is obliquely referred to in the trio of hymns VIII.35– 37. On the mythological side, the story of Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Emuṣa boar, found  in later brāhmaṇa texts, is mentioned several times in this maṇḍala, with a fairly  coherent account of it given in VIII.77. Perhaps the single most striking hymn in  VIII is the Apālā sūkta, VIII.91, in which a barely pubescent girl conducts a private  soma sacrifice for Indra. A particularly beautifully structured hymn is the All God  riddle hymn, VIII.29. Finally, one of the most salient features of the maṇḍala is the  number of dānastutis, including some of the most notable in the R̥gveda.
Although the first five hymns of VIII (VIII.1–5) are attributed to a variety of poets, as  Oldenberg discusses (1888: 214) they appear to belong together because of the simi larity of the names of the poets assigned by the Anukramaṇī, the regular appearance  of a dānastuti, and the connection of the names of the Kaṇvas and Priyamedhas.
## 1 (621) Indra (1–29), Dānastuti of Āsaṅga (30–33),
Āsaṅga (34)
Pragātha Kāṇva (formerly Pragātha Ghaura, brother and adoptive son of Kaṇva)  (1–2), Medātithi Kāṇva and Medhyātithi (3–29), Āsaṅga Plāyogi (30–33), Śaśvatī Āṅgirasī, wife of Āsaṅga (34)
34 verses: brhat ̥ ī, except satobrhat ̥ ī 2–4, triṣṭubh 33–34
The structure of this hymn is metrically complex; indeed Oldenberg despairs of it.  It begins with two pragāthas (vss. 1–4, br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī) and ends  with two triṣṭubhs (vss. 33–34). In between are twenty-eight br̥hatī verses, whose  organization is unclear. Oldenberg is inclined to assume an overall tr̥ca structure,  which has been disturbed—and indeed some of whose verses have been lost, as he  believes. Geldner, on the other hand, sees paired verses (continuing the pragāthas  of 1–4) in verses 5–20, tr̥cas in verses 21–29 and the dānastuti (vss. 30–33), with the  final verse (34) falling outside these structures. It is also important to note that this  hymn violates one of the principles of arrangement in the VIIIth Maṇḍala, whereby  within each poet’s collection all hymns to the same deity are grouped together in  order of descending number of verses: our VIII.1 has thirty-four verses, whereas VIII.2, also to Indra, has forty-two. This discrepancy is one of the pieces of evi dence that led Oldenberg to suggest that some verses had been lost in VIII.1. In any case the metrical particulars do not help in discerning the thematic struc ture. The one indisputable fact is that the last four verses (30–34) stand apart from  the rest of the hymn: verses 30–33 form a dānastuti, and the striking final verse (34)  belongs to the same level of colloquial discourse as the three immediately preceding  verses and may in fact be part of the dānastuti (see below). The rest of the hymn  is devoted to Indra, but there is very little sustained praise of the god and almost  no mythology (apart from a few glancing references in vss. 11 and 28). Most of the  Indra portion falls roughly into the genres of “journey” hymn and invitation to  the soma sacrifice, but as often in Indra hymns there is concern that Indra will go  elsewhere for his soma. The first ten verses develop this theme, but with somewhat  slangy language (e.g., “having it both ways,” vs. 2; “keep crisscrossing,” vs. 4) and  with an intimate and almost teasing approach to the god, as when the poet in verse  5 promises that he won’t “hand over” Indra even in return for a great sum. But the  anxiety that Indra will pass by his sacrifice is clear, especially in verses 3–4, 7; this  theme recurs in verses 13–16, and, even in the following verses devoted to the soma  preparation and the god’s response (17–22), in verse 20 the poet expresses his fear  that he might anger Indra with his importunings. The themes of the journey and the  invitation to soma are repeated once more in verses 23–27, and verse 27 ends with  a strong affirmation that Indra will come to our sacrifice, thus ending the repeated  doubts expressed earlier in the hymn. Two more verses (28–29), paired by their  repeated fronted pronouns, bring the Indra part of the hymn to a close. Thus the hymn keeps circling around certain topics, while other common fea tures of Indra hymns such as mythological references are absent; nonetheless, there  is little in the way of formal structure or organized presentation. Moreover, the  striking turns of phrase found in the earlier parts of the hymn are less frequent  in the later parts, with one exception: verse 12. This baffling verse is found also in  the Atharvaveda in the wedding hymn (AVŚ XIV.2.47). It seems to depict Indra as  a wondrous physician, in most interpretations: without even touching it he sticks  together a breach, perhaps a wound, which was perhaps made by a missile, before  the missile, if that’s what it is, pierces through to the collarbones. The translation  given here is provisional, and it is not at all clear to us why the verse is found in this  hymn or what it really refers to.
The dānastuti (vss. 30–33) is notable for a number of reasons, not least that it  mentions several different patrons. The “praises of the gift” are characteristically  obliquely expressed. But the oddest verse in the hymn, and indeed one of the oddest  verses in the R̥gveda, is the final one, verse 34. In it a woman (identified as Śaśvatī by  the Anukramaṇī, but we prefer to take that word as an attributive adjective) expresses  happy surprise at the sight of the penis of an unidentified man. There is no context  for this vignette of sexual encounter with its snatch of provocative direct speech. The  later tradition (Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra XVI.11.17, Br̥haddevatā VI.41) consid ers the female to be the wife of Āsaṅga, the patron mentioned in the immediately
1022 VIII.1
preceding verse (33), who had become a woman but was turned back into a man  thanks (according to the Br̥haddevatā) to the poet Medhyātithi. But this explanation  seems a desperate makeshift and the complex gender switching entirely invented. It  seems more likely that the verse belongs to the dānastuti, and in an even more oblique  expression than those that precede it, it “praises the gift” of a woman to the poet  (women are often mentioned as part of the poet’s spoils: see the final verse of the  next hymn, VIII.2.42) by alluding to the enthusiastic response of his new prize to his  sexual advances. (The poet thereby also obliquely praises his own equipment.)
1. Don’t praise anything else! Comrades, don’t do yourselves harm.
Praise only Indra the bull when (the soma) is pressed, and right now
pronounce your solemn recitations—
2. Him, rumbling loudly like a bull, unaging, conquering territory as if  (conquering) cow(s);
making both: division by hate and unions by love—having it both ways,  the most munificent one.
3. For even though these peoples now, every man for himself, call upon you  for help,
let it be our sacred formulation, Indra, that becomes your strengthening  now and throughout all days.
4. O bounteous one, the poetic inspirations, those attentive to poetic  inspiration—the ones belonging to the stranger (and those belonging)  to (our) peoples—keep crisscrossing each other.
Hop to! Bring here (to be) nearest a prize of many forms, for help.
5. Not even for a great exchange gift would I hand you over, you possessor  of the stone,
not for a thousand, not for ten thousand, you possessor of the mace, not  for a hundred, you of a hundred rewards.
6. You are better for me, Indra, than a father and than a brother who  benefits not.
You and a mother seem to me to be alike, o you who are good for goods  and largesse.
7. Where have you gone? Where are you? For surely your mind is in many  places.
Are you on the rise?—you fighter, creator of tumult, cleaver of
strongholds. They have sung forth their songs.
8. Chant forth a song to him who cleaves strongholds for his favorite— (it is songs) because of which the mace-wielder will travel to sit upon the  ritual grass of Kāṇva and split fortresses.
9. Those of yours which bring ten cows, which bring a hundred, a
thousand,
those horses of yours which are swift-running bulls, with these come  swiftly to us. 10. Today I summon the juice-yielding (cow), pulsing with excitement from  the songs,
Indra, the good milker, the lead milk-cow, the broad-streamed
refreshment, who gets it right.
11. When he gave a push to Etaśa, (the steed) of the Sun, and to the two  far-wandering winged (steeds) of the Wind,
he of a hundred resolves conveyed Kutsa, the son of Arjuna. He crept  up on the Gandharva, who was not to be laid low.
12. He [=Indra] who, even without a bandage, before (the missile) drills  into the collarbones,
joins together the join—he, the bounteous one with many goods: he  makes what has gone awry right again.
13. May we not be like outsiders, like foreigners to you, Indra.
Like trees left behind (by woodcutters), we have considered ourselves  poor at burning, you possessor of the stone.
14. Indeed we have considered ourselves neither swift nor strong, you  Vr̥tra-smasher.
But in an instant, through your great generosity, o champion, we could  (again) take delight in your praise.
15. If he will listen to my praise, let our (soma-)drops invigorate Indra, when they have run swift across the filter, they that strengthen the son  of Tugra [=Bhujyu].
16. Come here today to the joint praise from your favorite and comrade. Let the invitatory praise of the bounteous ones help you forward. Then  I am eager for good praise for you.
17. Once you (priests) have pressed the soma with the stones, rinse it in the  waters.
The superior men, garbing (it) in cows [=milk] as if in garments, will  milk (it) out from the belly.
18. (Coming) then from earth or then from heaven, from the lofty realm  of light,
by this my song become strong in your own body. Bring created things  to fullness, o you of strong resolve.
19. For Indra press well the most invigorating soma worthy to be chosen. The potent one [=Indra] will swell him who is spurred on, like a
prize-seeking (horse), by every insight.
20. I, always begging you with my song—with the gush [?] of soma
let me not
anger you, frenzied like a wild beast, at the soma-pressings. Who will  not beg his master?
21. (Begging) the mighty one with his mighty power for his exhilaration  roused by the exhilarating drink,
the one triumphant over all when roused to exhilaration—for in his
exhilaration he always gives to us.1024 VIII.1
22. In his treasury are many desirable things. The god (will grant them) to  the pious mortal;
he will grant to him who presses and to him who praises—(the god)  who is welcomed by all, praised by the stranger.
23. Drive here, Indra—find your invigoration (here)—together with your  bright bounty, o god.
Fill your belly, like a lake, broad and fat with soma juices drunk in  common.
24. Here let a thousand, here let a hundred, yoked to a golden chariot— the long-maned fallow bays, yoked by a sacred formulation—convey  you to drink the soma, o Indra.
25. Here let the two fallow bays (yoked) to the golden chariot, those with  peacock tails
and white backs, convey you to drink of the honey, of the
strengthening stalk.
26. Drink of this pressed (soma), you who long for songs, like the first  drinker [=Vāyu].
This pressed drink of the juicy, thoroughly prepared (soma), cherished  for invigoration, acts the lord.
27. He who is unique through his wondrous skill, the great and mighty one  is dominant through his commandments.
The fair-lipped one will come—he will not stay away, he will come here.  He will not avoid our call.
28. You crushed completely the roving fortress of Śuṣṇa with your deadly  weapons.
You followed the light, (and shall) once again, when, Indra, you will  become the one to be summoned.
29. Mine are the praises when the sun has risen, mine at the day’s midday, mine in the evening at the border of night, that have turned you here, o  good one.
30. Praise (them)! Just praise (them)! They are the most bounteous of  bounty among your bounteous ones:
Ninditāśva, Prapathin, and Paramajyā, o Medhyātithi.
31. When with trust in the winning horses I mount on the chariot, of the valuable goods what will stand out is the livestock coming  from Yadu.
32. Who has bounteously given two silvery (horses) to me, together with a  golden hide,
let him be dominant over all auspicious things—Svanadratha, (son of)  Āsaṅga.
33. Then Āsaṅga, the son of Playoga, will give more than others, o Agni, by  ten thousand.
Then for me ten gleaming bullocks emerged, like reeds from a pond. 34. His thick (member) has become visible in front along its length—a  boneless thigh hanging down.
His woman, ever ready, having caught sight of it, says, “My lord, you’re  bringing (me) an excellent treat!”
## 2 (622) Indra (1–40), Vibhindu’s Dānastuti (41–42)
Medhātithi Kāṇva and Priyamedha Āṅgirasa (1–40), Medhātithi Kāṇva (41–42) 42 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 28, arranged in trcas. ̥
As noted above, this hymn has considerably more verses than the preceding one,  and is therefore apparently out of sequence. The discrepancy in length between  the two hymns is one reason Oldenberg suggests that VIII.1 may have lost verses in  transmission. (See the introduction to the preceding hymn.)
As indicated by the Anukramaṇī, the majority of the hymn is devoted to Indra, with  the final verses a dānastuti; however, despite the Anukramaṇī’s division, the dānastuti  must begin with verse 40, not 41, both because of the tr̥ca division and on grounds  of content and tone. In the Indra portion the focus remains almost exclusively on the  preparation of soma in its various forms, and the hope that Indra will come to our  sacrifice, drink of our soma, and reward us. As often in such hymns, there is a journey  component (esp. vss. 19, 26–28), and underlying the calls to Indra to journey to our  sacrifice is the worry that Indra will stay away from our sacrifice because of anger or  the appeals of other sacrificers (vss. 5–6, 19–20). There are also some slight indications  that the hymn is concerned with a ritual innovation being introduced in some of the  R̥gvedic clans, the Third Pressing, which takes place in the evening and involves soma  mixed with milk. There are two occurrences of the word ā́śir “milk-mixture” (vss. 10,  11; see also 9b [ā́śir is also found twice in VIII.31, which also seems to contain refer ences to Third Pressing]), and verse 18 seems to imply that the gods themselves are not  satisfied with a soma sacrifice that ends with the Midday Pressing. The emphasis on  the number three (esp. vss. 7–9, 21) may also support this interpretation, as may the  hope expressed that Indra will not spend his evening away from us (vs. 20).
Aside from the thematic unity of some of the tr̥cas (e.g., vss. 7–9 on the three  types of soma), this long first section of the hymn has little apparent structure, and  it is also notable for its lack of mythological reference (beyond a few token men tions of Vr̥tra, vss. 26, 31, 36). But throughout this section there are unusual simi les (e.g., vss. 6, 12, 17, 19, 20) and turns of phrase, including some untranslatable  grammatical and lexical puns (as in vs. 3). The loose texture and the lightness and  transparency of the meter also help to make it an appealing piece.
The dānastuti (vss. 40–42) is, as often, hard to interpret. In verse 40 the actor  seems still to be Indra, who in the guise of a ram had some sort of interaction with  Medhyātithi: the language here is unclear, and although there are various treatments  of Medhātithi (sic) and Indra as ram in the Brāhmaṇa literature, these seem desper
ate attempts to make sense of the fleeting and mysterious reference here. Though it
1026 VIII.2
appears to be Indra who is addressed in a subordinate clause in the 2nd person in  verse 40, the 2nd person reference has shifted in verse 41 to Vibindhu, apparently  the human patron. Perhaps Indra’s generosity is being superimposed on this human  patron. The final verse, 42, like the final verse of the dānastuti in VIII.1 (vs. 34), con
cludes the hymn with a sexual innuendo: two “daughters of joy” (a phrase that goes  neatly into French as filles de joie “prostitutes”) have also been given to the poet.  These may indeed be two women, but since they are called “milk-strong,” it is quite  possible that the poet is referring to the two breasts of one woman. If so, this verse  responds directly to VIII.1.34, where the woman of the poet praises his member, and  recalls IV.32.22-24, with a likewise disguised reference to the breasts of a woman  given to the poet in payment for his verse.
1. This pressed stalk, o good one—drink your belly well full—
have we given to you, o you who bring no threat.
2. Rinsed by men, pressed by stones, purified by the sheep’s fleece,
washed like a horse in the rivers—
3. Preparing it with cows [=milk], we have made it sweet for you, like  barley (enjoyed) by cows.
Indra, (we have made) you (to be) at this joint revelry.
4. It’s just Indra who is the lone drinker of soma, Indra the lifelong  drinker of the pressings
among gods and mortals,
5. Whom neither the clear [=unmixed] nor the poorly mixed nor the  (juices) that are sharp
keep away—him of broad extent whose heart is good—
6. When those other than us go hunting him with cows, like
(self-)choosing women hunting (husbands),
and creep up on him with their milk-cows.
7. Let the three somas be pressed for the god Indra,
for the soma-drinker in (our) own dwelling.
8. Three buckets drip and three cups are well filled
at the same presentation.
9. You are clear, outstanding among many; (and you are) mixed with milk  in the middle;
and (you, mixed) with curd, (are) the most invigorating for the champion.
10. These soma-drinks are yours, Indra, the sharp ones pressed among us. The clear ones beg for the milk mixture.
11. Prepare these: the milk mixture, the offering cake, and this soma here,  o Indra,
for I hear that you are endowed with riches.
12. When they have been drunk, they fight each other within the heart, like  those badly intoxicated on liquor.
Like the naked in the cold they stay awake. 13. Rich indeed should be the praiser of a rich benefactor like you,
and far(-famed) indeed (the praiser) of a famous one, o possessor of  the fallow bays.
14. Never does the stranger pay attention to a solemn speech being recited  if it comes from a man without cattle,
nor to a song being sung.
15. Don’t hand us over to a taunter, Indra, nor to one who vaunts  himself.
Do your best (for us), able one, with your abilities.
16. We have just this aim: as comrades devoted to you, Indra,
the Kaṇvas sing to you with their solemn words.
17. I express admiration at nothing else, mace-bearer. Like workmen at  their labor,
it’s just your praise song to which I pay attention.
18. The gods seek a presser. They are not eager for sleep.
Tireless, they go to exhilaration.
19. Drive forth here with prizes. Stop being angry at us,
like a great man with a young wife.
20. Let him not (be) filled with evil rage. Will he spend his evening at a  distance from us
like a son-in-law down on his luck?
21. For we know the much-giving benevolence of him,
the hero,
and the thoughts of him who was born in the three.
22. Pour here the Kaṇvas’ (soma). We know no one more glorious than him  swelling with strength,
than him who has a hundred forms of help.
23. With the most superior (might), o presser, bring the soma to Indra, to  the able hero.
He will drink for manly strength—
24. He who among the unwavering is the best at finding the prize that  brings horses for the singers,
that brings cattle for the praisers.
25. Pressers, rinse the soma that is ever to be admired for the one to be  exhilarated,
for the hero, the champion.
26. The Vr̥tra-smasher, the drinker of the pressed (soma) will come. Not far  from us
will he stop, the one with a hundred forms of help.
27. Here, just here will his two capable fallow bays, yoked by the sacred  formulation, carry our comrade,
famed through songs, longing for songs.
1028 VIII.2
28. The soma juices are sweet: drive here! The soma juices are
prepared: drive here—
o you with (lovely) lips, accompanied by the seers, possessed of  ability—on your own to the landing site, to the joint revelry.
29. The praises that strengthen you for great generosity and manly action, o Indra, strengthening (you) as the decisive victor,
30. And the songs for you, o you whose vehicle is song, and the solemn  words—these are for you—
those which have in every way deployed their powers.
31. Just so the powerfully ranging one with mace in hand is the only one to  distribute the prizes of victory—indestructible from of old.
32. He is the smasher of Vr̥tra with his right (hand)—the many times  much-called-upon Indra,
the great one with great powers,
33. In whom are all the settled domains and both exploits and expanses. The (soma) invigorating for the bounteous (Indra) (follows) along.
34. He has done these things—Indra, who is famed beyond all things as the giver of prizes to the bounteous (patrons).
35. Even from behind he brings to the fore the cattle-seeking chariot that  he helps,
for he is the powerful conveyor of goods.
36. He is the winner as inspired poet and with his steeds, the smasher of  Vr̥tra, the champion with his superior men,
the real helper of him who does honor.
37. Sacrifice to him, o Priyamedhas, with fully focused mind—to Indra, whose exhilaration becomes real through the soma juices.
38. To the lord of the settlement whose fame is from song, whose desire is  fame, who has much in himself,
to the prize-winner—sing, Kaṇvas!
39. Who as able comrade gave the cows, even though (they were) without  tracks, to the superior men
who fixed their desire in him.
40. O possessor of the stone—him whose insights are to the point,  Medhyātithi Kāṇva,
since you, having become a ram, led (him) to (goods)—
41. Do your best for him, o Vibhindu, giving him four ten thousands and eight thousands beyond.
42. And these two dear little ones of mine, the milk-strong daughters of joy, has he bounteously given to become my wives. VIII.3 (623) Indra (1–20), Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa’s Dānastuti  (21–24)
Medhyātithi Kāṇva
24 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, 1–20, arranged in pragāthas, anuṣṭubh  12, gāyatrī 22–23, brhat ̥ ī 24
Like the previous two hymns, this one consists of a long praise of Indra (vss. 1–20)  followed by a short dānastuti (21–24). The Indra portion is arranged in stan dard pragāthas, while the dānastuti is metrically more varied. The verse pairs of  the pragāthas are for the most part internally unified, but like many of the longer  hymns in VIII there is not much apparent structure in the hymn as a whole. There  are, however, several recurrent themes:  the greatness (mahimán) and vast power  (śávas) of Indra (e.g., vss. 4, 6); the gods and poets who have previously celebrated  Indra and have been helped by him (e.g., vss. 7–9, 16); and the sheer noise made  by Indra’s praisers (e.g., vss. 3, 7, 16, 18). In the context of all this previous poetic  activity, verses 13 and 14 raise anxious questions about what constitutes the proper  topic of praise poetry and how to configure these praises anew, the perennial prob
lem of the R̥gvedic bard.
The dānastuti is far easier to interpret than those of the previous two  hymns: the patron Pākasthāman is celebrated for his gift of a particularly fine  sorrel horse, given also by Indra and the Maruts. The first half of the last verse  (24) seems to contain an adage, or adapted piece of folk wisdom, as a foil to  further praise of the patron in the second half of the verse. The verse itself has  a slight Pindaric ring.
1. Drink of the sap-filled pressed (soma). Reach exhilaration from our  (soma) accompanied by cows, Indra.
Become a friend, a feasting companion, for our strengthening. Let your  insights help us.
2. We would be in the good favor of you, the prizewinner. Do not lay us  low before hostility.
Help us with your conspicuous powers to prevail. Keep us in your good  thoughts.
3. Let these make you strong, you of many goods—the songs which  are mine.
Pure-colored, gleaming, attentive to poetic inspiration, they have cried  out to (you) with their praises.
4. This one, created with might by a thousand seers, spreads wide like  the sea.
(When) realized, his greatness, his vast power is sung at sacrifices in the  realm of the inspired poet.
1030 VIII.3
5. It is just Indra for the sake of the divine assemblage, Indra as the  ceremony advances,
Indra whom we call upon when we are winning at the encounter— Indra, in order to gain the stake.
6. Indra by his greatness spread the two worlds and his vast power; Indra  made the sun shine.
Within Indra are all beings held and within Indra the pressed drops.
7. To you, for you to drink first, o Indra, with their praises the Āyus and the R̥bhus united sounded together, and the Rudras sang (to you) as the  foremost.
8. Indra increased his own bullish vast power in the exhilaration of the  pressed (soma) in the company of Viṣṇu.
Today the Āyus praise his greatness as in the earlier way.
9. I beg you for a mass of good heroes and for the sacred formulation to  be first in your thought.
That with which, when the stake was set, (you were there) for the Yatis  and for Bhr̥gu, with which you helped Praskaṇva,
10. With which you sent the great waters surging to the sea, that is your  bullish vast power, Indra.
In a single day that greatness of his cannot be fully attained, toward  which the battle-cry has roared.
11. Muster your ability for us, Indra, when I beg you for wealth and a mass  of good heroes.
Muster your ability for the one striving to first win the prize. Muster  your ability for the praise song, foremost one.
12. Muster your ability for us since you helped Paura (and help) the  insights of this one striving to win, Indra.
Muster your ability just as you furthered Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kr̥pa  possessing solar glory, Indra.
13. What among the unshakable things should a powerful mortal  sing anew?
For, (even though) singing the sun, they have not reached his greatness,  his Indrian power.
14. Praising what will they be acting according to truth among the gods?  Which inspired poet will be lauded as a seer?
When will you come to the call of the man who presses, o bounteous  Indra, when (to that) of the man who praises?
15. These most honeyed songs and praises rise up—
entirely victorious, gaining the stake, possessing imperishable help,  competing for the prize like chariots. 16. The Kaṇvas—like the Bhr̥gus, (themselves) like suns—have attained  everything conceivable.
Magnifying Indra with praises, the Āyus and Priyamedhas sounded.
17. Yoke up your pair of fallow bays, o Indra, best smiter of obstacles,  from out of the far distance,
(then,) o bounteous one, turned our way, come here, a mighty one with  lofty (horses), to drink the soma.
18. For these bards, inspired poets, have bellowed for you for the winning  of wisdom with their insight.
You, o bounteous Indra longing for songs—like a tracker listen to our call.
19. You kicked Vr̥tra out from the lofty steppes, Indra.
You drove (the cows) of Arbuda and the tricky Mr̥gaya out, out the
cows of Parvata.
20. The fires shone out, out the sun, out the soma, the Indrian sap.
You blew the great serpent out from the midspace: that manly act did  you perform, Indra.
21. The one that Indra and the Maruts, that Pākasthāman, the son of  Kurayāṇa, gave me—
the most beautiful of all in body, like the one that runs in heaven
[=sun]—
22. (That) sorrel has Pākasthāman given me,
—good at the yoke-pole, filling his girthband, an awakener of wealth, 23. Alongside which the other ten draft-horses draw the yoke-pole
home, like birds the son of Tugra.
24. Food is the lifebreath, garments the body, and anointment is the giver  of strength.
But as the fourth I have proclaimed Pākasthāman, the nurturing giver  of the sorrel.
## 4 (624) Indra (1–14), Indra or Pūsan (15–18), Kurun ̣ ̇ga’s  Dānastuti (19–21)
Devātithi Kāṇva
21 verses:  brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas, except  puraüṣṇih 21.
Like the previous hymn, this one is arranged in pragāthas. However, there is less inter nal cohesion in the verse pairs, but more discernible structure in their arrangement in  the hymn. As noted in the Anukramaṇī the hymn falls into three major sections: the  longest (vss. 1–14) devoted to Indra, the next (vss. 15–18) to Pūṣan, and the last (vss.  19–21) a dānastuti. The Indra portion opens with a pragātha (vss. 1–2) listing many
1032 VIII.4
possible sacrificers that Indra might visit, and urging him to come to the Kaṇvas here.  The next four pragāthas (vss. 3–10) form a ring composition, with verses 3/4 and 9/10  matched to each other: Indra as a thirsty animal coming to drink (3a, 10a) and his  assumption of supreme power (4d, 10d). The remaining two pragāthas in this section  (vss. 11–14) command the Adhvaryus to press soma for Indra. The actual content of  the Indra section is conventional: praise of his powers and his help for mortals, invita
tions to journey here and drink the soma, with the invitation becoming more insistent  toward the end. There are almost no mythological references (though the enigmatic  first pāda of 8 seems to refer to the same event as III.32.11, where Indra wears the  earth on his hip), and the usual pleas for gifts are essentially absent, replaced by indi
rection: descriptions of pious men who benefit from Indra.
The Pūṣan section (though the Anukramaṇī offers a choice of Indra or Pūṣan  as the deity, it is clearly Pūṣan) makes the requests for gifts overt, and it serves as a  transition to the dānastuti proper. The penultimate verse of the Pūṣan section (17)  in fact seems to refer to a different Kaṇva poet, Pajra Sāman (see VIII.6.47), who  has his own gifts to praise—as our poet turns to his own in verse 18, apparently  sequestering his share of the cattle in a different pasture. The dānastuti (vss. 19–21)  is fairly straightforward in its first two verses, but the final verse (21) is entirely  opaque, at least to these translators.
1. When, Indra, you are being called forward or back, up or down, by men, you yourself, propelled by men, are many times in the company of the  descendants of Anu, are in the company of Turvaśa, you vaunter.
2. Or when, Indra, in the company of Ruma, Ruśama, Syāvaka, or Kr̥pa,  you bring yourself to exhilaration,
the Kaṇvas, whose vehicle is praise, guide you here with their sacred
formulations, Indra. Come here!
3. As a thirsty buffalo goes down to a salt-pocket made by water,
come swiftly here to us in friendship [/in the morning], in the evening. In  the company of the Kaṇvas, drink up!
4. Let the drops exhilarate you, bounteous Indra, to give largesse to the  presser.
Having stolen the pressed soma, you drank it in a cup. (Then) you
assumed this most superior might.
5. He put forward his might with might; he shattered battle fury with  his power.
All who seek battle, vigorous Indra, hold themselves down, like trees,  before you.
6. He is accompanied by an ever-battling warrior as if by a thousand— whoever has achieved a praise-invocation for you.
He puts his own son forward with a good twist amid an abundance of  good heroes—(whoever) ritually serves with words of reverence. 7. Might we not fear, might we not grow weary in comradeship with you,  the powerful one.
A great deed of you the bull should be witnessed. Might we see Turvaśa  and Yadu.
8. The bull wears (it [=the earth]) on his left hip. His giving is not
resentful.
The milk-cows are infused with the honey of the bees. Come here
swiftly! Run! Drink!
9. Your comrade, o Indra, certainly has a horse and chariot, is lovely in  form and rich in cows.
He is always accompanied by the vigor of a swelling portion.
Glittering, he drives to the assembly.
10. Like a thirsting antelope, come to the drinking hole. Drink the soma as  you will.
Pissing down day after day, o bounteous one, you have assumed the
most powerful might.
11. Adhvaryu, make the soma run: Indra wants to drink.
Now he has yoked his two bullish fallow bays and has come here, the  Vr̥tra-smasher.
12. Even he himself considers himself a pious man at whose place you  become sated on soma.
Here is your food, ready for yoking, fully sprinkled: of it—come!
run!—drink.
13. Adhvaryus, press the soma for Indra who stands on the chariot.
The stones gaze out upon (the upper surface) of the coppery (soma) as  they press the one belonging to pious ceremonies.
14. His two favorites, the bullish fallow bays, will convey Indra to the  coppery (soma) among the industrious (priests).
Let your team, the glory of the ceremony, convey you, facing our way,  right here to our pressings.
15. We choose Pūṣan of many goods for yoking.
You able one, invoked by many, you releaser—do your best because of  our insight to thrust out wealth for us.
16. Sharpen us like a razor in your hands. Bestow riches, you releaser. In you is that ruddy good [=cattle] easy to find for us (and for) the
mortal whom you urge on.
17. I pursue you, Pūṣan, to aim (toward you). I pursue you to praise (you),  glowing one.
I do not pursue (anything) of his—for that is alien, o good one, (and it  is) for Pajra Sāman to praise.1034 VIII.5
18. Away (be) the cows toward some (other) pasture, o glowing, immortal  one, (to be) our own legacy.
Become our kindly helper, Pūṣan, most munificent for the winning of  prizes.
19. Substantial is the bounty that brings a hundred horses at Kuruṅga’s  rituals of day(break).
At the gifts of the vibrant king, bestowing good fortune, we thought  ourselves to be among the Turvaśas.
20. Won through the insights of the prizewinning descendant of Kaṇva,  (won) by the heaven-bound Priyamedhas,
sixty thousand flawless [?] (cows) I drive along, (drive) forth herds of  cows—I the seer.
21. Even the trees have found pleasure at my supper-time.
They share in the cow in its profusion; they share in the horse in its
profusion.
## 5 (625) Aśvins
Brahmātithi Kāṇva
39 verses: gāyatrī, except brhat ̥ ī 37–38, anuṣṭubh 39, all arranged in trcas ̥
This long hymn (at 39 verses the longest hymn to the Aśvins in the R̥gveda) presents  few difficulties and, correspondingly, few particular pleasures. Many pādas in the  hymn have exact or near counterparts elsewhere.
The hymn begins not with the Aśvins but with the appearance of the (unnamed)  Dawn (vs. 1), as a lead-in to the Aśvins’ early morning journey. Throughout the hymn  the two gods are urged to drive here to our sacrifice, with occasional mentions of the  sacrifices they should pass over on their way to ours (esp. vss. 13, 15). They are also  begged for the usual assortment of wealth in goods and livestock; their “refreshments”  (íṣ) are especially insistently hoped for (see vss. 5, 9, 10, 20, 21, 31, 34, 36). There is  almost no mythological material, little mention of the miraculous rescues that are  the Aśvins’ stock in trade. Brief allusions to two of these exploits are found in verses  22–23, and the bare names of a number of their clients are listed in verses 25–26.
The last three verses (37–39) are a dānastuti praising the gift of one Kaśu, lord  of the Cedis. His previous, fairly modest, gift is mentioned in verse 38, with the  hope that the Aśvins will have the opportunity to see a more magnificent version in  verse 37. And in verse 39 Kaśu is implicitly challenged to make an unparalleled gift,  so that other men will not win greater praise for their generosity.
1. When, though being at a distance, she of ruddy breath has brightened as  if right here,
she has stretched out her radiance in all directions. 2. Manfully, o wondrous ones, with your mind-yoked chariot of broad  dimensions
you accompany Dawn, o Aśvins.
3. O you rich in prizewinning mares, praise songs have appeared facing  you two.
Like a messenger I shall solemnly proclaim my speech.
4. *O Kaṇvas, for us shall I praise the two dear to many, delightful to  many, who bring many good things,
the Aśvins—for their help—
5. The most munificent, the best prizewinners, the two lords of beauty  bringing refreshments
who go to the house of the pious man.
6. To the pious man who has the gods well on his side (give) good wisdom  that doesn’t doublecross him;
sprinkle his pasture-land with ghee.
7. Here to our praise song drive quickly at speed
with your swift falcons, your horses,
8. With which you fly around the three far distances, all the luminous  realms of heaven,
and the three nights.
9. And refreshments along with cattle and winnings, too, o finders of  the days—
unfasten the paths for us to win (them).
10. Convey here to us, o Aśvins, wealth in cattle, in good heroes and good  chariots,
and refreshments along with horses.
11. Having grown strong, o lords of beauty, you wondrous ones whose  tracks are golden,
drink the somian honey.
12. O you rich in prizewinning mares, to us and to our bounteous (patrons)  hold out extensive
shelter that cannot be cheated.
13. Team up the formulations of the people and come quickly here.
Do not go to the others.
14. You, o Aśvins—drink of this dear exhilarating drink,
of the honey bestowed, o holy ones.
15. Bring here to us wealth in hundreds and thousands,
consisting of much livestock, nourishing all.
16. Even though in many places men of inspired thought vie with (other)  cantors in invoking you two—
o men, o Aśvins, come here.
1036 VIII.5
17. The people, provided with twisted ritual grass and oblations, making fit  preparations,
call upon you two, o Aśvins.
18. Today let this praise song of ours, which best conveys you nearest, be for you two, o Aśvins.
19. The skin-bag of honey that was set here in your chariot-rut, drink from it, o Aśvins.
20. O you rich in prizewinning mares, with it bring weal for our livestock,  our offspring, and our cow,
and refreshments rich in fat.
21. And heavenly refreshments and rivers, o finders of the days— like two doors, you will open (these) up for us.
22. When did the son of Tugra, abandoned in the sea, do reverence to  you, o men,
so that your chariot would fly with its birds?
23. O Nāsatyas, to Kaṇva, (his eyes) pasted shut and in a locked house, over and over you offer your help.
24. Drive here with this help, when with our newer good lauds
I call upon you, o you with bullish goods.
25. Just as you helped Kaṇva, Priyamedha, Upastuta,
Atri, and Śr̥ñjāra, o Aśvins,
26. And just as you (helped) Aṃśu when the stake was to be decided and  Agastya when (it was) cows,
and Sobhari when (it was) victory-prizes,
27. For so much favor, or more than that,
do we singers beg you, o Aśvins with bullish goods.
28. O Aśvins, the chariot with golden chariot-box and golden reins that touches heaven—since you will mount it—
29. Golden your chariot-shaft, golden your chariot-pole and your axle; golden both your wheels—
30. With it [=chariot] come here to us even from afar, o you rich in  prize mares,
to this good praise of mine.
31. From far away you convey here the many refreshments
of the Dāsa, while consuming them, o immortal Aśvins.
32. Drive here to us with brilliance, here with fame, here with wealth,  Aśvins,
you much-gleaming Nāsatyas.
33. Let your feathered birds [=horses], frothing at the mouth, convey you here to the man who performs the ceremony well. 34. Your chariot pursuing our song—the (chariot) that rolls along, along  with its refreshment—
its wheel does not ram against it.
35. (Drive here) with your golden chariot, with your horses with speedy  forefeet,
o Nāsatyas, who spur on insights.
36. You sweeten, as it were, the wakeful wild animal [=soma?], o you of  bullish goods.
Infuse wealth with refreshment for us.
37. O Aśvins, may you know of my new winnings—
how Kaśu, the lord of the Cedi, will give a hundred camels, ten
thousand cows.
38. He who (previously) bestowed on me a king’s ten (horses?) of golden  appearance—
beneath the feet of the lord of the Cedis are (all) the communities, the  “hide-tanning” men all around.
39. Let no one go by this path by which these Cedis go,
lest another man be lauded as a patron who’s a better giver of
abundance.
The following hymn initiates the second group of hymns in VIII, those in which the  seer Vatsa is mentioned (VIII.6–11); see Oldenberg (1888: 211–14).
## 6 (626) Indra (1–45), Tirindira Pārsavya’s Da ́ ̄nastuti (46–48)
Vatsa Kāṇva
48 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The Vatsa group contains only one hymn to Indra, but at forty-eight verses it is  one of the longest hymns in the entire R̥gveda. It is thus not surprising that the  hymn is not a tightly structured creation, but a fairly loose collection of three-verse  units treating various aspects of Indra. Nonetheless, certain themes are threaded  through the hymn, in particular the Kaṇvas’ role in strengthening Indra through  their poetry. This is strongly articulated in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), in which the poet  Vatsa himself claims this role in verse 1, alongside his ancestral family in verses  2–3. This last verse contains the striking assertion that the Kaṇvas’ praise is their  “familial weapon,” which they “speak”—an image developed in verses 7–8, where  the Kaṇvas’ insights are blazing missiles. In the next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) the poetic  “I” (presumably Vatsa) speaks of his poetic heritage. The tr̥ca consisting of verses  19–21 implicitly identifies the verbal products of the Kaṇvas with the physical obla tions of the sacrifice. (And pāda 20c contains a particularly opaque simile, whose
1038 VIII.6
meaning we are uncertain of.) Once again, in two adjacent tr̥cas (31–33, 34–36)  the Kaṇvas’ power to strengthen Indra by poetry is celebrated in straightforward  terms. The last tr̥ca before the dānastuti (43–45) begins with another mention of  the Kaṇvas’ activity.
Interspersed among the Kaṇvas’ self-glorifications are tr̥cas of straight praise for  Indra. Tr̥cas 2 (vss. 4–6) and 5–6 (vss. 13–18) celebrate Indra’s might and his victories,  especially over Vr̥tra, and could be taken as examples of the Indra-strengthening  praise-poetry that the Kaṇvas attribute to themselves. The later Indra-oriented  tr̥cas (22–24, 25–27, 37–39, 40–42) are more concerned with the sacrifice, the invita
tion and journey to the soma, and the goods and help the sacrificers hope to obtain  from Indra. In the midst of these is an enigmatic tr̥ca (vss. 28–30), which seems to  suggest a connection between the primordial birth of the god (Indra? Soma?) and  the origins of poetic inspiration.
The hymn ends with a three-verse dānastuti, which, for a change, is far easier to  interpret than the hymn to which it is appended.
1. Great Indra, who is like rain-bearing Parjanya in might,
has grown strong through the praises of Vatsa.
2. They (are) guiding the offspring of truth [=poem] safely across, when  they bring it forward—the conveyors,
the inspired poets, by the conveyance of truth.
3. The Kaṇvas—when by their praises they have made Indra the one who  assures success to their sacrifice,
they are speaking their own familial weapon.
4. To his battle fury the clans and all the communities bend down
together,
like the rivers to the sea.
5. That might of his flared when Indra rolled up
both worlds together like a hide.
6. With his mace of a hundred joints, with the ram, he split apart
the head of raging Vr̥tra.
7. These insights (bellow out)—we bellow out—again and again toward  (you) at the forefront of the inspired words,
(the insights that are) missiles, like the blazing of fire—
8. Since, though they are hidden, the insights blaze forth by themselves— the Kaṇvas (blaze forth)—in a stream of truth.
9. Might we attain to this, Indra: to wealth in cows and horses,
and to a sacred formulation to be first in your thought.
10. Because it is just I who have acquired the wisdom of truth from my  father,
I have been (re)born like the sun. 11. I, like Kaṇva, beautify my songs with an age-old thought—
just the one with which Indra acquired his unbridled force.
12. (There are those) who have not praised you, Indra, and seers who have  praised you,
but grow strong just (by) my (praise), as one well praised.
13. When his battle fury smoked, he, breaking Vr̥tra apart joint by joint, sent the waters to the sea.
14. You, Indra, struck your steadfast mace down upon Śuṣṇa the Dasyu, for you, mighty one, are famed as a bull.
15. Neither the heavens, nor the midspaces will encompass mace-bearing  Indra with his might,
nor will the earths.
16. The one who lay upon the great waters, standing fast against
you, Indra,
that one you jabbed down into their footsteps.
17. Who held together in his grasp these two great conjoined worlds, that one, o Indra, you hid with shades of darkness.
18. (There are) those Yatis and those Bhr̥gus who have praised you, Indra— but hear just my call, mighty one.
19. These dappled ones milk out ghee and the milk mixture for you, Indra, they being swollen full of truth in this way.
20. The fecund ones who have made you their infant-by-mouth [=nursling] sur(round you), as the supports (of heaven do) the sun [?].
21. It is just you, lord of power, that the Kaṇvas have strengthened with  their recitation,
you that the pressed drops (have strengthened).
22. Just under your leadership, o Indra, master of the stones, is the
encomium
and the sacrifice worth tussling over.
23. Break out great refreshment for us, like a fortress filled with
cattle, Indra,
and also offspring and abundance of heroes,
24. And this abundance of swift horses, Indra, which will shine forth here at the forefront among the Nāhuṣa clans.
25. You extend your control over the one whose eye is near to the sun  [=Agni? gold?], as if over a cattle-pen.
When, Indra, you will be gracious to us,
26. When, indeed, you display your power and rule over the settled peoples,  o Indra,
great and unbounded in your might,
1040 VIII.6
27. Upon you the clans, offering oblations, call for help,
(you who are) of broad expanse through the drops.
28. In a remote place of the mountains and at the conjunction of the rivers the inspired poet was born with insight.
29. From here, from the heights, watchful, he looks down upon the sea, from where, quivering, he stirs.
30. Just after that they see the dawning light of the age-old semen, when it is kindled far beyond heaven.
31. The Kaṇvas all strengthen their thought for you, Indra, and your  manliness
and your bullishness, most powerful one.
32. Enjoy this good praise of mine, Indra. Promote me,
and strengthen my thought.
33. And in seeking a sacred formulation for you, you fully grown  mace-bearer,
as inspired poets we have fashioned (it) in order to live.
34. The Kaṇvas have roared, like waters going along a slope;
their winning thought (has roared) to Indra.
35. Their recitations have increased Indra, like the rivers the sea, (Indra,) the unaging one to whom the battle fury has been conceded. 36. Drive here to us from afar, with your two beloved fallow bays. Drink this pressed soma, Indra.
37. Just you, best smasher of obstacles, do the peoples, when they have  twisted their ritual grass,
call on for the winning of prizes.
38. After you (roll) both worlds, as the wheel rolls (after) Etaśa; after (you roll) the drops being pressed [/sounding].
39. Reach exhilaration in the presence of Svarṇara and, o Indra, in the  reed-filled (place).
Become exhilarated by the thought of Vivasvant.
40. Having grown all the way to heaven, the mace-bearing bull roared again  and again,
the smasher of obstacles, the best drinker of soma.
41. Because you are the first-born seer, being the only master by your might, o Indra, you keep poking out goods.
42. Up to our pressings and toward your delight, let the hundred straight-backed fallow bays carry you.
43. This earlier insight, swollen full of honey and ghee,
have the Kaṇvas increased through their recitation. 44. Of the great ones it is just Indra whom the mortal should choose at the  ritual offering,
Indra whom the one striving to win (should choose) for his help.
45. The fallow bays, praised by Priyamedha, will convey you near,
o much praised one, for soma-drinking.
46. At Tirindira’s I received a hundred and at Parśu’s a thousand
as the bounties of the Yāduvas.
47. Three hundred chargers, ten thousand cows
did they give to Pajra Sāman.
48. The prominent one has reached up to heaven, giving camels yoked  in fours,
and by his fame (has reached) the Yāduva people.
## 7 (627) Maruts
Punarvatsa Kāṇva
36 verses: gāyatrī
Although a tr̥ca division is possible for this hymn, it does not impose itself.  This is one of only three Marut hymns in VIII (with VIII.20 and VIII.94).  As with most Marut hymns, this one contains considerable description of the  effects on the cosmos of these embodiments of storm and of their journey  through the midspace:  the bowing of the mountains, the violent winds and  rain, the roaring. These descriptions are found primarily in the first part of the  hymn (e.g., vss. 2–5, 7–8) and toward the end (see esp. vs. 34, with its bowing  mountains forming a ring with vss. 2 and 5). The middle portion of the hymn  (approximately vss. 11–21) expresses our desires for their presence at our sac rifice and for their gifts, with the last two verses (20–21) posing anxious ques
tions concerning the whereabouts of the Maruts and the loss of their attention.  This anxiety returns in two further question verses, 30–31, which preface the  Maruts’ final journey to the place of sacrifice, where they are praised together  with Agni (vss. 32–26).
Verses 22–26 present various fragments of mythology; particularly striking, and  baffling, is verse 26 with its mention of the poet Uśanā and the “loins of the ox,”  which may be a glancing reference to the Vala cave.
Like other long hymns in VIII the structure of this one is quite loose. However,  it does have at least a sketchy ring:  in addition to verses 2/5 and 34 mentioned  above, note the references to meter in the first and last verses (1 and 36). It is char acterized also by recycling of vocabulary, by rhetorical repetition (see, e.g., vss. 6,  9, 17, 22–24), and by frequent phonetic figures (a particularly nice one is found in  28ab:...pŕ̥ṣatī ráthe / práṣṭir...róhitaḥ).
1042 VIII.7
1. In that the inspired poet has let flow the triṣṭubh refreshment to you, o  Maruts,
you rule [/shine] throughout the mountains.
2. In that you have certainly set your attention on your course, you  resplendent ones displaying your power,
the mountains have bent down.
3. They raise themselves upward with the winds—the bellowing ones  whose mother is Pr̥śni.
They have milked out swelling refreshment.
4. The Maruts scatter mist; they make the mountains tremble,
when they drive their course with the winds,
5. When the mountain peak (holds itself) down for your coursing, and the  rivers hold themselves down for your expansion and for your great  gusting.
6. You at night we invoke for help, you by day,
you when the ceremony is proceeding.
7. Up they rise, bright with ruddy breath, along their courses,
bellowing on the back of heaven.
8. They release the rein [/ray] with strength, for the sun to travel its path; they have extended themselves with its radiant beams.
9. This hymn of mine, o Maruts, this praise, o masters of the R̥bhus, this invocation of mine—long for it.
10. Three lakes did the dappled ones milk out as honey for the mace-bearer, a wellspring, a cask full of water.
11. Maruts, when seeking your benevolence we call you from heaven, then come here to us.
12. For—o Rudras, masters of the R̥bhus, possessing good drops—in  our house
and also in exhilaration you are provident.
13. Wealth, arousing exhilaration, consisting of much livestock,  all-nourishing—
impel it here to us from heaven, o Maruts.
14. When, as if on (the byways) of the peaks, you have set your attention  on your course, resplendent ones,
you become exhilarated with the drops being pressed [/sounding]. 15. A mortal might beg benevolence of them,
even of such an undeceivable (flock), with his prayers.
16. They who, like droplets, blow their blast through the two world-halves  along with their rains,
milking the unfailing wellspring,
17. Up they rise with their sounds [/with (the drops) being pressed], up with  their chariots, and up with the winds;
up with praises—they whose mother is Pr̥śni. 18. With which (aid) you aided Turvaśa and Yadu, with which (you aided)  Kaṇva, who gained the stakes,
may we receive (a portion) of this for wealth.
19. O you of good drops, these refreshments here swelling like ghee
will strengthen you, along with the prayers of the descendant of Kaṇva. 20. Where now do you become exhilarated, you of good drops, you for  whom the ritual grass has been twisted?
Who is the formulator who serves you?
21. For it is not (now) as it was before, when in return for our praises of you you used to animate the troops of truth, o you for whom the ritual
grass has been twisted.
22. They put together the great waters, together the two “opponents”  [=heaven and earth], together the sun,
together the mace, joint by joint.
23. They drove Vr̥tra apart, joint by joint, apart the mountains lacking  rules [/radiance],
performing a bullish manly deed.
24. They stood by the unbridled force and the resolve of Trita, while he was  fighting,
(stood) by Indra at the overcoming of Vr̥tra.
25. With lightning in their hands, heaven-bound—golden (helmet-)lips  (stretched out) on their head—
the resplendent ones anointed themselves for beauty.
26. When you drove with Uśanā from afar to the “loins of the ox” [=Vala  cave?],
like heaven it [=cave] roared with fear.
27. (Come) here to us, for the giving of bounty, with horses whose forefeet  are golden—
come near, o gods.
28. When the chestnut side-horse guides the dappled (mares yoked) to their  chariot,
the resplendent ones drive; they let flow the waters.
29. In (a place) of good soma, reed-filled, foamy, providing (soma’s)  dwelling,
the men drove in (their chariot) with down-turned wheels.
30. When will you come, o Maruts, to the inspired poet invoking (you) in  just this way,
(come) with merciful (aid) to the one needing assistance?
31. What is this now, you fair-weather friends?!—since you have deserted Indra, who vaunts himself on partnership with you?
32. O Kaṇvas, for us I will praise Agni along with the Maruts, who have  maces in their hands,
who have golden axes.1044 VIII.8
33. I (would turn) hither the bulls, worshiped first at the sacrifice, hither for  newer good progress,
would turn them who bring glittering prizes.
34. Even the peaks bend down, thinking themselves depths;
even the mountains hold themselves down.
35. Traveling crosswise the birds guide (the Maruts) here, as they [=Maruts]  fly through the midspace.
(The Maruts) establish vital energy for their praiser.
36. Since age-old Agni has (just) been born, like a metrical verse, with the  ray of the sun,
they [=Maruts] have extended themselves with its radiant beams.
## 8 (628) Aśvins
Sadhvaṃsa Kāṇva
23 verses: anuṣṭubh
Despite the Anukramaṇī ascription, the poet of this hymn repeatedly identifies him self as Vatsa (vss. 7, 8, 11, 15, 19), the Kaṇva. His composition is monotonously  one-note: “Come/drive here to us” is found, with few variations, in the first seven  verses and in a number of later ones (10, 11, 14, 17, 19); the Aśvins are urged to leave  wherever in the cosmos they find themselves (e.g., vss. 3–4, 7, 14), in order to come  to our sacrifice, and the usual anxieties about competing sacrificers who might tempt  the gods to pass us by are on view (vs. 8). The poet’s uncertainty about the location  of the Aśvins and his desire to lure the gods to his sacrifice and away from his com petitors are summed up in the final verse (23), with its paradoxical presentation of  the “three footsteps” of the Aśvins, which are both visible and hidden. The evocation
of Viṣṇu’s three strides is probably deliberate, but the reasons for it unclear. There is little other content in the hymn beyond the urged journey, the offered  sacrifice, and the expressed hopes for bounties in exchange. Verse 10 briefly and  obliquely alludes to the maiden Sūryā’s mounting of the Aśvins’ chariot, from the  well-known myth about Sūryā’s marriage, and the names of some successful clients  of the Aśvins are listed in verses 20–21.
1. Come here to us, o Aśvins, with all forms of help;
you wondrous ones whose track is golden—drink the somian honey.
2. Now drive here with your sun-skinned chariot, o Aśvins,
you benefactors decorated in gold, you poets of deep perception.
3. Drive here from Nahus, here from the midspace by reason of our  well-twisted hymns.
You will drink the honey pressed at the pressing of the Kaṇvas, o Aśvins. 4. Drive here to us from heaven, here from the midspace, o you (invoked  with) “then, friends.” The son of Kaṇva has pressed the somian honey for you here.
5. Drive here to us for soma-drinking upon hearing
“Svāhā!” and the praise song—o strengthening Aśvins; (drive) forth by  reason of our insightful thoughts, you poets and superior men.
6. Even as seers previously called upon you for help, o men,
drive here, o Aśvins; come right up to this good praise of mine here.
7. Come here to us even from the luminous realm of heaven, o finders of  the sun,
you who are attentive to Vatsa by reason of his insights and listen to  our summons by reason of our praise songs.
8. Do those other than us sit around (you) with their praise songs, Aśvins? The son of Kaṇva, the seer Vatsa, has strengthened you with his hymns! 9. The inspired poet has called you here for help, o Aśvins,
stainless ones, best smashers of obstacles: become joy itself for us.
10. When the maiden [=Sūryā] mounted your chariot,
you set forth to all conceivable things, you Aśvins whose goods are
prizewinning mares.
11. From there drive here with your chariot with its thousandfold raiment,  o Aśvins.
Vatsa has recited for you his honeyed speech—he a poet, son of a poet. 12. The two delightful to many who bring many good things, the two  minders of riches,
the Aśvins, as draft-animals, have bellowed out to this praise song
of mine.
13. Provide to us here all bounties that won’t shame us, o Aśvins;
make us follow proper sequence: don’t make us subject to scorn!
14. When, Nāsatyas, you are in the far distance or when upon the
circumference [?],
from there drive here with your chariot with its thousandfold raiment,  o Aśvins.
15. O Nāsatyas, the seer Vatsa, who has strengthened you with his hymns, for him provide refreshment with thousandfold raiment, dripping
with ghee.
16. O Aśvins, offer nourishment dripping with ghee to him
who will praise you for your favor and will seek goods from you, o lords  of the drop.
17. Come here to this praise song of ours, o you who care for the stranger  and provide many benefits.
Make us very splendid, you superior men. Grant these things for us to  prevail.
18. The Priyamedhas have called you here with all your forms of help— you who rule over the rites, o Aśvins—(who listen) to their calls on
your journey.
1046 VIII.9
19. Come here to us as joy and luck itself, o Aśvins,
(to him), Vatsa, who has strengthened you with his insightful thoughts  and hymns, o you who seek admiration.
20. With (those forms of help) with which you helped Kaṇva and
Medhātithi, with which Vaśa Daśavraja,
with which Gośarya, with those help us, o men;
21. With which you helped Trasadasyu when the stake was to be
decided, o men,
with those help us, to win the prize, o Aśvins.
22. Let the well-twisted praise songs and hymns strengthen you, o Aśvins, found in many places, best smashers of obstacles: become the ones who  provide many desired things to us.
23. There are three footsteps of the Aśvins—though being visible they are  hidden far away.
(Let) the two poets (drive) nearby along the flights of truth, away from  (other) living beings.
## 9 (629) Aśvins
Śaśakarṇa Kāṇva
21 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1, 4, 6, 14, 15; gāyatrī 2, 3, 20, 21; kakubh 5; anuṣṭubh 7–9, 13, 16–19;  triṣṭubh 10; virāj 11; jagatī 12, all arranged in trcas ̥
As is clear from the display above, a dizzying variety of meters is found in this  hymn. However, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 151), save for the tr̥ca composed of  verses 10–12, all these differently named meters are composed of combinations of  eight- and twelve-syllable pādas, which combine easily and without confusion, and  several tr̥cas consist of a single meter (anuṣṭubh vss. 7–9, 16–18).
As in the previous hymn, the poet identifies himself several times as Vatsa  (vss. 1, 6, 15); the Anukramaṇī’s ascription to Śaśakarṇa (“Hare-eared”) may be  taken as a nickname or simply a fanciful invention, as it has no verbal support  in the hymn.
The contents of the hymn are both as various as its meters and, underlyingly,  as harmonious. Certain expressions recur throughout the hymn (half-verse initial ā́ nūnám “here and now,” alternating with simple ā́ “here”; repeated yád and yád vā “when”/“or when”; repeated prá). The poet focuses on asking the Aśvins for aid  and protection, and offers sacrificial service in return. A tr̥ca late in the hymn (vss.  16–18) is addressed to Dawn in her relation to the Aśvins, a connection that fixes  the ritual time of at least that part of the hymn as the Morning Pressing.
1. Here and now, o Aśvins, come to the aid of Vatsa.
Hold out to him broad shelter that keeps the wolf at bay; keep away
whatever hostilities there are. 2. What (manly power) is in the midspace, what in heaven, what through  the five peoples of Manu,
confer that manly power (on us), o Aśvins.
3. (There are) inspired poets who have fondled your wondrous powers all  over, o Aśvins—
even so, take note only of the son of Kaṇva.
4. Here is the hot milk poured around for you, o Aśvins, together with a  praise song,
here the honeyed soma with which you will attend to Vr̥tra [/the
obstacle], o you who bring prize mares as goods.
5. What (healing remedy) you made in the waters, what in the tree, what in  plants, o you of many wondrous powers,
with that help me, o Aśvins.
6. (Even) when you are bustling about, Nāsatyas, or when you are engaged  in healing, o gods,
this Vatsa does not get enough of his poetic thoughts for you—for you  go to the man with an offering.
7. Here and now the seer attends to the praise song for the Aśvins in  exchange for a thing of value.
Here he will pour the most honeyed soma and the hot milk in the
presence of the fire-priest.
8. Here and now you two will mount the swift-tracked chariot, o Aśvins. Here should these praise songs of mine move you, like a cloud.
9. If today we would move you with our hymns, o Nāsatyas,
or with our voices, o Aśvins, even so, take note only of the son
of Kaṇva.
10. As when Kakṣīvant (called) you, as when Vyaśva, as when the seer  Dīrghatamas called you,
as when Pr̥thi Vainya (called) you to the ritual seats, even so, take
cognizance just of this.
11. Drive to us as protectors of our shelter and protectors from afar;  become protectors of our moving (possessions [=livestock]) and
protectors of our bodies.
Drive your circuit for our progeny and posterity (to prosper),
12. When you drive with Indra on the same chariot or when you come to  share the same home with Vāyu, o Aśvins,
when you are joined in fellowship with the Ādityas and R̥bhus or when  you stand in the strides of Viṣṇu.
13. If today I should call on you in order to to win the prize, o Aśvins— the might that is for victory in battles: that is the best help of the
Aśvins.
1048 VIII.10
14. Here and now, o Aśvins, drive here. Here are oblations set out for you; here are soma-drinks for you at Turvaśa’s and Yadu’s (sacrifice) and
here also among the Kaṇvas.
15. The healing remedy that is in the distance and (the one) nearby, o  Nāsatyas,
with that now extend shelter to Vimada and to Vatsa, o attentive ones.
16. I have woken up with the goddess [=Dawn], simultaneously with my  speech for the Aśvins:
o goddess, you have uncovered my (poetic) thought here, uncovered the  gift for mortals.
17. Wake up the Aśvins, o Dawn—(wake them) up, o goddess, liberal  and great,
(wake them) up in due order, o Hotar of the sacrifice [=Agni]. (Wake)  up lofty fame for our exhilaration.
18. When, o Dawn, you drive with your radiant beam, you shine together  with the sun.
This chariot of the Aśvins drives here along the circuit protective
of men.
19. When the swollen shoots, like cows, yield their milk with their udders, or when their voices have bellowed, those seeking the gods (wake) up  the Aśvins.
20. Up for brilliance, up for swelling might, up for victory over men and for  shelter,
up for ritual skill, you attentive ones—
21. Now when by reason of our insights you sit down at the womb of the  father, o Aśvins,
or when by reason of your favors, you praiseworthy ones.

Pragātha Kāṇva
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1, 5, madhyejyotis 2, anuṣṭubh 3, āstārapaṅkti 4, satobrhat ̥ ī 6, arranged  in pragāthas
Like the previous hymn, this one contains a number of different meters, though all  fall into the twelve- and eight-syllable pādas that combine easily into mixed lyric  hymns. Unlike the tr̥ca structure of the last hymn, this one is arranged in pragāthas,  the first two of which (vss. 1–4) are irregular, while the last (5–6) has the familiar  br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī alternation.
The hymn is a distillation of one of the key themes in the much longer Aśvin  hymns that precede it (VIII.8–9). The last pādas of the first and last verses are iden tical: “from there drive here, o Aśvins,” and most of the rest of the hymn (vss. 1–2, 5–6) consists of speculation on where “there” might be, with an array of cosmic  locations suggested. The middle two verses (3–4) invoke the Aśvins and remind  them of their devotion to us and to our sacrifice.
1. If you are at (the place) providing a long seat [=earth/ritual ground], or if  you are yonder in the luminous realm of heaven,
or if on the sea or in a house made ready, from there drive here, o
Aśvins.
2. Or if you two have mixed the sacrifice for Manu, even so, take note only  of the son of Kaṇva.
I call upon Br̥haspati and all the gods, upon Indra and Viṣṇu and the  Aśvins with swift missiles.
3. Now I call upon these Aśvins of very wondrous powers, the two made  for grasping,
whose comradeship for us is preeminent and their friendship among  the gods,
4. For whom (our) sacrifices and patrons are preeminent (even?) at the  sunless time.
They are attentive to our sacrifice and ceremony—those who drink the  somian honey after their wont.
5. If today you are in the west, if in the east, o Aśvins whose goods are  prizewinning mares,
if with Druhyu, Anu, Turvaśa or Yadu, I call upon you—so come to me. 6. If you are flying in the midspace or if along these two world-halves, o  you who provide many benefits,
or if, after your wont, you are standing upon your chariot, from there  drive here, o Aśvins.
## 11 (631) Agni
Vatsa Kāṇva
10 verses: gāyatrī, except pratiṣṭhā 1, vardhamāna 2, triṣṭubh 10, arranged in trcas, ̥ with a final verse
This is the last hymn in the Vatsa group and the only one dedicated to Agni.  Compared to earlier hymns in the cycle it is both brief and, as Renou points out  (EVP 13: 147), elementary. Nonetheless it is a pleasing composition, with adroit  deployment of contrastive terms, such as “mortal/god,” and of parallel structures,  such as “to be X-ed at Y” (vss. 1, 2, 10—the last also providing a simple ring).
1. You, Agni, are the protector of commandments, a god here among  mortals here;
you are to be reverently invoked at the sacrifices.
1050 VIII.12
2. You are to be proclaimed at the rites,
o overpowering Agni, as the charioteer of the ceremonies.
3. Keep away hatreds from us, o Jātavedas,
and ungodly hostilities, o Agni.
4. The sacrifice of the cheating mortal, even though it be nearby—
you do not seek it out.
5. Of you the immortal we mortals revere the many names—
(we) inspired poets (revere the names) of Jātavedas.
6. We inspired poets call upon the inspired one for help, we mortals upon  the god for aid,
upon Agni with our hymns.
7. Vatsa will guide your mind here, even from your most distant seat, o Agni, with a hymn whose desire is you.
8. Because you are of the same aspect in many places, preeminent
throughout all the clans,
in combats we call upon you.
9. In combats we call upon Agni for help as we seek the prize,
upon him who provides brilliant bounties when prizes (are at stake).
10. For as the ancient one to be invoked at the ceremonies, the Hotar both  from of old and also anew, take your seat.
Give pleasure to your own body, o Agni, and win good fortune for us  through sacrifice.
Hymns 12–18 form the third group of hymns in Maṇḍala VIII, which, as Oldenberg  notes in his Prolegomena (1888: 214), clearly belong together, despite the internal  absence of poets’ names and the varying attributions of the Anukramaṇī. All but  the last of these hymns (VIII.18 [Ādityas]) are dedicated to Indra and arranged  properly by descending numbers of verses.
## 12 (632) Indra
Parvata Kāṇva
33 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas. ̥
R̥gveda VIII.12 is tightly structured: the meter is uṣṇih (8 8 12), and in each tr̥ca  the last four syllables of the final pāda form a refrain, which is, however, syntacti cally integrated into the verse. The last two tr̥cas before the final one (vss. 25–27,  28–30) expand the four-syllable refrain to full pāda length (that is, the final twelve  syllables), which retards the verbal progress and hints at the end to come. The long  refrain of verses 25–27, “just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong,” echoes the short refrain of the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), “you have waxed strong,” and  thus hints at a ring composition as well.
The verb form shared by those two refrains (“waxed strong,” root vakṣ) is found  elsewhere in the hymn, as are synonyms (root vr̥dh:  “grow strong, make strong,  increase”) and near synonyms (“spread,” “swell”), and this verbal material pro vides the thematic spine of the hymn. Otherwise there is a mixture of mythological  material, especially toward the end, and invitations to and descriptions of the sac rifice. In the final tr̥ca (vss. 31–33) the poet announces the launch of his own hymn,  that is, the hymn to which this tr̥ca forms the end, and asks for the usual bounties  from Indra.
1. Most powerful Indra, your exhilaration that is conspicuous as the best  drinker of soma,
with which you strike down the devourer—for that we beg.
2. That with which (you helped) Daśagva and Adhrigu possessing solar  glory, who sets atremble,
with which you helped the sea—for that we beg.
3. (That) by which you impel the great waters forth to the Sindhu like  chariots
to travel the path of truth—for that we beg.
4. This praise song for dominance, purified like ghee, o master of the  stones,
by which now in a single day with might you have waxed strong—
5. This one enjoy, o you who yearn for songs—it swells like the sea. O Indra, with all your forms of help you have waxed strong.
6. The god from afar who has become ready for partnership with us— spreading like the one who spreads the rain from heaven [=Parjanya],  you have waxed strong.
7. His beacons waxed strong and the mace in his two hands,
when, like the sun, he made the two worlds grow.
8. When, o full-grown master of settlements, you devoured a thousand  buffaloes,
just after that your great Indrian power grew forth.
9. With the rays of the sun Indra burns down Arśasāna;
victorious like fire over the woods, he grew forth.
10. This newer visionary thought goes to you, conforming to her season  [/to the ritual sequence].
Rendering service, dear to many—she is (well-)measured indeed.
11. As embryo of the sacrifice, seeking the gods, (the thought?) purifies its  intention following the proper order.
By praises of Indra it has grown—it is (well-)measured indeed.
1052 VIII.12
12. Indra, who is the gain from our alliance, spreads himself out for  soma-drinking.
(The thought) advancing like an axe for the presser—it is (well-) measured indeed.
13. Whom [=Indra] the inspired Āyus, whose conveyance is solemn speech,  have brought to exhilaration—
like ghee, it swells in his mouth—(the speech) that belongs to truth. 14. And Aditi gave birth to the praise song for Indra, the sovereign king, (the song) proclaimed by many for his help—(the song) that belongs  to truth.
15. The draft-horses have roared to (him) for help and for his glorification. Your two fallow bays, o god, do not follow a commandment separate  (from the one) that belongs to truth.
16. When (you drink) soma in company with Viṣṇu or when with Trita  Āptya,
or when in company with the Maruts you reach exhilaration with  the drops—
17. Or when, able one, you reach exhilaration at a distance, upon the sea, take pleasure just in our pressing with its drops—
18. Or when you are the strengthener of the presser, of the sacrificer, o lord  of settlements,
or in whose solemn speech you take pleasure—together with the drops.
19. Upon hymning the god time after time, for (him) to help you, upon  hymning Indra time after time,
then they came through to victory for the sacrifice.
20. With sacrifices (they strengthened) him whose vehicle is the sacrifice,  with soma-drinks the best soma-drinker;
with libations they strengthened Indra—they came through.
21. Great is his guidance and many are the encomia for him.
All good things are for the pious man—they came through.
22. Indra did the gods set in front to smash Vr̥tra.
To Indra did their voices roar—entirely for his might.
23. To him, great through his greatness, to him hearing the summons  through our praise songs
and chants do we keep roaring—entirely for his might.
24. The mace-bearer whom the two worlds do not encompass, nor the  midspaces,
just from his own onslaught he has flared up—entirely from his might.
25. When, o Indra, at the battle-charge the gods set you in front, just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong. 26. When, o mace-bearer, with your vast power you smashed Vr̥tra who was  blocking the rivers,
just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong.
27. When Viṣṇu strode his three steps by your might,
just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong.
28. When your two beloved fallow bays grew strong from day to day, just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you.
29. When the Marutian clans held themselves down for you,
just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you.
30. When you fixed yonder sun, the blazing light, fast in heaven,
just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you.
31. The inspired poet, through his insights, raises this good praise to you, Indra, which guides its kin safely across, like footsteps, while the ceremony is  pro(ceeding).
32. When they have sounded in unison in his own dear domain,
in the navel of the sacrifice, along with the milking, while the ceremony  is pro(ceeding),
33. Indra, give to us the possession of good heroes, of good horses, of  good cows,
like a Hotar, (for us) to be first in your thought, while the ceremony is  pro(ceeding).
## 13 (633) Indra
Nārada Kāṇva
33 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥
Though, like the previous hymn (VIII.12), this one is in uṣṇih meter and arranged  in tr̥cas, the tight structuring of VIII.12 is absent here, save in the final tr̥ca (vss.  31–33) with its four-syllable refrain and repeated identifications with the “bull,” and  most of the tr̥cas lack clear unity. The theme of growing and making strong found  in VIII.12 is continued here, however—notably in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and that  formed by verses 16–18, but also generally throughout the hymn. There are also less  insistent links between different parts of the hymn (e.g., the tree branches of vss. 6,  17), and some pleasing turns of phrase, like the “sea of the stalk” (vs. 15) referring  to a particular large vessel of soma.
Mythological material is mostly lacking in the hymn, and what is found is given  perfunctory treatment (see the allusions to the Maruts in vss. 20 and 28–29). The  focus instead is the usual give-and-take of the ritual compact. Although the hymn  has no spectacularly memorable features, it does not seem to deserve Geldner’s  scornful dismissal as “ein recht nichtssagendes [‘trivial’ or ‘vacuous’] Lied.”1054 VIII.13
1. When the soma juices have been pressed, Indra purifies his resolve,  which is worthy of hymns.
He knows his own strengthening skill, for he is great.
2. In the first highest heaven, in the seat of the gods, he is the
strengthening one,
affording good passage, foremost in fame, entirely victorious amid the  waters.
3. I call on him, on Indra the tempestuous, for the winning of prizes, for  plunder.
Become, for us in your favor, our closest comrade, for strengthening.
4. This gift here, o Indra who yearns for songs, streams for you from the  one who presses.
Becoming exhilarated, you rule over this ritual grass.
5. Now, o Indra, give us that which we pressers beg of you.
Bring here to us the shimmering wealth that finds the sun.
6. When the boundless praiser makes bold his songs for you,
your *vitality grows afterward as branches do, when they take pleasure.
7. As of old, I will give birth to the songs: hear the call of the singer. At every revel you have waxed strong for the one who performs
(rituals) well.
8. Like waters going along a downward slope, they play—the liberal  gifts of him
who is called the lord of heaven by this visionary thought.
9. And who is called lord of the separate peoples—he alone exerts  his will—
by those strengthening (him) through reverence, seeking help. Rejoice in  the pressed (soma).
10. Praise the famous one who is attentive to poetic inspiration, to whom  belong the two overpowering fallow bays
that go to the house of the pious and reverential man.
11. You of great thought, ramming through with your horses frothing at  the mouth,
with the swift ones, drive here to the sacrifice—for it is surely weal  for you.
12. O Indra, most powerful lord of settlements, fix wealth fast in the  singers,
and immortal fame and goods for our patrons.
13. I call upon you when the sun has risen; I call upon (you) at the day’s  midday.
Rejoicing, Indra, come here to us with your teams. 14. Come here! Run forth! Take the exhilaration of the pressed (soma)  accompanied by cows.
Stretch the ancient thread in the way that is known.
15. Whether, able one, you are in the far distance, whether nearby,
Vr̥tra-smiter,
or whether at the sea of the stalk, it is just you who are our helper.
16. Let our songs increase Indra, let our pressed drops (increase) Indra; in Indra have the oblation-bearing clans found joy.
17. Just him did the inspired poets, seeking aid, (increase) with downward  coursing help.
The battle cries made Indra increase, as tree-branches do.
18. The gods stretched for themselves a noteworthy sacrifice among the  Trikadrukas.
Just him [=Indra] let our hymns increase—him who ever increases.
19. When the praiser, following his own commandment, has set out his  recitations for you in proper sequence,
he is called gleaming, pure, and unerring.
20. He perceives just that youthful (troop) of Rudra [=Maruts] in the  ancient domains,
where the discerning ones [=Maruts?] have distributed that thought.
21. If you will choose my companionship, drink of this stalk,
by which we have crossed beyond all hatreds.
22. O Indra who longs for songs, when will your praiser become most  wealful for you?
When will you place us amid bovine and equine goods?
23. And your two well-praised bullish fallow bays pull your chariot
to (the soma) most exhilarating to (you) who do not age—for whom  we beg.
24. For him do we beg, him praised by many, the youthful one with his  ancient forms of help.
He will sit down upon the dear ritual grass once again.
25. Become increased, o you who are praised by many, with your forms of  help that are praised by the seers.
Milk out swelling refreshment, and help us.
26. O Indra, it is only you who are the helper of him who praises just so, o  master of the stones.
From out of the truth I raise to you my insight yoked by mind.
27. Yoking here your two feasting companions, for soma-drinking,
cry out to the fallow bays that bring the “forth to that”
wealth, Indra.

28. Let them cry out—those who are yours: the Rudras accompany your  splendor,
as do the clans of Maruts, to your satisfaction.
29. These (clans), his advance (troops), find pleasure in the track that is in  heaven.
In the navel of the sacrifice they have joined together, as is (well-)
known.
30. This one—to take the long view while the rite is going forth toward  the east—
measures the sacrifice in proper order, having surveyed it.
31. A bull is this chariot of yours, Indra, and your fallow bays are
also bulls.
A bull are you, o you of a hundred resolves, and our call is a bull.
32. A bull is the pressing stone, a bull the exhilarating drink, and a bull this  pressed soma here.
A bull is the sacrifice that you urge onward, and our call is a bull.
33. As a bull, I call upon you, the bull, o mace-bearer, together with your  brilliant help,
for you cherish a responsive praise, and our call is a bull.

Goṣūktin Kāṇvāyana and Aśvasūktin Kāṇvāyana
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn begins with a pleasing playfulness: the poet teases Indra by declaring  that, if their places were switched, he (the poet as Indra) would be far more gener ous than Indra is now being (vss. 1–3), with the argument made in the next tr̥ca  (vss. 4–6; see also 10–12) that the strength Indra acquires from the sacrifice gives  him the power to be generous. Two tr̥cas in the hymn are devoted to Indra’s great  deeds: verses 7–9 to the splitting of the Vala cave and the supporting of the heavenly  realms, verses 13–15 to several different exploits, most notably the decapitation of  the demon Namuci (vs. 13). Though Namuci is mentioned several other times in the  text, this is the only place in the R̥gveda that refers to the later story of Indra’s trick
ery directed against Namuci: pledging not to slay him with anything dry or wet, he  used seafoam as his weapon. (The earliest clear version of this tale is probably that  in Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā IV.3.4, but it is recounted in several other Brāhmaṇa texts  and into epic and Classical Sanskrit. See M. Bloomfield [1893: 143–63]. For a pos
sible indirect reference in the R̥gveda, see I.104.3.)
The gāyatrī meter and tr̥ca structure, combined with the conversational tone of  the opening verses, give this hymn a light texture and informal style that contrast  nicely with the more ponderous Indra hymns in the early parts of Maṇḍala VIII. 1. Indra, if I, like you, were, all alone, lord over goods,
my praiser would have cows as his companions.
2. I would do my best for him. I would want to give to him who possesses  inspired thought, o lord of power—
if I were master of cattle.
3. Your liberal spirit is a milk-cow for the sacrificer, for the presser: swelling, she gives the cow and horse as her milk.
4. There exists no one to obstruct your generosity, Indra, neither god nor  mortal,
when, praised, you want to give bounty.
5. The sacrifice made Indra strong, when he unrolled the earth,
creating for himself a headdress in heaven.
6. You who have grown strong and won all the stakes—
we choose your help, Indra.
7. In the exhilaration of soma he spread out the midspace and the  luminous realms—
Indra did, when he split Vala.
8. He drove up the cattle for the Aṅgirases, making visible those that were  hidden.
He shoved Vala nearby.
9. Through Indra the luminous realms of heaven are firm and made firm, stable and not to be shoved aside.
10. Like the waters’ wave that brings exhilaration, the praise song hastens  rapidly (to you), Indra.
The exhilarating drinks have shone forth for you.
11. For you are the strengthener of praise songs, Indra, the strengthener of  recitations,
and the creator of good fortune for your praisers.
12. Just Indra will the hairy(-maned) fallow bays carry for the
soma-drinking
right up to the sacrifice—him who is very generous.
13. With the foam of the waters you made the head of Namuci roll, Indra, when you conquered all contenders.
14. They who, through their wiles, were trying to creep up and mount to  heaven, Indra,
those Dasyus did you send tumbling down.
15. Indra, you made the community that performs no (soma-)pressing  vanish away in all directions—
you as the soma-drinker getting the upper hand.

## 15 (635) Indra
Goṣūktin Kāṇvāyana and Aśvasūktin Kāṇvāyana
13 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas, with a final verse ̥
Attributed to the same poets as the preceding VIII.14, this hymn is a more conven tional praise hymn. It asserts the dominance of Indra over all the cosmos (esp. vss.  2–6), and conversely the contribution the cosmic entities and the various other gods  make to Indra’s power (vss. 7–10). The final tr̥ca (10–12), with its coda apparently  addressed to Soma (vs. 13), seeks to harness all Indra’s powers for victory for our  side, and thus echoes the poet’s opening charge to his comrades (vs. 1). The return  to the beginning is also signaled by a ring-compositional device: the first two pādas  of verse 11 are almost identical to those of verse 3 in the Sanskrit, though their  translations diverge somewhat.
Both the language and the structure of this hymn are straightforward, but its  relatively simplicity avoids the banal by the deft balancing of the powers in the two  contrastive sections of the hymn and the unembellished grandeur of the rhetoric.
1. Sing forth to him, much invoked and much praised.
Seek to entice mighty Indra here with hymns,
2. Him, the doubly lofty, whose lofty power holds fast the two
world-halves,
the mountains and plains, the waters and sun, through his bullishness. 3. You, o much praised one, are the ruler; you alone keep smashing  obstacles,
o Indra, to extend victories and (deeds) worthy of fame.
4. We hymn your exhilaration, an overpowering bull in battles,
creating wide space, bringing the splendor of fallow bays, o master of  the stone—
5. By which you found the lights for Āyu and Manu.
Becoming exhilarated, you rule over this ritual grass.
6. Even today do the reciters praise this (deed) of yours, as in the earlier way: you shall win the waters, whose husband is a bull, day after day.
7. This lofty Indrian power of yours, your unbridled force and resolve, and the mace worthy to be chosen—these does the Holy Place sharpen. 8. Heaven increases your manliness, Indra, earth your fame;
the waters and mountains spur you on.
9. Viṣṇu, the lofty dwelling place, hymns you, as do Mitra and Varuṇa. The Marut troop cheers you on.
10. You are the bull of the peoples; you were born as the most
munificent, Indra.
In every way you have acquired all things that bring good descendants. 11. In every way, o much-praised one, you alone stream over obstacles. None other than Indra spurs more action.
12. When, o Indra, they call upon you for help, every man for himself,  according to his own thought,
with our superior men win the sun now.
13. Fit (to be) a great dwelling for us, entering into all forms, (o Soma,) excite Indra, the lord of power, to victory.
## 16 (636) Indra
Irimbiṭhi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This is, in some ways, a meta–praise hymn, that is, a hymn about praising Indra.  Although the hymn is certainly full of actual praise of the deity, it also repeatedly  refers to invoking, praising, singing to, and giving recognition to Indra and his pow ers and deeds—in other words, to the delivery of the praise itself. Perhaps related  to this feature is the noteworthy fact that Indra is in the 3rd person throughout the  hymn, until the direct address and requests of the final verse (12). The constant  3rd-person reference is emphasized by regular fronting and incantatory repetition  of 3rd-person pronouns referring to Indra (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 8–9) and of his name  (see, e.g., vss. 7, 9, 11).
As for the content of the praise, it focuses on Indra’s power in warfare, where  separate peoples vie for his aid. Yet, despite the battle theme, the descriptions are  surprisingly devoid of violence, and it is Indra as maker of space (from constric tion, vs. 6) and light (from darkness, vs. 10) and as the verbal advocate for his clients  (vs. 5) who stands out.
1. Start up the praise anew with songs to the sovereign king of the separate  peoples, Indra,
the man who overpowers men, the most munificent,
2. In whom recitations find their joy, and all (deeds) worthy of fame, as the aid of the waters does in the sea.
3. With my good praise I seek to entice him, the preeminent king, effective  at raiding,
the prizewinner, for the gains of the great (prize?).
4. To whom belong the exhilarating drinks—unfailing, deep, wide,
overwhelming—
that produce his excitement at the contest of champions...
5. Just upon him do they call for intercession when the stakes are set. Whoever has Indra—they win.
1060 VIII.17
6. It’s just him that the separate peoples recognize by his exploits, him by  his deeds:
“That’s Indra, who creates wide space!”
7. Indra is the formulator, Indra the seer, Indra the many times
much-invoked
great one with great powers.
8. He is to be praised, he to be invoked—the real “real thing,” powerfully  ranging.
Even though alone, he is overwhelming.
9. Him with chants, him with melodies, him with songs
do the separate peoples, the settlements make strong: Indra—
10. The leader to a better state, the creator of light in combats,
conquering foes in battle.
11. He, our deliverer, much invoked, will deliver us to the far shore by boat, beyond all hatreds, with well-being: Indra.
12. You, o Indra—with prizes of victory do honor to us, and provide  us a way,
and lead us to your favor.
## 17 (637) Indra
Irimbiṭhi Kāṇva
15 verses: gāyatrī 1–13, brhat ̥ ī 14, satobrhat ̥ ī 15
Coming at the end of the Indra collection in this self-contained group (VIII.12–18),  this hymn consists of fifteen verses and is thus longer than the two previous hymns.  This over-length, combined with its metrical disunity and the varying use of the  verses in later Vedic ritual, suggests that the “hymn” is actually a composite of  three: verses 1–10, consisting of three tr̥cas plus a final verse; another independent  tr̥ca, verses 11–13; and a final pragātha, verses 14–15. (For details, see Oldenberg  1888: 139 n. 1 and 214 n. 2.)
The first and longest of the three hymns (vss. 1–10) is a straightforward invita tion to soma, urging Indra to make the journey to our sacrifice and promising an  ecstatic immersion in the liquid. There are several striking images toward the end,  especially that of the soma mixed with milk as a woman in disguise going to a ren dezvous (if our interpretation is correct) (vs. 7), and a vivid picture of Indra in the  grip of soma-exhilaration (vs. 8). Only the last verse (10), tacked onto the final tr̥ca,  asks for something in return.
The other two hymns, or hymn fragments, are more opaque. The first (vss.  11–13) begins with a conventional invitation to Indra, but the following two verses  address otherwise unknown men involved in some way in the soma sacrifice. The  final pragātha (vss. 14–15) first gives a praiseful description of the soma drop in verse 14, but ends with yet another unknown man also engaged in the soma sacri fice, who seems to have some success in getting Indra to drink it.
1. Drive here—for we have pressed soma for you, Indra. Drink this! Sit here upon this ritual grass of mine.
2. Let your hairy(-maned) fallow bays, yoked by sacred formulations,  convey you here, Indra.
Listen to our formulations.
3. We formulators, with you as our yokemate, call upon you, Indra— provided with soma, possessing pressings, we call upon the
soma-drinker.
4. Drive here to us, who have the pressings, here to our good praises. Drink of the stalk, (fair-)lipped one.
5. I pour (it) into your two cheeks. Let it run along and across your limbs. Grasp the honey with your tongue.
6. Let it be sweet for you sweetening; (let it be) honeyed for your body. Let the soma be weal for your heart.
7. Let this soma, completely covered (with milk), slink forth to you, like (covered) women (to a rendezvous), o boundless Indra.
8. Strong-necked, bulging-bellied, mighty-armed Indra in the exhilaration  of the stalk
keeps smashing obstacles.
9. Indra, go forth in front, holding sway over all with your might.
Smash obstacles, o smasher of obstacles [/Vr̥tra].
10. Let your hook be long by which you hold out goods
to the sacrificer who presses (soma).
11. Here is your soma, Indra, purified down onto the ritual grass.
Come here to it! Run, drink of it!
12. Śācigu, Śācipūjana, this has been pressed for your joy.
Ākhaṇḍala, you are called forth.
13. O grandson, great-grandson of Śr̥ṅgavr̥s—your (soma)
to-be-drunk-from-a-jar:
upon that has (Indra) fixed his mind.
14. O Lord of the Dwelling Place, a steadfast pillar, armor for comrades  in soma
is the drop, a splitter of strongholds, one after the other. Indra is the  comrade of ecstatics.
15. Pr̥dākusanu, worthy of the sacrifice, seeking cattle—even though he is  one, he sur(rounds) the many.
He leads forward, by thrust and grasp, the ardent horse that is Indra, to  drink of the soma.
1062 VIII.18
## 18 (638) Ādityas
Irimbiṭhi Kāṇva
22 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas, with a final verse ̥
Like the other hymns to the Ādityas in VIII (47, 67), this hymn is fairly elementary  and rarely strays far from its theme—the hope that the Ādityas (and, toward the  end [vss. 16, 20, 21], other gods) will provide protection from various dangers and  enemies and long life for us and our offspring. There is a fair amount of coherence  within tr̥cas—for example, the dominance of Aditi in verses 4–6, the repetition of  śám “weal” and the four-syllable tag refrain in verses 7–9.
1. Here and now a mortal should seek a share of their favor,
the unprecedented (favor) of the Ādityas, at the impulsion (of Savitar), 2. For the paths of these Ādityas are without assault,
and undeceivable are the protectors who provide strength on an
easy road.
3. Let Savitar, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman
extend to us that broad shelter for which we beg.
4. O goddess Aditi, you whose burden [=fetus(es)] cannot be harmed— come here with the gods,
along with patrons who provide good shelter, o you dear to many,
5. For these sons of Aditi know how to keep away hostilities—
the faultless ones who make wide (space) even out of narrow straits.
6. Let Aditi (protect) our livestock by day, let Aditi the unduplicitous (do  so) by night;
let ever-strengthening Aditi protect us from narrow straits.
7. And this Aditi, (like) a *banner by day, will come with her help;
she will make wealfulness and joy. – Failures away!
8. And those two heavenly healers, the Aśvins, will make weal for us. They should keep defect away from here. – Failures away!
9. Agni will make weal with his fires; let the sun blaze weal for us.
Let wind, without defect, blow weal. – Failures away!
10. Away affliction, away failure—drive away bad thought.
O Ādityas, keep us from narrow straits.
11. Keep the arrow from us, Ādityas, and thoughtlessness.
Set hostility aside, o you possessed of all possessions.
12. O Ādityas, extend to us the shelter that will free
even the sinful from his sin, o you of good gifts.
13. Whatever mortal seeks to harm us with demonry,
that man should harm his own lifetime by his own devices. 14. Evil will get the defaming, cheating mortal
who, full of evil rage, is double-dealing right here in our midst.
15. You are in the midst of simple folk, o gods: you know the mortal in  their hearts—
both the one who is double-dealing right here and the one who isn’t, o  good ones.
16. We would choose the shelter of the mountains and of the waters. O Heaven and Earth, put defect at a distance from us.
17. You, o good ones—with your beneficial shelter as a boat
carry us to the far shore, beyond all difficulties.
18. For the sake of progeny and posterity make for us a longer lifetime  to live,
o very great Ādityas.
19. There is a sacrifice closer to you than your anger, Ādityas. Have mercy! Only in you do we abide—in your kinship.
20. The Maruts’ lofty defense, the god Rescuer, the Aśvins,
Mitra and Varuṇa—(all of them) do we beg for our well-being.
21. O Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa, o Maruts—your faultless, manly,  praiseworthy
protection providing threefold defense—extend that to us.
22. For even though we are men, whose kinsman is death, o Ādityas, extend our lifetime for us to live.
The next four hymns (VIII.19–22) are attributed to Sobhari Kāṇva by the  Anukramaṇī and are dedicated to Agni (VIII.19, 37 verses), the Maruts (VIII.20,  26 verses), Indra (VIII.21, 18 verses), and the Aśvins (VIII.22, 18 verses). Sobhari  addresses himself in every hymn but VIII.21.
## 19 (639) Agni (1–33), Ādityas (34–35), Trasadasyu’s Dānastuti  (36–37)
Sobhari Kāṇva
37 verses: 1–26, 28–33 pragātha strophes of kakubh (8 12 8) and satobrhat ̥ ī (12 8 12  8), except dvipadā virāj 27, uṣṇih 34, satobrhat ̥ ī 35, kakubh 36, paṅkti 37
Save for VI.16 with its 48 verses, this is the longest hymn dedicated to Agni in  the R̥gveda, but unlike the composite VI.16, this hymn shows clear signs of unity.  This unity is evident (though more clearly in the Sanskrit) in the constant recy cling and recombination of vocabulary, especially the lexicon related to sacrifice.  Thematically the hymn focuses on Agni’s role in the sacrifice and on mortals’ tasks1064 VIII.19
in helping him fulfill that role. Numerous verses promise the favor and aid of Agni  to the mortal who properly serves the fire (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 9–14).
This reciprocal relationship between the god Agni and mortal men and Agni’s  mediating position between gods and men provide other themes in the hymn. The  first verses (1–4) emphasize Agni’s divine nature even while sketching his role as  the Hotar parallel to mortal priests and chosen by them (esp. vs. 3ab), but this  equivocal position of Agni is explored differently later in the hymn. Verse 24 again  puts heavy emphasis on the fact that Agni is a god and immortal and also the  Hotar acting for and established by men, but here he seems to be acting almost  like a mortal himself—seeking the rewards of the sacrifice like a human priest.  This subtle role shift leads to a more explicit and otherwise unthinkable one in the  next verses (25–27), where the poet imagines himself as the god and Agni as his  mortal server and claims that he, the poet, would act beneficently. (For a similar  role reversal but with Indra and his mortal worshiper, see nearby VIII.14.) This  flight of fancy ends quickly, and the proper relations between man and god are  restored in verse 28.
The hymn also has a political agenda, coming to a climax in verses 32–33, but  foreshadowed at various places earlier in the hymn. In verse 32 the poet announces  that he and his fellows have come to the fire belonging to the great king Trasadasyu,  the fire on which all other fires are dependent (vs. 33). As Proferes convincingly  argues (2007: 33–34 and passim), the fire represents the king’s sovereignty and is  depicted as being made up of the fires of the individual peoples who give allegiance  to the king, the brilliance belonging to each of these peoples being brought together  in a team. Agni is thus not only the mediator positioned between men and gods, but  also among different groups of men, and in both cases he is chosen for the role, put  in that position, by men acting voluntarily.
The model of the sacrifice as reciprocal action and responsibility provides an  implicit model for the state. As noted above, earlier parts of the hymn hint at  what is to come. In verse 7 the poet hopes that his group can use their fires to  provide good fire for an unidentified plural “you”—quite possibly the larger pol
ity. The plural “fires” is significant: though in ritual context it can easily be taken  as referring to the three fires on the ritual ground, in a political reading it can  represent the dependent fires of verse 33. The next verse (8) refers to Agni as “a  guest associated with alliance” (átithiḥ . . .mitríyaḥ). Again in ritual context this  refers to the god’s presence as guest in the house of a mortal and the alliance  between gods and men thus effected, but in a political reading the alliance is the  banding together of the peoples under Trasadasyu represented by Trasadasyu’s  fire. In verse 14 we find the curious and syntactically unusual expression “who will  piously offer boundlessness throughout the domains.” The word “boundlessness”  is áditi, usually used as the name of the goddess Aditi, mother of the Ādityas,  but more easily interpreted as a common noun here. Again, in a ritual context  it may mean that the ritual ground is equivalent to the whole world and thus  unbounded, but in a political context it may refer to the erasure of boundaries among the peoples who give allegiance to Trasadasyu and his fire. It may also  indirectly promise the favor of the Ādityas, the gods who oversee the relationships  among men, to the men who subscribe to this allegiance. The principal Ādityas,  Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman (as well as Bhaga), show up in verse 16, and already  Agni was said to be Mitraic (/associated with alliance) in verse 8 (see also vs.  25). It is surely significant that the two verses following the climactic declaration  about Trasadasyu’s sovereign fire (vss. 34–35) are dedicated to the Ādityas, specifi
cally Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. The final two verses (36–37) are a brief and  uncomplex dānastuti of Trasadasyu.
It is hoped that this introduction gives some sense of the richness and intricate  interconnections of this hymn; much more could be said.
1. Praise him who possesses solar glory. The gods have run to the god, the  spoked wheel (of the sacrifice).
They have conducted the oblation among the gods.
2. Reverently invoke him of extensive generosity, o inspired poet—Agni of  brilliant flame, the guider
of this ritual offering of soma, o Sobhari. (Bring him) forth as the
foremost for the ceremony.
3. We have chosen you, the best sacrificer, a god, an immortal, as Hotar  among the gods—
(you,) very effective for this sacrifice,
4. The child of nourishment, providing good fortune and good light, Agni  of fairest flame.
He will win for us by sacrifice in heaven the favor of Mitra and Varuṇa  and that of the waters in heaven.
5. The mortal who by kindling, who by pouring, who by knowledge  performs pious service to Agni, and
who conducts good ceremonies with reverence,
6. It is his steeds that speed swiftly, his glory that is most brilliant,
and no anxiety, whether god-made or mortal-made, will reach him from  anywhere.
7. With our fires might we provide good fire to (all of) you [=assembled  peoples]. O son of strength, o lord of nourishment,
kindly disposed toward us, you provide good heroes.
8. Being lauded like a guest associated with our alliance, Agni is worth  acquiring like a chariot.
Peaceful ways that bring success abide in you: you are king of riches.
9. The mortal who conducts pious ceremonies in the stipulated way, he is to  be lauded, o Agni, you who provide good fortune.
Let him be a winner with his insights—
1066 VIII.19
10. The one for whose ceremony you stand erect, he, controlling heroes,  achieves success—
and (let) him (be) a winner with his steeds, and with his extollers; a  winner of the stake with his champions.
11. The one in whose house the wondrous form Agni, possessing all  desirable things, should take delight in the praise song
or in the oblations, while he [=Agni] keeps laboring at his labors, 12. Or in the gifts of the inspired praiser who is quickest, o youthful (son)  of strength.
make his speech, when he has found it, one that brings the gods below  and is above (that of) mortals, o good one.
13. Who seeks to attract Agni here with the giving of oblations, or (seeks to  attract) the very skillful one with acts of reverence,
or him of nimble flame with song,
14. Who with kindling and with sharpening (of it [=fire]) piously offers  boundlessness throughout his [=Agni’s] domains,
that mortal, provided with good fortune, will cross over all things  and (all) peoples with his insights and his brilliance, as if through  the water.
15. O Agni, bring here the brilliance that will overpower any devourer in  his seat
and the battle fury of the ill-intentioned man.
16. (The brilliance) by which Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman see, by which  the Nāsatyas and Bhaga,
in that (brilliance) of yours might we receive ritual shares, (becoming)  the best pathfinders by your power, helped (also) by you, Indra.
17. It is those of good intention who have installed you who provide the  sight for men, o Agni, o inspired one—
the inspired priests (have installed you) as the very effective one, o god. 18. Just those (have made) the altar, o you of good fortune, they the poured  offering; they have made the soma-pressing (to be) in heaven.
Just those have won the great stake along with its prizes who set their  desire down in you.
19. Auspicious is Agni when he is bepoured; auspicious is our gift,  auspicious our ceremony, o you who provide good fortune,
and auspicious our lauds.
20. Set your auspicious mind on the overcoming of obstacles, the mind  with which you will be overpowering in battles.
Loosen the sturdy (bows) of those that are greatly defiant. Might we  win with your superior powers. 21. With my hymn I reverently invoke the one established by Manu, the  circle of spokes whom the gods have set down as their messenger,
the best sacrificer, who carries the oblations.
22. To the sharp-fanged one, the ruler of tender age—to Agni do you sing  delight,
Agni who adorns his mass of heroes with his liberal gifts, when he is  bepoured with ghee.
23. When, bepoured with ghee, Agni bears his axe up and down,
like a (rich) lord (he bears [=wears]) his cloak [=ghee].
24. Who, the god established by Manu [/man], set the oblations in motion  with his sweet-smelling mouth—
he seeks to win desirable things for himself as the Hotar who conducts  ceremonies well, (though he is also) an immortal god.
25. If, Agni, you were mortal and I were immortal—o you with the might  of Mitra,
o son of strength bepoured (with ghee)—
26. I would not give you over to the curse, o good one, nor to evil, o my  companion.
My praiser would not be in want nor ill-established, Agni, nor in an  evil way,
27. But well kept here in my dwelling, like a son in that of his father. Let  our oblation go forth to the gods!
28. Might I always keep company with your help that is so very nearby, o  Agni, at your pleasure, o good one—
I a mortal, (with that) of a god.
29. With your will may I win, with your gifts, with your lauds, o Agni. They say that just you are solicitude for me, o good one. O Agni, be
aroused to give.
30. He advances himself through your help well provided with heroes and  bringing prizes—
(the man) whose companionship you will choose.
31. Your drop [=spark], accompanied by dark [=smoke], bellowing as it  is kindled at the right ritual moment, has taken, o you who desire
to win.
You are dear to the great dawns; you rule [/shine] through the nights  and at the dawns.
32. We, the Sobhari, have come to the one possessing a thousand testicles,  well provided with superior power, for his help,
the sovereign king, (the fire) belonging to Trasadasyu—
1068 VIII.20
33. You, o Agni, on whom the other fire are dependent, like branches (on  a tree).
I team up the brilliant glories of the peoples as (poets team up) inspired  poems, while I strengthen your powers to rule.
34. O you Ādityas without deceit—the mortal whom you lead to the  far shore—
you who are the best givers among all the generous—
35. Any (man) holding power throughout the sons of Manu—you kings  who conquer territories—
might we be those to you, o Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman; might we  alone be the charioteers of truth.
36. Trasadasyu, the son of Purukutsa, has given me five hundred brides— the lord of settlements who is most munificent to his compatriot.
37. And, at the source of the (River) Suvāstu, the dusky (horse) of Prayiyu,  of Vayiyu,
became the leader of thrice seventy (cows) for me. Good is the lord
of gifts.

After inviting  them to the sacrifice (vss. 1–2), the poet first describes the effects in nature of the  storm they embody (vss. 3–6) and then their flashy beauty and that of their chariot  (vss. 7–12), ending this section with two verses (13–14) on their lack of individuality  (see also vs. 21). The remainder of the hymn concerns the generosity of the Maruts  and begs them to display it in response to Sobhari’s hymn: the poet addresses him
self in verses 19–20. Unlike the generic gifts generally asked for in R̥gvedic hymns,  the final verses make it clear that the poet has a specific request: Marut medicine to  heal the afflicted (vss. 23–26). Their association with healing comes through their  father Rudra.
The hymn exhibits a light touch and has a number of neat turns of phrase—for  instance, verse 8, where “the music of the Sobharis is anointed with cows” indicates  that their hymn reaps a bovine reward from the patron, or verse 19, with its pun on  the participle cárkr̥ṣat meaning both “plowing” and “celebrating.”
1. Come here; don’t mean harm. Setting out, don’t stay away, o you of  equal spirit,
who are able to bow even the fixed things. 2. With your (chariots) whose wheel-rims are firm, with your very bright  lights—o Maruts, masters of the R̥bhus, o Rudras—
with refreshment come here to us today, here to the sacrifice, seeking  the Sobharis, o you who are craved by many.
3. For we know the mighty forcefulness of the Rudrian Maruts, the  strenuous ones,
of quick Viṣṇu, of the ones who grant rewards.
4. The islands keep flying further apart; misfortune stands still; they  [=Maruts] yoke both world-halves.
The wasteplaces rise forth, when you stir (them), o you self-radiant
ones with beautiful bangles.
5. (When you stir) even the unshakeable things on your drive, the
mountains and the lord of the forest keep resounding.
The earth trembles at your journeys.
6. To allow your onslaught to drive by, o Maruts, heaven raises itself  higher aloft,
when the men, strong in arm, keep putting their energies on display on  their own bodies.
7. According to their nature, following their beauty, the men—greatly  vibrant, impetuous, bullish in breath,
unobstructed in breath—drive themselves.
8. The music of the Sobharis is anointed with cows. Onto the chariot, into  the golden (chariot) cask
(come) those well-born (Maruts), akin to a cow [=Pr̥śni], (for us) to
enjoy nourishment; the great ones (come here) now for us to gain.
9. O you who rain unguents, present oblations to your own bullish  Marutian troop
whose leader is a bull [=Indra].
10. O Maruts, with your chariot with its bullish horses, bullish breath,  bullish wheel-naves,
come here at will, like winged falcons, to pursue our oblations, o men.
11. Common to them (all) is their unguent; their brilliants glint on
their arms.
Their spears keep flashing.
12. These mighty bulls with mighty arms do not arrange (such things just)  on their bodies:
taut bows and weapons are on your chariots, beauties on your faces.
13. Of them whose name is vibrant and widespread like a flood, there is just  one (name) for each and every one of them to enjoy.
Their might is like the life force of their fathers.
1070 VIII.20
14. Extol these Maruts; praise them. For of these boisterous ones, as of wheel-spokes, there is no last one. This is so as to their giving; as  to their greatness is this so.
15. Very fortunate is he who was amid your forms of help at earlier  dawnings, o Maruts,
or who will be also now.
16. Or the prize-seeker whose oblations you come here to pursue, o men. He will attain to your favors, you shakers, along with brilliant things  and the winning of prizes.
17. Just as they wish, so shall it be—they,
the sons of Rudra, lord of heaven, the ritual adepts, the youths,
18. The Maruts of good drops who deserve (the soma-drink) and who go  about practicing generosity all together.
With a better heart even than this [=usual generosity], o youths, turn  yourselves hither toward us.
19. To the youths, to the bulls, the pure ones, sing with your newest hymn, o  Sobhari,
like a plowman to his cows [/celebrating (the Maruts) like cows].
20. Those who are victorious like a fist-fighter, to be invoked in all contests,  among (all) Hotars,
those, like lustrous bulls, receiving the most praises—extol them with a  hymn: the Maruts, yes!
21. Cows also, likewise akin through common birth, o Maruts of equal  spirit,
lick each other’s humps.
22. The mortal also will draw near to brotherhood with you, you dancers  with brilliants on your breasts.
Take note of us, Maruts, for your firmly founded friendship exists  always.
23. O Maruts of good drops, convey here to us (some) of your Marut  medicine,
you comrades in the span.
24. Those with which you aid the Sindhu, with which you triumph, with  which you favor Krivi,
with those kindly forms of help be a joy to us, you who are joy itself,  you who do not partner hatred.
25. O Maruts possessing good ritual grass—what medicine is in the Sindhu,  what in the Asiknī, what in the seas,
what in the mountains, 26. Seeing it, you carry it all on your bodies. With it intercede for us. To ground (should go) the malady of the afflicted; make what has gone  awry right again.
## 21 (641) Indra (1–16), Citra’s Dānastuti (17–18)
Sobhari Kāṇva
18 verses: kakubh alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn ends with a brief dānastuti to king Citra (vss. 17–18) and begins with a  pun on his name: in verse 1 Indra is described as citrá “brilliant.” In between the  poet ponders the various different relationships that he and his people might have  with Indra, deploying a surprising range of terminology: “comrade” (vss. 2, 8, 14,  15), “kin” (vs. 4), “rival” (vs. 13), “friend” (vs. 13), and “father” (vs. 14). Amid the  standard invitations to the soma sacrifice (e.g., vss. 3, 5) and praise of Indra’s quali
ties (e.g., vs. 10), the poet depicts himself and his people as previously deprived of  Indra (vs. 7), but as possessing hopes and visions of the god’s entering into rela tionship with them (see esp. vs. 6), and he imagines what they could achieve if this  relationship were activated (vss. 11–12). The stress on the 1st plural “we” (including  Indra along with the mortals) and on “our” states of mind is highly unusual in  R̥gvedic poetry.
The poet’s conception of possible relationships develops in even more unpredict able ways toward the end of the hymn. The pragātha strophe consisting of verses  13–14 begins strikingly by calling Indra friendless, and continues in verse 14 with a  brief and idiosyncratic characterization of some who don’t have relationships with  Indra. The following pragātha (vss. 15–16) urges “us” not to miss our own chance  with Indra, with a noteworthy comparison of “our” potentially damaging lack of  activity to that of aging spinsters.
Thus, though much of the hymn contains conventional Indra-hymn material,  there is a distinct “psychological” tinge to the poet’s depiction of the interaction of  his group with Indra. This depiction of an emotional bond between the worshipers  and the deity makes the abrupt transition to the dānastuti all the more surprising,  especially because the dānastuti seems to belittle Indra’s giving in comparison to  King Citra’s.
1. O you without precedent—we, seeking help like people carrying
something massive,
call upon you, the brilliant, in the prize contest.
2. That powerful youth of ours—in his daring—strode right up to you for  help in action,
for it is just you that we, your comrades, have chosen as the helper who  brings gain, o Indra.
1072 VIII.21
3. Drive here. Here are the drops, o lord of horses, lord of cows, lord of  fields.
Drink the soma, soma-lord.
4. Because we inspired poets without (such) kin hold fast to you who have  (those [=horses, etc.] as kin, o Indra,
come here with all of them, which are your deposits, to drink the soma,  o bull.
5. Like birds (in a tree), sitting by your exhilarating, strengthening honey  prepared with cows,
we keep bellowing to you, o Indra.
6. When we address you with this homage, will you hesitate even for a  moment?
Here are desires, and you are the giver, o possessor of the fallow bays.  Here are we; here are our visions.
7. Only recently have we come together with your help, Indra, for  previously, o master of the stones,
we have not known your abundance.
8. We (now) know your comradeship and sustenance, o champion. We beg  these of you, o wielder of the mace.
And so make us sharp, good one, whenever a prize of cattle is (at  stake), o you of beautiful lips.
9. Who previously led us to this better state right here, him shall I praise  on your behalf,
o comrades, for his help—Indra,
10. Possessor of the fallow bays, lord of settlements, conquering territories.  Because as ever it is he who has reached exhilaration,
the bounteous one will pursue for us, his praisers, a hundred in cattle  and horses.
11. Surely with you as our yokemate, o bull, we could talk back to the snorter at the concourse of the people possessing cattle.
12. As decisive actors, we could be victorious in the decisive action, o  much-invoked one; we could stand up to those of evil vision.
With our superior men we could smash the obstacle [/Vr̥tra] and swell  with strength. O Indra, you have pursued our visions.
13. You are without rival, but by the same token, without friend, Indra, by  birth and from of old.
Only in battle do you seek friendship.
14. You never take on a rich man for companionship. The booze-fueled  revile you.
When you make your roar, you just shove (them all) together. It is  because of that that you are called on like a father. 15. When we are in companionship with one such as you, Indra, let us not,  like foolish (spinsters) who grow old at home,
(just) sit still when (the soma) has been pressed.
16. Let us not miss out on your largesse, you whose gift is cattle. Indra, let  us not complain about you.
Seize hold of even the firmly fixed (goods) of the stranger and bring  them here. Those who receive your gifts are not to be swindled.
17. Is it Indra (who gives) so great a bounty, or well-portioned Sarasvatī who gives the goods?
Or is it you, o Citra, (who give) to the pious man?
18. Citra is the only king; the other petty little ones who (live) along the  Sarasvatī are only kinglets—
for like Parjanya with rain, he will thunder [/stretch forth] as he gives a  thousand ten thousands.
## 22 (642) Aśvins
Sobhari Kāṇva
18 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī 1–7; anuṣṭubh 8; kakubh alternating with  satobrhat ̥ ī 9–10, 13–18; kakubh 11; madhyejyotis 12, all arranged in pragāthas.
The metrical complexity of this hymn is not matched by corresponding complexity  of content. The hymn focuses especially on the chariot of the Aśvins, as well as on  their journey to us, the sacrifice with which we will welcome them, and the multi form aid we hope for in return.
Nonetheless there are a few striking images and turns of phrase, particularly in  verse 6 where the Aśvins “plow barley with a wolf,” an expression that cannot be sep arated from the similar one in I.117.21, likewise an Aśvin hymn, where they “scatter  barley with a wolf.” Starting with Yaska (6.26), the “wolf” has regularly been identi fied as a type of plow, though this recourse to agricultural technology could be taken  as a reductive attempt to explain away the wondrous nature of the Aśvins’ feats—here  perhaps their ability to harness the power of a dangerous and semi-wild beast for a  civilizing task. On the wolf as a cross-category in the Vedic conceptual universe, situ ated between the wild and the civilized and partaking of both, see Jamison (2008b).
1. I have called here this most wondrous chariot for help today,
the one that you mounted for Sūryā, o Aśvins easy to call, you who
follow the course of the Rudras [=Maruts]—
2. (The chariot) that is first to bring prosperity [?], that is easy to call,  eagerly sought by many, enjoyable, first in the prize-contests,
accompanied by favors, free of hatred, and without fault, o Sobhari.1074 VIII.22
3. These two gods who most often appear in many places, the Aśvins— with our acts of reverence
may we bring them here nearby for help: they go to the house of the  pious man.
4. One wheel of your chariot speeds around; the other, (though) at rest,  drives you onward.
Let your favor run to us here, like a cow (to its calf), o lords of beauty.
5. Your chariot with its three chariot-boxes and golden reins, o Aśvins, the famous one that busily circles around heaven and earth—with that,  come here, o Nāsatyas.
6. Rendering service to Manu, early in the day you plow barley with a wolf. O Aśvins, lords of beauty, today we would praise you together with  your favors.
7. O you whose goods are prizewinning mares, drive right up to us along  the paths of truth,
along which you spur Tr̥kṣi, son of Trasadasyu, for great sovereignty,  o bulls.
8. Here is the soma pressed for you with stones, o you men with  bullish goods.
Drive here to drink the soma; drink it in the house of the pious man.
9. Ascend onto the chariot, into the golden (chariot-)cask, o Aśvins with  bullish goods,
and so hitch up refreshments rich in fat.
10. With those (forms of help) with which you help Paktha, with which  Adhrigu, with which Babhru deprived of pleasure,
with these come to us right away and swiftly, o Aśvins. Heal what is ailing.
11. When we Adhrigus call upon the Aśvins, the two Adhrigu [/who are not  poor], at this very time of day—
we expressing admiration with our hymns—
12. With those (forms of help) drive here, o bulls, right to my call, which  brings all good things and all that is worth desiring—
(drive here) with refreshment, as the most bounteous ones who most  often appear in many places—with those (forms of help) with which  they [=the Maruts?] strengthened Krivi, with those come here.
13. To these two at this very time of the days, to these Aśvins do I appeal,  celebrating them,
and these two do we beseech with our acts of reverence—
14. Just these two in the evening, these two lords of beauty at dawn, and  these two who follow the course of the Rudras [=Maruts] on their  journey. Don’t look over and beyond us to a cheating mortal, o Rudras whose  goods are prizewinning mares.
15. In the early morning I call their easily moving (chariot) to move easily  here, or (rather I call) the overpowering Aśvins along with their
chariot—
I, Śobharī, like a father.
16. With (your chariot) swift as thought, o bulls roused to exuberance, with  your forms of help that come quickly,
even from far away come to be here for our help with your many (forms  of help), you who bring many benefits.
17. O Aśvins, you superior men who are first to drink the honey, to us here  drive your course providing horses,
cattle, and gold, o wondrous ones.
18. An abundance of good heroes, of good standing and well in advance,  desirable, unassailable by the demonic,
and all things of value might we acquire at this journey of yours, o you  whose goods are prize mares.
The next small collection of hymns (VIII.23–26) is attributed to Viśvamanas  Vaiyaśva, with hymns to Agni (VIII.23), Indra (VIII.24), Mitra and Varuṇa  (VIII.25), and the Aśvins and Vāyu (VIII.26). The names Vyaśva and its patro nymic Vaiyaśva occur several times in these hymns, as does the name of the patron  (Varo) Suṣāman, and the hymns are also characterized by the almost exclusive use  of the uṣṇih meter (8 8 12). See Oldenberg (1888: 211–13).
## 23 (643) Agni
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva
30 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥
The poet begins the hymn by urging himself to perform his sacrificial tasks (vss.  1–2ab), ending this little section with vocatives addressed to himself but seem ingly designed to identify himself with his divine target Agni: “belonging to all  domains” is often an epithet of Agni (as well as of Indra) and “having all in  mind” (viśvámanas) could be a divine descriptor. However, at least according to  the Anukramaṇī, it is the poet’s own name, and he then (vs. 2c) speaks in his own  1st-person voice. This interactive quality is prominent throughout the hymn. The  poet’s self-address returns in verse 24, and in between he also addresses in the 2nd person plural the assembled priests and worshipers, on whose behalf he is work ing (vss. 7–9; see esp. 9a, where he calls them “seekers of the truth”). (On poetic  self-address see Jamison 2009a.) Agni’s role in this social context, as clanlord of
1076 VIII.23
clans, is also emphasized (vss. 10, 13–14, 20). Manu, the mythical founder of the  larger Ārya sacrificial community known as the “descendants of Manu,” is also  duly remembered (vss. 13, 17, 25–26), as are the mythical seer Uśanā Kāvya (vs.  17) and the poet’s immediate ancestor, the seer Vyaśva (vss. 16, 23), whose devo
tion to Agni and lucrative relationship with his patron, Ukṣan, merit mention and  provide a model for Vaiyaśva’s own gentle hint to his patron Varo Suṣāman (vs.  28). Thus the poet situates his praise of the god and his requests to him in a web of  social relations and mutual dependency pertaining both in the current time and in  the long history of the descendants of Manu.
Both the praise and the requests follow the common tropes of the genre, though  often nicely executed. The focus is on Agni as the messenger of the gods and as  the carrier of our oblations to them. Some of the tr̥cas show thematic or syntactic  unity (e.g., vss. 13–15 against demons and cheats), but the tr̥ca structure is not  prominent, and there are bridges across tr̥cas (e.g., the messenger theme in vss.  18–19).
1. Reverently invoke him to receive (our offerings); sacrifice to Jātavedas, possessing curling smoke and flames that cannot be grasped,
2. To Agni the giver, with your hymn, o you common to all domains, who  have all in mind [/Viśvamanas (=the poet)].
And I shall praise the competitors [=flames], (drivers) of chariots,
3. Whose onward thrust, worthy of verses, (aims) to seize refreshments and  nourishments.
By close searching the driver [=Agni] finds the goods.
4. His flame has stood up and outward, the unaging flame of the
shining one,
of the very bright one of scorching fang, the glory of a warrior band. 5. Stand up with your divine body while you are being praised, o you who  conduct good ceremonies,
with your gaze (on us), blazing with your lofty radiance.
6. O Agni, drive (to the gods) with our good lauds, pouring oblations in  yourself in the proper sequence,
as you have become our oblation-carrying messenger.
7. I call upon Agni on your behalf, the foremost Hotar of the settled  domains.
I shall hymn him with this speech, and I shall praise him for you all,
8. Him of unerring will, whom, together with his body, they sweeten with  their sacrifices,
him, like an ally, well established among the people who abide in truth. 9. O you (people) who seek truth—in him abiding in truth, bringing success  to the sacrifice with our hymn,
in him do they [=the gods] take pleasure, in the footprint of our homage. 10. Let our sacrifices come in unbroken sequence here to the best of the  Aṅgirases,
who is the most glorious Hotar here among the clans.
11. O unaging Agni, these (flames) of yours, being kindled as lofty light, are displaying their power like bullish horses.
12. O lord of nourishments, give us wealth with an abundance of heroes. Further us in combats when progeny and posterity are at stake.
13. When the clanlord, whetted, is well pleased in the clan of Manu,
Agni repels all demonic powers.
14. O Agni, in harkening to my new praise song, you clanlord and hero, with your searing heat burn down the wily demons.
15. Not by any wile should a cheating mortal be master of him
who offers ritual service to Agni with gifts of oblations.
16. The seer Vyaśva, seeking bulls [/Ukṣan (=his patron)], pleased you, the  finder of goods.
For great wealth might we kindle you.
17. Uśanā Kāvya set you down as Hotar—
you to win (goods) by sacrifice for Manu as Jātavedas.
18. Because all the gods, altogether, made you their messenger,
by harkening (to them), o god, you became the first one worthy of the  sacrifice.
19. This same immortal should the mortal, the hero, make his messenger— the pure one of extensive power whose course is black.
20. With ladles extended, we would call upon him of good radiance and  blazing flame,
the unaging and ancient Agni, to be invoked by the clans.
21. The mortal who has dedicated a poured offering with gifts of
oblations to him
receives abundant prosperity and glory in heroes.
22. (It goes) first toward Agni Jātavedas, foremost at the sacrifices— the ladle full of the oblation goes with homage.
23. Like Vyaśva, we would do honor to Agni with these most distinguished  (thoughts),
to him of blazing flame with most munificent thoughts.
24. Now chant to him of extensive power with praise songs like sturdy  posts [/like Sthūrayūpa],
o seer, son of Vyaśva—to the Agni of the household.
25. Him, the guest of the descendants of Manu, the son of the forest-lords  [=trees],
ancient Agni do the inspired priests reverently invoke for help.
1078 VIII.24
26. Because he, the great one, is superior to all, (let) the oblations of the  descendants of Manu (also be) superior.
O Agni, sit down on the ritual grass with homage.
27. Win for us many desirable things. Win of the wealth eagerly sought  by many—
accompanied by good heroes, offspring, and glory.
28. O Agni, give the impetus to generosity to Varo Suṣāman and to his  people,
each and every one, always—o youngest good one.
29. For you are the furtherer. Uncover for us refreshments consisting of cows and the winning of great wealth, o Agni.
30. Agni, you are glorious. Convey Mitra and Varuṇa here,
the sovereign kings possessing the truth and of refined skill.
## 24 (644) Indra
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva
30 verses: uṣṇih (except anuṣṭubh 30), arranged in trcas ̥
The first twenty-seven verses of this hymn are dedicated to Indra, while the final  tr̥ca (vss. 28–30) is a dānastuti of the patron Varo Suṣāman, with Dawn the divinity  addressed because of her association with the distribution of the priestly gift. The  first two verses of the dānastuti are unexceptional in diction and tone, but the last  verse (30) contains puns and neologisms, as often in dānastutis.
The rest of the hymn contains fairly standard praise of Indra, with special  emphasis on his generosity—rā́dhas “generosity” is something of a signature word  in the hymn, occurring six times—though his powers do not go unmentioned. The  need to praise Indra to stimulate his giving is also a recurrent motif in the hymn,  and the poet calls upon both himself (sometimes by name) and his companions to  provide that praise (see, e.g., vss. 1, 14, 19, 22–23). Such interactivity was also char
acteristic of the preceding hymn (VIII.23) to Agni.
The hymn consists of tr̥cas, but there is little unity within most of these triplets;  instead, there are a number of instances of cross-tr̥ca transitions (see, e.g., vss. 3/4,  6/7, 9/10). The poet also makes considerable use of alliteration and, especially, of  pairing derivationally related words. Verse 10 provides a particularly fine example  of the latter practice.
1. Comrades, we direct our formulation to Indra who bears the mace— I shall praise him on your behalf—to the most manly, bold one.
2. For you are famed because of your swelling might and, as Vr̥tra-smasher,  because of your Vr̥tra-smashing [/obstacle-smashing].
With your bounties you outdo the bounteous ones in piety, o champion. 3. Being praised, bring here to us wealth that offers most brilliant fame— you who are exclusively the good giver, o master of the fallow bays.
4. Tear out what is exclusive and dear to the peoples, Indra.
Being praised, bring it here boldly, bold one.
5. Hindrances obstruct neither your left nor your right hand,
nor do repulsions, o master of the fallow bays, in your quests for
cattle.
6. I fit you out with my songs, as a pen with cows, o master of the stones. Fulfill the desire and the mind of the singer.
7. All these things of the one who has all in mind [/Viśvamanas
(=poet)]—o best Vr̥tra-smasher—
study them well though our insight, o forceful leader, o good one.
8. O Vr̥tra-smasher, o champion, might we know of this newer,
eagerly sought generosity of yours, o good one, much-invoked.
9. For, Indra, just as for you there exists a swelling might that cannot be  encompassed, o dancer,
your giving to the pious man cannot be impaired, o
much-invoked one.
10. Rain yourself down, o you who are greater than great, o best of men,  for great generosity.
Being yourself steadfast, stand fast, bounteous one, for bounteous
giving.
11. Never have our hopes gone to any other place than you, o master of the  stones.
Bounteous one, exert your ability for us with your help.
12. For surely I do not find any other than you, for generosity, o dancer, for wealth, for brilliance, and for swelling might, o you who long
for songs.
13. Pour here the drop for Indra: he will drink the somian honey.
He will spur himself on in his generosity and greatness.
14. I have addressed the lord of the fallow bays as he engorges his skill. Now listen to the son of Aśva as he praises.
15. For surely never before has a greater hero than you been born,
neither in wealth—not in just such a way (as you are)—nor in favor.
16. (Pour) right here what is more invigorating than honey, or pour,  Adhvaryu, (what is more invigorating) than the stalk,
for in this way the ever-strengthening hero is praised.
17. O Indra, mounter of the fallow bays, none has reached up to your  foremost praise hymn
in swelling strength nor in favor.
1080 VIII.24
18. Seeking fame, we have called upon the lord of prizes on your behalf,  (comrades,)
upon him who is to be strengthened by unremitting sacrifices.
19. Come now! Comrades, let us praise Indra, the superior man worthy of  praise,
who all alone surmounts all the separate peoples.
20. For the heaven-ruling one who does not withhold cattle, who seeks  cattle, speak a wondrous speech,
sweeter than ghee and honey,
21. For him whose heroic deeds are immeasurable, whose generosity is not  to be circumscribed,
whose priestly gift surmounts everything, like light.
22. Like Vyaśva, praise Indra, who controls the prizewinning (horse) that  rides the wave,
liberally apportioning the property of the stranger to the pious man. 23. In just this way now, o Vaiyaśva, praise him anew [/to the nines, and  then] a tenth time—
the one who knows well, worthy to be celebrated by those who roam. 24. For you know how to avoid calamities day after day, o you with mace  in hand,
as a preener [=water bird] does snares.
25. Bring that help here, Indra, with which, o most wondrous one, (you are  there) for the (ritually) active man.
Once again pierce (Śuṣṇa?) for Kutsa and force (him) down.
26. We beg you now for a new (life?) for an older (man), o most  wondrous one.
You are victorious over all our antagonists—
27. (You, the one) who releases (us) from the bear and from constraint or  who (releases constraint) from the Ārya amid the seven rivers.
You have made the Dāsa’s weapon bow, o you of powerful manliness.
28. Just as you conveyed wealth to Varo Suṣāman for his gain
and to the Vyaśvas, o well-portioned (Dawn) rich in
prizewinning mares,
29. (Even so) let the priestly gift of Nārya come to the Vyaśvas, who  provide soma,
as well as substantial generosity in hundreds and thousands.
30. When the sacrificer will ask you: “Where (is he), you where-actor?” (you will answer:) “This ‘Vala’ [=the patron Varo Suṣāman], who is set  apart, is descending toward the Gomatī (River) [/pen full of cows].” VIII.25 (645) Mitra and Varuṇa (1–9, 13–24) and the All Gods  (10–12)
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva
24 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas ̥
The only hymn in Maṇḍala VIII ostensibly devoted to Mitra and Varuṇa, it keeps  its focus on these two gods only during the first part of the hymn (vss. 1–9), which  celebrates them as sovereign kings possessing the truth. Starting in verse 10 other  gods join the group besought for help and protection. In particular the Sun, as a  representative of the Ādityas, is the main subject of two tr̥cas (vss. 16–21). The final  verses of the hymn (starting with vs. 19) turn their attention to the sacrificial setting.  A simile concerning the ritual fire in verse 19 serves as a transition to this scene,  and an address to the Sun in verse 21, which introduces the poet’s “benefactors,”  likewise produces a transition to the final tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), a dānastuti praising the  gift of several horses and a chariot.
Although the thematic structure of the hymn roughly tracks the arrangement  in tr̥cas, the tr̥cas do not have strong internal cohesion, and there is relatively little  verbal unity within them.
1. To you two, the herdsmen of all, the gods worthy of the sacrifice among  the gods,
truth-possessing and of refined skill, shall I sacrifice.
2. They are like two charioteers along the (home) stretch (of a
racecourse), the two allies [=mitras], Mitra and Varuṇa, who is of  strong will,
both well-born descendants from of old, whose commandments are  upheld.
3. Their mother, great truth-possessing Aditi, gave birth
to the two who possess all possessions, whose greatness (goes) forward to  lordship.
4. Great Mitra and Varuṇa, sovereign kings, gods and lords [/devas and  asuras],
truth-possessing, loudly sound their lofty truth.
5. The two grandsons of great strength, the sons of skill, strong-willed, possessing fat drops, dwell in the house of refreshment.
6. You two who control the drops, the earthly and heavenly refreshments— let your cloud-accompanied rains drift here.
7. The two who from lofty heaven look down upon (us) as if upon
your herds,
the truth-possessing ones were installed as sovereign kings for reverence.
1082 VIII.25
8. Truth-possessing, strong-willed, the two took their place for sovereign  kingship.
Their commandments upheld, the rulers attained their rule.
9. Better even than the eye at finding the way, by means of eyesight  without motes,
even when blinking, the two attentive ones remain attentive.
10. And let the goddess Aditi, let the two Nāsatyas [=Aśvins] give us room; let the Maruts, whose strength has increased, give room.
11. You (all) of good drops—give room to our roar by day and by night. Not suffering harm, might we be accompanied by protectors.
12. Not suffering harm, we (sing) to Viṣṇu of good drops who does  not smite.
Listen, o River traveling your own course, (for us) to be first in your  thought.
13. We choose what is worth choosing, the best choice, worthy of protection, which Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman protect.
14. And that (let) the River among the waters (grant) to us, that (grant) the  Maruts, that the Aśvins,
and Indra and Viṣṇu—the generous ones of one accord.
15. For these superior men strike against the hostility of any zealot, like roiling (rivers) their sharp surge.
16. This (Sun) here, as clanlord, gazes widely—the one (gazing) over  the many.
We proceed according to his commandments and yours [=Ādityas’]. 17. We follow the ancient accustomed ways of the one [=the Sun]  associated with the sovereign kings [=Ādityas],
the long-heard commandments of Mitra and of Varuṇa.
18. He who measured on every side the ends of heaven and of earth with  his ray,
he filled both world-halves with his greatness.
19. This Sun held up his light under the shelter of heaven,
blazing like fire when it has been kindled and bepoured.
20. The speech at (the place) providing a long seat [=ritual ground] gains  control over a prize rich in cattle;
it gains control over non-poisonous food for giving.
21. I speak this to the Sun and to both world-halves, at evening and  at dawn:
“Always rise up to us among our benefactors.”
22. A silvery (horse) at Ukṣaṇyāyana’s (sacrifice), a silver one at Harayāṇa’s, and a yoked chariot at Suṣāman’s—these have we gained. 23. These two are overflowing with (bounties) of horses, with fallow bays,  for me;
and the two (horses) that carry men (are overflowing) with those that  get results.
24. With my newest inspired thought I have gained two altogether, along  with their reins and with their whips,
two chargers great at the winning of prizes.

Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva or Vyaśva Āṅgirasa
25 verses: uṣṇih, except gāyatrī 16–19, 21, 25 and anuṣṭubh 20, arranged in trcas, with ̥ an extra verse, 19, at the end of the Aśvin sequence
A long and rather repetitive hymn. The first nineteen verses are dedicated to the Aśvins  and, as usual, urge them to drive their chariot to our sacrifice and to give us goods in  return. There is little novel to capture the audience; the most striking image is found in  verse 13: the unnamed god Agni, dressed in sacrifices like a bride in her wedding finery.
The final six verses belong to Vāyu, deified Wind, another god associated with  the early-morning sacrifice, who receives the first soma drink there. He too is called  to make the journey to our sacrifice and reward us for our offerings. He is twice (vss.  21, 22)  designated as the son-in-law of Tvaṣṭar, the fashioner god—a somewhat  surprising identification, given the tangled marital situation of Tvaṣṭar’s daughter  as tantalizingly sketched in X.17.1–2—where Vāyu is not in the picture.
1. I call your chariot for joint praise among our patrons,
o you of invincible skill, you bulls who bring bullish goods.
2. O Nāsatyas, to Varo Suṣāman for his great extension
do you drive with your help, you bulls who bring bullish goods.
3. We call you today with our oblations, you who bring prizewinning mares  as goods,
as you become refreshed on the many refreshments beyond the nights.
4. Let your famed chariot, the best conveyor, drive here, o Aśvins,
superior men.
(Then) you shall look closely at the praise songs of the powerful one for  splendor.
5. Even as you follow your meandering course, you should turn your mind  here, o Aśvins, who bring bullish goods,
for (then) you two, o Rudras, shall deliver (us) beyond hatreds.
6. For you two wondrous ones fly around the whole (world) in proper  sequence with your prompt (horses),
as those who quicken our insight, as the honey-colored lords of beauty.1084 VIII.26
7. Drive right up to us, o Aśvins, together with all-prospering wealth, as unbudgeable bounteous ones, bringing good heroes.
8. You two—come here to receive this (offering) of mine, Indra and  Nāsatyas—
as two gods joined in greatest delight with the gods today.
9. Because we call upon you, (we) seeking bulls like Vyaśva seeking Ukṣan  (his patron),
come here with your favors, o inspired poets.
10. Praise the Aśvins, o seer. Surely they will listen to your call
and burn up the niggards very nearby?
11. Listen to the son of Vyaśva, you two superior men, and you will know  of this (offering) of mine,
as two of one accord, (you and) Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman.
12. O holy ones, out of what is given by you and what is brought by you, do your best for me along with my patrons day after day, o bulls.
13. The one who is swathed in sacrifices for you, like a bride in her  (wedding) dress—
serving (him [=Agni]), the Aśvins have made (him) to be beautiful— 14. (Agni,) who will watch over your (circuit) of broadest extent, protective  of men.
Drive around your circuit, seeking us.
15. For us drive your circuit protective of men, you who bring
bullish goods.
As if mounting (a chariot) facing many directions, you have conveyed  the sacrifice with our hymn.
16. Our praise song, best of calls at conveying, calls you as our  messenger, o men.
Let it be for you, o Aśvins.
17. Whether you find exhilaration yonder in the flood of heaven or in the  house of refreshment,
listen just to me, immortal ones.
18. And this one, driving brightly, best of rivers at conveying,
the Sindhu River with her golden track—
19. Together with this good praise and bright insight
do you travel, o Aśvins driving beautifully.
20. Yoke the two that power the chariot; team up the two flourishing  (horses), o good one.
After that, drink our honey, o Vāyu; come to our pressings.
21. O Vāyu, unerring lord of truth, son-in-law of Tvaṣṭar—yours are the forms of help we choose. 22. The son-in-law of Tvaṣṭar, the lord of wealth, do we beseech for  wealth—
as the people who provide the pressed soma (we beseech) Vāyu for
brilliant things.
23. Kindly Vāyu, journey here from heaven. Drive your good horse-flesh; drive from great (heaven) the two broad-winged (horses) at the chariot. 24. For we call you to the seats of men (to be) the first to attain delight (as we call) the horse-backed pressing stone—(call you) along with your  munificence.
25. O god Vāyu, as the first to find exhilaration with your mind,
make prizes, waters, and insights for us.
The next group of hymns (27–31) is attributed to Manu Vaivasvata and consists of  four hymns to the All Gods, followed by a very interesting praise of the Sacrificer  and his Wife, the only direct mention of this latter figure in the R̥gveda. On the  group see Oldenberg (1888: 215).
## 27 (647) All Gods
Manu Vaivasvata
22 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn to the All Gods falls roughly into three parts on the basis of the gods  addressed. The first eight verses contain a number of named gods, whose associa tions seem random, rather than ordered into the usual functional groups—with, for  example, the Maruts mentioned next to the Ādityas, singly or jointly, or to Agni.  In contrast to this jumble of divine names, the middle section (vss. 9–14) mentions  no gods except Savitar (vs. 12), and he is in service of the unnamed plural “you”  used of the gods as a corporate entity. The unity and superimposability of the vari ous gods in this section is made clear in verses 13–14. The final section (vss. 15–22)  mentions only the Ādityas, though in fact they appear only in verses 15, 17, and 22.
Despite these differences in divine address, the hymn is unified by its concerns,  especially the desire for protection and shelter offered by the gods (see, e.g., vss. 4,  9, 20), and by its vocabulary—in particular the epithet viśvá-vedas “affording all  possessions” (vss. 2, 4, 11, 19, 20, 21) or, according to others, “having all knowledge,  which is a near phonological match to víśve devā́ḥ “All Gods,” to whom the hymn is  dedicated. The ritual context is also very much present in the hymn.
On the basis of verse 12 and the sketch of Savitar’s functions there, Geldner  suggests that this is an evening hymn. But later in the hymn the poet insistently  mentions various times of day (vss. 19–21), and so it seems rather that he is seeking  the aid and protection of the gods round-the-clock, as it were.
1086 VIII.27
The language of the hymn is fairly simple and straightforward, and the lexicon  often repetitive. But the effect is pleasing, and the poem hardly deserves Renou’s  judgment (EVP IV: 106) that it is “banal” and “facile.”
1. Agni has been set in front while the solemn speech (is being recited), as  have the pressing stones and the ritual grass while the ceremony (is
going forth).
With a verse I implore the Maruts, Brahmaṇaspati, and the gods for  help worthy to be chosen.
2. Here I have sung the (sacrificial) animal, the earth, the trees, Dawn and  Night, the plants.
And do you all, good ones affording all possessions, become furtherers  of our poetic insights.
3. Let our ceremony go forth first to Agni among the gods,
forth to the Ādityas, to Varuṇa of firm commandments, to the
all-radiant Maruts,
4. For they all, affording all possessions, caring for the stranger, will be  there for Manu, to increase him.
With invulnerable protectors, you who afford all possessions—hold out  to us shelter that keeps the wolf away.
5. Come to us here today, all of like mind and like delight—
o Maruts, goddess Aditi, great House-Goddess—at our verse and our  song to our seat.
6. Dear are those equine (gifts) of yours and dear to you the oblations to  which you drive, o Maruts and Mitra.
Let Indra, Varuṇa, the powerful men [=Maruts?], (and?) the Ādityas sit  on this ritual grass of ours.
7. We who have ritual grass twisted for you and pleasurable offerings set  out in due order,
who have soma pressed and the fire kindled, like Manu, invoke (you), o  Varuṇa.
8. Drive forth hither, o Maruts, Viṣṇu, Aśvins, Pūṣan, by reason of the  poetic insight belonging to me.
Let Indra drive here first, with those desirous of gain—he who is sung  as the Vr̥tra-smashing bull.
9. O gods without deceit, hold out to us unbroken shelter,
a defense that neither from afar, nor even from nearby will (anyone)
venture against, o good ones.
10. For there exists for you a common birth (with us), you gods who care  for the stranger; there exists friendship.
Commend us for previous good faring; right away (re)commend (us) for  newer favor. 11. Because just now (I have dispatched) a praise invocation to you, just  now for the distribution of desirable goods—
to you who afford all possessions have I, doing homage, dispatched (it)  like a lead(-cow).
12. O you of good guidance, for you has this Savitar, worthy to be chosen,  stood up, erect.
Down have settled the busy two-footed and four-footed, and those that  fly about.
13. Every god among you for help, every god for dominance,
every god for prizewinning would we invoke, singing with poetic insight  (as our) goddess.
14. For the gods, all as one, are of like fervor for Manu, of like generosity. Let them be for us now, let them be in the future for our progeny, the  finders of a wide realm.
15. I recite to you, o you without deceit, at the concourse of praise invocations. No injury (comes) to that mortal who has done honor to your
ordinances, o Varuṇa, Mitra, (and Aryaman).
16. He furthers his dwelling place, ex(tends) his great refreshments, who  does ritual service to your liking.
He is propagated through progeny forth from his foundation.
Unharmed and whole, he thrives.
17. That one acquires without fighting; along (paths) easy to go on he  travels his routes,
whom Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman protect—they of like generosity  and like delight.
18. Even in the flat plain you make a niche for him; even in difficult going  (you make for him) smooth flowing.
Also this missile—it is now far from him—let it go unfaltering to
destruction.
19. Since today as the sun was rising you established truth, o you of dear  dominion,
since at (sun)set, at awakening, or since at midday of the day, you
affording all possessions,
20. Or since at evening, o lords, you held out shelter to the pious man who  pursues truth,
so might we stay nearby you, you good ones affording all possessions,  in your midst.
21. Since today when the sun rose, since at midday, since at the (time of)  covering [=evening?],
you establish a thing of value for Manu the discerning oblator, o you  affording all possessions,
1088 VIII.28–29
22. We would choose this much-protecting (shelter) of yours, o sovereign  kings, as a son would (his father’s shelter).
May we, pouring the oblation, reach that by which we shall reach a
better (state), o Ādityas.
## 28 (648) All Gods
Manu Vaivasvata
5 verses: gāyatrī, except puraüṣṇih 4
A curious little fragment with no apparent unity, unlike the immediately following  hymn. The common canonical number of gods, thirty-three, is mentioned in verse  1, and these undifferentiated gods are apparently our global protectors in verse 3  and able to attain all their desires in verse 4. Verse 2 mentions an oddly assorted set  of gods: the three principal Ādityas, but also multiple Agnis, and two fairly mar
ginal groups of divinities, the Wives of the Gods and the Gift Escorts. Though verse  2 names the divinities, in contrast to verses 1 and 3–4, it shares the ritual context of  verse 1, which is lacking in the two following verses concerning the gods in general.
The final verse (5) is in the same riddling style as the following hymn (VIII.29),  though in a different meter, and its vocabulary invites the identification of the  “seven” as the Maruts (called thrice seven in I.133.6), especially since they are not  found in the following hymn.
1. The gods, three beyond thirty, who sat down on the ritual grass,
they found and once again they gained.
2. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, the Agnis with the Gift Escorts,
along with the Wives (of the Gods), are those to whom the
vaṣaṭ-cry is made.
3. These are our herdsmen to the west, these to the north, these likewise to  the south,
to the east—through their whole clan.
4. As the gods desire, just so will it be. No one will confound this (desire) of  theirs,
not even a hostile mortal.
5. Of the seven there are seven spears; seven brilliancies are theirs;
seven beauties did they put on.
## 29 (649) All Gods
Manu Vaivasvata or Kaśyapa Mārīca
10 verses: dvipadā virāj (so Anukramaṇī), but really dvipadā satobrhat ̥ ī A very tightly and intricately structured riddle hymn. (See discussion in Jamison  2007: 75–77.) Each short verse (dvipāda satobr̥hatī verses contain only twenty syl lables apiece) identifies a god (or pair of gods) by attributes or behavior, but not by  name—though the referents would be clear to the audience. It is thus, in the first  instance, a list hymn. However, the poet has devised a method to endow the list  template with both internal structure and forward momentum. In second position  of each of the verses is a numeral. In the first seven verses it is ékaḥ “one,” but verses  8 and 9 have dvā́ “two” and the last verse plural éke “some” or, literally, “the ones,”  so that the verse structure builds through the categories of grammatical number,  culminating in the only plural—though since éke belongs to the same stem as ékaḥ,
there is also a sense of symmetry and return.
There is further structure within the subsections of the hymn. The éka verses,  the first seven in the hymn, show an omphalos structure, with the three middle  verses (3–5) having the identical sequence ... éko bibharti háste “the one bears in his  hand.” The poet plays with number in other ways in this hymn: verse 7, the final  verse containing “one,” begins trī́ṇi ékaḥ “three the one....” The referent is Viṣṇu  and his three strides, so the poet, by introducing a new number, prepares us for our  departure from the singular. Similarly, the next verse, the first with “two,” also con
tains “one”: VIII.29.8a víbhir dvā́ carata ékayā sahá “With the birds the two wander  along with the one” [=the two Aśvins plus Sūryā], with the feminine instrumental  ékayā providing a transition between the “one” verses and the “two” verses.
If we are correct, the lone and climactic plural éke in verse 10 also has a differ ent status from the apparently parallel numerals in the previous verses. As previ ously noted, each riddling verse defines a god, but in this last verse the identity  of the éke is not entirely clear: the Aṅgirases or Atri(s) have been suggested (see  Geldner’s note ad loc.). I would suggest instead that this verse now turns to the  world of men by presenting the poets’ self-identification. The poets themselves (or  their ancestors) are the solution to this final riddle. They draw attention to their  own creative activity (or that of their ancestors), and as often in final verses they  make a sort of meta-reference to the rest of the hymn that precedes this announce ment: it is this same hymn that they are chanting now. At the same time the rigid  poetic parallel structure implicitly claims for the mortal poets the same status as  the gods they have just celebrated, since they are numerically identified in the same  type of riddle as the gods of verses 1–9. In favor of the view that human poets/ ritualists are the subject of verse 10 is the presence of the words árcanta(ḥ)...sā́ma “chanting...melody.” Joining these two words in the same clause seems intended  to evoke the technical terms r´̥ c “verse” (of the R̥gveda) and the sā́man “melody”  (of the Sāmaveda) to which it is set, major components of Vedic ritual utterance,  and therefore to mark the event depicted as a contemporary ritual of the present  Vedic community. “Causing the sun to shine” may ascribe a cosmogonic act to the  original performance of the ritual, or (more likely in our view) simply suggest that  the hymns uttered at the daily dawn ritual actually ensure the rising and shining of  the sun, rather than simply celebrating it.
1090 VIII.30
Thus the poem skillfully combines and balances architectonic structures with  forward, developing movement, and does so in a remarkably economical package.  The development is not only formal, for the order in which the gods are presented  takes us from the here-and-now of the ritual ground (Soma and Agni), through the  mythical space where gods perform deeds that have effects on men (Tvaṣṭar, Indra,  Rudra, Pūṣan), to the airy and heavenly spaces (Viṣṇu, Aśvins and Sūryā, Mitra and  Varuṇa), ending specifically “in heaven” (diví). Yet, despite all this clever machinery,  the hymn wears its structure lightly, and the mechanisms that provide so much plea sure are essentially invisible to the audience.
1. Brown, this one is changeable, a spirited youth; he smears golden  unguent on himself. [=Soma]
2. In the womb this one has sat down flashing, the wise one among the  gods. [=Agni]
3. An axe this one bears in his hand—a metal one—he firmly founded  among the gods. [=Tvaṣṭar]
4. A mace this one bears in his hand, set there; with it he keeps smashing  obstacles. [=Indra]
5. A sharp thing this one bears in his hand, a weapon—he blazing, strong,  with healing [?] remedies. [=Rudra]
6. The paths this one swells; like a thief he knows of hidden treasures.  [=Pūṣan]
7. Three (strides) this one, wide-going, has stridden, to where the gods  become exhilarated. [=Viṣṇu]
8. With the birds these two wander, along with the one (woman). They go  abroad like exiles. [=Aśvins and Sūryā]
9. A seat these two made for themselves, the two highest in heaven,  sovereign kings, whose potion is melted butter. [=Mitra and Varuṇa]
10. Chanting, these ones thought up a great melody. With it they caused the  sun to shine. [=human poets]
## 30 (650) All Gods
Manu Vaivasvata
4 verses: gāyatrī 1, puraüṣṇih 2, brhat ̥ ī 3, anuṣṭubh 4
The final hymn in this Viśve Devāḥ series consists of four verses in four different  meters, though since they are all different combinations involving eight- and twelve syllable pādas, the difference in meters is not jarring. Much more jarring—and,  in our opinion, deliberately so—is the contrast between the slangy and popular  register in verse 1 and the solemn, almost stilted rhetoric of the second verse, which  explicitly represents itself as quoting the first one. The remaining two verses express  conventional prayers for aid and protection, in much the same style as verse 2. 1. “Since there isn’t a little runt among you, gods, nor a little kid,
(you are) all just entirely great.”
2. Thus shall you be praised, you who care for the stranger, who are the  three and thirty,
you gods who deserve the sacrifice of Manu.
3. Protect us; help us; speak on our behalf.
Do not lead us far away from the path of the fathers, of the sons of
Manu, into the distance.
4. O gods, all of you who are here and belonging to all men—
to us hold out extensive shelter, and to our cattle and horse.
## 31 (651) Yajamāna + Patnı̄[Praise of Offering and Laud of  the Sacrificer 1–4; Household 5–9; Blessings for the Household  Pair 10–18]
Manu Vaivasvata
18 verses: gāyatrī 1–8, 10–13; anuṣṭubh 9, 14; paṅkti 15–18
This last hymn of the small Manu Vaivasvata collection shows its composite nature  by its length, its mixture of meters, and, especially, by its themes. The first nine  verses contain two parallel treatments of the same subject; verses 10–14 seem  unconnected both with what precedes and what follows, and resemble some of the  disordered All God sequences in earlier Manu Vaivasvata hymns (VIII.27.1–8 and  VIII.28) in calling on an odd assortment of gods for protection; the final four verses  (15–18) return to the topic of the beginning of the hymn, the benefits accruing to  the punctilious sacrificer, though in rather general terms.
The beginning of the hymn, especially verses 5–9, are of extraordinary rit ual interest, for they contain the only clear reference to the participation of the  Sacrificer’s Wife in R̥gvedic ritual—participation which is, in our view, a ritual  innovation in the late R̥gveda. (For indirect references to her presence in R̥gvedic  ritual, see Jamison 2011 and forthcoming a and b, and discussion ad VIII.33.) As  the Anukramaṇī states, verses 5–9 are dedicated to the “household pair” (dámpatī),  who are depicted as jointly participating in soma preparation (vs. 5). Their rewards  are great and appropriately domestic (see esp. vs. 8). Indeed, the mention of the  “milk-mixture” (āśír, vs. 5) makes it quite likely that the ritual depicted is the Third  Pressing, itself likely a ritual innovation, found only among certain R̥gvedic clans,  the pressing in which the participation of the Sacrificer’s Wife is particularly promi
nent in later śrauta ritual (see Jamison 1996a: 126–46). The first four verses of the  hymn mention only the Sacrificer, with no mention of the Wife, but a reference to  the milk-mixture in verse 2 and to the benefits to his house (vs. 4) makes it likely  that these four verses treat the same topic, though without the radical overt mention  of the Wife.
1092 VIII.31
The Anukramaṇī considers the final four verses (15–18) to be blessings for the  same household pair (dampatyor āśiṣaḥ), but again there is no overt mention of the  Wife, and, in contrast to verses 1–4 with its reference to the milk-mixture, the ritual  that the successful sacrificer performed is left unclear.
1. Whoever will sacrifice for another and will also sacrifice for himself,  who will press (soma) and will cook (the oblation),
just that formulator will find pleasure of Indra.
2. Whoever will give the offering cake to him and the soma with its  milk-mixture,
able (Indra) will protect just him from difficult straits.
3. His chariot will be brilliant; god-sped, he will swell up,
winning all (the things) of the enemy.
4. In his house inexhaustible Refreshment, possessed of offspring
and milk-cows, gives milk day after day.
5. The household couple who with one mind press and rinse (the soma) with its own proper milk-mixture, o gods,
6. Those two go up against the puffed-up (rival pressers?); united they  attain to the ritual grass.
They do not fade out when prizes (are at stake).
7. Those two do not spurn the favor of the gods, nor seek to conceal it; they seek to win lofty fame.
8. Possessing sons, possessing children they attain a complete lifespan, both decorated with gold.
9. The two whose oblations are worth pursuing, divvying up goods, doing  honor, for the sake of immortality,
they slam together the hairy udder; they perform friendly service to
the gods.
10. We would choose the shelter of the mountains, of the rivers,
of Viṣṇu, who stays by.
11. Let Pūṣan come here, let Wealth, let Fortune, best establishing
well-being and whole(ness),
a broad road toward well-being.
12. (Let) Aramati [/Devotion] (come), (let) every unassailing one with the  mind of a god,
the faultless (gift?) of the Ādityas.
13. Just as Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa are our protectors, (so) are the  paths of truth, which are easy to travel.
14. Agni, the foremost god of the good ones do I invoke for you all with  a hymn—
(I and you all) serving him, dear to many, like an ally who brings
success to the cultivated lands. 15. Quick is the chariot of the one with god on his side, or a champion in  battles of every sort.
– Just he who, as sacrificer, seeks to attain the mind of the gods will
surpass non-sacrificers.
16. You suffer no harm, o sacrificer, nor do you, o presser, nor you, o seeker  of the gods.
– Just he who, as sacrificer, seeks to attain the mind of the gods will
surpass non-sacrificers.
17. Because of his (ritual) work no one can catch up to him, nor send him  away, nor keep him away.
– Just he who, as sacrificer, seeks to attain the mind of the gods will

18. There will be (a mass) of good heroes here and also (a mass) of swift  horses.
– Just he who, as sacrificer, seeks to attain the mind of the gods will
surpass non-sacrificers.
Hymns 32–34 form a small collection, with all three hymns devoted to Indra, and  frequently mentioning the Kaṇvas internally (and attributed by the Anukramaṇī to  three different Kāṇva poets). See Oldenberg (1888: 215).
## 32 (652) Indra
Medhātithi Kāṇva
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged for the most part in trcas ̥
The hymn begins with a call to the Kaṇva poets to praise Indra’s great deeds, and  the next two verses (2–3) provide a quick catalogue of Indra’s victories over several  of his lesser known opponents. This theme, with some of the same names/epithets,  returns at the end of the hymn (esp. vss. 25–27). In between we find the usual twin  exhortations to Indra—to come to our soma sacrifice (rather than that of others;  see esp. vss. 21–22) and to give us wealth and aid. The reciprocal obligation of the  sacrificers and the recipient of sacrifice is nicely expressed in verse 16, where Indra’s  debt to (other) sacrificers has been discharged by his countergift.
There is nothing of particular note in this hymn, though it is nicely executed. It  also contains several hapaxes and words with apparently non-Indo-Aryan phonol ogy, especially toward the beginning, that give it a slightly exotic air.
The internal structure of the hymn is not entirely clear. We follow Oldenberg’s  analysis, whereby the hymn consists of tr̥cas plus a final verse (30) save for verses  19–20, which form an incomplete tr̥ca with perhaps a verse missing. However, the  tr̥cas thus identified show little internal unity.1094 VIII.32
1. O Kaṇvas, with a song proclaim (the deeds) of Indra of the  silvery drink
done in the exhilaration of soma,
2. Who smashed Sr̥binda (so he became) harmless, smashed Pipru the  Dāsa puffed up like a snake [/Ahīśuva]—
he the strong one letting flow the waters.
3. Undermine the topside of Arbuda, the height of the lofty one. You have done this manly deed, Indra.
4. To the famed one (bring) your (soma) boldly, like a torrent [?] from the  mountain.
I invoke him of good lips for help.
5. Having become exhilarated, you will split apart the enclosure of the  cow, of the horse
like a stronghold for your comrades in soma, o champion.
6. If you will take pleasure in my pressed (soma) or you will find delight in  my solemn speech,
from afar come near through your own power.
7. We praisers abide in you, o Indra with your longing for hymns. You drinker of the soma—quicken us.
8. And bring us food, granting it inexhaustible—
many are your goods, liberal one—
9. And make us possessed of cows, of gold, of horses.
Might we be clasped by refreshments.
10. We invoke him of stammering speech, of stout forearms,
for help;
(we invoke) him who creates success, for aid.
11. Who as “hundred-intentioned one” then carries them out in the  concourse as Vr̥tra-smasher,
while providing many goods for the singers,
12. He as “able one” will be able for us, he who has gifts and brings  them near—
Indra, with all his help.
13. He who is the great streambed of wealth, easy to cross, the partner of  the presser—sing to that Indra,
14. The guider, the very steadfast one who wins fame in battles,
lord over much by his strength.
15. No one can restrain his powers, his liberalities;
no one can say, “he does not give.”
16. There exists no debt to the formulators, nor to the puffed-up  pressers now: no soma has been drunk without a counter(gift).
17. Sing just to the admirable one, to the admirable one recite
solemn words;
perform sacred formulations just for the admirable one.
18. The admirable one will tear out hundreds, thousands (of goods)—he  the unobstructable prizewinner,
Indra, who is the strengthener of him who offers sacrifice.
19. Wander widely following your own power, following the invocations of  the communities.
Indra, drink of the pressings.
20. Drink of (the pressings) that have their own milk-cows, both (the  pressing) at the son of Tugra’s [=Bhujyu]
and this one right here, which is yours, Indra.
21. Pass over him who presses with rage, the one who has pressed
in violation.
This one here—drink this pressed gift.
22. Pass through the three distant realms; pass over the five peoples, keeping watch over the nourishing streams, o Indra.
23. Like the sun its ray, let loose your rein. Let my hymns guide
you here
like waters, converging, to the deep.
24. Adhvaryu! Pour out the soma for the belipped hero.
Bring of the pressing (for him) to drink.
25. Who split the bolt of the water and released the rivers
downward,
who fixed the cooked (milk) fast in the cows,
26. He who is equal to song smashed Vr̥tra, (smashed) the spider’s son  [/Aurṇavābha] and the one puffed up like a
snake [/Ahīśuva].
With snow [/an icicle?] he pierced Arbuda.
27. To the strong one who lays low, the invincible victor,
sing your god-given formulation—
28. Who in the exhilaration of the soma stalk
oversees all commandments among the gods—Indra.
29. Hither let these two feasting companions, the pair of fallow bays with  golden manes,
convey (you) to the pleasure set out (for you).
30. The fallow bays, praised by Priyamedha, will convey you near,
much praised one, for soma-drinking.

## 33 (653) Indra
Medhyātithi Kāṇva
19 verses: brhat ̥ ī arranged in trcas 1–15, g ̥ āyatrī 16–18, anuṣṭubh 19
For most of its length (through vs. 15), this is an unremarkable hymn to Indra,  with the usual invitations to him to attend our soma sacrifice along with praise of  his overwhelming strength and requests for his bounty. Indra’s “resolve” (-krátu) is  frequently mentioned (vss. 5, 6, 11, 13, 14).
The last four verses (16–19), in a different meter, are also entirely different in  tone and intent and have given rise to multiple interpretations—especially the final  taunt (19d): “You, a brahmin, have become a woman.” Our view of this tantalizingly  opaque sequence is that it concerns the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife into the  performance of solemn ritual, an introduction celebrated in the nearby hymn VIII.31  (see remarks there). But, unlike the situation in VIII.31, the poet of VIII.33 displays  a conservative opposition to this ritual innovation, an innovation that he nonethe
less ascribes to Indra’s leadership. In verse 16 the poet complains that an unnamed  ritualist no longer listens to the instructions of his fellow ritualists but only to Indra’s.  In verses 17 and 18 Indra speaks, and though he at first disparages women’s intellect  (vs. 17), he asserts that a sacrifice directed by a complementary pair (mithunā́, a word  often used explicitly of a sexual couple) is especially successful (with implicit contrast  to the older model without female participation)—while at the same time suggesting  that the husband should keep the upper hand (or upper chariot-pole: the common  metaphor of sacrifice as chariot is in play). The final verse is, in our view, spoken by  the jaundiced poet himself. In the first three pādas he mocks his ritually innovative  colleague by pretending to be a mother inculcating proper feminine behavior into  her little daughter. The language is both slangy and heavily diminutivized, and the  crucial noun in pāda c, the dual kaśaplakaú, is a hapax and unclear, though it may  well refer to female genitalia. He then announces his reasons for this mockery: the  innovative colleague, by favoring women’s ritual participation, risks being tainted by  the female presence and becoming a woman himself. (Such charges have frequently  been directed at men who favor women’s rights, at least since the time of John Stuart  Mill.) For more detailed discussion, see Jamison (forthcoming a and 2011).
It is not entirely clear why this curious sequence is found tacked onto an other wise ordinary Indra hymn. It occupies the position often taken by a dānastuti, and  of course dānastutis often display a linguistic register similar to what is found here,  slangy and colloquial vocabulary, syntactically informal direct speech, and sexual  innuendo. It has been suggested that it is a sort of anti-dānastuti, a “satire” in the  technical sense. This is an appealing explanation for its position in the hymn, but  with the proviso that, at least in our interpretation, the target of the satire is clearly  not the poet’s patron (stingy or not), but a fellow ritualist.
1. We who are provided with pressings, with the twisted ritual grass,  like waters at the outpourings of the strainer, take our seats around you,
Vr̥tra-smasher, as praisers.
2. The men provided with hymns cry out to you exclusively when (soma) is  pressed, o good one.
When will you come thirsting here to our house, to our pressed (soma),  Indra, like a buffalo following its own track?
3. With the Kaṇvas, bold one, you will boldly tear out a prize worth a  thousand.
We beg for a tawny-formed (prize) consisting of cattle—right away, o  unbounded bounteous one.
4. “Drink!”—sing (thus) to Indra, at the exhilaration of the stalk, o  Medhyātithi,
to the mace-wielder, who is linked with the two fallow bays, who, when  (soma) is pressed, is a golden chariot,
5. Who has a good left (horse) and a good right one, the strong one, who  is hymned as the one of good resolve,
who distributes thousands, who has a hundred bounties, Indra, who is  acknowledged as the stronghold-splitter,
6. Who is audacious, who is unobstructable, who is embedded within his  beard,
possessing extensive brilliance, rouser, much praised, in his resolve
strong like an ox.
7. Who recognizes him when he drinks when (the soma) is pressed? What  vigor has he assumed?
This is the one who splits strongholds with strength, the belipped one  getting exhilarated from the stalk.
8. Like a wild elephant he has established his wandering [=his territory] in  many places, through his giving.
No one will restrain you; you will come here to the pressed (soma);
great, you wander about in your strength.
9. Though being strong, unprostratable, steadfast, perfected for battle, if the bounteous one will hear the call of a praiser, Indra will not stay  away. He will come here.
10. This is truly so: you alone are the bull for us, with the speed of a bull,  unobstructable—
for as a bull, strong one, you are famed in the distance, as a bull famed  nearby.
11. Bullish are your reins, bullish your golden whip;
bullish is your chariot, bounteous one, bullish your two fallow bays; a  bull are you of a hundred resolves.
12. Let the bullish presser press for you; o bull, flying straight—bring  (prizes) here.
1098 VIII.34
The bull has run to the bull in the waters. It [=soma] is for you, o
mounter of the fallow bays.
13. Drive here, most powerful Indra, to drink the somian honey;
as bounteous one, (drive) on your own to the landing site. He of
good resolve will listen to the songs, the sacred formulations, and the
hymns.
14. You who bestride the chariot—let the fallow bays, yoked to the chariot,  convey you hither,
even across what belongs to the stranger, across the pressings that
belong to others, you Vr̥tra-smasher of a hundred resolves.
15. Set our praise today nearest to yourself, you greatly great one;
let our pressings be most availing to you for exhilaration, you
heaven-ruling soma-drinker.
16. [Poet:] He finds no pleasure in the instruction of you or me, (but only in  that) of the other one [=Indra],
the hero who led us hither.
17. Indra said just this, “the mind of woman is not to be instructed,
and her will is fickle.
18. [Indra, cont’d:] “(Nonetheless,) it’s the twin span, the complementary  pair [/married couple], aroused to exuberance, that draws the chariot  [=sacrifice];
but even so the chariot-pole of the bull [=husband] is higher.”
19. [Poet:] “‘Keep your eyes to yourself: look below, not above. Bring your  two little feet closer together:
don’t let them see your two little “lips” [?].’ For you, a brahmin, have  turned into a woman!”
## 34 (654) Indra
Nīpātithi Kāṇva (1–15), the thousand rṣ̥ is of Vasurocis Āṅgirasa (16–18) 18 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–15, gāyatrī 16–18, arranged in trcas ̥
The first fifteen verses of this hymn show a rigid formal structure that is awkward  to convey in translation. The second half of each verse consists of a refrain, which  implicitly contrasts with the first half of each verse. The refrain addresses an uniden tified plural “you,” who have driven to heaven and command heaven; we consider  the “you” to refer to the other gods, as contrasted with Indra, or perhaps specifi cally to the Maruts. Most of the first half-verses begin with the preverb ā́ “here”  and generally call upon Indra to drive here (using the same verb as in the refrain)  and participate in the sacrifice. Thus Indra’s desired presence “here” is the constant  counterweight to the removal of the other gods to heaven. The other part of the refrain is a curious vocative, clearly addressed to Indra,  divā-vasu “you who (bring) goods by day,” found only here and of odd formation.  The motivation for this form becomes clear in the dānastuti (vss. 16–18), where the  patron’s name is given as Vasu-rocis (vs. 16) “whose light is goods”: Indra’s epithet  divā-vasu is a pun on and a metathesis of this name, with the vásu “goods” element  reversed and rocís “light” replaced by dívā “by day.” The similarity between this  name and the relentlessly repeated epithet of Indra establishes an implicit identifi
cation between the human patron and Indra; even more strikingly, verse 16 asserts  that the poet and the god Indra have jointly received rich goods from Vasurocis, so  that even Indra is presented as a beneficiary of the largesse of Vasurocis.
The formal structure of the hymn continues to its very end: the final word of the  hymn is the signature ā́ “here,” which also began it.
1. Here—Indra, drive here with your fallow bays, up to the lovely praise  of Kaṇva,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
2. Here—let the soma-possessing pressing stone as it speaks hold you here  with its cry,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
3. In this place their felly shakes itself, as a wolf does a lamb,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
4. Here—the Kaṇvas call you here for help, for prizewinning,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
5. I set out the first drinking of the pressings for you, as if for a bull, o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
6. Along with Plenitude come here to us, as one whose vision is everywhere,  for our help,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
7. Here—drive here to us, you of great thought, of a thousand forms of  help, a hundred bounties,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
8. Here will the Hotar convey you—he installed by Manu, to be invoked  among the gods [=Agni],
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
1100 VIII.34
9. Here will the pair of fallow bays, aroused to exuberance, convey you, as  its two wings convey a falcon,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
10. Here—drive here, away from the stranger—hail!—to drink of the  soma,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods),
who impose order over yonder heaven, have driven off to
heaven.
11. Here—drive here to us to listen; take pleasure in the hymns here,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
12. Come here to us with your fully equipped (horses) of like form, o you  who possess fully equipped horses,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
13. Here—drive here from the mountains, from the surface of
the sea,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
14. Here—keep breaking out for us bovine and equine (wealth) in
thousands, o champion,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
15. Here—bring (it) here to us in thousands, bring ten thousands and  hundreds,
o you who bring goods by day—(though) you (other gods), who impose  order over yonder heaven, have driven off to heaven.
16. Here—when Indra and I took from Vasurocis [/him whose light
is goods]
a thousand strongest equine livestock,
17. The silvery ones whose speed is the wind’s, the reddish ones,
quick-streaming,
which shine like suns,
18. Amid the gifts of Pārāvata [/the one from afar (=Indra?)], amid the  swift (chariots) with speeding wheels,
I mounted on the middle of the wood(en chariot?) here.
The next four hymns (VIII.35–38) are attributed to Śyāvāśva Ātreya, whose Marut  cycle in Maṇḍala V (52–61) is one of the glories of that dazzling book, and who is  also the composer of a single hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala (IX.32). VIII.35 (655) Aśvins
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
24 verses: pariṣṭājjyotis, except paṅkti 22, 24 and mahābrhat ̥ ī 24, arranged in trcas. ̥
The Anukramaṇī’s attribution of this hymn to Śyāvāśva is supported by his self-refer ence in verses 19–21 and his reference to his ancestor Atri in verse 19, but the virtuos ity so characteristic of Śyāvāśva’s Marut hymns in Maṇḍala V is not on display here.  This long hymn may be one of the most repetitive in the R̥gveda. In the first twenty one verses the c-pāda is identical, and the tr̥cas making up the hymn all have refrains  encompassing at least the second half-verse (pādas cd: vss. 1–3; pādas cde: vss. 22–24)  and usually the second (b)  pāda as well (bcd:  vss. 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, 13–15, 16–18,  19–21). This leaves the first (a) pāda as the only locus of variation in each tr̥ca, and  even that variation is patterned and under strict control. Moreover, the contents and  phraseology of the individual tr̥cas do not differ significantly one from another—urg ing the Aśvins to come to the sacrifice with numerous other gods and to partake of  our offerings while providing us with gifts and aid in return. The repetitive structure  has an incantatory effect, but it does not challenge the decoding skills of the audience.
The most interesting tr̥ca consists of verses 16–18. As a number of others have  pointed out, these three verses, asking the Aśvins to “quicken” or “animate” various  things for us, are appropriate to the three varṇas in turn: verse 16 to the brahmin, 17  to the kṣatriya, and 18 to the vaiśya. In fact, verse 16 begins with the word bráhma,  while 17 begins with kṣatrám. In 16 we ask for the Aśvins’ aid for ritual and priestly  elements, in 17 for elements related to kingly and martial power, and in 18 for our  livestock and people. As is well known, the varṇa system is not a prominent feature  of the R̥gveda and may well only be taking shape in this period, but this small collec tion of Śyāvāśva hymns displays it clearly—not only in this tr̥ca, but in the next two  twinned hymns (36 and 37) with their reference to bráhman and kṣatrá respectively.
1. With Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Viṣṇu, with the Ādityas, the Rudras, and  the Vasus,
in concert with Dawn and the Sun, drink the soma, o Aśvins.
2. With all insights and (all) creation, o prizewinners, in comradeship with  Heaven and Earth and the stones,

18. Quicken our cows and quicken our clans. – Smite demons; keep away  diseases.

o Aśvins.
19. As if to Atri’s, listen to the first praise hymn of the presser Śyāvāśva, o  you roused to exuberance.
– In concert with Dawn and the Sun, o Aśvins, (drink) the (soma) aged  overnight.
20. Like gushes (of water), send gushing the good praise hymns of the  presser Śyāvāśva, o you roused to exuberance.

drive here, o Aśvins; come here. Seeking help, I call to you: provide
riches for the pious man.
24. Satiate yourselves on the pressed plant prepared with the svāhā-call,  o gods.
– Drive here, o Aśvins; come here. Seeking help, I call to you: provide  riches for the pious man.
## 36 (656) Indra
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
7 verses: śakvarī, except mahāpaṅkti 7
Despite the length and elaboration of the meter—a śakvarī verse consists of fifty six syllables arranged in at least six pādas (for Oldenberg seven)—most of each of  the first six verses in this hymn consists of refrain; only the first pāda, of twelve1104 VIII.36
syllables, varies in each verse. This structure is almost identical to that of the pre ceding hymn (VIII.35).
This hymn and the following one, VIII.37, although in different (but  related) meters, are twinned conceptions. Both are seven verses long; both  devote most of the first six verses to refrain, reserving only the first pāda  of each verse for new material. The final verses of both hymns are almost  identical save for a few lexical variants, the most important of which is the  correspondence between bráhmāṇi “priestly formulations” in VIII.36.7 and  kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” in VIII.37.7. This correspondence suggests that the  hymns were designed as appropriate to brahmins and kṣatriyas respectively,  and though the formalized doctrine of the three twice-born varṇas seems  to be taking shape only in the late R̥gveda (see especially the Puruṣasūkta,  X.90.11–12), it is surely no accident, as Oldenberg points out (Noten ad loc.),  that this same group of Śyāvāśva hymns contains a tripartite blessing clearly  referring to the three upper varṇas (VIII.35.16–18). Nonetheless in this hymn  there seems little that is specifically applicable to the brahmin and only to him,  and indeed the strong emphasis on victory in the refrain would seem more a  warrior than a priestly preoccupation.
Since Śyāvāśva is best known for his Marut cycle in the Vth Maṇḍala (V.52–61),  it is entirely appropriate that Indra is “accompanied by the Maruts” in this refrain.  Śyāvāśva’s ancestors the Atris (note his patronymic Ātreya) are also glorified in this  hymn (vss. 6–7); the Atris are, of course, more at home in their own family maṇḍala,  V, than in VIII.
1. You are the helper of the one who presses (soma) and twists the
ritual grass.
– O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements.
2. Help the praiser further, bounteous one; help yourself.
– O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements.
3. With nourishment you help the gods, with strength you help yourself. – O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements. 4. Begetter of heaven, begetter of earth—
– o you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements.
5. Begetter of horses, begetter of cows are you.
– O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of

6. Make the praise of the Atris great, o you of the (pressing) stone.
– O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements.
7. Listen to Śyāvāśva as he presses (soma), just as you listened to Atri as he  performed (ritual) acts.
Alone, you helped Trasadasyu in the conquering of men, Indra,
strengthening the priestly formulations.

7 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except atijagatī 1
For the relationship between this hymn and its twin, VIII.36, see the introduction  to the previous hymn. As discussed there, the final verse (7) of this hymn with its  reference to kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” (as opposed to the “priestly formulations” of  VIII.36.7) puts the hymn in the domain of the kṣatriya varṇa. Unlike the previous  hymn, where the brahmanical aspect is muted at best, this hymn does present a  kingly and martial profile in the variant material in the first pādas of verses 2–6.
1. You furthered this priestly formulation at the overcoming of obstacles,  furthered (the formulation) of the presser—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of the mace. 2. Winning battles against deceits, strong one—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
1106 VIII.38
3. As lone king do you rule over this creation—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
4. You, just alone, keep apart the two (hosts) in confrontation—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
5. Over both peace and hitching up (for war) you are master—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
6. You help one to lordly power, you did not help another—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
7. Listen to Śyāvāśva as he “rasps,” just as you listened to Atri as he  performed (ritual) acts.
Alone, you helped Trasadasyu in the conquering of men, Indra,
strengthening the lordly powers.
## 38 (658) Indra and Agni
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This simple hymn is defined by its structure. Each of the three tr̥cas has a differ ent refrain, though each of the refrains begins with the vocative dual dvandva  índrāgnī “o Indra and Agni.” The final verse (10) breaks the pattern, though the  same dvandva is found, pāda-initial, in the genitive. In content the hymn is entirely  devoted to the soma sacrifice and the poet’s invitation to the two gods to come and  enjoy it. The poet names himself in verse 9 and summarizes his poetic activity in the  past tense. Such a summary is ordinarily found in the absolute final verse of hymns,  but here it is capped by the pattern-breaking verse 10.
As often in hymns dedicated jointly to these two gods, who share little in terms  of activities and attributes, they are either described in general terms or with epi thets related to one or the other—for example, in verse 1 it is technically only Agni  who is a “regular offerer of sacrifice” (r̥tvíj), while Indra is more appropriately the  victor in prize contests (vā́jeṣu) than Agni. The third term in that verse, kármasu “in acts/deeds,” is ambiguous, however, since kárman is regularly used both of the  types of heroic deeds associated with Indra and with ritual acts more commonly  ascribed to Agni. 1. Because you two are regular offerers of the sacrifice, winners in
prize-contests and in (cultic/heroic) acts,
– Indra and Agni, take note of this.
2. Streaming, driving on the same chariot, Vr̥tra-smashing, invincible— – Indra and Agni, take note of this.
3. Here is the exhilarating honey for you two—the men have milked it out  with stones.
– Indra and Agni, take note of this.
4. Enjoy this sacrifice to your liking, (enjoy) the pressed soma, you jointly  praised ones.
– Indra and Agni, come here, men.
5. Enjoy these pressings here, because of which you conveyed the
oblations.
– Indra and Agni, come here, men.
6. This “turn” of song enjoy, my lovely praise.
– Indra and Agni, come here, men.
7. Along with the early-traveling gods come here, you two of noble goods, – Indra and Agni, for soma-drinking.
8. Listen to (soma-)pressing Śyāvāśva, (as you did) to the call of
the Atris—
– Indra and Agni, for soma-drinking.
9. Thus did I call upon you two for help, just as the wise ones called— – Indra and Agni, for soma-drinking.
10. Here do I choose the help of Indra and Agni in company with
Sarasvatī,
the two for whom the song is recited.
The following group of hymns, VIII.39–42, is attributed to Nābhāka Kāṇva, who  names himself several times in VIII.40 and 41. The group is characterized by the  slangy refrain that puns on his name, nábhantām anyaké same “let  all the other  squirts burst!” The poet is also partial to the mahāpaṅkti meter, found in VIII.39–41.
## 39 (659) Agni
Nābhāka Kāṇva
10 verses: mahāpaṅkti
Agni’s role as messenger between heaven and earth and as mediator between gods and  men is particularly emphasized in this hymn. And, in addition to his usual ritual role,  his identity as poet is also mentioned several times (see esp. vss. 1, 7, 9). The hymn
1108 VIII.39
contains an example of the well-known trope of “pouring prayers” (vs. 3), and in the  middle of the hymn we find a pun on one of Agni’s standard epithets Jāta-vedas, in  verse 6 where it is said that he “knows” (veda) the “races” (jātā́) of gods and men.
The hymn in general has a benign tone and high discourse level, and so the flip pantly bloodthirsty refrain rests oddly in it. Only in verse 2 does it fit the contents,  and even there the linguistic register is quite distinct between the verse proper and  the refrain.
The poet handles the six-pāda structure of the mahāpaṅkti flexibly. The last pāda  of each verse is the Nabhāka refrain. Otherwise the first two pādas (ab) and the  fourth and fifth (de) pādas each group together, while the third pāda (c) belongs  sometimes with ab (generally in the first part of the hymn) and sometimes with de  (toward the end, vss. 7–9).
1. Agni have I praised, worthy of verses, Agni to be worshiped with
invocation. Let Agni anoint the gods for us,
for the sage poet acts as messenger between both (cosmic) divisions
[=heaven and earth].
– Let all the other squirts burst!
2. O Agni, (set) down on their [=gods’] bodies a laud with our newer  speech. (Put) down the hostilities of the hostile ones.
Let all the hostilities of the stranger, the hindrances keep away from here. – Let all the other squirts burst!
3. O Agni, prayers to you I pour like ghee into your mouth. Be the
discerning one among the gods,
for you are the foremost gracious messenger of Vivasvant.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
4. Every kind of vigor does Agni acquire, even as (soon as) he longs for  it—his oblation is the nourishment of the good ones—
he acquires luck and lifetime, acquires joy, for every invocation of the gods. – Let all the other squirts burst!
5. Agni shows brightly through his very mighty, bright (ritual) action. He is  Hotar of each and every (clan).
He is decked out with gift-cows, and he impels (them) to the (gift-)
reception.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
6. Agni knows the races of the gods, Agni (those) of mortals: (this is his)  secret name [=Jātavedas]. Agni is the giver of treasure.
Agni opens the doors, when well bepoured with a newer (speech).
– Let all the other squirts burst!
7. Agni is joined with goods among the gods, among the clans devoted to  sacrifice.
With delight he fosters the many poetic arts, as the earth (fosters)
everything—the god devoted to sacrifice among the gods.
– Let all the other squirts burst! 8. Agni, who, belonging to the seven human (divisions), is fixed amid all  the rivers—
to him have we come—the one with three dwellings, the best smasher of  Dasyus for Mandhātar, Agni foremost in the sacrifices.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
9. Agni inhabits the three (cosmic) divisions with their three parts, as sage poet. He will sacrifice to the thrice eleven (gods) here and please them for us,  as inspired poet and messenger, when he has been prepared.
–Let all the other squirts burst!
10. You, foremost Agni, among the Āyus, among the gods, alone have  control over goods for us.
Around you do the swirling waters circle, which are their own bridges. – Let all the other squirts burst!
## 40 (660) Indra and Agni
Nābhāka Kāṇva
12 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except śakvarī 2 and triṣṭubh 12
Unlike many Indra and Agni hymns, in this one the two divinities achieve some  measure of independence, with the more significant role falling to Indra, who is  mentioned alone in several verses, in part or wholly (2, 5, 6, 9, 10). Much of the  content is martial, appropriate to Indra, and also more appropriate to the Nābhāka  refrain than any other of the Nābhāka hymns. The freeing and winning of the  waters is celebrated several times (vss. 5, 8, 10/11). There are several paired verses: 4  and 5 where Nābhāka is mentioned by name, and 10/11, the first to Indra, the sec
ond, almost identical, to Agni. The hymn ends with a verse in a different meter,  without the refrain, that summarizes the hymn that precedes, as is often the case.
1. O Indra and Agni, victorious ones—you two will give us wealth,
by which we might become victorious over the strongholds, even the firm  ones, in the combats,
as Agni (is victorious) over the woods especially when there is wind.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
2. For we do not stick you two together in a hole. But we sacrifice to Indra  especially as strongest man among men.
He will come here to us sometime with his steed to win the prize; he will  come here to win wisdom.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
3. For these two, Indra and Agni, preside amid battle-raids.
You two, sage poets through your poetic skill, on being asked, realize the  visionary thought for the one seeking your companionship, o men.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
1110 VIII.40
4. Like Nabhāka recite to Indra and Agni with a worshipful song, the two to whom this whole moving world belongs,
whose goods this heaven and the great earth bear in their lap.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
5. Like Nabhāka, direct sacred formulations to Indra and Agni, the two who opened up the flood with its seven (stream)beds, with its  sloping banks—Indra, showing mastery through his strength.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
6. Hew (him) apart in the age-old way, like the tangle of a vine; weaken  the strength of the Dāsa.
Might we then take a share in his goods, brought together by Indra. – Let all the other squirts burst!
7. When these peoples here vie in invoking Indra and Agni with song at  length,
with our men might we overcome those doing battle, might we win  against those eager to win.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
8. The two bright ones [=sun and moon], who (come) down from heaven  and will proceed upward every day,
(they do so) following the commandment of Indra and Agni; following  the commandment of Indra and Agni the rivers go driving, those  which the two [=Indra and Agni] freed from bondage.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
9. Many are your distributions (of goods to us), Indra, and many our  encomia to you, o son of impulsion, possessor of fallow bays—
(many) the infusions of goods of the hero [=Indra], (and many) our  visionary thoughts, which now reach their goal.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
10. Hone him [=Indra] with well-twisted (hymns)—the turbulent one, the  “real thing,” worthy of verses.
And he who even now will split the “eggs” of Śuṣṇa with his strength,  he will conquer the waters along with the sun.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
11. Hone him [=Agni] affording good ceremonies, the “real thing” really  there at the proper season.
And he who even now is solemnly proclaimed (as the one) who will split  the “eggs” of Śuṣṇa, he has conquered the waters along with the sun. – Let all the other squirts burst!
12. Thus to Indra and Agni, in the manner of the ancestors, of Mandhātar,  of Aṅgiras, a newer (speech) has just been spoken.
With tripartite shelter protect us; may we be lords of riches. VIII.41 (661) Varuṇa
Nābhāka Kāṇva
10 verses: mahāpaṅkti
A mystical hymn dedicated to Varuṇa alone, celebrating the god as cosmogonic  creator and shaper of the world—both spatially, by measuring out the primordial  cosmic domains and holding down and apart the cosmic realms (esp. vss. 4, 10), and  temporally, by regulating the nights and days (vss. 3, 10). The sun and moon as his  deputies function at the intersection of the spatial and temporal (vs. 9). The god is  also presented as holding both human and natural phenomena within his encom
passing physical protection (vss. 1cd, 3ac, 4de, 7abc).
The hymn seems to have a loose omphalos structure. Verbal correspondences in  verses 2/9 (especially the “seven”) and 3/8 (ní √dhā “deposit” and feminine plurals)  provide a weak ring (see also the “three” in vss. 3/9 and “embrace” [pári √svaj] and  “envelop” [pári √mr̥ś] 3/7). And the two middle verses, 5–6, the omphalos proper,  point to the hymn’s cryptic message—the creative power of poetry and of the  knowledge and control of words, especially names.
Varuṇa’s later association with the waters is evident in several hints in the  hymn: his closeness to the rivers in 2d, who are also his seven sisters in 2e and the  seven over which he has control in 9e, and his identification as “a secret sea” in  8a. The waters may well be the referents of the unidentified feminine plurals in 7a  and 8c.
Much remains unclear in this hymn, however, and we do not claim to have pen etrated all its many mysteries. One of the most obvious, but perhaps least interest ing, puzzles is the relevance of the jaunty and bloodthirsty Nābhāka refrain to the  high-minded and solemn contents of the hymn.
1. Chant to this one for him to prevail—to Varuṇa, and to the Maruts, the  very wise ones—
(Varuṇa,) who guards the insights of the sons of Manu like the cows of  a herd.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
2. (Chant to) him in the same way with a hymn, with the composed  thoughts of our forefathers, and with the panegyrics of Nābhāka—
(him,) who is nearby at the rising of the rivers, having seven sisters he is  in the middle (of them).
– Let all the other squirts burst!
3. He holds the nights in his embrace; by his magic art he deposited the  ruddy (dawns). He (holds) everything in his embrace—the one lovely  to see.
Following his commandment, his trackers [=nights?] increased the
three dawns.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
1112 VIII.42
4. Who is the one who fastened the peaks down upon the earth—the one  lovely to see—he was the measurer of the primordial place.
That is the leadership of Varuṇa, for he is like an energetic herdsman. – Let all the other squirts burst!
5. Who is the upholder of the worlds, who knows the secret names of the  ruddy (dawns), their hidden names,
he is a poet who fosters the many poetic arts, as heaven does its
(concrete) form [=sun].
– Let all the other squirts burst!
6. In whom are fixed all poetic arts—(he is) like the nave in a wheel. Do  honor to Trita [/the third one] with alacrity.
Like oxen in a pen to be yoked together, they have yoked the horses for  yoking.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
7. Who lies on these [fem. =the waters?] (like) a cloak, while enveloping all  the created things of these [masc. =the gods?] and their domains—
in Varuṇa’s household, in front (of him), are all the gods, following his  commandment.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
8. A secret sea, powerful, he mounts as if to heaven, when he has
deposited the ritual formula in them [=waters?].
He scattered the magic arts with his ray as his foot, as he mounted to  the celestial vault.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
9. Whose two bright, wide-gazing ones [=sun and moon] preside over the  three earths, and three times have filled the higher (seats)—
steadfast is the seat of Varuṇa. He has control over the seven (rivers?). – Let all the other squirts burst!
10. Who made the bright (days) and black (nights) becloaked following his  commandments, he measured out the primordial domain—
he who with his prop held apart the two world-halves, as Aja (Ekapad)  held up heaven.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 42 (662) Varuṇa (1–3), the Asvins (4–6) ́
Arcanānas or Nābhāka Kāṇva
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6
This last hymn of the Nābhāka series is actually two hymns, on the grounds both  of meter and of subject matter, as Oldenberg clearly states (1888: 213 n. 2). The  first three verses, in triṣṭubh, are dedicated to Varuṇa. They continue the solemn tone and the cosmic focus of the previous hymn to Varuṇa (VIII.41), but with none  of the complexities. The Aśvins are the target of the second three verses (4–6), in  a simple invitation to soma-drinking. The Nābhāka refrain is found only in this  second hymnlet.
1. He propped up heaven—the lord who possesses all possessions—he  measured out the expanse of the earth;
the sovereign king made all the living worlds his seat. All these are the  commandments of Varuṇa.
2. Extol lofty Varuṇa thus: offer reverence to the insightful herdsman of the  immortal.
He will extend to us shelter providing threefold defense. Protect us in  your lap, o Heaven and Earth.
3. Sharpen the will and skill of the man who puts his best into this
insightful thought, o god Varuṇa.
Might we board a boat that provides a good crossing, by which we might  cross beyond all difficulties.
4. The pressing stones, inspired poets, have roused you two, o Aśvins, with  their insightful thoughts,
for you to drink the soma, o Nāsatyas.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
5. Just as the inspired Atri kept calling to you two, Aśvins, with his hymns, for you to drink the soma, o Nāsatyas.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
6. In just this way have I called to you two for help, just as the wise have  called,
for you to drink the soma, o Nāsatyas.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
As Oldenberg remarks (1888: 216), on the basis of agreements in lexicon, phrase ology, and style it is likely that VIII.43–48 form a group, though they are not all  attributed to the same poet.
## 43 (663) Agni
Virūpa Āṅgirasa
33 verses: gāyatrī, most likely arranged in trcas ̥
Though it is likely that this hymn is constructed of tr̥cas, there is little overt unity  within the tr̥cas. On the surface the hymn is a pleasant but generally unremarkable  praise of Agni. His ritual functions are showcased throughout, and toward the end  the “we” of the poet and his fellow sacrificers invoke him more and more insistently1114 VIII.43
in this role. But earlier in the hymn there is some nice naturalistic description of fire  and fires (vss. 3–10). In verses 14 and 16 the poet emphasizes the kinship between  himself and Agni as poet.
Another thematic strain evident in the hymn and asserting itself more and more  toward the end is the role of Agni as a unifying focus of various clans and settle ments in the larger Ārya community. In several early verses multiple fires are kin dled at once (vss. 4–5). In light of later parts of the hymn, these can be interpreted  as the separate family or clan fires, which are later joined conceptually in the single  fire to which all the separate groups give allegiance (see esp. vs. 18, also 27, 29). This  single fire, found in multiple places but shared by all the clans, is invoked for help  in combat in verse 21. Agni’s competitive (vss. 20, 25), martial (vss. 21, 23, 26, 32),  and ruling (vs. 24) aspects become more prominent in the second half of the hymn;  the sacrificers clearly wish to harness these powers for the good of the whole com munity. Though not insistent, this theme is pervasive and provides a subtle unity to  this superficially rambling thirty-three-verse composition.
1. For the inspired poet, the ritual adept, the indestructible sacrificer,  for Agni—
these hymns, these praises arise right here.
2. For you right here, yearning for it, o unbounded Jātavedas,
o Agni, I generate a lovely praise hymn.
3. Like brilliants, certainly, are your sharp scintillations, Agni.
With their teeth they snap at the woods.
4. The fallow bays with smoke as their beacon, sped by the wind up  toward heaven,
take up opposing positions—the fires.
5. These fires kindled here in opposing (places) have come to sight all  at once,
like the beacons of the dawns.
6. Black are the realms at the feet of Jātavedas on his advance,
when Agni grows on the earth.
7. Making the plants his wellspring (of nourishment), snapping (at them),  Agni does not become extinguished,
as he comes once again to the tender ones.
8. Bending back and forth with his tongues, flickering here and there with  his flame,
Agni shines brightly in the woods.
9. In the waters is your seat, Agni. You grow through the plants.
While (still) being in their womb, you are born again.
10. This flame of yours, Agni, when bepoured, blazes up from the ghee, kissing the offering spoons on the mouth. 11. To him whose food is oxen, whose food is barren cows, to the ritual  adept with soma on his back—
to Agni we would do honor with praises.
12. And you, o Hotar whose resolve is worthy to be chosen, with homage and with kindling sticks do we beseech, o Agni.
13. And you, o Agni blazing when bepoured, like Bhr̥gu, like Manu, like Aṅgiras, do we invoke.
14. For you—o Fire by fire, a poet by a poet, the real (thing) by a
real (man),
a comrade by a comrade—are kindled.
15. You—to the pious poet grant wealth in thousands,
o Agni, and refreshment abounding in heroes.
16. O Brother Agni, made by might, having ruddy horses, of blazing  commandment—
enjoy this praise of mine.
17. And you, Agni, have my praises reached—(the praises generated) for  the bellowing one who yearns for (them)—
like cows their cow-stall.
18. For you, best of the Aṅgirases, all these lovely settlements have separately yielded themselves to your desire, Agni.
19. With their insightful thoughts the inspired wise ones who are attentive  to poetic inspiration
have spurred Agni to join their meal.
20. You, Agni, prizewinner on the drives, do those who stretch out their  ceremony
reverently invoke as draft-horse (of the sacrifice), as Hotar.
21. Because you are of the same aspect in many places, preeminent
throughout all the clans,
in combats we call upon you.
22. Reverently invoke him, Agni who flashes forth when bepoured with  (streams of) ghee.
He will listen to this call of ours.
23. It is you we call upon, the listening Jātavedas,
who smash away hatreds, o Agni.
24. The infallible ruler of the clans, this overseer here of the (ritual)  statutes—
Agni do I reverently invoke: he will listen.
25. Agni pulsing with excitement all his life—like a young blood spurred on  to seek the prize,
like a (prize-seeking) team do we incite him.
1116 VIII.44
26. Smashing away insults and hatreds, burning demonic forces
everywhere,
Agni, shine with your sharp (flame).
27. You whom the peoples kindle, as Manu did, o best of the Aṅgirases, Agni, take cognizance of my speech.
28. O might-made Agni, whether you are born in heaven or born in the  waters,
we call upon you with hymns.
29. To you do these peoples here, all the lovely settlements separately, impel the wellspring (of nourishment) to be eaten.
30. O Agni, may we be very attentive and with manly gaze,
crossing over difficult depths through all the days.
31. Agni, the gladdening one dear to many, sharp, pure-flamed,
do we implore with gladdening hearts.
32. You, Agni, with far-radiant goods, dispatching (darkness) like the sun  with its rays,
vaunting yourself, you keep smashing the dark shades.
33. This we implore of you, mighty one—that your giving does not
give out.
From you, Agni, (comes) the good thing worthy to be chosen.
## 44 (664) Agni
Virūpa Āṅgirasa
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Like the last hymn, this one, though apparently divided into tr̥cas, shows little  unity within the tr̥cas. Indeed, this hymn does appear to ramble, unlike the last  one, in which several persistent themes provided structure. There are several sig nature words, especially forms of the root śuc “flame, blaze” and of the nominal  vásu “good/goods.” Agni’s ritual function is the dominant topic, and his twin and  contrasting roles as vípra “inspired poet” (vss. 10, 12, 21, 29) and kaví “sage poet”  (vss. 7, 12, 21, 26, 30) are regularly mentioned. But there is no clear development  in the hymn, and most of the verses contain standard descriptions and addresses  to the god.
1. With a kindling stick do friendly service to Agni; with (streams of) ghee  awaken the guest.
Into him pour oblations.
2. Agni, enjoy my praise. Grow strong through this thought.
Take delight in our hymns. 3. Agni I place in front as messenger; I appeal to him as the conveyor of  the oblation:
he will make the gods sit down here.
4. Your lofty beams rise upward as you are kindled,
upward the flaming ones, shining Agni.
5. Let my ghee-filled offering spoons come near to you, delightful one. Agni, enjoy our oblations.
6. Gladdening Hotar, seasonable offerer, of bright radiance, with
far-radiant goods,
Agni do I reverently invoke—he will listen—
7. The age-old Hotar to be reverently invoked, enjoyable Agni, who has a  poet’s purpose,
the full glory of the ceremonies.
8. O best of the Aṅgirases, enjoying these oblations here in due order, Agni, conduct the sacrifice at the proper season.
9. When you have been kindled, o comrade with flaming flame,
convey here
the divine race, as the attentive one.
10. The inspired poet, Hotar without deceit, whose beacon is smoke, with  far-radiant goods,
the beacon of the sacrifices do we implore:
11. “Agni, protect us. (Burn), god, against those who do harm.
Split hatred, o might-made one.”
12. Agni beautifying his own body with an age-old thought,
the sage poet is strengthened by the inspired poet.
13. I call the child of nourishment, pure-flamed Agni,
here to this sacrifice of good ceremony.
14. You who have the might of Mitra, o Agni, with your flaming flame sit here on our ritual grass along with the gods.
15. The mortal who serves god Agni in his own house,
just for that man will he bring goods to light.
16. Agni is the head, the peak of heaven; this (Agni) here is lord of the earth. He quickens the spawn of the waters.
17. Your flaming flames rise up as they flash, Agni,
your lights, your beams.
18. Because you hold sway over a choice gift, Agni, as lord of the sun, might I, your praiser, be in your shelter.
19. You, Agni, do those of inspired thought, you do they spur on with their  insights.
Let our hymns strengthen you.
1118 VIII.45
20. Of the undeceivable, self-empowered messenger who is always
crackling—
of Agni would we choose the comradeship.
21. Agni, best possessor of flaming commandments, flaming inspired poet,  flaming sage poet,
flaming he shines when he is bepoured.
22. And let my visionary thoughts, let my hymns strengthen you at
all times.
Agni, take cognizance of our comradeship.
23. If I were you, Agni, or you were me,
your hopes would come true here.
24. Because you are surely the good lord of goods, Agni, with
far-radiant goods,
may we be in your benevolence.
25. Agni, like rivers to the sea, to you of steadfast commandments
do our hymns go bellowing.
26. The youthful clanlord, the sage poet, omnivorous, pulsing with much  excitement—
Agni do I beautify with my thoughts.
27. To the charioteer of the sacrifices, sharp-fanged, staunch,
would we make haste with praises—to Agni.
28. Let this singer here abide in you, comrade Agni.
To him be merciful, o pure one.
29. For you are a clever companion at table, always wakeful like an
inspired poet.
Agni, you will give light (all the way up) to heaven.
30. Agni, in the face of difficult passages, in the face of insults, o
sage poet,
lengthen our lifetime, o good one.

The hymn begins and ends with a tr̥ca marked by a refrain (vss. 1–3 and 40–42). The  tr̥ca division can otherwise be faint, and in several instances seems to contravene  groupings of verse by content (see esp. vss. 36–39). The Anukramaṇī attributes the  hymn to a certain Triśoka, but this name has probably been plucked from verse 30.
The first two verses establish a ritual mise-en-scène, but we quickly move into the  martial and competitive mode that prevails in most of the rest of this long hymn. Familiar chords are struck: Indra is exhorted to destroy enemies in various fero cious ways (e.g., vs. 8) and to parcel out their goods to us (e.g., vs. 15), to drink our  soma and aid our efforts (e.g., vs. 14), and to give us rich gifts (e.g., vs. 12), and he  is praised for his past deeds (see esp. vss. 25–30).
But the hymn also has several unusual features. The poet expresses a remarkable  degree of apprehension about the exercise of Indra’s powers and fear that they may  be turned against him and his comrades. Although a certain amount of such senti ment (as in the beginning of vs. 10) is not rare in Indra hymns, the sequence of verses  31–35, which begins with a plea to Indra not to do what he has in mind and seeks  to accomplish, a sharp reversal of the usual request, depicts men in fear of being  Indra’s targets—or perhaps even just of witnessing his terrifying hyper-power (see  vss. 32, 35)—and begging for his mercy. Already in verse 19 they expressed worry  about their shaky relationship with Indra, and the poet speaks of their “offenses”  in verse 34, a term more at home in an Ādityan context.
Even more striking are two snatches of dialogue, which bookend the hymn: the  first two verses of the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–5) and the first two verses of the penul timate tr̥ca (vss. 37–38). In the first pair the just-born Indra takes up a bow and  asks his mother about potential enemies, and she replies with what appears to be a  proverbial expression assuring him of his ultimate victory. (This scene has a close  parallel in VIII.77.1–2.) In verses 37–38 it seems (the verses are quite obscure and  uncontextualized) that Indra and the Maruts exchange slangy insults: in 37 Indra  reproaches the Maruts (not named but identified by one of their epithets) for not  honoring their partnership by even thinking of abandoning him, while they reply in  38 by suggesting that he should have thought of that before, when he was hogging  the soma. The unspoken context is the well-known episode when all the gods but the  Maruts abandon Indra before the Vr̥tra battle (see, e.g., VIII.96.7, using some of  the same vocabulary), and the Maruts later demand from Indra a share in the soma  sacrifice because they stood by him (see especially the dialogue hymn I.165). This  intriguingly deracinated exchange seems to have been suggested to the poet by verse  36, in which he himself hopes not to be deprived of a comrade. If Indra himself  could find himself deserted by his friends, how much more conceivable such a situa tion is for a mere mortal. This theme of comradeship was announced in the refrain  to the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and arises several times elsewhere in the hymn (vss. 16, 18).
Though the hymn does not have a clear structure—and its length would have  made such a structure difficult to apprehend in a performance situation—the  themes and concerns that keep surfacing give some sense of unity, and the two little  dialogues at the two ends of the hymn grab the attention.
1. Those who kindle the fire and strew the ritual grass in due order,
of whom Indra is the youthful comrade,
2. Lofty is their kindling wood, abundant their recitation, broad their  sacrificial post,
of whom Indra is the youthful comrade.
1120 VIII.45
3. Unembattled himself, in battle the champion drives the troop along  with his warriors,
of whom Indra is the youthful comrade.
4. The Vr̥tra-smiter took the Bunda-bow; just born, he asked his mother: “Which ones are powerful; which ones are famed?”
5. She, the strong one [/Śavasī], replied to you: “Like a wasp at a mountain  he will fight,
who desires rivalry with you.”
6. And you, o bounteous one—listen: “Who wishes (something) of you,  for that you exert your will.
What you will make firm, that is firm.”
7. When the setter of contests drives to the contest in search of good  horses, Indra
is the best charioteer of charioteers.
8. Rip apart all attackers, mace-bearer, as if into (a million) pieces. Become the one who most receives our praises.
9. Let Indra set our chariot in front to win,
he whom injuries do not injure.
10. May we avoid your hatred (and be) fit for you to give to, able one. May we go to (prizes) consisting of cattle, Indra—
11. O possessor of the (pressing) stone, (the soma drops), though they  move deliberately, are bringing horses and hundreds of cattle,
are strengthening and faultless.
12. For day after day your upright liberal spirit
is ready to give thousands, hundreds to the singers.
13. For we know you as winner of spoils, Indra, bursting even into the  fastnesses,
like one breaking into a household.
14. Let the drops exhilarate you, as lead horse, o sage poet, audacious one, when we beg you for a niggard:
15. The impious rich man who has neglected to give to you bounteously, bring his possessions here to us.
16. These comrades here, possessing the soma, watch out for you, Indra, as those who have flourishing (cattle) watch out for their livestock. 17. And you, who are not deaf but have listening ears,
do we call here from afar for help.
18. When you should hear this call here, you should do (a deed) difficult to  forget, and then
you would become our most intimate friend. 19. For even though we’ve thought that we’ve been going a wayward course  to you,
still become for us a giver of cows, Indra.
20. As elderly men grasp a staff, we have grasped hold of you, lord of  strength.
We want you in our seat.
21. Sing a praise song to Indra, the warrior of much manliness,
whom none obstruct in battle.
22. When it has been pressed, I set you loose on the pressed (soma) to drink  it, o bull.
Become satiated; come through to exhilaration.
23. Let not the greedy dolts, let not the deriders deceive you.
Do not cherish those who hate the sacred formulation.
24. Here let the (soma drinks) with their profusion of cows [=milk]
exhilarate you to generosity.
Drink a lake, as a buffalo does.
25. Those (deeds) that the Vr̥tra-smiter set in motion afar, both the old ones  and the new,
proclaim these at the assemblies:
26. Indra drank the pressed (soma) of Kadrū for that which possesses a  thousand-arms [=battle?].
Then he displayed his own masculine power.
27. This is real: having obtained at Turvaśa’s and Yadu’s what is not to be  spurned [=soma],
he came through to victory by his labor.
28. I laud him to you as the surpassing one, as driller of the bovine prize  for the peoples,
and as one common (to all)—
29. As the master of the R̥bhus, not to be obstructed, as the strengthener of  the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu] (do I laud him) in solemn words
when the soma is pressed—Indra!
30. Who cut apart the broad, womblike mountain for Triśoka,
as a way for the cows to go forth.
31. What you take on, have in mind, and, becoming exhilarated, set out to  accomplish,
don’t do that, Indra. Have mercy!
32. For even a paltry deed of one such as you is famed on earth.
Let your mind go (to us?), Indra.
33. Just yours will be these glorifications and encomia,
when, Indra, you will be merciful to us.
1122 VIII.46
34. Don’t smite us at a single offense, nor at two or three,
nor at many, o champion.
35. For I am afraid of one such as you—powerful, shattering,
wondrous, vanquishing with his attack.
36. Let me not find the lack of a comrade, nor of a son, o you of
outstanding goods.
Let your mind be turned here.
37. [Indra to Maruts:] “You young bucks—who, (as if) unpaired, has said,  as comrade to comrade,
‘I will leave (you)’? Who retreats from us?”
38. [Maruts to Indra:] “Hey bull. So—when (the soma) was pressed, being  insatiable you consumed a lot,
sashaying around the lower depths like a guy with ‘the dog-killer’ [=the  winning throw at dice].”
39. I hold onto these two fallow bays of yours, yoked by speech, along with  their chariot,
so that you will give to the formulators.
40. Split off all hatreds; parry oppressions. Smite the slighters.
The craved good thing—bring that here.
41. What is in a firm place, what in a solid place, Indra, what has been  borne away into a deep place—
the craved good thing—bring that here.
42. The abundance given by you that the whole people of Manu
will know—
the craved good thing—bring that here.
## 46 (666) Indra (1–20), Dānastuti (21–24), Vāyu (25–28),  Dānastuti (29–33)
Vaśa Aśvya
33 verses: a variety of lyric meters combining 8- and 12- and 4-syllable pādas
This hymn has been called the most metrically varied hymn in the R̥gveda: it con tains verses of nearly twenty different meters, although all the verses that allow  analysis appear to be made up of the standard building blocks of eight-, twelve-,  and four-syllable pādas in various combinations. (Some irresolvable irregularities  remain.) For the most part, the verses are grouped into two-verse pairs (anomalous  pragāthas), but the hymn begins with a tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), and the metrically messy  verses 14–16 also appear to form a tr̥ca. The two dānastuti sections (vss. 21–24  and 29–33), broken by two pragāthas to Vāyu, show no internal metrical struc ture. The meter is discussed by Oldenberg with his characteristic acuity both in the  Prolegomena (1888: 109–10) and in the Noten. The hymn is miscellaneous in content as well. It begins and continues for some  time as a fairly standard Indra hymn, insistently focused on begging Indra for gifts  of all sorts. The Indra section continues through verse 20, but becomes more and  more problematic, with metrical and syntactic difficulties reinforcing each other.  Verses 14–16 are metrically almost unanalyzable, and they consist in great part of  syntactic fragments the relationships among which are difficult to construct. Verse  17 (paired in a pragātha with 18) equally resists metrical and exegetical certainty,  but introduces the Maruts as a counterweight to Indra; in verse 18 we return to  more rational metrical structure and, to some degree, analyzable syntax. The last  two verses of the Indra section (19–20) are fairly straightforward and bring the  praise of Indra to a conclusion with an explosion of adjectives (the first hemistich  of 20 is also made entirely of vocatives).
The remaining thirteen verses of the hymn consist of three almost equal parts: two  dānastutis (vss. 21–24, 29–33), interrupted by a dānastuti-tinged section addressed  to the wind god Vāyu, who participates in the Morning Pressing, when the priestly  gifts are distributed. Both dānastutis mention extravagant numbers of livestock. In  the first the poet Vaśa Aśvya mentions himself (vs. 21) and his patron Pr̥thuśravas  Kānita (vss. 21, 24); the final verse (24) of this first dānastuti has a distinctly sum
mary tone and clearly spells out the cause-and-effect relation between gifts and fame.  The second dānastuti mentions a more various set of patrons, and the poet names  himself in the final verse (33), as a “great maiden,” clearly his favorite gift, is brought  toward him. The diction and style of both dānastutis is straightforward; they lack  the sly puns and clever insult-as-praise and praise-as-insult that characterize many  dānastutis and seem intent only on counting up the spoils. The four intervening  verses (25–28) describes Vāyu’s dawn journey to the sacrifice, but it is made clear  that his purpose there is to give, or (vs. 27) to motivate the patron to give, to the poet.
1. To such a one as you, Indra, you leader with many goods,
do we belong, you mounter of the fallow bays.
2. For we know you, possessor of the stone, as real, as giver of
refreshments;
we know you as giver of riches—
3. You, of a hundred forms of help and a hundred resolves, whose
greatness
the bards hymn with hymns.
4. That mortal has good guidance whom the Maruts, whom Aryaman and Mitra protect—those without deceit.
5. Acquiring (wealth) in cows and horses and an abundance of heroes,  impelled by the Ādityas, he flares up
with much craved wealth always.
6. We beseech this Indra for a gift, him swelling with strength, fearless— we beseech the lord of wealth for wealth.1124 VIII.46
7. For in him exist all fearless forms of help altogether.
Let the spans convey him hither, who has many goods; let the fallow  bays convey him to the pressed (soma) for exhilaration.
8. Your exhilaration, which is worthy to be chosen, which is the most  Vr̥tra-smiting, o Indra,
which with superior men takes the sun, which is difficult to surpass in  battles—
9. Which, difficult to surpass, worthy of fame, is the overcomer in the  prize-contests, o you who grant all wishes—
you, o strongest good one—come here to our pressings. May we go to a  pen full of cows.
10. At our desire for cows, for horses, and for chariots, (now) just as before, create wide space for us, you greatly great one.
11. For I do not find a limit to your generosity in any way, o champion. Show favor to us, bounteous possessor of the stone, even now. You have  aided our poetic insights with your prizes.
12. The lofty one who makes his comrade famous, he, praised by many,  knows all the races.
Through the human lifespans they all call on him, on Indra the
powerful, with their offering ladles extended.
13. He will become our helper in the prize-contests—he of many goods, the  one who stands in front, the bounteous Vr̥tra-smiter.
14. Sing to the hero amid the raptures of the stalk; with a great hymn (sing)  to the discriminating one,
Indra by name, worthy of fame, capable like speech.
15. (You are by nature) one who gives a legacy to the body [=a son], who  gives goods, who gives a prizewinner in the prize-contests, o much  invoked one—
now then (do so)!
16. (Sing to him) who has control of all goods, who also, when he is  victorious, has control of this form (of his?),
(and has control) over those who yearn (for him). Now then!
17. We shall praise you great ones [=Maruts] for the rewarder fit for  nourishment, who comes fittingly, who comes regularly [=Indra]. Through the sacrifices and the hymns of all the peoples of Manu, you  [=Indra] are likely to attain (the favor) of the Maruts.
I sing to you reverently with a hymn.
18. Those who launch themselves in flight on their drives along the backs  of the mountains—
the sacrifice of those greatly noisy ones, the favor of those powerfully  noisy ones (you are likely to attain) while the ceremony is pro(ceeding). 19. O strongest Indra, bring here the shatterer of bad thoughts,
(namely) wealth to be harnessed for us, o you who stir thought—
preeminent (wealth), o you who stir thought.
20. O winner, good winner, powerful, brilliant, most brilliant, liberal-spirited, sovereign king, (bring wealth) victorious through victory,
victory-winning, enjoyable, foremost at the prize-contests.
21. Let him come here—any non-god who has taken as great a gift
as Vaśa Aśvya has taken from Pr̥thuśravas Kānita at the dawning of  this (dawn) here.
22. I have won sixty thousands in equine property, myriads, twenty
hundreds of camels,
ten hundreds of dusky mares, ten of those with three red spots, ten
thousands of cows.
23. Ten dusky (stallions), following wealth to fulfillment,
straight-tailed, swift,
skittish, have turned the felly homeward.
24. These are the gifts of Pr̥thuśravas Kānita, the very generous.
In giving a golden chariot, he has become the most bounteous patron. He has made his fame the highest.
25. Vāyu, drive here to us for the extension and the spread (of our line) to  be great and for bounty.
For we have performed (a sacrifice) for you, for you to give much, to  give greatly all at once.
26. As the one who drives here with his horses at the breaking of the day— with the thrice seven seventies—
(invigorated) with these soma drinks by the soma-pressers, (be ready) to  give, you soma-drinker, drinker of the clear purified (soma).
27. The one of good resolve who by his breath invigorated just this man  here, to give something brilliant to me
in the axle made of araṭu wood, in the presence of Nahuṣa, who is a  good performer (of rituals) for (a god) who performs even better,
28. You who are an independent king, in a wondrous form worthy of praise  and bathed in ghee, o Vāyu—
this drive (of yours), horse-impelled, dust-impelled, dog-impelled,
pro(ceeds). Here it is now!
29. Now then, I have won something dear to the vigorous one, sixty  thousand
(geldings, which are) just like stallions.
30. Like cattle to their herd, the geldings approach, the geldings
approach me.
31. Then when in a roving band [=caravan] a hundred camels roared, then (I took) twenty hundreds from the Śvitnas.
1126 VIII.47
32. I, the inspired poet, took a hundred from Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa. These are your peoples here, Vāyu. With Indra as protector they
become exhilarated; with the gods as protectors they become
exhilarated.
33. And now this great maiden, facing Vaśa Aśvya,
with bright ornaments upon her, is led forth.
## 47 (667) Ādityas
Trita Āptya
18 verses: mahāpaṅkti
The first two-thirds of this hymn (through vs. 12) beg the Ādityas for general help  and protection from generic evils—the nonspecific nature of what is requested  underlined by the rather redundantly phrased refrain. The refrain continues through  the last third of the hymn (vss. 13–18), but in the non-refrain portions the focus nar
rows—to the elimination of the “bad dream,” which is sent far away to the shadowy  figure called Trita Āptya. Nothing else in the scraps of mythology we know about  Trita Āptya explains why he should be the scapegoated recipient of our nightmares,  much less why he would make them into body ornaments (vs. 15) or use them as  food and work (vs. 16). The agent who removes the bad dream to Trita is Dawn (vss.  14–16, 18), whose participation is easier to understand—as anyone knows who has  experienced the relief of waking in the morning to discover that the nightmares just  experienced were not real.
1. Great is the help, of (all of) you who are great, for the pious man, o  Varuṇa and Mitra.
Whomever you protect from deceit, o Ādityas, evil will not reach him. – Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
2. You know how to make evils stay away, o gods, o Ādityas.
Like birds their wings, spread your shelter out above us.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
3. Spread that shelter out over us, like birds their wings.
We revere all things providing defense, o you who possess all
possessions.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
4. Mankind—to which the attentive ones gave peaceful dwelling and  livelihood—
over all its wealth do these Ādityas hold sway.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
5. Evils will avoid us, as charioteers avoid hard places.
Might we be in the shelter of Indra and the help of the Ādityas.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help. 6. It is only by a crooked course that in such a way a man becomes lost to  what is given by you.
O gods, o Ādityas, it’s not a trifle that he obtained from you—the man  whom you spurred on.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
7. Negligence, sharp or weighty, will never beset him
to whom you, Ādityas, have given broad shelter.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
8. We abide in you, o gods, like fighters in armor.
You—deliver us from a great offense; you—from a small one.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
9. Let Aditi deliver us; let Aditi spread her shelter—
the mother of rich Mitra, of Aryaman and Varuṇa.
–Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
10. That sheltering shelter, o gods, beneficial and without damage,
providing threefold defense—spread that out over us.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
11. For you, o Ādityas, gaze down (on us), like spies from a hillside.
You will lead us along an easy way like steeds to an easy ford.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
12. There is no benefit for the demonic here, for him to descend and to  come near.
There is benefit for the milk-giving cow and for the hero seeking fame. – Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
13. Whatever is ill-done in the open, whatever in secret, o gods,
all that set on Trita Āptya, far away from us.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
14. The bad dream in the cattle and the one in us, o Daughter of Heaven— carry it away to Trita Āptya, o far-radiant one.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
15. He will make (it) his neck ornament or his garland, o Daughter of  Heaven—
the whole bad dream we consign to Trita Āptya.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
16. To the one who has it as his food and as his work, to the one reverently  approaching it as his portion—
to Trita and to Dvita, o Dawn, carry the bad dream.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
17. Just as we bring back a sixteenth, then an eighth, then the
(whole) debt,
even so we bring the whole bad dream to Āptya.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
1128 VIII.48
18. We have conquered today and we have won; we have become free  of blame.
O Dawn, the bad dream which we have feared, let (dawn) dawn it away. – Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 48 (668) Soma
Pragātha Kaṇva
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 5
This well-known and frequently translated hymn is one of the very few dedicated to  Soma outside of the IXth Maṇḍala, and as such does not concern “self-purifying”  Soma (Soma Pavamāna), the subject of that maṇḍala. The preparation of soma  is not treated here, save for a single reference (vs. 7) to it as “pressed.” Instead the  emphasis is on soma’s effects, “when drunk” (pītá vss. 4, 5, 10, 12), on the drinker.  The immediate effect is euphoria; as in the famous exultant boast in verse 3 “we  have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we have  found the gods.” The soma produces a sense of space and boundlessness (vss. 1, 2,  5) while, paradoxically, being confined in the drinker’s body (vss. 2, 9, 10) and hold ing this body together (vs. 5). The temporal equivalent of this spatial expansion is  the wish constantly expressed to “lengthen our lifetime” (vss. 4, 7, 10, 11). Soma is  thus characterized by vitality, or life force, which he also confers on the drinker: the  first and last verses of the hymn contain this signature word váyas.
The mood in the second half of the hymn darkens slightly. Though the poet still  sees Soma as his protector and kindly comrade, he senses the threats that cause  him to need that protection—threats from outside (vs. 8), from his own imperfect  actions (vs. 9), and even from soma itself (vs. 10). Though he ultimately pronounces  the threats vanquished (vs. 11), the mood of sheer exuberance has been broken.
The final few verses (12–14) take a more ritual turn, with our ceremonial dedica tion of an oblation to soma, in his connection with the forefathers (who themselves  receive soma, as is made clear elsewhere). The ancestor cult thus briefly surfaces  here, and the emphasis throughout the hymn on lengthening our lifetimes (on  earth) may provide a counterpoint to the ritually shaped afterlife inhabited by our  ancestors.
1. I of good wisdom have partaken of the vitality of the sweet drink, which  is rich in purpose and excellent at finding wide space,
which all the gods and mortals, calling it honey, converge upon.
2. When you have gone within, you will become Aditi [/boundlessness],  appeaser of divine wrath.
Drop, enjoying the comradeship of Indra, like an obedient mare
following the chariot-pole, you should follow riches to fulfillment. 3. We have drunk the soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to  the light; we have found the gods.
What can hostility do to us now, and what the malice of a mortal, o  immortal one?
4. Become weal for our heart when drunk, o drop, very kindly, like a  father to a son,
like a comrade to a comrade, you who are widely proclaimed as
insightful. Lengthen our lifetime, for us to live, Soma.
5. These glorious (drops), when drunk, seek wide space. As cows [=leather  straps] do a chariot, it [=soma] knots (me) together in my joints.
Let the drops guard me from my foot slipping, and let them keep me  away from lameness.
6. You have enflamed me like a churned fire. Make us conspicuous; make  us better off,
for now in the exhilaration of you, Soma, I think of myself as a rich  man. I shall advance to prosperity.
7. With a vigorous mind we would take a share of you when pressed, as of  ancestral wealth.
King Soma, lengthen our lifetimes, like the sun the dawning days.
8. King Soma, be merciful to us with well-being. We are under your  commandment: know this.
Potency and battle fervor are on the rise, o drop. Don’t hand us over (to  the battle fervor) of the stranger, at his wish.
9. For as protector of our body, Soma, you have settled down in every  limb, having your eyes on men.
If we will confound your commandments, be merciful to us, as our
good comrade, all the more, o god.
10. Might I be accompanied by a tender-hearted comrade, who would not  harm me when it has been drunk, o possessor of fallow bay horses.
This soma here that has been deposited in us—for it I go to Indra to  lengthen our lifetime.
11. These famines and diseases have gone off. Those allied to darkness have  shied away; they have become afraid.
Soma has mounted us to his full extent. We have gone to where they  lengthen lifetime.
12. O forefathers, the drop that, once drunk, entered into our hearts, the  immortal into the mortals,
to this Soma we would do ceremonial honor with an oblation. May we  be in his mercy and good grace.
13. You, Soma, coming to agreement with the forefathers, extend through  heaven and earth.
To you, drop, we would do ceremonial honor with an oblation. May we  be lords of riches.
1130 VIII.48
14. Protector Gods, speak on our behalf. Let sleep not master us, nor  mumbling.
May we, always dear to Soma, possessed of good heroes, announce the  ceremonial honor.
15. You, o Soma, confer vitality on us on all sides; you, as finder of the sun,  possessing the eye of men—enter us.
You, o drop, along with your help—protect us from behind and also  from in front.
Vālakhilya Hymns
The following eleven hymns (VIII.49–59) are known as the Vālakhilya hymns.  These are apocryphal or, in Geldner’s felicitous description, “half-apocryphal”  (halbapokryph). A  number of khilāni or apocrypha were transmitted in the  R̥gvedic tradition, but only these eleven (or, in some other reported recensions,  somewhat fewer) were inserted into and transmitted within the R̥gveda Saṃhitā
itself, as well as in the khilāni collections. Moreover, these eleven were trans mitted with accents and were treated in the Padapāṭha, the Anukramaṇī (save  for the tenth, VIII.58), and so forth, though they were not commented on by  Sāyaṇa in his R̥gvedic commentary. In our R̥gveda recension, the Śākalya, they  were inserted between the sixth and seventh anuvākas of VIII, though they are  reported to appear elsewhere in other recensions, not always in a single group.  The Grassmann numbers, 1018–1028, reflect the status of these hymns as addi tions to the original saṃhitā.
The text of these hymns is in general less well transmitted than the rest of  the R̥gveda, and the hymns themselves sometimes have the air of a school exer cise. Notable in this connection is the fact that the first eight hymns proceed in  pairs, each pair dedicated to the same divinity (except for a few verses in the  third pair, VIII.53–54) and containing the same number of verses in the same  meter (except for a few verses in the last pair, VIII.55–56). Moreover, the first  pair (VIII.49–50) and, to a much lesser extent, the second pair (VIII.51–52)  follow the same model, verse by verse, often using identical or near identical  vocabulary but varying grammar, or else employing transparent lexical sub
stitution but keeping the grammar the same, and one can imagine that the  two hymns represent separate realizations of a set pedagogical task. However,  whatever the reason for their coupling, the pairs afford us interesting insights  into the composition of R̥gvedic hymns. For this reason, as well as the fact  that puzzles in one hymn of the pair are sometimes illuminated by the parallel  passages in the other, we will comment on the first two sets of paired hymns  together. VIII.49 (1018) Indra
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
10 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 50.
This pair of hymns follows a standard trajectory: the poet exhorts himself to praise  Indra for his generosity and his power, and then invites Indra to partake of the  soma at his sacrifice, traveling with his fallow bays from wherever he might be. The  final pragātha asks Indra to provide the same help and largesse as he has on other  occasions at the sacrifices of other, named individuals.
The interest in these two hymns lies in the interplay between the quite strict  parallelism in parts of each verse and the freedom with which the poet treats the  variable portions. There is no space here for a full catalogue of the correspondences,  but a few telling patterns will be noted. First, despite the pervasive parallelism there  are no repeated pādas between the hymns. The initial verses of the two hymns (49.1,  50.1) are perhaps the most fully parallel, and in subsequent verses the beginnings  and ends of pādas and half lines are more likely to be parallel than the middles,  not surprisingly given the salience of these positions. Responsion can take a num ber of different forms. Frequently there is exact responsion, as in 49/50.6c udrī́va  vajrinn avatáḥ...“Like a well-spring full of water, o mace-bearer....” Single-word  repetitions will ordinarily take the same metrical position, as in the pāda-final  surā́dhasam of 49/50.1a. Derivationally different synonyms can correspond, as in  49.5c svadáyanti / 50.5c svádanti, both “they sweeten”; similarly, to stems belonging  to the same root but with different nuances, 49.10c ásanoḥ “you won” versus 50.10c  ásiṣāsaḥ “you sought to win.” Or an expanded phrase can take the place of a single  word, as in 49.8b vā́tā iva “like the winds” versus 50.8b ójo vā́tasya “the power  of the wind.” Synonyms or functionally identical words can respond, as in 49.5b  (d)hiyānó áśvo ná “being spurred on like a horse” and 50.5b iyānó átyo ná “being  sped like a steed,” where the morphology and word order are identical, but the lexi cal realization entirely different. Phonological correspondence is not neglected, as  in the adjectives in the parallel phrases 49.8a ajirā́so hárayaḥ “nimble fallow bays”  and 50.8a rathirā́so hárayaḥ “fallow bays fit for the chariot.” And of course there is  rough semantic parallelism throughout the two hymns, even when there is no lexi cal, morphological, syntactic, or phonological identity. It is also the case that one  of the pair can provide the answer to an obscurity in the other, as in 49.2a where  śatānīkeva “like (something) with a hundred facets” responds to 50.2a śatānīkā
hetáyaḥ “missiles with a hundred facets,” where the comparandum is explicit.
1. Chant forth to Indra, the very generous, in the way that is known— who as a bounteous one possessing many goods—by the thousands, as it  were—exerts himself for you singers.
2. Like (a missile) with a hundred facets he advances boldly. He smashes  obstacles for the pious man.
1132 VIII.50
Like the juices [=streams] of a much-nourishing mountain his gifts  swell forth.
3. The pressed drops that are your exhilarating drinks, o Indra who longs  for songs,
fill you, o mace-bearer, like waters a pond, following the accustomed  way, for your generosity, o champion.
4. Faultless, (life-)extending, strengthening—the sweetest of
honey—drink it,
so that becoming exhilarated, you will by yourself boldly scatter forth  (goods) to us like specks (of dust).
5. Being spurred on like a horse by the pressers, (come) at a run to our praise, which the milk-cows and the gifts sweeten for you, autonomous Indra,  among the Kaṇvas.
6. With homage we reverently approach (you) like a powerful hero, the  distinguished one dispensing imperishable goods.
Like a wellspring full of water for the one who pours it out, the poetic  thoughts flow (for you), Indra, bearer of the mace.
7. Whether now (you are) either at (another’s) sacrifice or (elsewhere) on  the earth,
from there come here to our sacrifice with your swift (horses), you of  great thought, powerful with your powerful (ones).
8. Nimble are your fallow bays, which are swift and overpowering like  the winds,
with which you speed around the progeny of Manu, with which (you  speed around) the whole (world), (for it) to see the sun.
9. We beg for such great cattle-bringing benevolence of yours, Indra, as when you helped Medhyātithi, o bounteous one, as when (you
helped) Nīpātithi to spoils—
10. Just as at Kaṇva’s, at Trasadasyu’s, o bounteous one, as at Paktha  Daśavraja’s,
just as at Gośarya R̥jiśvan’s, Indra, you won (wealth) in cattle and gold.
## 50 (1019) Indra
Puṣṭigu Kāṇva
10 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 49.
1. Chant forth to the famed, very generous, able one for his dominance, who grants to the presser and to the praiser desirable goods, by the  thousands as it were. 2. His missiles with a hundred facets are difficult to overcome, the great  projectiles of Indra.
Like a beneficial mountain he swells among the bounteous ones when  the pressed (soma drinks) have exhilarated him.
3. When the pressed drops have exhilarated the dear one,
like waters my pressing has been deposited (in you), good one, (and it  will be) like milking cows for the pious.
4. Your [=poets’] thoughts of honey flow to the faultless (soma), which is  calling for help.
The drops, calling on you [=Indra], good one, have been set among the  praisers.
5. Being sped like a steed, he [=Indra] streams to our soma, good at the  ceremony,
which our greetings sweeten for you, self-giving one. At Paura’s you
take pleasure in the invocation.
6. (Chant) forth to the powerful hero, the discriminating one who gains  the stakes, the distinguished one of great generosity.
Like a wellspring full of water, mace-bearer, you always swell goods for  the pious man.
7. Whether now (you are) at a distance either on earth or in heaven, hitching up with your fallow bays, o Indra of great thought, come here,  lofty with your lofty (horses)—
8. Fit for the chariot are your fallow bays, which, unfailing, cross over the  power of the wind,
with which you made the Dasyu heed because of Manu, with which  you speed around the sun.
9. Might we know such help of yours anew, o champion,
as when you helped Etaśa when the stake was to be decided, as (you  helped) Vaśa at Daśavraja’s.
10. Just as at Kaṇva’s, o bounteous one, at the ritual offering, at the  ceremony, beside (Agni), the domestic leader of long counsel,
just as at Gośarya’s you sought winnings, you possessor of the stone, at  my side (win) a cowpen splendid with fallow bays.
## 51 (1020) Indra
Śruṣṭigu Kāṇva
10 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 52.
By contrast to VIII.49–50, the parallelism of these two hymns is quite muted and  surfaces only occasionally. Not only are strict responsions rare, but the develop ment of the thought in each hymn is quite distinct, though both focus on Indra as1134 VIII.51
generous giver. The correspondence between the two hymns is clearest at the begin ning: both hymns have almost identical initial verses, save for the personal names  of the human hosts. These verses also have the same structure as the final verses  of VIII.49–50.10. There is also some verbal responsion in the beginning of verses  3 and 5, throughout much of verse 6, and at the beginning of verse 7, and there  are also correspondences that cross verse lines, for instance, 51.6c=52.4c táṃ tvā vayám...“we you...,” with the continuation of that pāda (51.6c) maghavann indra
girvaṇaḥ “o bounteous Indra who longs for songs” matched in 52.8a. As just noted, both hymns are primarily concerned to stimulate Indra to generos ity. In VIII.51 are interspersed several obscure references to unknown sagas: verse 2  with the old, prone Praskaṇva set upright (Praskaṇva figures also in nearby VIII.54.8,  but only as beneficiary of Indra’s largesse, and he is the poet to whom I.44–50 as well  as VIII.49, the first Vālakhilya hymn, are attributed) and Indra’s defeat of Krivi (vs.  8). And in verses 4 and 8, in identical language, an apparently miraculous birth follows  ritual and cosmogonic activity. One of these acts is the chanting of a “seven-headed,  threefold chant in the highest footstep” (vs. 4), and a stripped-down version of the  same phrase, “they chanted the chant” is found in the final verse (10), with the current  poets as subject, thus implicitly attributing cosmogonic powers to the poets of today. The construction of VIII.52 is far less orderly than that of 51. It is characterized  by subordinate clauses that lack main clauses (e.g., vss. 2, 3), lack of grammatical  agreement between apparently coreferential entities (e.g., sg. “whose” picked up  by “we” in vs. 4; similar disharmony in vs. 8), and a general looseness of structure  especially in the verses that lack all responsion to 51. If this was a school exercise,  perhaps it was an unsuccessful one.
1. Just as at Manu Sāṃvaraṇi’s you drank pressed soma, Indra,
and at Nīpātithi’s, at Medhyātithi’s, (do so) at Puṣṭigu’s, at Śruṣṭigu’s,  bounteous one.
2. Pārṣadvāṇa made old Praskaṇva, who was lying down, sit upright  together (with him, at a sacrificial session?).
The seer sought to win thousands of cattle; Dasyave Vr̥ka was aided  by you.
3. He who cannot get enough of hymns, who is the observant stimulator  of seers,
to this Indra speak with a newer thought, to give sustenance to him like  a man greedy for food.
4. He for whom they chanted the seven-headed, threefold chant in the  highest footstep,
that one made all these worlds cry out. Right after that his masculine  nature was born.
5. He who is the giver of goods to us, that Indra we invoke,
for we know his ever newer favor. Might we go to a pen full of cattle. 6. He to whom you exert yourself to give, o good one, that one achieves  the thriving of wealth.
We, who have pressed (the soma), invoke you, o bounteous Indra who  longs for songs.
7. Never are you a barren cow, nor, Indra, do you go dry for the
pious man.
Over and over, more and more, the gift coming from you, the god,
becomes engorged.
8. He who attained Krivi by his strength, while making Śuṣṇa heed with  his murderous weapons,
just when he propped up yonder heaven as he spread it out, right after  that the earth dweller was born.
9. You to whom every Ārya here belongs, every Dāsa, every
treasure-guarding stranger,
even across (all these) (come) to the Arya Ruśama Parīru. There there is  wealth anointed just for you.
10. The eager inspired poets have chanted a honeyed, ghee-dripping chant. Among us wealth spreads out and bullish power; among us are the
drops being pressed.
## 52 (1021) Indra
Āyu Kāṇva
10 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas. Parallel to 51.
1. Just as at Manu Vivasvant’s you drank pressed soma, able one,
just as at Trita’s you will enjoy the poem, Indra, (even so) at Āyu’s you  bring yourself to exhilaration—
2. (Just as) at Pr̥ṣadhra’s, at Medhya’s, at Mātariśvan’s, Indra, you became  exhilarated on the (soma) being pressed,
just as at Daśasipra’s, at Daśoṇya’s, at Syūmaraśmi’s, at R̥jūnas’ (you  drank) the soma.
3. He who took as his own the hymns, who boldly drank the soma,
for whom Viṣṇu strode his three steps, according to the institutes of their  alliance ...
4. In whose praises, Indra, you will take pleasure when the prize (is set), you  prizewinner of a hundred resolves...
Eager for fame, we call to you, as milkers call on a cow who gives
good milk.
1136 VIII.53
5. Who is a giver to us, he is our father—great, powerful, performing the  master’s part.
Even without our begging, let the powerful bounteous one who
possesses many goods give to us of cow and horse.
6. He to whom you are ready to give, o good one, that one spurs the  thriving of wealth.
Seeking goods, with praises we call on the lord of goods possessing a  hundred resolves: Indra.
7. Never do you stay away; you protect both breeds [=gods and men]. O fourth Āditya, the invocation destined for you, for Indra, has
mounted to the immortal (world?) in heaven.
8. For whatever pious one, o bounteous Indra who long for songs, you  muster your abilities, able one—
listen to our songs and lovely praise, o good one, to our call, like that of  the Kaṇvas.
9. The age-old thought has been expressed as praise. Speak the sacred  formulation to Indra.
Many lofty (songs) of truth have roared; the wise thoughts of the
praiser have been released.
10. Indra shook together lofty riches, together the two opponents [=Heaven  and Earth], together the sun.
Together the gleaming pure soma-drinks, together those mixed with
milk, have exhilarated Indra.
## 53 (1022) Indra
Medhya Kāṇva
8 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas.
A fairly conventional Indra hymn, which begins with a string of superlatives  applied to Indra and praise for his previous deeds (vss. 1–2) and then proceeds to  the invitation to the soma sacrifice (vss. 3–4). The poet asks Indra for the usual ben efits: wealth and aid, but he is especially concerned with winning in prize-contests  and battle raids. See especially verses 6–8.
1. You, the best of bounteous ones and most preeminent of bulls,
best stronghold-splitter, o bounteous Indra, finder of cows, lord of
wealth do we beseech for wealth.
2. You who set Āyu, Kutsa, Atithigva to shaking, while growing stronger  every day,
you do we invoke, seeking prizes—you of the fallow bay horses,
possessing a hundred resolves. 3. Let the stones pour out the honey’s juice of all of us—
the drops that have been pressed in the distance among (other) peoples,  and those that have been pressed nearby.
4. Smash all hatreds and bring them low. Let all (of us) win goods.
Even among the Śīṣṭas there are invigorating shoots for you, where you  become sated on soma.
5. Indra, come closer here with your help that provides secure wisdom— here, most wealful one with your most wealful superior powers, here,  friendly one with your friendly powers.
6. Make the lord of the settlements surpassing in the contest, governing all  domains, sharer in offspring.
With your powers lengthen (the lifetime of those) who, equipped with  solemn words, purify your resolve following the proper order,
7. (Your resolve) to help which best brings success. Might we be yours in  the bouts.
May we consider ourselves winners through our libations and
invocations to the gods.
8. For I, seeking the prize, enter the contest for the sacred formulation  always with your help, you of the fallow bays.
Seeking horses, seeking cows, I pledge myself just to you, at the
beginning of raids.
## 54 (1023) Indra (1–2, 5–8), All Gods (3–4)
Mātariśvan Kāṇva
8 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
Despite being technically twinned with VIII.53, this hymn has little in common  with its predecessor. However, verse 6 not only shares the concern for winning that  characterized the previous hymn, but also shares some of its phraseology: it begins  with a compound of ā́ji “contest” and two compounds with -pati “lord,” closely  paralleling VIII.53.6a, and much of the second half of the verse matches the second  half of VIII.53.7.
The three pragāthas dedicated to Indra (vss. 1–2, 5–6, 7–8) are interrupted by  one to the All Gods, an elementary listing of various groups of gods (vs. 3) and  individual gods and natural forces (vs. 4). The verses to Indra beg him to display  his generosity.
1. This heroic deed of yours, Indra, the bards sing with songs.
Beating time they furthered the nourishment dripping with ghee. The  Pauras approach with their visionary thoughts.
1138 VIII.55
2. With their good (ritual) work they approach Indra for help—they at  whose pressings you reach exhilaration.
Just as you became exhilarated at Saṃvarta’s, at Kr̥śa’s, just so become  exhilarated among us.
3. All you gods joined in revelry, come here to us.
The Vasus, the Rudras will come here to help us. Let the Maruts hear  our call.
4. Let Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, Sarasvatī aid my calling, let the Seven Streams.
Let the Waters, the Wind, the Mountains, the Lord of the Forest, let  Earth hear my call.
5. What bounteous generosity is yours, most bounteous Indra,
with that become a feasting companion for our strengthening, become  Bhaga for giving, o Vr̥tra-smasher.
6. Because just you are lord of contests, lord of men, convey us to the prize,  o you of good resolve.
By their (ritual) pursuit, by their oblations and by their pursuits of the  gods, they have become far famed as winners.
7. For the hopes of the stranger come true: in Indra is the lifetime of the  peoples.
Approach us, to help, bounteous one. Milk out swelling refreshment.
8. Might we do honor to you, Indra, with praises. You are ours, you of a  hundred resolves.
Great, sturdy, enduring, unabashed generosity—make it spill down for  Praskaṇva.
## 55 (1024) Dānastuti of Praskaṇva
Krś̥ a Kāṇva
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–2, 4, anuṣṭubh 3, 5
Although the Anukramaṇī identifies this hymn as a dānastuti of Praskaṇva by Kr̥śa  Kāṇva, as Geldner points out, it is more likely a dānastuti by Praskaṇva (mentioned  in the last verse of the previous hymn, VIII.54.8) to Dasyave Vr̥ka, mentioned in  the first verse of this one.
This little hymn begins almost like a parody of the great proclamations of great  deeds such as I.32: the poet briskly announces that he’s finished with his catalogue  of Indra’s heroic deeds and can now turn to the praise of his patron’s generosity.  The following two verses (2–3) list a miscellany of gifts, including some odd ones.  He then praises the Kaṇvas in general (vs. 4) and returns to the gift in the final verse (5). Its sevenfold nature (if that’s what the word means here: it’s disputed) is not  achieved until the end: the items listed in verses 2–3 add up to six groups, but with  the mares of 5ab we reach seven.
1. Since I have just abundantly surveyed the heroism of Indra, your
generosity
will now follow, Dasyave Vr̥ka.
2. A hundred gleaming white oxen shine like the stars in heaven;
with their might they seem to prop up heaven itself.
3. A hundred bamboo stalks, a hundred dogs, a hundred tanned hides, a hundred ewes with tufts like balbaja-grass, four hundred ruddy (cows)  (did you give me).
4. You have the gods well on your side, you descendants of Kaṇva. Passing  from strength to strength
like horses they keep pace.
5. From here on they will keep paying tribute to the sevenfold (gift). Great  is the praise of (the gift) that lacks nothing.
When the dusky (mares) dust over the paths, they are not to be
encompassed by the eye.
## 56 (1025) Dānastuti of Praskaṇva (1–4), Agni and Sūrya (5)
Prṣ̥ adhra Kāṇva
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–4, paṅkti 5
Like the preceding hymn, this is more likely a dānastuti by Praskaṇva of his patron  Dasyave Vr̥ka (once again mentioned in vs. 1) than of Praskaṇva. The hymn follows  the general pattern of VIII.55: the generosity of the patron is praised in the first  verse, and the details of the gifts follow, especially in verses 3 and 4. The latter verse  describes the presentation of an adorned female whose identity is disputed, as the  readings of the R̥gveda and the khila collections differ. Some scholars consider her  to be Pūtakratu’s wife, thus the patron’s mother or stepmother, but the daughter of  Pūtakratu’s wife (following the R̥gveda reading with some minor adjustment), the  patron’s sister or half-sister, might make more sense. The final verse (5) to Agni and  Sūrya marks the moment of the kindling of the ritual fire at sunrise, when the ritual  gifts are distributed.
1. Your immoderate generosity has just been seen, Dasyave Vr̥ka—
Your capacious power is like heaven in its extent.
2. To me Dasyave Vr̥ka, son of Pūtakratu,
granted ten thousands from his own wealth.
3. A hundred donkeys for me, a hundred wooly ewes,
a hundred slaves, and garlands beyond that.
1140 VIII.57–58
4. Then there was also led forth the adorned (daughter) of Pūtakratu’s wife  [=Dasyave Vr̥ka’s sister]
just as if she belonged to a troop of horses.
5. Agni, the perceptive, has just been perceived, the oblation-conveyor  along with his chariot.
Agni shone with his blazing flame, having his own sun aloft, as the Sun  shone in heaven.
## 57 (1026) Aśvins
Medhya Kāṇva
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This sequence of verses inviting the Aśvins to the soma sacrifice is unremarkable save  for a few features. The first verse explicitly establishes the context as the Third Pressing,  which, as we have discussed elsewhere, was probably a recent addition to R̥gvedic rit ual. And especially in verse 2 there are insoluble textual problems. Since the verse itself  is not terribly interesting in content, the difficulties can safely be left aside here.
1. You two, o gods worthy of the sacrifice, yoked by your age-old purpose,  with your chariot
come here to the powerful (soma?), o Nāsatyas, with your skills. You will  drink this Third Pressing here.
2. You two have the gods, the thrice eleven, (called upon); those realest of  the real have appeared in front.
Taking pleasure in our sacrifice, our pressing, drink the soma, o Aśvins,  as ones for whom the fire glows.
3. This deed of yours, o Aśvins, is to be wondered at. The bull of heaven, of  the dusky realm, of the earth,
and the thousand chants, which (are performed?) at the quest for cattle— drive up to all those, to drink (the soma).
4. Here is a portion deposited for you, you worthy of the sacrifice; here are  hymns, o Nāsatyas—drive up to them.
Drink the honeyed soma among us. Foster the pious man with your skills.
## 58 (1027) “Fragment”
Not mentioned in the Anukramaṇī, so without rṣ̥ i attribution
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This fragment of three verses is not transmitted as a unity in the khila collections,  with verses 1–2 and 3 located separately. Verse 3 in fact appears to belong to the Aśvin hymn VIII.57, with which it fits well: the “left-over” soma it mentions is a  standard offering in the Third Pressing treated in VIII.57.
As for the other two verses, Geldner memorably characterizes verse 1 as a riddle  without an answer, and verse 2 as an answer without a preceding riddle. This seems  persuasive, and the two verses may have been secondarily connected because of the  bahudhā́ “in many forms, in many ways” that appears in the middle of the first pāda  of each verse. Proferes argues (2007: 56), again persuasively, that verse 1 inquires  about the compact or agreement between the Sacrificer and the priests that is ritu
ally dramatized in the later śrauta system in the ritual of the Tānūnaptra, in which  a formal alliance is created among these participants, and he suggests that this verse  is a precursor of that later ceremony. Verse 2, on the other hand, has been taken,  since Sāyaṇa, as the answer to the riddle posed in X.88.18ab “How many fires and  how many suns? How many dawns, and how many waters?” and the tone of this  verse is in harmony with the philosophical speculation characteristic of such Xth  Maṇḍala hymns.
1. This sacrifice here, which the priests, configuring it in many ways, carry  out with one mind,
and the Brahman who was yoked as reciter—what is the Sacrificer’s
compact there [=with them]?
2. Just one fire is kindled in many forms; just one sun has projected
through all.
Just one dawn radiates over this whole (world). In truth just One has  developed into this whole (world).
3. Your light-filled, three-wheeled, well-naved chariot, providing a beacon,  easy to sit in, bringing abundant valuables,
at whose yoking (Dawn) of bright bounties is born—that I call upon, for  you two to drink the “left-over” (soma).
## 59 (1028) Indra and Varuṇa
Suparṇa Kāṇva
7 verses: jagatī
This last Vālakhilya hymn presents a number of uncertainties in transmission, and  so it is difficult to know whether its sometimes awkward phrasing belonged to the  original poem or is the result of flawed transmission. In contrast, the hymn has a  rather tight structure, with an apparent omphalos: verses 3 and 5 have a number  of lexical correspondences, and in particular they both announce a truth (satyám).  These correspondences form a ring that defines verse 4, the central verse of the  hymn, as the omphalos, as well as containing the “truth” proclaimed in the adja
cent verses. All three verses refer to a group, or groups, of seven in riddling fashion.  At least the female “seven” in verses 3 and 4—seven voices, seven sisters—can be
1142 VIII.59
identified as the soma-purifying waters, conceived of as the “seven rivers” of Vedic  mythology. (They are called “voices” because of the noise they make, just as one  of the words for “river,” nadī́, is derived from the root nad “roar,” an etymology  explicitly recognized by Vedic speakers.) The three heptads of verse 5 may refer to  the same streams, multiplied, or may evoke the number of gifts Indra and Varuṇa  should bestow in response.
The omphalos verse is left incomplete: the poet urges the two gods to “estab lish...” (dhattam [if this is the correct reading, as we think]) but does not specify the  object desired. This truncated wish returns at the end of the hymn, however. The  final verse contains two occurrences of this same verb, with a plethora of objects.  This completion of the unfinished expression of verse 4 may be seen as another  example of “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006).
Indra and Varuṇa do not form a natural pair, and it is not surprising that very  few hymns are dedicated to the two alone (I.17, IV.41–42, VI.68, VII.82–85, and a  tr̥ca in III.62 [1–3]). In the more prominent hymns to both divinities, especially the  justly celebrated IV.42, their contrastive qualities, especially their different types of  kingship, are highlighted. Here by contrast the two gods are essentially featureless  (the possible exception is 2cd), their only activities being to accept the soma offer
ing and give prosperity to the sacrificers in return. In fact, vocabulary appropriate  to a more standard pair of gods, the Aśvins, is adapted here, especially the vocative  “you two lords of beauty” (śubhas patī), a common epithet otherwise confined to  the Aśvins.
1. These portions here run to you two, Indra and Varuṇa; run forth to you  when the (soma-drinks) are pressed, for your great (generosity?).
At every sacrifice you bustle toward the pressings, when you do your best  for the sacrificer who presses (soma).
2. The plants and waters, offering tribute to these two, have reached  greatness, o Indra and Varuṇa—
the two who run on the far side of dusky space, at the far limit of their  road, the two of whom no non-god vaunts himself as their rival.
3. This is really true, Indra and Varuṇa: the seven “voices” of Kr̥śa milk out  a wave of honey for you two.
With these, you lords of beauty, help the pious man who, undeceivable,  keeps watch over you with his thoughts.
4. The ghee-sprinkling companions of soma, possessing lively drops, the  seven sisters in the seat of truth,
who are ghee-dripping for you two, Indra and Varuṇa—with these
establish....Do your best for the sacrificer.
5. We have proclaimed a true thing for great good fortune, have proclaimed  greatness and Indrian strength for the two vibrant ones.
Help us who drip ghee, o Indra and Varuṇa, with three groups of seven,  you lords of beauty. 6. O Indra and Varuṇa, in that you in the beginning gave to the seers  inspired thought, the thinking of speech, what is heard—
the insightful (seers) launched these as poems as they stretched out the  sacrifice. I looked upon them with fervor.
7. Indra and Varuṇa, establish undistracted benevolence and thriving of  wealth among the sacrificers.
Establish offspring, prosperity, and development among us. Lengthen  our lifetime for long life.
The grouping of the VIIIth Maṇḍala hymns that follow the Vālakhilya hymns (60– 103) is not as clear as in the earlier section of the maṇḍala, in great part because  the poets are far less likely to identify themselves. Nonetheless, the order of deities  and the number of verses per hymn provide good evidence. We follow Oldenberg’s  (1888: 216–18) proposed structure.
The next collection of hymns (VIII.60–66) is ascribed to Pragātha and several of  his sons. All but the first are dedicated to Indra.
## 60 (669) Agni
Bharga Pragātha
20 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
The focus throughout most of this hymn is Agni in his sacrificial role, a theme strongly  established in the first five verses, and in his close relationship to the household and  clan. As a consequence of this latter relationship he also appears as the protector of  those entities against external threats: see verses 6–10, 12–14, and especially the two  final verses 19–20. The usual prayers for wealth and aid are not absent, however.
1. Agni, drive here with your fires: we would choose you as our Hotar. Let the oblation-bearing (ladle), held forth, anoint you, the best
sacrificer, for you to sit upon the ritual grass,
2. For the ladles are moving toward you at the ceremony, o son of strength,  o Aṅgiras.
We supplicate the child of nourishment, ghee-haired Agni, foremost at  the sacrifices.
3. O Agni, pure one, you are the sage poet and ritual expert, the Hotar who  receives (the command) “sacrifice!”—
delightful, the best sacrificer, to be invoked at the ceremonies by our  inspired poets with their thoughts, o blazing one.
4. Without deception, convey the eager gods here for them to pursue (the  offerings), o youngest one, untiring.1144 VIII.60
Come here to the well-placed pleasing offerings, o good one. Take  delight as you are spurred on [/set in place] by our insights.
5. Just you, of great extent, are the entruthed sage poet, o guardian Agni. Just you do the inspired poets and the ritual experts seek to attract here,  o you who shine while being kindled.
6. Blaze bright, brightest blazing one; shine joy for the clan. Give to the  praiser. You are great!
Let my patrons, overpowering their rivals and endowed with good fires,  be under the shelter of the gods.
7. Just as you incinerate the brushwood grown thick on the ground,  o Agni,
in the same way burn whoever stalks (us), lying to us and
ill-intentioned, o you who deploy the might of alliance.
8. Do not make us subject to a mortal who is a cheat possessed of  demonic power, nor to one who utters evil.
O youngest one, protect us with your protectors that are unfailing,  overwhelming, but kindly.
9. Protect us with one, Agni, and protect us with a second.
Protect us with three hymns, o lord of nourishments; protect us with  four, o good one.
10. Protect us from every hostile demon. Ever further us when prizes (are at  stake),
for we approach just you, the one nearest to the divine assemblage and  our friend, for strengthening.
11. (Bring) here to us praiseworthy wealth that strengthens vital force, o  pure Agni,
and give it to us, o apportioner—(wealth) much craved and very  glorious—with your good guidance—
12. (Wealth) with which we will vanquish in battles those who vaunt  themselves, as we overcome the aims of the stranger.
Strengthen us because of our pleasing offering, o you who have the  goods of skill. Quicken our insights so they find goods.
13. Like a bull sharpening his horns, shaking them again and again,  is Agni.
His sharp jaws are not to be withstood: well fanged is the young (son)  of strength.
14. For your fangs are not to be withstood when you spread yourself out, o  bullish Agni.
Make our oblation well poured, o Hotar. Win for us many things worth  choosing. 15. You lie in the pieces of wood and in your two mothers [=kindling  sticks]; the mortals kindle you.
Tireless, you convey the oblations of him who makes oblation. Right  after that you shine [/rule] among the gods.
16. The seven Hotars reverently invoke just you, o Agni, the unabashed one  displaying great abandon.
You split apart the rock with your heat and your flame. Agni, stand out  beyond the peoples.
17. Agni after Agni, not one poor, would we invoke for you [=the
assembled clans]—we with our ritual grass twisted,
with our pleasing offerings set in place—Agni here in each and every  (clan), the Hotar of the settled domains.
18. He [=singer?] keeps company with your intention in the shelter made of  good melody. O perceptive Agni, the *pieces of wood are for you.
By impulsion bring here to us the prize of many forms to be nearest to  us, for our aid.
19. O Agni, o singer and god, you are the clanlord who burns the demons, the houselord who doesn’t go abroad; you are great—the protector
from heaven, but devoted to the house.
20. Let demonic power not enter into us, nor the sorcery of those who  deploy sorcery, o you who have the goods of the glowing one
[=Pūṣan].
Keep thirst and hunger away, far beyond the pasture-lands; o Agni,
keep away those who deploy demonic power.
## 61 (670) Indra
Bharga Pragātha
18 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn begins with the invitation to soma (vss. 1–3), but the poet soon turns his  attention to the gifts Indra will bestow, a theme that dominates the rest of the first  half of the hymn (through vs. 8). The sacrificial context returns at this point, and in  verses 11–12 the sacrificers seek to harness Indra as their comrade, whose powers they  wish to marshal for their protection against hostile forces (see esp. vss. 13, 15–18).
The syntax is fairly straightforward, but there are a number of rare words and  hapaxes (e.g., the last two words of vs. 9) and pleasing verbal plays. The poet espe cially likes variable repetition (of the type “unassailable assailant” vs. 3).
1. If Indra nearby will hear this twofold speech of ours,
the most powerful benefactor will come here to the soma-drinking by  reason of our fully focused insight.
1146 VIII.61
2. For the two Holy Places [=Heaven and Earth] fashioned the bull as  sovereign king, for strength.
And as the first among the highest you take your seat, for your mind  has desire for soma.
3. Drench yourself in the pressed stalk, o Indra who bring many goods, for we know you, o master of the fallow bays, as victorious in battles,  as the unassailable assailant.
4. You whose reality cannot be confounded, o bounteous Indra, it will be  just as you wish according to your intention.
Might we win the prize with your help, o you of fair lips, as we go  quickly, o master of the stones.
5. Exert your ability, o master of ability, o Indra, through all your help, for we follow after you who are like Bhaga, glorious and finding goods,  o champion.
6. As multiplicity yourself, you are a multiplier of horseflesh, of cattle;  you are a golden wellspring, o god,
for no one will shun a gift in your (control). Whatever I beg for, bring  that here.
7. Come on and find fortune, to give goods to the attentive man. Boil up and over, generous one, for the seeking of cattle, up and over  for the seeking of horseflesh, Indra.
8. You are ready to give many thousands and hundreds of herds. We of inspired speech have brought the stronghold-splitter here, singing  Indra for his help.
9. If without inspiration or if inspired, someone has dedicated his speech  to you, Indra,
he will reach elation in devotion to you—o you of a hundred resolves,  whose battle-fury is upfront, whose (motto is) “I shall win!”
10. The strong-armed stronghold-splitter who causes destruction—if he  will hear my call,
we, seeking goods, will call upon the goods-lord of a hundred resolves,  upon Indra, with songs of praise.
11. Let us not be regarded as evil, or stingy, or greedy,
if just now we will make Indra, the bull, into our companion at the  pressing.
12. We have yoked the strong one, victorious in battles, the undeceivable  one who wants what he’s owed.
The winner, the best charioteer recognizes a prizewinning (racehorse),  even when it’s a blur—which is just the one he will attain. 13. Whatever we are afraid of, Indra, make us unafraid of that.
Bounteous one, exert your ability then through your help for us. Smash  away hatreds, away slights.
14. For you, lord of largesse, are (lord) of great largesse and of the dwelling  place of him who does honor.
We, who have pressed (the soma), invoke you, bounteous Indra, who  long for songs.
15. Indra, spy and Vr̥tra-smasher, protector from afar, is worth our choosing. He will guard the last one of us and the midmost. Let him protect us  from behind and from in front.
16. Protect us from behind, from beneath, from above, from in front, from  everywhere, Indra.
Put far away from us fear of the gods, far away the ungodly missiles.
17. Today after today, tomorrow after tomorrow, rescue us, o Indra—and  in the future.
Through all the days, by day and by night, you will guard our singers, o  lord of settlements.
18. Shattering champion, bounteous patron of powerful bounty, equipped  for heroic action—
o you of a hundred resolves, both your arms are bulls, which hold fast  to the mace.
## 62 (671) Indra
Pragātha Kāṇva
12 verses: paṅkti, except brhat ̥ ī 7–9, arranged in trcas ̥
A pleasantly limpid praise of Indra, which emphasizes Indra’s pleasure in praise  and sacrifice (e.g., vss. 1, 4, 6) and the usual reciprocal benefits exchanged between  the god and his worshipers. The relationship between Indra and the sacrificers seems  to become stronger as the hymn progresses, its growth tracked through the word  “yoke.” In the early verses of the hymn Indra is isolated in his accomplishments: in  verse 2 he is said to be “without yokemate” and to accomplish his deeds alone; in  verse 3 he is about to win even with an unsatisfactory horse. But after he comes to  the sacrifice, the exchange relationship between worshiper and god comes to the  fore (vs. 5) and already in verse 6 the poet announces that Indra makes the soma offerer his partner and “yokemate.” By the penultimate verse (11) the poet himself,  in the first person, proposes that the god and the mortal “yoke ourselves together,”  to achieve the winnings Indra was on the point of winning alone in verse 3. The  poet somewhat hubristically claims that any enemy will yield to “us two,” implicitly  claiming a kind of equality between the man and the most powerful of gods.
1148 VIII.62
The final verse, as often, is a summary, and it seems to establish the truth value  of the whole preceding hymn, as well as the précis given in the last half-verse. The  refrain found in every verse establishes the cheerful tone from the start.
1. Present a praise invocation to him so that he will find pleasure.
By solemn recitations the providers of soma increase the great vitality  of Indra.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
2. Without yokemate, without equal among superior men,
irrepressible—he alone
has grown strong over the many peoples, over all created things, with  his might.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
3. He of lively gifts is on the point of winning, even with a steed that’s not  spurred on.
That of yours should be proclaimed, Indra, when you are going to
perform heroic deeds.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
4. Drive here! We shall make strengthening sacred formulations for
you, Indra,
in which you will delight, you strongest one. There is something
auspicious here for one who seeks fame.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
5. Bold also is the mind of (you,) the bold, o Indra, when you act
for the man who renders service with sharp soma drops, who attends  with homages.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
6. He who is equal to song gazes down on the (soma-)springs like a man  into wells.
Finding pleasure, he makes a partner and yokemate of the skillful
soma-bearer.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
7. All the gods conceded heroism and resolve to you.
You became the herdsman of all, o you praised by many.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
8. I sing that utmost strength of yours, Indra, for the divine assembly, that you smash Vr̥tra with your might, o lord of ability.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
9. He will make those who marvel at him into festive assemblies, as it were,  throughout the generations of men.
Indra knows his own distinctive sign: he is famed (for it).
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra. 10. They have increased your new-born strength, Indra, increased you and  your resolve
many times, o you of many cows, under your shelter, bounteous one. – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
11. I and you, o Vr̥tra-smasher—let us two yoke ourselves together for  winnings.
Even a hostile man, o master of the stones, will yield to the two of us, o  champion.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
12. This is really true—and thus we shall praise this Indra—not false: he is the great weapon of death for the man who does not press soma,  but many are his lights for the man who does press.
– Auspicious are the gifts of Indra.
## 63 (672) Indra (except the Gods 12)
Pragātha Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 5, 7 and triṣṭubh 12, arranged in trcas. ̥
Compared to the simple diction of the last hymn, this one seems deliberately  stiff and full of labored expressions whose decoding slows the pace of the hymn,  perhaps on purpose. The hymn’s structure, by contrast, is rather simple and  follows a straightforward trajectory, with each of the four tr̥cas expressing a  different theme.
The hymn opens with a mysterious figure, the “tracker,” who is smeared or  anointed with mental constructs—intentions and insights—by two different  agents, who can be plausibly identified as the gods and Manu in his role as father  of mankind and the first sacrificer. This liminal figure, the tracker, is most likely  a ritual mediator between the divine and the human, and Agni makes the most  sense as the referent. The second verse confirms the ritual setting, and in the  third verse Indra makes his first appearance, in his role as opener of the Vala  cave. This mythological reference calls dawn to mind, and suggests the time of  the current sacrifice. Thus, the first tr̥ca establishes the scene as the Morning  Pressing.
The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) then calls Indra to that sacrifice; each verse contains  the word arká “chant.” In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) various deeds of Indra are  celebrated, especially his defeat of enemies for the Five Peoples (vs. 7) and his  involvement, with Viṣṇu, in the killing of the Emuṣa boar (vs. 9), a myth which is  a specialty of this part of Maṇḍala VIII (VIII.69.14–15; 77.1–2, 6–8, 10–11; 96.2).  Here only the preliminaries, in which a rice porridge is fetched by Viṣṇu to nourish  Indra, are treated. The middle verse 8 mentions Indra’s manly deeds in general,  but also contains the phrase “you furthered the turning of the wheel” (cakrásya
1150 VIII.63
vartaním), which reminds us of the later designation cakra-vartin “turner of the  wheel” for a universal monarch. The last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) introduces the Maruts  and finally the gods in general as associates of Indra and calls on all of them  for help.
1. The tracker [=Agni?], stationed in front, has been smeared with the  intentions of the great ones [=gods],
he on whose doors father Manu smeared insightful thoughts to
the gods.
2. The stones with soma on their backs have sat up, as if to the measure of  heaven.
The solemn words and sacred formulations are now to be recited.
3. Indra, knowing how, uncovered the cows for the Aṅgirases.
That manly act of his is to be praised.
4. As of old, let Indra, strengthener of poets, fortifier of speech,
the kindly one, come among us for help at the pouring of our chant.
5. And therefore, following the intention of your will, those eager to  sacrifice (have cried out) “hail!”;
their chants have cried out to (you), who are swollen with strength,
Indra, to give of the cowpen.
6. All heroic deeds, both done and to be done, are in Indra,
whom the chants know as the very ceremony itself.
7. When cries were sent surging to Indra by the clan belonging to the Five  Peoples,
through the power of their inspiration, through the power of his
measure he laid the strangers low. He is peaceful dwelling.
8. Here is the praise that follows you: you did these manly deeds;
you furthered the turning of the wheel.
9. (Viṣṇu) strode widely to the rice porridge for this bull to live on.
(Indra) took it, as cattle do barley.
10. Seeking help as we present this (praise hymn), through you (all) might  we have skill as our father
for the strengthening of the one accompanied by the Maruts [=Indra]. 11. Yes indeed! through our chanters we cry out again and again for your  establishment according to the ritual sequence, o champion.
Let us conquer with you as our yokemate, Indra.
12. For us are the Rudras [=Maruts] in their profusion and the mountains  of one accord at the Vr̥tra-smashing, where the call is “Carry
(the day)!”
The steadfast one who has been established for the praiser and
presser—with him, Indra, as their chief let the gods help us. VIII.64 (673) Indra
Pragātha Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
A hymn artful in its extreme simplicity. Its diction, its syntax, and its structure  are all straightforward. It consists of four tr̥cas. The first (vss. 1–3) begs Indra for  gifts and aid against enemies and celebrates his preeminence. The second (vss. 4–6)  calls him to the sacrifice. The third (vss. 7–9) consists of rhetorical questions about  Indra’s whereabouts and the possibility of his consorting with other sacrificers. The  final one (vss. 10–12) presents him with the just-pressed soma.
The transparency of the hymn is produced in great part by its syntax: many of  the verses contain several short, generally pāda-length sentences (vs. 1 is a typi cal example), and more extreme concision is encountered in the abrupt series of  imperatives “come! run! drink!” in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10c and 12c; cf. also 4a). Even  when the sentence extends beyond the pāda, it often deploys simple parallel con stituents across two pādas (e.g., vss. 3ab, 6ab). There is also no overt subordination  in the hymn (unless we count the nahí [“for not”] clause of 2c). There are almost no  past tenses (only in 5c [perfect] and 9a [aorist]); the finite verb forms are otherwise  limited to imperatives, indicative presents, and one presential perfect (8c).
The sentiments expressed and the vocabulary are likewise uncomplex and stan dard. Only the penultimate verse (11), with its apparent references to locales for  finding soma, causes any interpretive problems.
1. Let the praises whip you up. Show your generosity, o master of the stones. Strike down the haters of sacred formulations.
2. With your foot stamp down the ungenerous niggards. You are great, for no one is equal to you.
3. You are master of the pressed soma-drops, and you, Indra, of the  unpressed ones.
You are the king of the peoples.
4. Come here! Go forth—your dwelling is in heaven—as you take heed of  the separate communities.
You fill both worlds.
5. This very mountain, this peak, which holds a hundred, a
thousand (cows),
did you shatter apart for your praisers.
6. We by day at the pressing and we by night call upon you:
fulfill our desire!
7. Where is this young, strong-necked bull who cannot be bowed?
Who is the formulator who serves him?
8. To whose pressing does the bull, relishing it, descend?
Who finds their pleasure in Indra?
1152 VIII.65
9. Whom have your gifts accompanied, whom have masses of brave men, o  Vr̥tra-smasher.
Who at the recitation is closest (to you)?
10. This soma here is being pressed for you amid the people of Manu,  among the Pūrus.
Of that—come! run!—drink!
11. Here is your dear (soma) in the reed-filled (pond?), here in the Suṣomā (River?)
the most invigorating in the foamy (lake?).
12. (Drink) this delightful one today for (you to show) great generosity, for  thrilling invigoration—
come to it, Indra! run! drink!
## 65 (674) Indra
Pragātha Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn is at least superficially a twin to the last one: it is attributed to the same  poet, consists of the same number of verses, and is in the same meter. And indeed  it shows important similarities to VIII.64. It, too, tends to short, often pāda-length,  syntactic units and to balanced parallel constituents (e.g., 2a, c, 6ab), and there  are even agreements in wording:  the abrupt verse-final imperative “drink!” of  VIII.64.10 and 12 is repeated in 65.5 and 8 (with the former also containing éhi “come!” like the examples in VIII.64), and “we call upon” appears in the same verse  (6) in the same position in both hymns.
However, VIII.65 introduces some complications absent from VIII.64. Unlike 64,  which had no subordination at all, 65 begins with a subordinating conjunction (yád),  which occurs three times in the first two verses, and verse 2 finds its main clause only  in verse 3. (See also vs. 7.) Though present indicatives and imperatives predominate,  the range of verbal forms is somewhat widened as well, with injunctives (9b, 10c), aor
ists (8b, 12c), a subjunctive (2b), a preterital perfect (probably, 11c), and a number of  dative infinitives, as well as two of the much discussed -ṣé forms (5a).
The diction can be more resistant than that of VIII.64, as in verse 2 where the  choices given to Indra are puzzling. Are these places (as in the also puzzling 64.11)  or sources of exhilaration, and are there two choices or three? What do the opaque  phrases, especially “the sea of the stalk,” refer to?
Like VIII.64 this hymn consists of four tr̥cas. The last (vss. 10–12) is clearly  defined as a dānastuti. The other three are not thematically differentiated. They all  call on Indra to attend our sacrifice, and the major concern running throughout  is that rival sacrificers are competing with us for his presence (e.g., vss. 1, 2, 7, 9).  These first three tr̥cas, before the dānastuti, display ring composition: the command “drive here straightaway” (ā́ yāhi tū́yam) in 1c is echoed in 9b “come here straight away” (tū́yam ā́ gahi).
1. When, Indra, you are being called forward or back, upward or down  by men,
drive here straightaway with your swift (horses).
2. Whether you will bring yourself to exhilaration on the outpouring of  heaven in the presence of Svarṇara,
or on the sea of the stalk,
3. I call you here with songs, you great and broad, like a cow to give  sustenance,
and to drink of the soma, Indra.
4. Your greatness, Indra, your grandeur, god—let your fallow bays, bearing it, carry it here on your chariot.
5. Indra, you are to be hymned and praised: great, powerful, performing  the master’s part.
Come to our pressed soma! Drink!
6. We, who have pressed soma and have a pleasing offering, call you to take your seat here upon this our ritual grass.
7. Even though you are the support common to each and every one, Indra, we summon you to us.
8. Here is the somian honey for you—the men have milked it out with stones. Finding enjoyment, Indra, drink it!
9. Look beyond all the strangers who are also attentive to poetic
inspiration. Come here straightaway.
Place lofty fame in us.
10. The king is a giver to me—of dappled cows (with horns) wrapped in gold. Let the bounteous patron not suffer harm, o gods.
11. On top of the thousand dappled cows, I took glistening, lofty, wide, gleaming gold.
12. The descendants of Durgaha, very generous with a thousand for me, have made fame for themselves among the gods.
## 66 (675) Indra
Kali Prāgātha
15 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas, except anuṣṭubh 15
This hymn of fifteen verses is longer than the Indra hymns that precede it (VIII.62– 65, all twelve verses long), and is therefore out of place in the collection. Oldenberg  suggests (Noten ad loc.) that it may consist of two hymns (or even three): verses 1–81154 VIII.66
and 9–14, with verse 15 appended in a different meter. However, as he also notes  (1888: 217), there is no strong internal support for this division, and it may very well  be a single hymn.
The invitation to Indra to the soma sacrifice is the primary theme of the hymn. It  begins with a call for Indra’s help (vs. 1) and continues with descriptions of the sac rificial offerings (vss. 5–8, 11–12), along with the usual hope that Indra will choose  our sacrifice over those of others (see esp. vs. 12). The poet remarks particularly on  the regular and predictable nature of the sacrifice (vs. 7), and in a striking image in  verse 8 suggests to Indra that, since even the apparently uncontrollable wolf follows  its own routine, Indra should make it a habit to attend our sacrifice as he has before.  The regular nature of the sacrifice has its drawbacks, of course: many others before  us and many others around us have performed and continue to perform it, but the  poet assures Indra in verse 11 that although he and his comrades are only the most  recent among the sacrificers, their formulations are novel and unprecedented (see  also vs. 5). The competition between us and the others is emphasized by the numer
ous occurrences of “many” in this hymn.
Interspersed are verses celebrating Indra’s power and his aid to his worshipers  (vss. 2–4, 9–10). Not all of this praise is entirely clear, especially that in 3ab, where  Indra is identified with two hapaxes, our translations of which are quite provisional.  In the final pragātha (vss. 13–14) the poet makes his strongest plea for Indra’s help.  The final verse (15), in a different meter as noted, is puzzling. It reassures an oth
erwise unknown group of people, the Kalis, that if they press soma, whatever is  threatening them will disappear.
1. With staying power and force (I call for) Indra, finder of goods, for help; as (we) sing loftily at the rite with its pressed soma, I call (for him) as if  for the takings of a decisive victor,
2. Whom neither obdurate nor substantial hindrances will obstruct when  the fair-lipped one is in the exhilaration of the stalk,
who, tearing them out for the laboring presser, is the giver of
praiseworthy (goods) to the singer.
3. The able one, who is a horse’s curry comb [?] or who is a golden stake [?], he sets the opening of the cattle-pen to shaking—Indra the
Vr̥tra-smasher.
4. He who casts upward for the pious man the goods assembled by many,  even when they are buried deep,
Indra, with mace, fair lips, and fallow bays, will act as he wishes
according to his will.
5. O champion praised by many, whatever belonging to men you held dear  even before,
we assemble that for you, Indra: the sacrifice, the solemn word, and the  surpassing speech, 6. As well as the soma drinks for your exhilaration, o mace-wielder  invoked by many, heaven-ruling soma-drinker.
For you become the best giver of desirable goods to the creator of
sacred formulations, to the presser.
7. At this time yesterday we made the mace-bearer drink here;
today, in the same way, bring the pressed soma to him. Now attend
upon the renowned one.
8. Even a wolf—wild and sheep-stealing—attends to its own patterns. Come here, having found pleasure in this praise song of ours with its  shimmering insight, Indra.
9. What manly deed of his now remains undone by Indra?
Indeed, by what fame has the Vr̥tra-smasher not been famed from
his birth?
10. Are there great powers that are unassailable by him? What has not been  laid low by the Vr̥tra-smasher?
Indra dominates all the Bekanāṭas who see the day and the Paṇis
through his will.
11. (Although we are) the latest of many, we present to you sacred
formulations without precedent, o Indra, Vr̥tra-smasher,
like a present, o mace-bearer invoked by many.
12. For although many are the hopes that call to you, powerfully ranging  Indra, and many are your forms of help,
pass over the pressings of the stranger, good one. Most mighty one,
heed my call.
13. We are yours; we inspired poets abide just in you, o Indra,
for there exists no other dispenser of mercy than you, o bounteous one  invoked by many.
14. You—rescue us from this neglect and hunger, from their curse.
You—because of our brilliant insight, do your best for us with your  help, most able one, as the way-finder.
15. Let just your soma be pressed. Kalis, stop fearing:
this miasma will go away; by itself it will go away.
The next group likely consists of 67–71, though Oldenberg (1888: 217) considers  the possibility that VIII.72 belongs here as well. Save for VIII.67 with its fanciful  authorial ascription, the rest (68–71) are attributed to Āṅgirasa poets.

21 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
According to the Anukramaṇī, a fish (Matsya) or “many fish caught in a net” are  two of the three possible composers of this hymn. Unfortunately, there is not a  scrap of evidence in the hymn itself for these intriguing ascriptions. The poet begs  the Ādityas and their mother Aditi, who is more prominent in the hymn than in  most Āditya hymns (vss. 10–12, 14, 18), for shelter and protection from a range of  dangers and enemies and for continued life for ourselves and our progeny.
1. Now we shall beg these rulers, the Ādityas, for help—
the very merciful ones, (for us) to prevail.
2. Mitra will carry us beyond constraint, and Varuṇa and Aryaman, just as the Ādityas know how.
3. For their bright, praiseworthy shield exists for the pious man—
(the shield) of the Ādityas for the man who does it right.
4. Great is the help of you who are great, o Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman. We choose your help.
5. Gird us, alive, against the deadly blow, o Ādityas.
Are you ones who heed the call?
6. Your shield, your shelter that exists for the man who has ritually  labored and who presses soma—
with that intercede for us.
7. O gods, does there exist wide (space emerging) from out of constraint?  Does there exist a treasure for the blameless man,
o Ādityas, you (whom others’) offenses cannot mislead?
8. Let this fetter here not bind us; let it avoid us for our great (good  fortune?),
for only Indra is famous for imposing his will.
9. Don’t (harm) us with the harm of crooked cheats.
O gods greedy to help, seize them!
10. And, great goddess Aditi, I entreat you,
the very merciful, (for us) to prevail.
11. Deliver us, whether we’re in the shallows or the deep, from someone  who wishes to smite us, o you who have powerful sons.
Let none of our offspring be injured.
12. Make faultless (shelter) for us, o widely spreading (goddess) possessing  a wide enclosure, (for us) to extend afar
and for our offspring to live. 13. They who, as heads of the settled peoples, untrickable, self-glorious, without deceit, guard their commandments—
14. Being such, free us from the mouth of wolves, o Ādityas,
like a thief who’s been bound, o Aditi.
15. Let this arrow go away from us, o Ādityas,
away malevolence, without striking us.
16. Because, o Ādityas of good gifts, over and over,
previously and now, we have benefited by your help—
17. Because, o attentive gods, each and every man, even one coming back  from an offense,
do you make to live—
18. This is the new (life) for an older (man) that will free us, o Ādityas, like a bound man from his bondage, o Aditi.
19. We do not have the driving force to leap beyond, Ādityas.
You—have mercy upon us!
20. O Ādityas, let the missile of Vivasvant, the finely made arrow,
not strike us now before old age.
21. O Ādityas, rip apart hostility, apart constraint, apart what is packed  together;
rip malady apart and asunder.
## 68 (677) Indra (1–13), Dānastuti of R̥ksa and A ̣ ̄svamedha ́ (14–19)
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa
19 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 7, 10. Verses 1–12 arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn falls into two parts. It begins with four tr̥cas (vss. 1–12) dedicated to  Indra, each beginning with an anuṣṭubh verse and continuing in gāyatrī; there fol lows a single appended verse (13) continuing the thought of the previous verse. The  final six verses are a dānastuti to a set of patrons whose names and identities are  not entirely easy to sort out.
The Indra portion is conventional, with an emphasis on his extreme power and  might. The dānastuti is likewise comparatively straightforward compared to others  of this genre, with a catalogue of the gifts received and a promise to the patrons,  expressed in surprisingly negative terms, that even a man who wishes to insult them  will not be able to do so (vs. 19).
1. We will turn you here, like a chariot, for help and favor,
you powerfully ranging one who vanquish through your attack, o Indra,  strongest lord of the settlements.
1158 VIII.68
2. O you of powerful outbursts, of powerful will, you able one whose  thought is everywhere,
you have filled (everywhere) with your greatness,
3. You the great, whose hands with their greatness have encompassed the earth-encircling mace of gold.
4. The lord of the unbowable strengths who has domain over all men do I call for you, together with his means and help for the separate  peoples and their chariots—
5. Him, ever-strengthening, whom men, every man for himself, call on in  (contests) whose prize is the sun,
for dominance and for help,
6. Indra, beyond measure and equal to song, strong, of good generosity, holding sway also over goods.
7. Him and him alone, Indra, do I impel to drink, for the sake of his great  generosity—
the dancer who holds sway over the communities, according to the  ancient praise that follows him.
8. You whose fellowship no (other) mortal has attained,
he will not attain your strengths, o you who swell with strength.
9. Aided by you, with you as our yokemate, might we win in our battles a great stake in the waters and the sun, o mace-bearer.
10. We implore you with our sacrifices, with our songs, o Indra most  longing for songs,
just as you helped Purumāyya in the prize-contests.
11. You whose fellowship is sweet, whose leadership is sweet, o master of  the stones—
yours is the sacrifice worth tussling over.
12. Make it wide for our own body and our lineage, wide for our dwelling. Extend it wide for us to live.
13. As a path wide for our men, wide for our cow, wide for our chariot— thus do we consider our pursuit of the gods.
14. Six men having sweet gifts approach me
two by two, in the excitement of soma.
15. From Indrota I received two silvery ones, from the son of R̥kṣa two  fallow bays,
and the two chestnuts of the son of Aśvamedha;
16. (Horses) having good chariots from the son of Atithigva, those having  good reins from the son of R̥kṣa,
and those having good ornaments from the son of Aśvamedha. 17. I gained six (horses), along with brides [?], from the son of Atithigva,  from Indrota,
along with Pūtakratu.
18. In the midst of these silvery ones there appeared a ruddy female  [=Dawn?] along with a bull,
having good reins and a whip.
19. Never will a mortal seeking to scorn you [=patrons], o you who are kin  to prizes,
hold disrepute over you.

(11cd–12)
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa
18 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 4–6, paṅkti 11, 16, brhat ̥ ī 17–18 [2 wrongly identi fied as uṣṇih by Anukramaṇī]
This often baffling hymn is metrically complex, as the above summary shows, and  its metrical patterns do not always coincide with its intricate structure. Although  many details remains obscure, the thematic outline of the hymn becomes clearer  when that structure has been discerned. In our view, the hymn falls into two halves  (vss. 1–9, 10–18), which are exactly parallel. Each consists of two tr̥cas (1–6, 10–15),  followed by a single verse celebrating the partnership between Indra and the poet  (7, 16), and ending with two verses concerning the Priyamedhas’ ritual offering to  Indra (8–9, 17–18). The parallelism is especially clear in the final three verses of  each half: both 7 and 16 contain the dual optative sacevahi “might we two become  comrades” and concern a journey of a certain number of steps. In both 8–9 and  17–18 the Priyamedhas are explicitly mentioned. They are exhorted to ritual per formance in verses 8–9, while in 17–18, as is suitable in hymn-final verses, their per
formance is summarized. The parallelism between the opening tr̥cas of both halves  is much freer, though there are rough correspondences.
The relationship between the two tr̥cas of the first half is noteworthy. The first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) is quite puzzling, with opaque phraseology and uncertain references;  the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) seems a double of the first, paraphrasing and explaining  it, in a sort of global example of “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006). The second tr̥ca  exhorts the poet to “chant forth” to Indra (vs. 4), and the next two verses describe  the preparation of soma for Indra, with the soma drops racing to the milk (con
ceptualized, as so often, as cows). With this in mind we can approach the first tr̥ca.  In verse 1 the opening phrase “forth, forth” recalls the similar phrase in verse 4  and allows the verb “chant” to be supplied (see also vs. 8). In verse 1 the recipient  of what is chanted, the poem, identified as “triṣṭubh refreshment,” is clearly Soma  (“the drop”), not Indra as in verse 4, but the constructions are parallel. The poem is
1160 VIII.69
then the subject of the second half of the verse, as it seeks to win something unspec ified. In our opinion the subject of verse 2 is this same poem, taking aim at Soma  (the “roaring bull”) among the cows, who represent the milk-mixture. In verse 3 the
soma mixture is prepared for Indra, and, it seems, for the rest of the gods. This matched pair of triplets is followed by the remarkable verse 7, in which  the poet proposes a partnership between himself and Indra, a partnership to be  sealed by the symbolic seven steps that in the later marriage ceremony make a  marriage legal after the bride and groom have taken them, and that already in the  R̥gveda (X.8.4) are the symbolic act creating a contract or alliance. The phrase  “the seven(th) step of the comrade” seems to refer to this ceremonial institution.  In order to make this alliance the poet and Indra go to Indra’s own home and  drink the soma together, having made the journey over the surface of the sea  of soma (in our view, though others consider this to be a reference to the sun).  The relationship between poet and god is thus a surprisingly intimate one, remi niscent of that between the poet Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa in VII.86–89, especially  the verses describing their former comradeship with grammatical constructions  and lexicon very similar to those here (VII.88.3–5). It is also similar to nearby  VIII.62.11, where the poet again proposes that he and Indra yoke themselves  together. The first half of the hymn is then brought to a close by the aforemen tioned exhortation to the Priyamedhas to chant to Indra (vs. 8), with a tantaliz ing glimpse of what appear to be three musical instruments accompanying them  (vs. 9).
The two tr̥cas opening the second half of the hymn (vss. 10–15) reverse the order  of obscurity. The first (vss. 10–12) is relatively straightforward and, at least to begin  with, matches material in the first half: the speckled cows giving milk for the soma  mixture in verse 10 remind us of the dappled cows and their milk in verse 3 (also  5–6), and Indra and other gods partake of the soma in verse 11, though the pres
ence and role of Varuṇa in verses 11–12 are somewhat puzzling. However, it is the  next tr̥ca (vss. 13–15) that almost defeats the interpreter, especially verse 13. There  is no agreement even on what god (or gods) the verse concerns, much less on what  the actions in question are and whether the verse is a self-contained syntactic unit.  We are inclined to take the verse as a suite of relative clauses referring to Indra,  who is triumphantly proclaimed in verse 14. The second half of verse 14 alludes  to the Emuṣa myth (also treated in VIII.77, etc.), in which, it seems, Indra as a boy  slew a boar named Emuṣa by shooting through a mountain, and brought (or Viṣṇu  brought him) a rice porridge and some buffalo (which had been protected by the  boar?) from the mountain. The next verse (15) most likely also concerns this myth,  or it may refer to another of Indra’s boyhood deeds. There are numerous difficulties  in these three verses, and our translation is only provisional.
The following verse (16) brings us back to the present, with the poet’s second  proposition of fellowship to Indra, again in the course of a journey. And the final  two verses (17–18) summarize the Priyamedhas’ ritual efforts and pronounces them  even better than before. We cannot claim to have settled the many issues of this hymn, but the structure  outlined above does give a context in which to evaluate the difficulties that remain.
1. Forth, (chant) forth your triṣṭubh refreshment to the drop that
invigorates heroes.
With your visionary thought and with plenitude it is seeking to win, in  order to gain wisdom.
2. You take aim at the roaring bull among your moist [=willing] females  and at the roaring bull among the females who keep hanging back,
at the lord of your prized milk-cows.
3. These dappled cows, which give the sweetening milk, prepare the soma  for him [=Indra].
At its birth the clans of the gods are in the three luminous realms of  heaven.
4. Chant forth with a song to the lord of cows, to Indra, in the way that  is known,
to the son of the real, the master of settlements.
5. The tawny (soma-drops) have been let loose at the ruddy (cows) upon  the ritual grass,
where we will bellow out together.
6. The cows have milked out the milk-mixture for Indra, the honey for the  mace-bearer,
since he found them in the remote place.
7. As we two, Indra and (I), go up to his home along the surface of the  coppery (soma),
having drunk of the honey three times, might we two become comrades  at the seven(th) step of the comrade.
8. Chant! Chant forth! Chant, o Priyamedhas!
Let your little sons chant, and you—chant boldly as if against a
fortress.
9. The Gargara(-instrument) will gurgle downward, the Godhā(-vīṇā) will  keep resounding all around,
and the Piṅgā(-string) will keep quivering all around. The sacred
formulation is offered up to Indra.
10. When the speckled (cows), who yield good milk and never kick, fly here, take hold of the kicking soma for Indra to drink.
11. Indra has drunk; Agni has drunk. All the gods have become
exhilarated.
Varuṇa will settle here, too. The waters have bellowed out to him, as  (cows) that share their young do to their calf.
1162 VIII.70
12. You are well-provided with gods, Varuṇa—you through whose gullet  the seven rivers
stream, as through a tube that provides easy flow.
13. He who made the paired, well-yoked horses leap for the pious man, (who is) their swooping leader—and just this is the marvel—who was  set loose as the very measure (of heaven)—
14. Just he is solemnly proclaimed as the able one, as Indra, beyond all  hatreds.
The lad ripped (out) the rice porridge that was cooking far away on the  mountain.
15. Like a teeny-tiny wee little boy, he mounted his new chariot.
He cooked the wild buffalo of prodigious will for his father and
mother.
16. You fair-lipped houselord, mount your golden chariot.
Then we two might become comrades along the heavenly, ruddy (path)  with a thousand steps,
faultless and leading to well-being.
17. Bringing homage, they reverently approach him, their sovereign king,  just so.
Just this is his well-set goal when they turn him here to come and
to give.
18. Following the (custom) of their ancient house, the Priyamedhas
with twisted ritual grass, with their pleasing offering set in place, have  equaled their previous presentation.
## 70 (679) Indra
Puruhanman Āṅgirasa
15 verses:  brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī arranged in pragāthas 1–6; brhat ̥ ī arranged in trcas 7–12; u ̥ ṣṇih 13, anuṣṭubh 14, puraüṣṇih 15
Another metrically complex hymn. The first six verses consist of three pragāthas in  br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, the next six (7–12) of two tr̥cas in br̥hatī, and the  last three (13–15) of verses in three different meters, but all consisting of eight syl lable or a mixture of eight and twelve syllable lines, like the br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī verses  before them.
The thematic divisions correspond well with these metrical divisions. The  first six verses are extravagant praise of Indra’s unequalled power. Having flat tered him with his praise, the poet occupies the tr̥ca portion with the usual  requests for Indra to exercise his generosity and, more strikingly, for him to pun ish mortals who do not worship him and do not follow the Ārya way, with the culminating verse 11 listing the numerous ways in which this evil man can deviate  from the proper path. One of the stylistic features especially of the tr̥ca section  (but see also vs. 4) is the tendency for the final word or words of the c and d  pādas to match (4cd, 7cd, 8cd, 11cd, 12cd; see also 9a+d), and there are other  verse-internal echoes.
The final three verses (13–15) are a dānastuti of Śara Śauradevya, or rather what  we might term an anti-dānastuti or, technically, a satire. The first of these verses (13)  poses a rhetorical question that seems to promise lavish praise to come, but the poet  takes this back in verse 14 with another rhetorical question: will you really receive  praise for a gift that consists of calves doled out in miserly fashion? The final verse  specifies just how miserly: a single calf for three poets. In these verses the standard  vocabulary of generosity (benefactor, patron, bounteous one) is deployed sarcasti
cally, and the poet cleverly gives his criticism a gloss of praise.
For an analysis of the phonetic and grammatical features of the entire hymn, see  Watkins (1995: 184–87).
1. He who is king of the separate peoples, a driver with chariots, rich, an overcomer in all battles, who is sung as the preeminent smasher of  Vr̥tra—
2. Beautify that Indra, o Puruhanman, for his help, him whose (mace) is  once again in (the hand of) the apportioner:
the mace, lovely to see, has been put back into his hand, like the great  sun into heaven.
3. No one will catch up with him who by his (ritual?) action created an ever  strengthening one
like Indra, welcomed with sacrifices by all, ingenious, unassailable but of  assailing might,
4. Invincible, mighty, and victorious in battles, in whose (control) are the  great, wide-expanding (waters?).
While he was being born, the milk-cows kept bellowing in unison; the  heavens and earths kept bellowing.
5. Since a hundred heavens and a hundred earths could be yours, Indra, a thousand suns were not equal to you when you were just born, o
mace-bearer, nor were the two world-halves.
6. You have filled all things with your bullish greatness, bull, and with your  strength, strongest one.
Help us to a pen full of cattle with your bright help, bounteous
mace-bearer.
7. A godless mortal shall not acquire refreshment, o long-lived one!
Indra, who will yoke his two steeds that win dappled cows, who will yoke  his two fallow bays—1164 VIII.71
8. (Call upon) him to give to you—Indra, the conqueror to be greatly  magnified,
who is to be called upon at the fords and in foreign parts, who is to be  called upon at the prize-contests.
9. Shape us up for your great generosity, o good one, champion—
(shape us) up for your great giving of bounty, bounteous one; (shape  us) up for great fame, Indra.
10. You are the one who seeks the truth for us, Indra. You find no
satisfaction in him who reviles you.
Gird yourself in between your thighs, o you of mighty manliness. Jab  down the Dāsa with your blows.
11. The man who follows other commandments, who is no son of Manu,  no sacrificer, no devotee of the gods—
him should your own comrade, the mountain [=mace?], send tumbling  down; the mountain (should send down) the Dasyu for easy smiting.
12. O strongest Indra, grab a handful of these (cows), o most capacious  one, to give to us,
like a handful of roasted grains, being disposed toward us. Grab two,  being disposed toward us.
13. O comrades, find the resolve: how shall we bring to success our
invocatory praise of Śara,
who is a benefactor, a patron without restraint?
14. Will you be praised in any way by many seers provided with ritual grass, Śara, if you will hand over your calves in just this way, one by one?
15. The bounteous son of Śūradeva, having grabbed hold of its ear, led a  calf here to us three,
a patron (leading) a nanny-goat to give suck (to three kids).
## 71 (680) Agni
Sudīti Āṅgirasa and/or Purumīḷha Āṅgirasa
15 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas 1–9; br ̥ hat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī arranged  in pragāthas 10–15
This, the last hymn of the small Āṅgirasa collection VIII.67–71, falls into two  parts, defined by meter: verse 1–9 in gāyatrī tr̥cas and 10–15 in br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī pragāthas. As Oldenberg suggested (1888: 217; Noten ad loc.), it could be made up  of two separate hymns, and the lack of thematic continuity in fact favors this divi sion, though there is some shared vocabulary. The first names of the two alternative  poets suggested by the Anukramaṇī were extracted from verse 14.
The first nine verses beg Agni’s protection for the pious worshiper from all  manner of malign and threatening forces, particularly those of other humans. It is Agni’s power as a god that is emphasized, with mortals hostile or devout subject to  this superior divine power, to be punished or rewarded, as they deserve. The second part of the hymn (vss. 10–15) is dominated by a stylistic pattern: Agni  in the accusative case is the goal of sacrificial actions and words throughout this  section. In verse 10 he is not named, but an epithet in the accusative is found in  every pāda of the verse. His name (agním) begins the next verse (11a), and in the  subsequent verses it is featured again and again. Verse 12 contains five occurrences  of agním, one beginning every pāda, plus one in the middle of the third. Verse 13  varies the pattern by beginning with a nominative form of the name, but the second  half-verse returns to the initial accusative, which continues through the subsequent  verses: three examples of initial agním in verse 14 (pādas a, c, d), two in the final verse  (15a, b). The interplay between our ritual devotion and prayers and his gifts and aid  is the topic of this section, but the content is far less noticeable than the form.
1. O Agni, protect us by your great powers from all hostility
and from mortal hatred.
2. For no human fury is master of you (gods), o (Agni), born dear. Just you are the protector of the earth.
3. O child of nourishment, of fortunate flame, along with all the gods give us wealth consisting of all desirable things.
4. Hostilities do not keep that mortal away from wealth, o Agni,
the pious one whom you safeguard.
5. Whom you impel toward the stakes at the winning of the
wisdom—o Agni, inspired poet—
he by your help will arrive at cows.
6. (Give) wealth consisting of many heroes to the pious mortal.
Lead us forth to a better state.
7. Deliver us: do not hand us over to one who wishes evil, o Jātavedas, to the mortal of evil intent.
8. Agni, let no non-god keep away the gift of you, a god.
You are the master of goods.
9. Mete out a measure of your great good, o child of nourishment, to us who are your singers, o comrade, o good one.
10. Let our songs go to him of sharp flame, lovely to see;
(let) our sacrifices (go) with reverence to him of many goods, lauded by  many, for his help—
11. To Agni, the son of strength, Jātavedas, for a gift of valuable things, (Agni,) who once again has come to be the immortal here among
mortals, the most delighting Hotar in the clan.
12. Agni (we beseech) on your behalf with sacrifice to the gods, Agni as the  ceremony proceeds,
Agni first in insights, Agni when a charger (is at stake), Agni to assure  success to the cultivated lands.
1166 VIII.72
13. Let Agni in fellowship give us of his refreshments, he who is master of  valuable things.
Agni we beseech over and over when progeny and posterity (are at
stake), since he is the good one, the protector of our bodies.
14. Agni—with songs reverently invoke him of sharp flame for help;
Agni the famed (do) men (invoke) for wealth, o Purumīḷha; Agni as
shelter for Sudīti.
15. Agni we hymn to keep hatred away from us; Agni to give us luck and  lifetime.
In all the clans he will be the one to be invoked like a helper, the lighter  of the morning rays.
The next group consists of only three hymns, X.72–74 and has no real signature  features.
## 72 (681) Agni or Praise of Oblations
Haryata Prāgātha
18 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn is so opaque that it is not even clear to whom, or what, it is dedicated.  The Anukramaṇī gives two choices: Agni or “praise of oblations” (haviṣāṃ stutiḥ).  There are several good reasons to prefer the second designation, or at least to reject  the first. On the one hand, Agni is named only once, close to the end (vs. 15) and  in conjunction with Indra. Though the ritual fire and its divine representative are  clearly the referents in a number of verses, a number of different ritual substances  and apparatus are also referred to through the hymn; the fire is not significantly  more prominent. Moreover, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 217), the third hymn  in this little collection is clearly to Agni, so that the first should have a different  dedicand.
As a number of scholars have noted, the hymn contains a sequence of ritual  moments, sometimes even quoting from mantras found in later ritual, depicted in  allusive and indirect fashion. Although some have tried to find a systematic and  sequential representation of the, or a, sacrifice, these efforts have not been suc
cessful. Rather we seem to have a set of discontinuous sacrificial vignettes, cast as  riddles. Though nowhere near as famous as the well-known riddle hymn (I.164),  this hymn resembles that one in certain ways, including a fondness for numerology  (vss. 7–9) and for unidentified referents (throughout).
We confess to being uncertain about many of the answers to these implicit rid dles, and for others the machinery of explanation would overwhelm the poetry.  We have therefore for the most part avoided parenthetical identifications and para phrases. In general the first verses (esp. 2–5) seem to concern Agni and the initiation of the sacrifice, signaled by the sighting of the horses and chariot (of the sun?) in  verse 6. Most of the rest of the hymn, verses 7–17, concerns the preparation of  soma. The final verse (18) has much the same structure as verse 6, which closed the  first section of the hymn, and has similar annunciatory function.
1. Make oblation! He will come here. The Adhvaryu seeks (him) again, knowing his command.
2. The Hotar sits down beside the sharp soma-plant, in Manu’s presence, taking pleasure in its companionship.
3. They seek him within (themselves) and among the people, (seek him) as  Rudra beyond inspired thought.
With his tongue they grasp the grain.
4. I have heated my familial bow. Imparting vital force, he has mounted  the wood.
With his tongue he has struck the millstone.
5. The gleaming calf, roaming here, does not find anyone to bind it. It pursues its mama to praise (her).
6. And it’s just now that his team of horses, great and lofty,
the binder of the chariot, has been sighted.
7. The seven (priests) milk the one (cow [=soma plant?]), and the two  (=hands?) send the five (fingers?) nearby,
at the ford of the river, at its sound.
8. With the ten (fingers) of Vivasvant, Indra has agitated the cask
of heaven with his triple hammer.
9. A newer firebrand goes around the ceremonial course three times. With honey the Hotars perform the anointing.
10. With reverence they dip out the encompassing wellspring with its  (water-)wheel above
and its sides facing downward, the inexhaustible one.
11. The pressing stones are just on their way to it. The honey has been  poured down into the lotus
at the wellspring’s surging forth.
12. O cows, approach the wellspring with help. Great is (the vessel?) of the  sacrifice, giving teeming abundance;
its two ears [=handles?] are golden.
13. Into the pressed soma pour glory [=milk], the full glory of the two  world-halves.
The Rasā (River [=water]) should receive the bull.
14. They [=soma juices] recognize their own home. Like calves coming  together with their mothers,
they pair off with their kin [=milk and water].
15. In the jaws of the (soma press) as it chews they make themselves a  support in heaven,
make their reverence to Indra and Agni, and create the sun.
1168 VIII.73
16. The stranger has milked the swelling refreshment, the nourishment  associated with the seven steps,
along with the seven rays of the sun.
17. O Mitra and Varuṇa, at the rising of the sun I take of the soma:
it is healing for the afflicted.
18. And it’s just now that his place, the place of the delightful one, is to be  laid down:
he has stretched around heaven with his tongue.

Unified by its refrain, this hymn otherwise seems haphazardly structured, with  standard straightforward appeals to the Aśvins to come to our sacrifice (e.g., vss.  1–2) alternating with undeveloped questions and statements (e.g., 11–12) and,  more baffling, mythic allusions. The poorly understood story of the Aśvins’ res
cue of Atri is mentioned in verses 3 and 7–8, their relation to Saptavadhri in verse  9, and an unnamed figure, sometimes identified by commentators as Saptavadhri,  is addressed in the final verses 17–18. The stories of Atri and Saptavadhri (who  are sometimes considered to be the same person) have often been discussed, and  radically incompatible plots have been reconstructed for them. See, for example,  Jamison (1991: 212–46) and, more recently, Houben (2010), who discusses previous  accounts. Houben emphatically rejects Jamison’s version, and his own has some  points in its favor but remains unconvincing in its entirety, at least to us.
1. Rise up for the man who acts according to truth; hitch up your chariot, o  Aśvins.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
2. Drive here with your chariot that is quicker even than a wink, Aśvins. – Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
3. For Atri you made an underlayer with snow beneath the hot pot, o  Aśvins.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
4. Where are you? Where have you gone? Where have you flown like  falcons?
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
5. If today, at any time at all, you two should hear this call,
– let the help of you two become truly nearby.
6. The Aśvins, most often summoned on their journey, do I beg for closest  friendship.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby. 7. You made a helpful house for Atri, o Aśvins.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
8. You obstruct the fire from burning, for Atri who speaks agreeably. – Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
9. Saptavadhri honed the blade of fire with hope.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
10. Come here, o you who bring bullish goods; hear this call of mine. – Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
11. What is this (deed?) of yours proclaimed in age-old fashion, like that of  old men?
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
12. You have a common kinship, a common connection (with us),  o Aśvins.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
13. Your chariot that drives through the airy realms, through the two  world-halves, o Aśvins—
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
14. (With it) come here near to us with your thousands of cattle and horses. – Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
15. Do not overlook us with your thousands of cattle and horses.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
16. Breathing her ruddy breath, Dawn has appeared; following the truth  she has made the light.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.
17. Looking hard at the Aśvins, as a man with a hatchet does a tree— – Let the help of your two become truly nearby.
18. Break (it) like a fortress, o bold one, you who were oppressed by the  black clan.
– Let the help of you two become truly nearby.

15 verses: mixed anuṣṭubh and gāyatrī arranged in trcas, with the first verse of each ̥ trca anu ̥ ṣṭubh, the other two gāyatrī; final trca (13–15) all anu ̥ ṣṭubh
This hymn consists of five tr̥cas, each of which is thematically and syntactically uni fied. The first four (vss. 1–12) concentrate on the formal praise and invocation of  Agni, who appears in three of the four (vss. 1–6, 10–12) insistently as the accusative  object of the reverent approach of the worshipers. (The other tr̥ca, verses 7–9, has  the worshiper’s prayerful thought as its subject.)
1170 VIII.74
Somewhat surprisingly, Agni is several times associated with a lexical and mythic  complex far more characteristic of Indra: obstacle [/Vr̥tra] smashing. Agni is called  the best smasher of obstacles in verse 4, and the theme returns in verses 9 and  12. This association may have been triggered here by the identification of Agni as  the tribal fire of the Anu (vs. 4), the group whose leader appears to be the poet’s  patron Śrutarvan (vss. 4, 13, 15). The tribal fire represents the (temporary) unifi
cation of separate groups of people generally mobilizing against outside threat,  and an obstacle-smashing tribal fire would serve their purposes well. Although the  unification theme is not insistent in the hymn, notice that the first verse begins by  announcing Agni’s affiliation with every clan, “dear to many” (vs. 1ab), and the joint  invocation of Agni by various peoples is repeatedly mentioned (vss. 2, 6, 10, 12).
The final tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), with slightly different metrical structure, is the poet’s  dānastuti of Śrutarvan and his gift of four horses and a chariot. Though it is not as  self-consciously clever as some dānastutis, verse 13 contains a nice pun.
1. The guest of every clan, dear to many, (shall we praise) on your behalf  as (we) seek the prize;
Agni belonging to the house shall I praise on your behalf, (with) speech  and with thoughts of fortifying song—
2. (Agni), whom the peoples laud with their lauds like Mitra [/an ally], offering oblations to him whose potion is melted butter—
3. To Jātavedas, much to be admired, who raised to heaven
the oblations lifted up among the conclave of the gods.
4. We have come to the best smasher of obstacles [/of Vr̥tra], preeminent  Agni [/the chief fire] belonging to the Anu,
before whose face lofty Śrutarvan, the son of R̥kṣa, flares up;
5. To immortal Jātavedas, lovely to see across the dark shades,
receiving the ghee-oblation, worthy to be invoked;
6. To Agni, whom these peoples here urgently invoke with oblations, pouring offerings with their ladles held forth.
7. This newer thought here has been produced from us for you, o Agni, o delighting, well-born, strong-willed guest, unerring and wondrous.
8. Let it be most wealful, most pleasing, and dear to you, Agni.
Well praised by it, grow strong.
9. Brilliance with its brilliance, it should set lofty fame upon fame
at the smashing of obstacles [/Vr̥tra].
10. (Him,) bestowing the chariot, the horse, and the cow, vibrant, a lord of  settlements like Indra,
whose claims to fame you [=priests] bring to triumph, and the one ever  to be admired (whom) the separate peoples (hymn).
11. You whom Gopavana will please with his hymn, o Agni, o Aṅgiras, o pure one, hear our call. 12. You whom the peoples urgently invoke to win the prize,
be attentive when it’s the time for overcoming obstacles.
13. Being summoned to Śrutarvan the son of R̥kṣa, who is roused to elation, I will swipe [=take] four head (of horses) as if swiping [=stroking/
grooming] flocks of tufted (sheep).
14. The four swift runners of most powerful (Śrutarvan),
along with a good chariot, will convey me to my pleasure, as birds
conveyed the son of Tugra.
15. This is really true—what I forcefully point out to you, o great river  Paruṣṇi:
o waters, there exists no mortal who is a greater giver of horses than  most powerful (Śrutarvan).
The next group of hymns, VIII.75–79, consists of one hymn to Agni (75), three to  Indra (76–78), and one to Soma (79), in appropriately descending number of verses.  The Indra hymns are all assigned to the same Kāṇva poet by the Anukramaṇī, but  the other two hymns have different authors, 75 an Āṅgirasa, 79 a Bhārgava.
## 75 (684) Agni
Virūpa Āṅgirasa
16 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas ̥
Agni’s role in the sacrifice and his relationship with the poet-sacrificers is the subject  of the first two conventional tr̥cas (vss. 1–6), but a martial, indeed a belligerent,  strain appears beginning with verse 7. The setting seems to be a contest for cattle  or a cattle raid, and the poet calls on Agni to use his aggressive powers to defeat  encroaching threats and assure victory and the winning of cattle and wealth (vss.  7–13). The hymn ends with general, and less combative, prayers for help for the  sacrificer (vss. 14–16).
1. Harness your horses that best summon the gods, o Agni, like a
charioteer.
Take your seat as the primordial Hotar.
2. And as one who knows better, invite the gods for us, o god.
Make our trust (in the sacrifice) into all things worth desiring,
3. Since you—o youngest one, o son of strength to whom offering is made— have become the one possessing the truth and worthy of the sacrifice.
4. This Agni here is the lord of the thousandfold prize and of the
hundredfold;
as sage poet he is the head of riches.
1172 VIII.76
5. As craftsmen [/R̥bhus] bend the felly, bend here, closer to the sacrifice, with the shared invocations, o Aṅgiras [=Agni].
6. Now for him, for the heaven-bound bull, o Virūpa [=poet],
with your very own speech rouse your lovely praise hymn.
7. What Paṇi shall we lay low with his weapon, the weapon of Agni whose  eye is not fooled,
when cattle are at stake?
8. Let not the clans of the gods, like rosy bathers [=Dawns],
leave us behind like cows a scrawny (calf).
9. Let not the coercion of anyone of evil intention and
encompassing hatred
crash down on us, like a wave on a boat.
10. Homage to your power, Agni! The separate peoples hymn you, o god. With your attacks shake our foe to pieces.
11. Surely you will toil for wealth for us, for our quest for cattle, Agni? Make a wide (way) for us, you wide-maker.
12. Do not shun us in this (contest for) great stakes, any more than a  burden-bearer would (his burden).
Win wealth as your takings.
13. Let this misfortune here follow some other one than us, to frighten him,  o Agni.
Strengthen our power of attack.
14. (The man) who offers homage or is no stingy patron, whose ritual labor  he [=Agni] has enjoyed—
him alone does Agni help with strengthening.
15. From beyond the distant boundary, cross over to the ones below, where I am. Help them!
16. For we know of your help from of old, o Agni—help like that of a  father—
and so we beg your favor.

Kurusuti Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas ̥
A simple hymn that never strays far from its twin themes: Indra accompanied  by the Maruts and Indra drinking soma. The Maruts are mentioned as Indra’s  companions in each of the first nine verses, and the invitation to soma occu pies the middle six verses (4–9), while the Vr̥tra myth, glancingly alluded to,  occupies much of the first tr̥ca. Only the last tr̥ca lacks mention of the Maruts. The first verse of the last tr̥ca (10) appears to present the soma-drinking as  accomplished, and Indra’s role as Dasyu-smiter is celebrated in the next (11).  The final verse of the hymn (12) is a meta-verse describing the production of  the hymn itself. The numerological expression “eight-footed, nine-cornered” is,  as Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.), a reference to the gāyatrī tr̥cas in which  this hymn is composed, with eight-syllable lines arranged into three verses of  three pādas each.
Although the hymn is simple, it makes implicit reference to a complex ritual  development—that, in the course of the R̥gvedic period, the Midday Pressing, orig inally dedicated entirely to Indra, made room for the Maruts as joint recipients of  the soma with Indra. An important mythological treatment of this ritual innova tion is found in I.165 and related hymns. Here we see only the liturgical result, an  insistence on Indra Marutvant in a soma-drinking context.
1. This master of artifice here I now invoke, Indra, holding sway by  his might,
accompanied by the Maruts—as if to twist (him here).
2. This Indra here, with the Maruts as comrades, split apart the head  of Vr̥tra
with a hundred-jointed mace.
3. Having grown strong, with the Maruts as comrades, Indra propelled  Vr̥tra apart,
releasing the waters of the sea.
4. Here he is—the one by whom in truth this sun was won,
by Indra, accompanied by the Maruts—to drink the soma.
5. Accompanied by the Maruts, possessing the silvery drink, mighty,  conferring abundance—
Indra do we invoke with songs.
6. Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, we invoke with our age-old
thought,
to drink of this soma here.
7. O Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, giver of rewards, drink the soma,  you of a hundred resolves,
at this sacrifice here, much praised one.
8. Just for you, o Indra, accompanied by the Maruts, possessor of the  stone, are the pressed soma-drinks,
provided with hymns, poured out with our whole heart.
9. Just drink, o Indra, with the Maruts as comrades, the pressed soma at  the rituals of the day,
sharpening your mace with might.
10. Standing up with your might, you made your two lips shake after you  had drunk
the pressed soma in the cup, Indra.1174 VIII.77
11. Both the world-halves yearned after you as you howled,
Indra, when you became the smiter of the Dasyus.
12. An eight-footed nine-cornered speech that touches the truth—
I have measured out its body because of Indra.

Kurusuti Kāṇva
11 verses:  gāyatrī arranged in trcas 1–9; br ̥ hat ̥ ī 10, satobrhat ̥ ī 11, arranged in a  pragātha
This hymn primarily treats the obscure Emuṣa myth, a boyhood deed of Indra’s.  As far as can be determined, in the R̥gvedic version (there are later Vedic prose ver sions, e.g., Taittirīya Saṃhitā VI.2.4.2–3) the just-born Indra, after a brief dialogue  with his mother, takes a bow named Bunda and kills a boar named Emuṣa, allow ing him to capture (or Viṣṇu to capture for him) a special mess of rice porridge, as  well as some buffalo, which he cooks for his father and mother. The most impor tant (and essentially only) R̥gvedic passages about this myth outside of VIII.77 are  I.61.7, VIII.45.4–5, VIII.69.14–15, and VIII.96.2.
Our hymn begins with Indra’s dialogue with his mother (vss. 1–2), a dialogue  found in the same words in VIII.45.4–5. Since in that passage Indra takes the  Bunda bow prior to questioning his mother, we can connect the first two verses  of this hymn with the story in verses 6–8, even though the Bunda bow is not men
tioned here in verses 1–2 and other material intervenes. Between the dialogue of  verses 1–2 and the rest of the story starting in verse 6 are several references to other  deeds of Indra’s, at least one of them (vs. 5) even more obscure than the Emuṣa  myth. It does seem likely, however, that the drinking of prodigious amounts of  soma in verse 4 is part of the Emuṣa story: in III.48, also about Indra’s boyhood  and his relationship to mother and father, he consumes vast amounts of soma  right after birth.
When the story is taken up again, we first are given a general summary of the  myth in 6ab, and then the first incident in the story, the taking of the Bunda bow,  in 6c. In our opinion, verse 8 is the speech of Indra’s mother, urging him to cap ture the porridge by means of the bow. Her “just born right now” (vs. 8c) echoes  the “just born” that begins verse 1, and these two phrases form a ring defining the  Emuṣa story. Verse 7 continues the story of the Bunda bow and the aiming of the  arrow. Verse 9, the final verse in the gāyatrī meter, is a standard summary of Indra’s  great deeds.
The last two verses (10–11) are in different meter. The first gives a précis of the  myth, introducing Viṣṇu’s role in securing the rice porridge, a detail that does not  appear in accord with verse 6. The final pāda of verse 10 identifies Indra’s opponent  as a boar (no mention of the boar in the earlier verses) and in its final word provides the boar’s name, Emuṣa, as the solution of the riddle. (The name Emuṣa occurs  only here in the R̥gveda.) The version given in verse 10 agrees better with the one in  I.61.7 than it does with the treatment in the rest of this hymn and indeed in the rest  of Maṇḍala VIII, which contains the other pertinent passages, and one wonders if  the poet was trying to harmonize two versions that he knew of this myth by tack
ing the Viṣṇu verse onto the Viṣṇu-less version found in the gāyatrī portion of the  hymn. The final verse (11) is a high rhetorical celebration of the Bunda bow and of  Indra’s arms that wield it.
1. Just born, the one of a hundred resolves asked his mother,
“Which ones are powerful; which ones are famed?”
2. Then she, the strong one [/Śavasī], named to him Aurṇavābha [/the  spider’s son] and Ahīśuva [/the one puffed up like a snake].
“Let them be (yours) to lay low, son.”
3. The Vr̥tra-smiter just hammered them together, like spokes in a nave  with a hammer.
When grown up, he became smiter of Dasyus.
4. At one shot he drank thirty ponds at once,
hogsheads [?] of soma—(did) Indra.
5. He bored through to the Gandharva in the bottomless dusky realms, to strengthen the composers of sacred formulations—(did) Indra.
6. He pierced (the boar Emuṣa), pierced the cooked rice porridge forth  from the mountains, and held it fast.
Indra (took) the well-stretched Bunda-bow.
7. Your arrow with a hundred ruddy glints and a thousand feathers was  the single one
that you made into your yokemate, o Indra.
8. [Indra’s mother:] “With it [=Bunda-bow] bring to the praisers, to the  superior men and to their ladies, (the rice porridge?) to eat,
though you were just born right now, o steadfast one of the R̥bhus.”
9. These highest exploits performed by you in profusion
you held fast with your whole heart.
10. All these things Viṣṇu brought here, the wide-striding one spurred on  by you:
a hundred buffaloes, a rice porridge cooked in milk—(when) Indra
(pierced) the boar Emuṣa.
11. Powerfully ruling, well-made, made of boar is your bow, the golden  Bunda, that aims straight.
Your two arms are fit for battle, well-equipped, increasing injury even  for one who protects himself from injury.

## 78 (687) Indra
Kurusuti Kāṇva
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas 1–9, br ̥ hat ̥ ī 10
This hymn is all about greed. The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) barely mentions the offerings  we make to Indra in the haste to list the things we want in return, down to the  earrings in verse 3. The last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) praises both Indra and Soma for their  (potential) generosity, and verse 9 gives another list of desired gifts. Verse 10, in a  different meter, may be the most egregious of all: the poet, picking up the desire he  expressed for grain in verse 9, tells Indra he plans to do no labor for his grain, but  expects Indra to deliver it, not only grown but processed—preferably stacked, but  at least mown. So Indra is expected to serve as farmhand! This verse may indirectly  express the stockbreeder’s disdain for agriculture.
The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) contrasts somewhat with its surroundings. Though  the greed motif is found in verse 4, it is expressed in terms of Indra’s unique pow ers to increase wealth, to win goods, and to give them. The rhetorical pattern set  in this verse carries into the following verses, where the description of the god’s  powers becomes more general. However, the theme of the rest of the hymn is not  far from the surface, for Indra’s ability to see and to anticipate everything a mortal  might do would allow him to identify proper recipients and deny gifts to those who  behave badly.
1. (Taking pleasure) in the offering cake and of the soma-stalk, Indra, bring  here to us a thousand
and a hundred cows, o champion.
2. Bring here to us an ornament, a cow, a horse, an adornment,
along with golden jewelry.
3. And bring here to us many earrings, bold one,
for you are famed as a good one.
4. Never is another man within your abundance, Indra. There is no good  winner and no good giver
other than you for the cantor, o champion.
5. Never is Indra to be put down nor the able one to be circumvented. He hears and sees all.
6. Not to be outwitted, he watches out for the fury of mortals,
watches out before the insult (comes).
7. Full of resolve is the belly of the powerful, (booty-)apportioning,
Vr̥tra-smiting drinker of soma.
8. In you are goods united and all auspicious things, o Soma,
goods good for giving, not to go astray. 9. Just toward you does my desire hasten, seeking grain, seeking cattle,  seeking gold,
toward you, seeking horses.
10. With my hope on you, Indra, I never take scythe in hand.
Supply us with grain by the handful, whether just mown or already
stacked together, bounteous one.
## 79 (688) Soma
Krtnu Bh ̥ ārgava
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9, probably arranged in trcas ̥
One of the rare hymns to Soma outside of the IXth Maṇḍala. None of the physical  or ceremonial properties of soma the substance, the ritual drink, is found in this  hymn. There is only indirect reference to the preparation of soma, in verse 3, where  the “body-makers,” presumably the priests who prepare the soma, are given shelter  from hatred, and in verse 4 soma is called “possessor of the silvery (drink) [that is,  soma itself],” an epithet otherwise almost exclusively used of Indra.
Instead of the ritual soma, we have here a portrait of an all-powerful and multi talented divine helper: a winner (vs. 1), a poet (vs. 1), a healer (vs. 2), a giver (vs. 5),  a finder of lost objects (vs. 6), and especially a protector from hostility (vss. 3, 4, 9).  Only in verse 8 is there any hint that Soma might ever be anything but benevolent  to us, but this hint is not developed.
1. Here is the effective gambler, ungraspable, all-conquering Soma, who got  the lucky break—
a seer, an inspired poet with poetic skill.
2. He covers over what is naked; he heals everything that is sick.
The blind man sees; the lame sets forth.
3. O Soma, for those who create your body [=soma-pressers] you hold out a  broad defense
from the hateful things done by others.
4. You possessor of the silvery drink—through your perception, through  your skills you keep away from heaven and earth
the hatred of any evil man.
5. And when those with (ritual) tasks proceed to their tasks, they will surely  reach the generosity of the giver,
should they (manage to) deflect the desire of the thirsting man.
6. He finds what was previously lost; he raises up the man who
follows truth.
He lengthens our (as yet) untraversed lifetime.
1178 VIII.80
7. Very kindly to us, merciful, of undistracted resolve, unquenchable— be weal for our heart, o Soma.
8. Don’t agitate us, o Soma; don’t frighten us, o king.
Don’t smite our heart with turmoil.
9. When I behold malevolent thoughts of the gods in my own seat,
o king, ward off hateful things; you who give rewards, ward off failures.
The next group of hymns consists of 80–87, with three hymns to Indra (80–82),  one to the All Gods (83), one to Agni (84), and three to the Aśvins (85–87), all but  the last showing the appropriate descending number of verse. But 87 can in fact be  broken into two original hymns, to produce the proper sequence. The poets named  by the Anukramaṇī are various.
## 80 (689) Indra (1–9), Gods (10)
Ekadyū Naudhasa
10 verses: gāyatrī, probably arranged in trcas, except final verse, tri ̥ ṣṭubh 10
The final pāda of this hymn (10d) is the same as the refrain in the verbally clever and  finely structured hymns of Nodhas Gautama in Maṇḍala I (I.58, 60–64). (R̥gveda  I.59 is also attributed to him, but lacks the refrain; see also nearby VIII.88.) The  patronymic of our poet (Naudhasa) identifies him as a descendant of Nodhas, and  he seems to have inherited some of his ancestor’s skill:  the tone of the hymn is  light and slangy, and he addresses Indra informally and with mocking exasperation,  especially in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), in which the poet complains that Indra has  been slow to help his chariot in the race (see also vs. 8).
The poet seems to be withholding his highest praise for Indra until Indra has  earned it. He begins the hymn by announcing that he hasn’t chosen anyone else  for certain as his mercy-giver, and invites Indra to show mercy. He ends the hymn  proper (vs. 9) with a promise that Indra will be proclaimed as lord after he “makes  his fourth sacrificial name.” What these four names are is not at all certain, but  we suggest that the phrase forms a ring with the first verse, where the title/name  “mercy-giver” hasn’t yet been bestowed on the god. The poet is thus urging Indra  to perform the actions that will earn him the names that will attract sacrifice and  praise from mortals.
In the final verse, in a different meter, the poet names himself and reminds all the  gods (and goddesses, an unusual inclusion) that he has performed service for them,  demanding appropriate recompense.
1. Because I have not made anyone else my for-certain dispenser of mercy,  o you of a hundred resolves,
be merciful to us, Indra. 2. You who, not shirking, in the past, time after time, helped us to win  the prize,
be merciful to us, Indra.
3. Are you really one who rouses even the feeble, who are the helper of the  soma-presser?
Will you indeed muster your ability for us?
4. O Indra, possessor of the stone, advance our chariot even when it is behind; put it in front for me.
5. Blast it! Are you just going to sit there now? Put our chariot first for utmost fame that seeks the prize.
6. Help our chariot that seeks the prize. Easy for you to do. Why this  runaround?
Just make us victorious!
7. Indra, stand fast. You are a stronghold. The lucky woman goes to a  rendezvous with you—
this visionary thought conforming to her season [/the ritual sequence]. 8. Don’t make it [=chariot?] share in disgrace: the racecourse is wide, the  stake is set;
the elbows have been twisted outward [=driving posture?].
9. When you will make your fourth sacrificial name—this we eagerly  desire—
after that you will be solemnly proclaimed as our lord.
10. Ekadyū has strengthened you, you immortals; he has invigorated you,  you gods and you who are goddesses.
To him show generosity to be praised. – Early in the morning—soon— he should come, acquiring goods through his insight.

9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Though assigned to a different poet, this hymn, like the last one (VIII.81), addresses  Indra with a certain irreverence and informality, with multiple demands that Indra  seize goods and bring them to us, in addition to the usual praise of his power and  generosity. One verse is somewhat puzzling: the middle verse (5), in which Indra  seems to participate in the ritual in priestly roles as well as being the object of wor
ship, but this theme is not pursued.
1. Grab for us here a brilliant cattle-rich handful, o Indra,
who have great hands, with your right one.
1180 VIII.82
2. For we know you as powerfully ranging, of powerful gifts, of powerful  bounty,
of powerful mass, with your help.
3. For when you wish to give, o champion, neither gods nor mortals
hinder you, anymore than they would a fearsome bull.
4. Come now! Let us praise Indra, the sovereign king who holds sway  over goods.
He will not neglect us with his generosity.
5. He will start up the praise; he will join in the singing; he will listen to the  sāman being sung.
He will greet it with generosity.
6. Bring to us with your right hand; seize with your left.
Indra, don’t deal us out of goods.
7. Hop to! Bring here boldly, bold one, for the peoples
the possessions of the very impious.
8. Indra, the prize that now is yours is to be won by the inspired poets. Win it with us.
9. Your all-glittering prizes come speeding in an instant to us.
They awaken at our will and right away.

9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn is an insistent invitation to the soma sacrifice, punctuated by impera tives: “run,” “come here,” “drink,” and so forth, and larded with descriptions of the  soma in various stages of preparation. It is simple in diction and entirely focused  on the ritual situation and the hope for Indra’s arrival, save for the last verse (9),  which alludes briefly to the myth of the stealing of soma from heaven. The last tr̥ca  is marked by a refrain.
1. Run here from afar and from nearby, Vr̥tra-smiter,
in response to the proffering of the honey.
2. Sharp are the soma-drinks. Come here! The pressed drinks are ready to  exhilarate.
Drink heartily as you are accustomed.
3. Become exhilarated on the refreshment, and then in accord with your  desire and your fervor
it will become weal for your heart, Indra.
4. You without rival—here, come here! You are being called down to the hymns (while you are) in the highest luminous realm of heaven. 5. For you this one here has been pressed by stones, prepared with cows  [=milk], for exhilaration.
The soma is being poured forth, Indra.
6. Indra, hear my call. Reach the drinking and satiety
of the soma that has been pressed among us and provided with cows.
7. Indra, the soma in the beakers and in the cups that has been pressed  for you—
drink of it. You are master of it.
8. The soma that is seen in the cups, like the moon in the waters—
drink of it. You are master of it.
9. That which the falcon brought to you with his foot across the airy  realms—the one that could not be recaptured—
drink of it. You are master of it.
## 83 (692) All Gods
Kusīdin Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–6) of this hymn to the All Gods mention only the Ādityas  and are quite straightforward. The poet praises the help of these gods in the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and asks for valuables in the second (vss. 4–6). The final tr̥ca turns to  other gods (see esp. vs. 7) and to a more interesting topic: the ultimate kinship of  gods and men (vss. 7–8). The gods are reminded of this relationship presumably to  stimulate them to give help and goods.
1. We would choose the great help of the gods,
of the bulls, to aid us.
2. Let them be our yokemates always—Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman—
and forethoughtful strengtheners.
3. You carry us across many perils [?], as if across the waters with boats— you charioteers of truth.
4. Let there be a treasure for us, o Aryaman; a treasure worthy of praise,  o Varuṇa,
for we would choose a treasure.
5. For you forethoughtful ones, who care for the stranger, are holding sway  over a treasure.
What belongs to evil (shall) not (reach) it, o Ādityas.
6. O you of good gifts, we, whether dwelling peacefully or traveling on our route, call upon you, gods, for strengthening.
7. O Indra, Viṣṇu, Maruts, Aśvins—of these your common births with us take cognizance.
1182 VIII.84
8. You of good gifts, now once again in the same way we bring to the fore  our brotherhood with you
in the womb of our mother.
9. For you of good gifts, with Indra preeminent—you are heaven-sent. And so I call just upon you.
## 84 (693) Agni
Uśanā Kāvya
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This short and simple hymn to Agni makes no reference to his fiery qualities,  and only glancing ones to his ritual role: as guest in our houses (vs. 1) set here  by the gods (vs. 2). The most salient aspect of the hymn is the series of ques tions it contains: in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) the poet asks what services we  should perform for Agni and how we should perform them (vss. 4–5); the final  tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) again begins with a question (vs. 7), this time about which poet  is the recipient of Agni’s poetic stimulation. The poet is clearly concerned  with producing the proper praise for the god; he mentions hymns or praises in  verses 3–7.
The Anukramaṇī names as the poet the legendary and mythic figure Uśanā Kāvya, to whom the three hymns IX.87–89 are also attributed. It is not clear why,  save for the mention of the kaví “sage poet” in verse 2.
1. The dearest guest will I praise for you—dear like an ally—
Agni, worth acquiring like a chariot,
2. Him, discerning like a sage poet, whom the gods now once again
have set down among mortals.
3. You, youngest one—protect pious men; listen to their hymns.
Guard their lineage along with their life.
4. In what fashion (shall we present) a praise invocation to you, o Agni,  Aṅgiras, child of nourishment,
(fit) for your desire, your fervor?
5. With our mind on what sacrifice might we do pious service, o youthful  (son) of strength?
And what shall I speak as homage here?
6. So that then you will make all dwellings lovely for us
and make our hymns have riches as their prize.
7. Whose thoughts in profusion do you now quicken, o houselord—
the man whose hymns are (presented) to you at the winning of
cattle? 8. They groom him, the very resolute one who goes in front at the
contests,
the prizewinner, in their own dwelling places.
9. He dwells peacefully in peaceful ways that bring success—whom no one  smites, but who himself smites.
O Agni, whoever is rich in heroes thrives.

Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Renou (EVP XVI:  68)  deems this hymn “elementary,” and indeed the hymn  reduces the divine–human interaction to its simplest dimensions—the refrain  promising the gods ritual offerings and the rest of the verse sketching the poet’s  invitation, the gods’ journey, and the returns desired. The poet identifies himself  twice (vss. 3–4).
1. Come to my call, o Nāsatyas, o Aśvins,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
2. Hear this praise song of mine, Aśvins, this call of mine,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
3. This Kr̥ṣṇa is calling you, o Aśvins whose goods are prizewinning  mares,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
4. Hear the call of Kr̥ṣṇa the praising singer, o men,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
5. Extend undeceivable protection to the praising poet, o men,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
6. Go to the house of the pious man who praises just so, o Aśvins,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
7. Hitch the donkey to the chariot whose parts are solid, o you who bring  bullish goods,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
8. With your triply-turning chariot with its three chariot boxes drive here, o  Aśvins,
to drink of the honeyed soma.
9. Now promote my hymns, o Nāsatyas, o Aśvins,
to drink of the honeyed soma.1184 VIII.86
## 86 (695) Aśvins
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa or Viśvaka Kārṣṇi
5 verses: jagatī
This hymn clearly depicts a precise situation, with the poet Viśvaka making a direct  appeal to the Aśvins, but the particular nature of the situation is difficult to ascer tain. The two named men, Viśvaka and Viṣṇāpū, are found together three times else where, always in Aśvin context. In nearly identical Kakṣīvant passages (I.116.23,  117.7) the Aśvins “gave” (dadathuḥ) Viṣṇāpū to Kr̥ṣṇiya Viśvaka (Viṣṇāpū com pared to “a lost herd-animal” in 116.23); in X.65.12 they “let loose” (áva sr̥jathuḥ)  Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka. The first verb occurs twice in our hymn (2b, 3b), though not  with a personal object; the other verb has a close synonym (mumócatam “release”)  in the refrain of all five verses. Thus, our hymn seems roughly to conform to the  other R̥gvedic occurrences of these personae. Unfortunately this is all we know  of the story: neither of the named men occurs in later texts, and though Geldner  provides a contextualizing narrative, himself relying on Sāyaṇa, with Viśvaka the  “grieved and deserted” (betrübte und verlassene) father who catches sight of his son,  a poet who had gone far away to seek his fortune, there is no real evidence for this  plot in the R̥gvedic passages—not even for the father–son relationship. Like many
of the Aśvin myths it is intriguing and probably ultimately unknowable. The Viśvaka/Viṣṇāpū episode seems only to occupy the first three verses, which  may form a tr̥ca, as Oldenberg suggests (Noten ad loc.). The last two verses (4–5)  retain the final-pāda refrain (of vss. 1–3), but omit the repeated c-pāda with its  mention of Viśvaka. The appeal to Indra for help (vs. 4) and the praise of truth (vs.  5) seem loosely attached to the rest of the hymn.
1. Since both of you are wondrous healers, embodying joy, and both of you  are (men) of skill and of speech,
Viśvaka calls upon you at the making of bodies [=sons?]. – Do not keep  us away from partnership with you. Release (him? [=Viṣṇāpū?])!
2. How shall one of expansive mind now offer praise to you? You two have  given insight (to me? Viṣṇāpū?) to seek a better state.
Viśvaka calls upon you at the making of bodies. – Do not keep us away  from partnership with you. Release (him?)!
3. Since you two have given this radiance to Viṣṇāpū to seek a better state, o  you who provide many enjoyments,
Viśvaka calls upon you at the making of bodies. – Do not keep us away  from partnership with you. Release (him?)!
4. And this hero, the winner of spoils and possessor of the silvery drink  [=Indra], do we call upon for help, even though he is at a distance,
upon him whose favor is sweetest like that of a father. – Do not keep us  away from partnership with you. Release (him?)!
5. By truth god Savitar performs his labors; the horn of truth is extended widely. The truth overpowers even those doing great battle. – Do not keep us  away from partnership with you. Release (him?)!

Dyumnīka Vāsiṣṭha or Priyamedha Āṅgirasa or Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī arranged in pragāthas
A typical and rather banal Aśvin hymn, with the simple message “come here, drink  the soma, give us aid and goods,” although there are a few striking images, espe cially in verse 1.
As Oldenberg (1888: 217) points out, this six-verse hymn, following a five-verse  hymn, violates the proper order, but, as he also points out, the first two pragāthas  are parallel in structure and phraseology, and may well form one four-verse hymn,  with the final pragātha (vss. 5–6) an originally separate hymn. Detaching the last  verses would restore an acceptable order, with a five-verse hymn (86), followed by  four- and two-verse hymns.
1. Brilliant is the praise song for you two, o Aśvins, like a blood-red  (horse) [?] at its outpouring. Come here!
This (outpouring) of pressed honey is dear to heaven, o men. Drink like  buffaloes at a salt-pocket.
2. Drink the honeyed hot milk, o Aśvins; sit here on the ritual grass, o men. Reaching exhilaration here in the dwelling of Manu, protect our vital  energy along with our property.
3. The Priyamedhas have called you here with all your forms of help. Drive your course right up to the pleasing sacrifice of the man who has  twisted the ritual grass at the rituals of daybreak.
4. Drink the honeyed soma, o Aśvins; sit close together on the ritual grass. Having grown strong, come from heaven right up to our good praise, like  buffaloes to a salt-pocket.
5. Now drive here with your horses frothing at the mouth, o Aśvins.
O wondrous ones of golden course, o lords of beauty, strong through  truth, drink the soma.
6. Because we inspired poets in our admiration call upon you to win  the prize,
you two, agreeable, wondrous, and possessed of many wonders—come  here with insight and attentive hearing, o Aśvins.
Oldenberg groups the four Indra hymns 88–91 together, though their numbers of  verses do not conform to the expected sequence.
1186 VIII.88
## 88 (697) Indra
Nodhas Gautama
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn is attributed by the Anukramaṇī to Nodhas Gautama, the skillful poet  of I.58–64, whose descendant Ekadyū Naudhasa is the purported author of nearby  VIII.80, which utilized the Nodhas Gautama refrain. This refrain is not found in  this hymn, though the most striking word in the refrain, makṣū́ “soon, right away,”  does appear in verse 2. And in verse 4 the Gotamas are identified as creators of the  chant being presented to Indra in phraseology very close to that used in the Nodhas  Gautama hymns in Maṇḍala I (esp. I.61.16, but also I.60.5, I.63.9, I.62.13).
The hymn contains the usual mixture of praise for Indra’s overwhelming might  and pleas for his largesse. The poet uses Indra’s unconstrained powers as an argu ment for his exercising generosity (see esp. vss. 3, 6). It is a well-crafted and pleasing  piece; however, whether it is a part of the oeuvre of the Nodhas of Maṇḍala I is  difficult to determine on stylistic grounds.
1. To him, the wondrous, vanquishing with his attack, becoming exhilarated  from the good stalk,
to Indra do we bellow with our hymns on your behalf, like milk-cows in  good pastures to their calf.
2. The heaven-ruling one of good drops, swathed in powers, much
nourishing like a mountain
do we beseech for a prize rich in livestock, hundredfold, thousandfold,  consisting of cattle—right away.
3. The high, hard rocks do not obstruct you, Indra.
When you wish to give goods to a praiser like me, no one confounds this  (intention) of yours.
4. As a battler with resolve, vast power, and wondrous skill, you surmount  all created things with your might.
This chant here will turn you hither for help, the chant which the
Gotamas have generated.
5. Because you project beyond the limits of heaven with your strength, the earthly realm does not contain you, Indra. You have waxed strong  following your independent power.
6. There is no constriction of your bounty, bounteous one, when you show  favor to the pious man.
Become the stimulator of our speech, most munificent, for the winning  of prizes. VIII.89 (698) Indra
Nrmedha ̥ Āṅgirasa and Purumedha Āṅgirasa
7 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas 1–4; anuṣtubh 5–6,  brhat ̥ ī 7, arranged in a trcḁ
The signature word of this hymn is br̥hánt “lofty”: it is the first and last word of the  hymn, and appears in every verse except the two anuṣṭubh verses (5–6). (Note that the  names of the other two meters in the hymn, br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī, contain a form of  this word as well.) The theme of the hymn is the Vr̥tra battle and the singing of the  Maruts that strengthens and inspires Indra for the battle. The middle verse (4) is quite  possibly the Maruts’ direct address to Indra, the sacred formulation (bráhman—note  the phonological similarity to br̥hánt) mentioned in the previous verse (3).
The hymn begins and ends with an exhortation to produce a song or hymn for  Indra. In verse 1 it is explicitly the Maruts who are thus urged (so also vs. 3), but  in the last half of verse 7 the addressees are not identified (though they must be  plural, unlike the singular “you” of 7ab). This lack of referent allows the verse to  be interpreted in two ways—as a further address to the Maruts or as an address to  the human poets—and this in turn allows the Maruts and the poets to be identified  with each other and allows the current ritual to acquire the resonance of a divine  correspondent. The ritual context is clear from the beginning: in verse 1 the gen eration of the light suggests the dawn sacrifice; in 6ab the creation of the sacrifice  and its elements are Indra’s recompense for his cosmogonic deeds; and in 7cd the  mention of the heated gharma pot evokes a particular ritual, the Pravargya, which  involves heating milk to boiling—milk that may be indirectly alluded to in 7a.
The hymn is also notable for what it lacks: any request for aid or riches. It is that  very rare thing in the R̥gveda, a pure hymn of praise. It is also nicely crafted, with  balanced rhetorical responsions and variations and phonological and morphologi cal play throughout, in deceptively direct and simple language.
1. For Indra, o Maruts, sing the lofty (sāman) that best smites Vr̥tra, with which those who are strong through truth [=Maruts or gods] gave  birth to the light, god(like) and wakeful, for the god.
2. The smiter of malediction blew away the interdictions. Then brilliant  Indra was at hand.
The gods yielded themselves to partnership with you, Indra—you of  lofty radiance, with the Maruts as your flock.
3. To lofty Indra, o Maruts, chant your sacred formulation.
He will smite Vr̥tra—the Vr̥tra-smiter of a hundred resolves—with his  mace of a hundred joints.
4. [Maruts:] “Bear down boldly, you of bold mind: there will be lofty fame  for you.
Let the waters, the mothers, flow apart at speed. You will smite Vr̥tra;  you will win the sun.”
1188 VIII.90
5. When you were born for the smiting of Vr̥tra, you bounteous one  without predecessor,
then you spread out the earth, and then you propped up heaven.
6. Then the sacrifice was born for you, then the chant and (the fire’s)  “laughter.”
You dominate all this, what has been born and what is to be born.
7. You brought the cooked (milk) into the raw (cows); you made the sun  mount in heaven.
[To singers/Maruts:] Like the gharma pot when the sāman (is sung), heat  the lofty (song) enjoyable to the one who yearns for song, with its
well-twisted ornaments.

Nrmedha ̥ Āṅgirasa and Purumedha Āṅgirasa
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
Indra as the powerful smiter of obstacles is called to our sacrifice and begged for  aid in battle and for riches. There is nothing particularly remarkable in this hymn  except for verse 5, where there appears to be an obscure reference to Varuṇa as  the “sustainer of domains,” who concedes various unopposable obstacles to Indra.  This epithet, carṣaṇī-dhŕ̥t, is actually more often used of Indra than of other gods,  but Varuṇa is also so called (IV.1.2, twice), and a telling passage, VII.85.3, describes  an amicable division of labor between Indra, who smashes unopposable obstacles,  and Varuṇa, who sustains the peoples, in almost identical phraseology to our verse  5. What then does “concede” mean in our passage? Most likely, in our view, that  Varuṇa concedes the sphere of warfare and martial defense to Indra, while con tinuing to perform his own task of assuring orderly existence in times and places  of peace.
1. Let Indra, who is to be invoked, tend to all our battles.
Let the Vr̥tra-smiter attend upon our sacred formulations and our
pressings—he who has the highest overwhelming power, who is equal  to song.
2. You are the foremost giver of bounties; you are the real thing, the one  who performs the master’s part.
We would choose to be the associates of the powerfully brilliant son of  strength, of the great one.
3. The unsurpassable sacred formulations are being performed for you, o  Indra who yearn for song.
Take pleasure in these “teams,” o possessor of fallow bays, which we  have thought up for you, Indra. 4. For you, bounteous one, the real thing who cannot be bowed, bear down  on many obstacles.
You, o strongest one with mace in hand—bring wealth nearby for the  pious man.
5. You, Indra, are the glorious possessor of the silvery drink, o lord of  strength.
You, all alone, smite the unopposable obstacles that have been conceded  by the one who sustains the domains [=Varuṇa?].
6. You, o lord, the forethoughtful one, do we now beseech for bounty, as we  would beseech Bhaga for a portion.
Your shelter is like a great hide, Indra. May your benevolent thoughts  reach us.
## 91 (700) Indra
Apālā Ātreyī
7 verses; paṅkti 1–2, anuṣṭubh 3–7
This deceptively simple, and much discussed, hymn consists of a monologue  embedded in a charm for healing and fertility. Unusually the speaker is an unmar ried girl, who undertakes a clandestine soma ritual for Indra, with erotic over tones, in ultimate preparation for her marriage. It begins with a contextualizing  introduction (vs. 1a–c): a maiden going to fetch water finds soma on her way.  She brings it home and addresses first the soma and then Indra. She announces  to soma her intention to press it (1de):  as it turns out she presses it with her  own mouth (2c) and offers it to Indra along with all the accoutrements of a real  soma sacrifice (vs. 2). Indra arrives for the soma, and she seeks to understand his  intentions, even as she assures him that she will keep his presence a secret (3ab). The  lexeme translated “recite” (ádhi √i) is an item of pedagogical vocabulary, appro priate to her age and stage of life, and refers to students’ oral recitation of their  lessons; in this context it seems to mean “reveal your presence verbally.” She then  urges the soma to flow softly, in contrast to the excessive noise usually associated  with soma’s preparation (3cd). In verse 4 she tremulously speculates to herself  about whether Indra will be able to achieve what she wants from her private  soma-pressing, and worries, as an adolescent girl apprehensive about sexual ity and marriage, about sexual intercourse with Indra, a rather formidable first  sexual partner, one might think. In the next two verses (5–6) she expresses her  wishes—three different types of hair growth: on the fields, that is, plants; on her  father’s bald head; and on her “belly,” the last wish indicating a desire for pubic  hair as a sign of sexual maturity. Apālā’s words end here; the final verse says  nothing directly about whether Indra fulfilled her expressed wishes (though we  take it as implying that he did), but simply states that he purified her by pulling
1190 VIII.92
her through increasingly smaller holes, rendering her “sun-skinned,” quite pos sibly a reference to the curing of teenage acne, a frequent accompaniment to the  entry into sexual maturity.
This R̥gvedic hymn is extensively quoted and embedded in a prose narrative in  the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa (I.220–21). For detailed discussion of this hymn and its  middle Vedic version, see Jamison (1991: 149–51, 165–67). That account and this  translation are deeply indebted to and dependent upon the ground-breaking discus
sion by Hanns-Peter Schmidt in chapter 1 “The Affliction of Apālā (R̥gveda 8.91)”  in his 1987 Some Women’s Rites and Rights in the Veda (pp. 1–29).
1. A maiden going down to the water found soma along the way.
Bringing it home she said, “I will press you for Indra; I will press you for  the able one.
2. “You over there, the dear little hero who goes earnestly looking from  house to house,
drink this (soma), pressed by the jaws—(soma) accompanied by grain,  by gruel, by cakes, by hymns.
3. “We wish to comprehend you; we will not ‘recite’ you aloud.
Softly-like, ever so softly-like, o drop, flow around for Indra.
4. “Will he be able? Will he do it? Will he make us better off?
Shall we, though coming as husband-haters, unite with Indra?
5. “Indra, make these three surfaces grow forth—
the head of my Papa, the field, and this on my belly.
6. “That field of ours, this body of mine,
and my Papa’s head—make all these hairy.”
7. In the nave of a chariot, in the nave of a wagon, in the nave of a yoke, o  Indra of a hundred resolves,
having purified Apālā three times, you made (her) sun-skinned.
The next three hymns, 92–94, should be grouped together, according to Oldenberg  (1888: 218).
## 92 (701) Indra
Śrutakakṣa Āṅgirasa or Sukakṣa Āṅgirasa
33 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, arranged in trcas ̥
This long, loosely structured hymn is essentially a constantly repeated invitation to  Indra to come to the soma sacrifice. Although the poet does ask for aid from time  to time, the focus is on the sacrifice, the verbal accompaniments, and the soma itself.  The poet names himself (or nicknames himself: the name is Śrutakakṣa “having a famous armpit” [or a famous crotch]) in verse 25. This nickname appears in the  midst of a striking sequence using the adverb áram “fitting(ly)” (vss. 24–27) in a  clever shift implicitly equating Indra’s body parts (e.g., “fit for your cheek” vs. 24a)  with the gifts the poet hopes to receive (e.g., “fit for a horse” vs. 25a), at least once  punningly: verse 35c, where the word dhā́mane can refer both to a body part, the  “fundament,” that is, the buttocks, and to Indra’s conferring of gifts.
1. Sing (him) here to the drinking of your stalk; sing forth to Indra, the all-conquering one, of a hundred resolves, most liberal to the settled  domains,
2. Much-invoked, much-praised leader of song, famed of old—
call him, “Indra!”
3. It’s Indra who is the giver to us of great prizes, the dancer.
The great one, in a crouch [=driving posture], will guide (the
prizes) here.
4. The belipped one has drunk of the stalk conferring good skill,
accompanied by oblations,
of the drop mixed with grain—has Indra.
5. Chant forth to him, to Indra, to drink the soma,
for that is his strengthening.
6. Having drunk of this god here, of his exhilarating drinks, the god with  his power
will surmount all beings.
7. Him, entirely victorious, held in place amid all your hymns
you will rouse for help—
8. The soma-drinker who is an unassailable fighter who cannot be budged, a superior man of unobstructable resolve.
9. Do your best for wealth for us, as one knowing many things, o Indra,  you who are equal to song.
Help us in the decisive (contest for) spoils.
10. Even from yonder, Indra, drive up close to us with hundred-prized, thousand-prized refreshment.
11. Let’s go to the visionary thoughts of our visionary poet; with (the  thoughts as) our steeds, o able one who breaks out the cows,
might we conquer in battles, o possessor of the mace.
12. We will make you take pleasure in our hymns, o you of a hundred  resolves,
as cows do in their pastures.
13. Because all things in the mortal way are in accord with your desire, o  you of a hundred resolves,
we have arrived at our hopes, possessor of the mace.
1192 VIII.92
14. To you, o son of strength, the desirers of desires have turned. Nothing surpasses you, Indra.
15. O bull, give aid to us with the awesome, dashing
visionary thought that gains the most, and with plenitude.
16. O Indra of a hundred resolves, that which now is the most brilliant  exhilaration for you,
with that you should now become exhilarated on the
exhilarating drink—
17. That of yours which possesses the brightest fame, which is the best  smiter of Vr̥tra, Indra,
that exhilaration which best gives strength.
18. For we know what of yours was given by you—possessor of the stone,  real drinker of soma—
to all communities, wondrous one.
19. Let our hymns encircle with rhythm the soma pressed for Indra for  exhilaration.
Let the bards chant their chant.
20. He in whom are all splendors, in whom the seven who sit together  [=priests] take pleasure,
Indra do we invoke when the soma is pressed.
21. The gods have stretched for themselves a noteworthy sacrifice among  the Trikadrukas.
Just him [=Indra] let our hymns increase.
22. Let the drops enter you, like rivers the sea.
Nothing surpasses you, Indra.
23. O wakeful bull, with your greatness you encompass the portion of soma that is in your belly, Indra.
24. Let the soma be fit for your cheek, o Indra, Vr̥tra-smiter,
fit for your “fundament” the drops.
25. Śrutakakṣa [“Famous Armpit”] sings fit for a horse, fit for a cow, fit for the “fundament” [/bestowal] of Indra.
26. For fittingly you exert yourself when our soma drinks are
pressed, Indra,
fittingly for your giving, able one.
27. Even from a distance our hymns reach you, possessor of the stone. Let us go fittingly to you.
28. For as surely as you are one who acts the hero and as surely as you are a  steadfast champion,
just as surely is your thought to be realized— 29. Just as surely has your giving, powerfully liberal one, been ordained by  all the Ordainers.
And so, Indra, (you are) in partnership with me.
30. Do not become like an indolent formulator, o lord of prizes.
Exhilarate yourself on the pressed soma accompanied by cows [=milk].
31. Let not (ill) intentions toward us guide us away from the sun into the  nights, Indra.
With you as yokemate, we would gain it.
32. With just you as yokemate, Indra, we would respond to the challengers. You are ours; we are yours.
33. For those seeking you, ever bellowing after you, will proceed just  to you—
your comrades, the bards, o Indra.

Sukakṣa Āṅgirasa
34 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This long hymn begins with an address to the rising sun (vs. 1), which is echoed in  the first verse of the second tr̥ca (vs. 4 ), and near its end are two verses directed  to Agni (vss. 25–26). These paired addresses to other deities within an Indra hymn  suggest the ritual context of a dawn soma sacrifice (though Dawn herself is not  alluded to). Indeed, the soma offered to Indra is the dominant theme of the hymn,  which becomes more insistent as the hymn progresses. Not surprisingly, mention of  the aid and material wealth he will give in return for the soma is also not scanted.
Throughout the hymn Indra is especially celebrated as (best) Vr̥tra-smiter: the  simple epithet and its superlative form occur an astonishing nine times, even though  the myth itself is treated only sparingly (vss. 2, 7, 14–15).
As often, the tr̥cas become more tightly organized toward the end of the hymn, with  a partial refrain in verses 25–27, and full-pāda refrains in 28–30 and 31–33, the latter  being introduced (31a) by the same pāda that provides the refrain (31–33c). There are  also intra- and inter-tr̥ca verbal echoes in these later verses. The separate final verse (34)  mentioning the R̥bhus seems to have little or no connection to the rest of the hymn.
1. Up toward the bull whose bounty is famous, who performs manly work, toward the archer do you go, o Sun.
2. He who split the nine and ninety strongholds with his arm-strong (mace), and as Vr̥tra-smiter smote the serpent,
3. That Indra, propitious companion, will milk out for us (wealth) in  horses, in cows, in grain,
like (a cow) yielding a broad stream.1194 VIII.93
4. O Vr̥tra-smiter—whatever today you have risen over, o Sun, all that is under your will, Indra.
5. Or if, o lord of settlements grown strong, you think, “I shall not die,” just that comes true for you.
6. The soma drinks which have been pressed in the distance, which nearby, to all those do you go, Indra.
7. We incite this Indra to smite great Vr̥tra.
He will become a bullish bull.
8. Indra is the one made for giving. Strongest is he when ensconced in  exhilaration;
brilliant is he who, deserving of soma, receives the (invitatory) call. 9. Like a mace equipped with a hymn, powerful, not to be budged, he has waxed high, not to be laid low.
10. Even in difficult going, make easy passage for us when you are hymned,  o Indra who yearn for hymns,
if you will so desire, bounteous one—
11. You whose aim, whose sovereignty they never confound—
neither god, nor the exalted folk.
12. And the two goddesses, both the World-Halves,
respect your unrepulsable forcefulness, o you of good lips.
13. You fixed this fast in the black (cows) and in the reddish ones, and in the gray ones—the gleaming white milk.
14. Then as all the gods strode away from the turbulent power of the serpent, the onslaught of the wild beast found them.
15. And after that he became a covering for me: the Vr̥tra-smiter displayed  his masculine nature—
he for whom no rival has been born, he who cannot be laid low.
16. Him famed as the best smiter of Vr̥tra, the propelling force of the  settled peoples,
do I inspire to great generosity to you (patrons).
17. (I inspired you, Indra,) with this visionary thought and with desire for  cattle—o you of many names, praised by many—
so that you appeared at every soma-pressing.
18. Let him be of attentive mind just toward us—the Vr̥tra-smiter  possessing many pressed drinks.
Let the able one listen to our prayer.
19. (Coming) with what help for us do you reach exhilaration, bull? With what (help) for the pressers? Bring it here!
20. In whose pressed soma does the bullish bull with his teams take pleasure, the Vr̥tra-smiter, for soma-drinking? 21. On reaching exhilaration, (bring) wealth in thousands to us.
Become a provider to the pious man.
22. These pressed drinks here, accompanied by their wives [=waters], go  eagerly in pursuit.
Regularly coming, ever filling [?] is (the wave) of the waters.
23. The desirable [/offered] libations, strengthening Indra at the ceremony,  have surged
to his down-stroke with their power.
24. Hither let these two feasting companions, the pair of fallow bays with  golden manes,
convey (you) to the pleasure set out (for you).
25. For you have these soma drinks here been pressed and the ritual grass  strewn, o you of radiant goods [=Agni].
Convey Indra hither for the praisers—
26. (Agni,) as you diffuse your skill through the luminous realms and  distribute treasures to the pious man.
(All of you,) recite to Indra for the praisers.
27. I establish here your Indrian strength and set out all solemn words for  you, o you of a hundred resolves.
Be merciful, Indra, to the praisers.
28. Bring us every good thing, every refreshment and nourishment, o you  of a hundred resolves,
when you will show us mercy, Indra.
29. Bring us all welfare, o you of a hundred resolves,
when you will show us mercy, Indra.
30. We who have pressed soma call upon just you, best smiter of Vr̥tra, when you will show us mercy, Indra.
31. Right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays—drive, o lord of  exhilarating drinks—
right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays.
32. He who is known, now as before, as Indra, best smiter of Vr̥tra,  possessing a hundred resolves—
right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays.
33. For you, Vr̥tra-smiter, are the drinker of these soma-drinks—
right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays.
34. Let Indra give us the wealth belonging to craft [/R̥bhu] as the
craftsmaster [/R̥bhukṣan] for our refreshment.
Let the prizewinner give a prizewinner.

## 94 (703) Maruts
Bindu Āṅgirasa or Pūtadakṣa Āṅgirasa
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn, focused on soma-drinking, is a curious mix of almost vapid simplic ity and baffling obscurity. Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the whole hymn to  the Maruts, it has several features that deviate markedly from the general pattern  of Marut hymns. To begin with the clearest, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) names a  number of gods as drinkers of the soma being presented: not only the Maruts (vs.  4), but the Aśvins (vs. 4), Indra (vs. 6), and the Ādityas, both as a body (vs. 4) and  separately (vs. 5). By contrast, in the remaining tr̥cas (vss. 7–9, 10–12) only the  Maruts are mentioned, but they are several times qualified by epithets and actions  that are ordinarily the province of other gods: for example, “having refined skill”  (vss. 7 and 10), generally used of one or more of the Ādityas; “mountain-dwell
ing” (vs. 12), usually of Soma. Since the lexicon of Marut hymns is often tightly  limited, this borrowing of attributes is somewhat remarkable. Similarly the cos mogonic acts of spreading out the cosmic realms (vs. 9) and propping apart the  two world-halves (vs. 11) are Indra’s signature deeds, not otherwise attributed to  the Maruts.
It is the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) that is the most problematic, however. It ends  (vs. 3c) exactly as the third tr̥ca ends (9c), and with a variant of the formula  found in all three verses of the final tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), in all cases inviting “the  Maruts to drink the soma.” But the hymn begins with a paradox (vs. 1), a cow  who herself sucks rather than giving suck, a cow identified as the mother of the  Maruts and also, in a sharply different animal metaphor, as the draft-horse of  their chariots. In the second verse this female figure seems to transform into, or  be identified with, Aditi: “the lap of Aditi” is a common phrase. It is this idiom  that gives some clue as to the intent of the first two verses. “The lap of Aditi”  seems elsewhere to refer to the ritual ground, or some part of it or some vessel  associated with it, and soma is prepared or deposited in this lap. The statement  that “the gods cause their commandments to be upheld” in this lap is a way  of saying that the ritual activities of mortals sacrificing to the gods keep the  cosmos functioning, so that, for example, the sun and the moon can be seen.  As for the first verse, Pr̥śni, the mother of the Maruts, is in a few mysterious  passages (notably IV.5.7, 10) also apparently identified with some part of the  ritual ground or equipment, and so Aditi (in “the lap of Aditi”) and Pr̥śni can  be superimposed on each other. If “the cow” of verse 1 is the ritual ground  (or some part thereof or piece thereon) as Pr̥śni, she “sucks” by receiving the  oblation, and she is the draft-horse of the Maruts’ chariots in providing the  occasion for their journey.
The identification of the Maruts’ mother with Aditi in the first tr̥ca and the  ascription to them of epithets and activities characteristic of other gods in the rest of the hymn presumably stem from the same motive: to universalize the Maruts and  make them a species of All Gods.
1. The cow herself takes suck, the fame-seeking mother of the bounteous  Maruts;
she is yoked as the draft-horse of their chariots,
2. She in whose lap all the gods cause their commandments to be upheld, for the sun and moon to be seen.
3. So then do all our bards sing them here, away from (the sacrifice of) the  stranger—
the Maruts to drink the soma.
4. Here it is—this pressed soma. They drink of it—the Maruts,
and also the self-ruling ones [=Ādityas] and the Aśvins.
5. They drink—Mitra, Aryaman, Varuṇa—of the one purified in a  continuous (stream),
which possesses three seats and grants offspring.
6. And now at pleasure Indra (drinks) of it, of the pressed one with its  cows [=milk-mixture];
early in the morning he will become exhilarated like a Hotar.
7. Have the patrons [=Maruts] grown excited? Like the waters they rush  beyond failures,
the (Maruts) of refined skill.
8. Do I today choose the help of you gods, who are great
and by nature of wondrous luster?
9. Those who spread all the earthly realms here and the luminous
realms of heaven, (I call)
the Maruts to drink the soma.
10. Just these of refined skill—you, o Maruts—from heaven I now call, to drink of this soma.
11. Just these, who propped apart the two world-halves, the Maruts  I now call,
to drink of this soma.
12. Just this, the bullish mountain-dwelling Marut flock, I now call,
to drink of this soma.
Oldenberg collects the hymns 95–101 into a single group, despite the varying num ber of verses and the lack of other clear unifying features.

## 95 (704) Indra
Tiraścī Āṅgirasa
9 verses: anuṣṭubh, arranged in trcas ̥
A simple hymn in which the poet, who names himself in verse 4, both urges Indra  to come to the soma sacrifice to enjoy the soma and the words of praise offered to  him and exhorts his fellow celebrants to redouble their praises. The most notable  feature of the hymn is the last tr̥ca (vss. 7–9), with its inescapable repetition of the  word śuddhá “cleansed, washed,” applied not merely to the soma but also to its ver
bal accompaniments, as well as to Indra and the help he will bring. This verb is not  a standard part of soma vocabulary: it is used only once in Maṇḍala IX (IX.78.1),  where it refers to the washing of the soma plant before its pressing. The verb is in  general rare: almost all of its R̥gvedic attestations are found in the last three verses  of this hymn. In the few other occurrences where the nature of the action can be  determined, water is the agent, and it is clear that washing is the literal meaning of  the verb and the metaphor deployed in this hymn.
1. Like a charioteer (his chariot), the songs have mounted you at the  pressings, o you who long for songs.
In unison they have bellowed to you, Indra, like mothers to their calf. 2. The clear pressed (soma drinks) have roused you hither, o Indra who  long for songs.
Drink of this stalk, Indra: it has been set for you among all (the clans). 3. Drink the soma for exhilaration, Indra, the pressed soma brought by the  falcon,
for you are the lord, the king of each and every clan.
4. Hear the call of Tiraścī, who honors you, Indra.
Grant fullness of wealth in good heroes and in cows. You are great.
5. (Hear the call of Tiraścī,) who has begotten for you, Indra, a newer,  invigorating hymn,
a visionary thought stemming from a perceptive mind, an age-old vision  swollen with truth.
6. Let us praise him—Indra, whom the songs and solemn words have  strengthened.
Seeking to gain them, may we win his many manly powers.
7. Come now! Let us praise Indra the cleansed with a cleansed sāman. Him grown strong through cleansed hymns let the cleansed (soma) with  its milk-mixture exhilarate.
8. O Indra—cleansed, come here to us; (come) cleansed with cleansed help. Cleansed, lay down a foundation of wealth; cleansed, become
exhilarated as the one deserving of soma. 9. For, o Indra, cleansed, (you lay down) wealth for us, cleansed, (you lay  down) treasures for the pious man.
Cleansed, you keep smashing obstacles, cleansed, you seek to gain
the prize.
## 96 (705) Indra (except Maruts 14d, Indra and Br̥haspati 15)
Tiraścī Āṅgirasa or Dyutāna Māruti
21 verses: triṣṭubh except virāj 4, arranged in trcas ̥
A rich and complex hymn containing both glancing references and vivid treatments  of several Indra myths. Its parts conform well to the tr̥ca structure, especially (as  often) toward the end. Each of the last four tr̥cas (vss. 10–21) has a verbal signa ture: in verses 10–12 the half-pāda refrain “surely he will take cognizance” (kuvíd  aṅgá védat); in verses 13–15 the “droplet” (drapsá); in verses 16–18 the opening “you
then” (tuváṃ ha tyád); in verses 19–21 the definitional “Vr̥tra-smiter” (vr̥trahā́). The first tr̥ca of the hymn (vss. 1–3) sets the stage for the wide-ranging praise  of Indra by describing his overwhelming power in three different areas. In verse 1  the powers of nature are subject to him. Verse 2 apparently contains a snatch of  the Emuṣa myth, most extensively related in VIII.71. In that myth Indra shoots a  boar named Emuṣa through many mountains; here only the mountains and the  arrow-shot are mentioned, but the prodigious nature of the unnamed archer’s  action is clear, and the audience would be aware that this was a boyhood deed of  Indra’s. In verse 3 Indra’s body is described as the site of his powers, both physical  and mental.
The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) begins with a summary of his preeminence (vs. 4),  but soon moves to the Vr̥tra battle (vs. 5) and especially to the Maruts’ role in it, a  topic that will also occupy the third tr̥ca. The Maruts appear to be the “formula tors” (brahmáns) introduced at the end of verse 5, bellowing to Indra. Verses 6–9  are best interpreted as the direct speech of the Maruts to Indra, offering him their  praise while seeking an alliance with him. They remind him (vs. 7) that they stuck  and continue to stick by him when the other gods deserted him in the Vr̥tra battle,  and they put in their claim to share the sacrifice with him (vs. 8), a claim also vividly  dramatized in the dialogue hymn I.165. They end their speech (vs. 9) with the reas
surance that together they, the Maruts and Indra, will make an unbeatable team. The next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) returns to the ritual present, with the poet’s exhorta tion to himself to produce well-crafted words for Indra—whose attention to the  praises he nervously hopes for. The following tr̥ca (vss. 13–15) is the most puz zling part of the hymn; it concerns an otherwise unknown story about a “droplet”  (drapsá) or perhaps an individual (human? divine? semi-divine?) so named. There is  a conflict of some sort in the Aṃśumatī River, which Indra appears to win in verse  15. The middle verse of the tr̥ca (vs. 14) is 1st-person direct speech and may be the
1200 VIII.96
words of Indra addressing the Maruts. But the “story” may also be an extended  ritual metaphor. “Droplet” is a word also used of soma, and the name of the river  means literally “possessing (soma) plants.” The descent of the droplet into the river  could well describe the rinsing of the soma plant that forms a regular part of soma  preparation, although the ritual counterpart of the mythic conflict is difficult to  identify.
Unified by its opening words “you then,” the next tr̥ca (vss. 16–18) provides  a survey of some of Indra’s great deeds, some obscure (like the rivalry with the  unidentified seven in vs. 16), some familiar: the defeat of Śuṣṇa (17c), the release  of the cows from Vala (17d), and the Vr̥tra battle again (18). The last tr̥ca begins  with a riddle, though not a very challenging one. The first three pādas of verse 19  give a series of definitional descriptors of a hero. Those asked the riddle give their  answer to “the other,” in our opinion the riddler himself: “That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter!”  And they provide other embellishments to the Vr̥tra-smiter in the following two  verses (20–21), while declaring the need to invoke and praise him. The hymn thus  keeps returning to the Vr̥tra battle, and the final three verses implicitly assert that  Vr̥tra-smiter is Indra’s fundamental role.
1. For him do the dawns pass along their course; for Indra do the eloquent  evenings (pass along their course) by night.
For him do the waters, the seven mothers, stand still—the rivers easy to  cross, for men to traverse.
2. They were pierced through by the archer, though he wavered—the thrice  seven backs of the mountains fitted firmly together.
No god nor mortal could surpass this—(the deeds) that the bull, grown  strong, performed.
3. The metal mace is an appendage of Indra; greatest power is in the two  arms of Indra.
The intentions of Indra are in his head exclusively; into his mouth they  rush en masse, to (become speech) worthy to be heard.
4. I consider you the most worthy of the sacrifice of those worthy of the  sacrifice; I consider you the stirrer of the unstirrable;
I consider you the beacon of warriors, Indra; I consider you the bull of  the settled domains.
5. When, o Indra, in your two arms you took the mace stirred by
exhilaration, to smite the serpent,
the mountains bellowed forth, and forth the cows, forth the formulators  [=Maruts] approaching Indra.
6. [Maruts:] “Let us praise him, who begat all these creatures here
below him.
We would like to establish an alliance with Indra with our hymns; we  would come near the bull with reverences.” 7. [Maruts:] “Shrinking from the hissing of Vr̥tra, all the gods who were  your partners deserted you.
Let your partnership be with the Maruts, Indra. Then you will win all  these battles here.”
8. [Maruts:] “We, the thrice sixty Maruts, having increased you as ruddy  throngs [=herds of cattle] increase, are deserving of the sacrifice.
We reverently approach you. Make a share for us. We would honor
your unbridled force with this oblation.”
9. [Maruts:] “Sharp is the weapon, the vanguard of the Maruts. (And)  who dares venture against your mace, Indra?
The lords lacking gods are weapon-less. With your wheel [=discus?]
scatter them, possessor of the silvery drink.”
10. For the great, strong, powerful one, for the one most propitious to cattle  send forth a well-twisted (hymn).
Produce many hymns for Indra whose vehicle is songs, for his body.
Surely he will take cognizance (of them)?
11. To him whose vehicle is hymns, to the far-ranging one send an inspired  thought like (a boat) to the far shore of rivers with a wooden
(paddle).
Stroke the body of the famous, very enjoyable one with a visionary
thought. Surely he will take cognizance (of it)?
12. Labor at what Indra will enjoy from you. Give as praise a good praise  hymn. Seek to entice him here with reverence.
Be attentive, singer. Don’t screech, but make your speech heard. Surely  he will take cognizance (of it)?
13. The Droplet descended into the Aṃśumatī (River), the black one  speeding with the ten thousand.
Indra with his skill helped him as he blew. The manly minded one
repelled the “blizzards” (of attacking warriors?).
14. “I saw the Droplet wandering in the oscillating eddy of the
Aṃśumatī River,
descending like a black cloud. I dispatch you, bulls. Fight in the
contest.”
15. Then the Droplet held his body in the lap of the Aṃśumatī, as he  glittered.
With Br̥haspati as yokemate, Indra overcame the godless clans as they  attacked.
16. You then—just as you were being born, you became the rival to the  seven unrivaled ones, Indra.
You discovered heaven and earth, which were hidden. You provided joy  to the wide-ranging creatures.
1202 VIII.97
17. You then—emboldened, you smote the power without counterpart with  your mace, mace-bearer.
You brought low (the power) of Śuṣṇa with your murderous weapons.  You found the cows just with your skill, Indra.
18. You then—bull of the settled domains, you became the forceful bane of  obstacles.
You released the rivers, which had been blocked. You conquered the
waters whose husband was a Dāsa.
19. “He is the very resolute one, who is the enjoyer of the pressings, to  whom the battle-fury has been conceded, who is like a rich man
through (all) the days,
who all alone is the performer of manly labors.” “That’s the
Vr̥tra-smiter!” they respond to the other.
20. That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter—Indra, sustainer of the settled domains. Him  who is to be invoked would we invoke with a lovely praise hymn.
He is our bounteous helper, our advocate. He is the giver of the prize  deserving of fame.
21. That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter—Indra, the master of the R̥bhus. As soon as he  was born, he became one to be invoked.
Performing many manly labors, like soma when drunk he is to be
invoked by his comrades.
## 97 (706) Indra
Rebha Kāśyapa
15 verses:  brhat ̥ ī 1–9, atijagatī 10, upariṣṭādbrhat ̥ ī 11–12, atijagatī 13, triṣṭubh 14,  jagatī 15, arranged in trcas ̥
Though metrically complex and metrically disturbed, this hymn follows a famil iar thematic pattern, with its contents structured by the tr̥ca division. In the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) the poet asks Indra to take possession of wealth belonging to other  human lords, who do not follow proper ritual behavior, and to redistribute it to the  ritualists of the poet’s own group. The next tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), as often, calls on Indra to  come to the sacrifice from wherever he happens to be. The hope for Indra’s exclusive  company and the fear that he might not come at all are balanced in the third tr̥ca  (vss. 7–9). This tr̥ca has an unusual structure, with the first and last pādas of each  verse identical, a type of very tight ring-composition.
Only in the following tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) does the poet turn to formal praise of the  god (though vs. 9 serves as a transition), but these verses function almost as much  as a praise of the praisers themselves. In verse 11 the mockingly designated “raspers”  (rebhá), that is, the singers, especially the poet himself, whom the Anukramaṇī iden
tifies as Rebha, make Indra strong through their praise. More strikingly, in verse  12 the poets “bend the felly” of his chariot just by looking at it, and make Indra himself bow by their words; the point is surely that they thereby make Indra change  the course of his journey and come to the sacrifice. In verse 10 an unidentified  group both fashions and begets Indra; given the agents of the following verses, it  is very tempting to assume that Rebha intends us to understand that it is the poets  who fashioned and begot Indra (although the gods themselves, mentioned at the  end of the previous verse, could also be the subject). In the last tr̥ca the poet com
bines praise of Indra’s immense power with pleas for him to use it for our benefit.
1. The delights that you, the possessor of the sun, brought here from the  (other) lords, o Indra,
from that strengthen only your praiser, bounteous one, and those who  have twisted the ritual grass for you.
2. What you have appropriated, Indra—the horse, the cow, and the ovine  portion—
confer that on the one who sacrifices, presses, and offers priestly gifts— not on the niggard.
3. He who slumbers sleepily not following the commandments, not  following the gods, o Indra,
through his own activities he will hinder his wealth from prospering.  Put him far away from it.
4. Whether, able one, you are in the distance, whether nearby, Vr̥tra-smiter, from there he who has pressed soma seeks to attract you, Indra, with  hymns as hairy-maned (horses) on heaven’s way.
5. Or whether you are in the luminous realm of heaven or on the surface  of the sea,
whether in an earthly seat, best smiter of Vr̥tra, whether in the
midspace—come here!
6. When our soma drinks are pressed, o soma-drinker, lord of power, bring yourself to exhilaration—with your liberal generosity, Indra, with  wealth in profusion.
7. Don’t shun us, Indra. Become our feasting companion.
You—be there with help for us; just you—be friendship for us. Don’t  shun us, Indra.
8. Among us, Indra, at our pressing, sit down to drink the honey.
Produce great help for the singer, bounteous one—among us, Indra, at  our pressing.
9. The gods have not attained you, nor mortals, o possessor of the stone. You dominate all created things with your vast power. The gods have  not attained you.
10. The superior man who is even more dominant over all battles—Indra  have they jointly fashioned and begotten for ruling—
most excellent in resolve and a hindrance in obstructing, strong,
strongest, powerful, surpassing.1204 VIII.98
11. The “raspers” have cried out in unison to him, to Indra to drink of  the soma,
so as to increase him, the lord of the sun. For he of steadfast
commandments is united with strength and with help.
12. The inspired poets bend the felly just with their gaze and bow the ram  [=Indra] with their cry.
Very bright, without deceit, along with your versifiers they (cry out)
close to the ear of the surpassing one.
13. I constantly call on this Indra, bounteous, strong, unrepulsable,
deploying his own powers in every way.
If the most munificent one, worthy of the sacrifice, will turn here
because of our hymns, let the mace-bearer make all our pathways
easy for wealth.
14. You, o Indra, perceive how to utterly destroy the strongholds with your  strength, most powerful, able one.
In fear of you, mace-bearer, do all the worlds and both heaven and
earth tremble.
15. Indra, brilliant champion, let this truth be protective for me. Carry us  across manifold difficulties, as if across the waters.
When, King Indra, would you show us the favor of wealth, to be
eagerly sought like the distillate of all mother’s milk?

Nrmedha ̥ Āngirasa ̇
12 verses: uṣṇih, except kakubh 7, 10–11, puraüṣṇih 9, 12, arranged in trcas. ̥
Although the hymn is composed in three different meters, each of the three meters  consists of two pādas of eight syllables and one of twelve, just differently arranged,  so that the hymn is more formally unified than the bare metrical synopsis suggests.  It is arranged in tr̥cas, but not all the tr̥cas show unity of form or content. The  second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a four-syllable refrain, and each verse of the last (vss.  10–12) begins with a form of “you” and contains the vocative “you of a hundred  resolves,” though not always in the same position. Otherwise there are no clear  formal marks.
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with an exhortation to the ritualists to sing to Indra, and  the second tr̥ca begins (vs. 4) with a complementary request to Indra to come to the  sacrifice, but most of the rest of the first six verses is devoted to generalized praise  of Indra. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the ritualists mobilize their verbal resources to  strengthen Indra and bring him to the sacrifice, and in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), as  usual, the poet then states our requests, here for battle strength and fighting heroes  rather than wealth. 1. To Indra sing a sāman, a lofty one to the lofty inspired poet,
to the creator of the foundations, who is attentive to poetic inspiration,  inviting admiration.
2. You, Indra, are the dominator; you caused the sun to shine.
Accomplishing all deeds, controlling all the gods, you are great.
3. Flashing forth (like) the sun with its light, you went to the luminous  realm of heaven.
The gods yielded themselves to partnership with you, Indra.
4. Come here to us, Indra, as the dear, entirely victorious one, who cannot  be concealed,
broad on all sides like a mountain—as lord of heaven.
5. For, you real drinker of soma, you dominate both world-halves.
Indra, you are the strengthener of the soma-presser—as lord of heaven. 6. For you, Indra, are the splitter of each and every stronghold,
the smiter of the Dasyu, the strengthener of Manu—as lord of heaven.
7. For therefore, o Indra who yearns for hymns, we have sent our great  desires surging to you
as those who come with waters [=Maruts] do their waters.
8. Like water with its floods, our sacred formulations are strengthening  you, o champion,
even though you have already grown strong day by day, o possessor of  the stone.
9. With a song they yoke the two fallow bays of the vigorous one to the  broad chariot with its broad yoke,
the two conveyors of Indra, yoked by speech.
10. Indra, bring here to us strength and manly power, you unbounded one  of a hundred resolves,
bring here a hero victorious in battle.
11. For you are our father, o good one of a hundred resolves, you our mother. And therefore we beg for your favor.
12. To you who seek the prize do I appeal, you tempestuous much-invoked  one of a hundred resolves.
Grant us a mass of good heroes.
## 99 (708) Indra
Nrmedha ̥ Āṅgirasa
8 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
As often, an invitation to the soma sacrifice begins the hymn (vss. 1–2), but it then  continues directly to the topic of Indra’s giving (vss. 3–4), which often ends hymns.  The poet expresses his hope for goods somewhat indirectly, in a curious simile about
1206 VIII.99
getting cooked in the sun (vs. 3) and in the complex negative constructions of verse  4. The references to the same time yesterday (vs. 1) and to the apparent rebirth, that  is, the regular rising, of the sun (vs. 3) suggest that the setting is the dawn ritual,  when priestly gifts are distributed.
The second half of the hymn (vss. 4–8) is the praise hymn proper, with emphasis  on Indra’s irresistible might in battle. The changes rung on the root tr̥̄ “overcome”  as well as the balanced oppositions (of the type “who X-es but is not X-ed”) and  parallelisms (e.g., the recurrence of -tar- agent nouns) give this portion of the hymn  a high rhetorical polish.
1. At this time yesterday these fervent men made you drink,
o mace-bearer.
Listen here to those whose vehicle is the praise song, Indra; come right  up to the good pasture.
2. Become exhilarated, you well-lipped possessor of the fallow bays: we  beseech you for this. The ritual adepts attend to you.
Yours are the utmost claims to fame deserving of hymns at our pressings,  o Indra who yearn for song.
3. As those who “get cooked” [=become warm/fervent] share in the sun,  they share in all (the goods) of Indra.
When he [=the Sun?] who has been born before is being born (again) with  strength, we direct our thoughts toward goods, as if toward our share.
4. Praise the giver of goods, whose presents are not harmful. The presents  of Indra are beneficial.
He does not take umbrage at the desire of a man who does honor, as he  bestirs his mind for giving.
5. O Indra, at the battle-charges you dominate all contenders.
You are the smiter of maledictions, the begetter, the all-overcomer.
Overcome those who seek to overcome.
6. The two “opponents” [=Heaven and Earth] follow after your gusting in  its headlong rush, like two parents after their child.
All contenders go slack before your battle fury, when you overcome
Vr̥tra, Indra.
7. For you (people) (we invoke) the one with enduring help, the unaging  driver who cannot be driven,
the swift victor, impeller, best of charioteers, the strengthener of the
Tugryas who cannot be overcome—
8. The one who sets right but needs no setting right, made by might, of a  hundred forms of help and a hundred resolves,
common (to all)—Indra do we invoke for help, the possessor of goods,  speeder of goods. VIII.100 (709) Indra (1–9, 12), Vāc (10–11)
Nema Bhārgava (1–3, 6–12), Indra (4–5)
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6, anuṣṭubh 7–9
A vivid but baffling hymn, consisting in great part of snatches of dialogue or direct  speech that may or may not be connected with each other. Needless to say, it has  been much discussed and disagreed upon, and our own interpretation of it is not  entirely secure.
The first two verses are a brief dialogue between an unidentified speaker and his  addressee, Indra. The first speaker demands that Indra obtain a portion of the sac rifice for him before he will assist Indra in his deeds (vs. 1). In verse 2 Indra promises  him the soma and proposes an active partnership. The first speaker has been vari ously identified, but we are in agreement with Oldenberg (Noten ad loc.), inter alia,  that it is Vāyu, the god who along with Indra receives the first soma-offering at the  soma sacrifice. (The word ágre “at the beginning” in vs. 2 gives strong support to  this view.)
Thus we seem to have embarked, in mythical time, on the ritual day of real  time. Such blending of mythical and current ritual time is not uncommon. And,  in our view, what happens next, in the next snatch of dialogue (vss. 3–6), is the  emergence of the real-time ritualist. A singer (who may, or may not, be named  Śarabha [vs. 6]), addresses his colleagues (vs. 3), urging them to praise Indra, even  as he raises doubts about Indra’s existence—doubts that Indra counters directly  (vs. 4) by his epiphany and self-praise. The scene has shifted from the mythical  dialogue between Indra and Vāyu to the ritual dialogue between Indra and the  singer.
Indra continues to speak in verse 5, though the contents of the speech are  rather unclear. In our view the verse concerns the relationship between Indra and  the Maruts, often called Indra’s “companions” (sákhāyaḥ) as here, and the verse is  here both because of the progress of the ritual day and because of an association  of ideas with verses 1–2. The second or Midday Pressing of the soma sacrifice is  dedicated to Indra and the Maruts, but the Maruts’ share of the pressing was only  established mythically when they reminded Indra of their help to him in the Vr̥tra  battle and demanded from him a share in the soma—a scene effectively dramatized  in the famous hymn I.165. Thus, we have moved from the Morning Pressing with  Indra and Vāyu to the Midday Pressing with Indra and the Maruts, and the covert  thematic connection is that both Vāyu and the Maruts demanded a share of the  sacrifice from Indra. What makes the mental association even more complex is the  fact that in verse 5 Indra remains in dialogue with the singer, while remembering  and recounting to the singer his side of a dialogue with the Maruts. In any case the  singer is now convinced of Indra’s reality and declares that Indra’s deeds are to be  praised.
1208 VIII.100
The following three verses (7–9) in dimeter meter (as opposed to the trimeter  meter of the rest of the hymn) are in our opinion the contents of the singer’s  praise hymn to Indra, highlighting the Vr̥tra battle (vss. 7 and 9) and the fal con’s theft of soma for Indra (vs. 8). But, not surprisingly, the narration is far  from straightforward. Most strikingly, in verse 7 there is a further layer of ven triloquism: in this verse the singer imitates the speech of yet another speaker, a  witness or participant in the Vr̥tra battle, urging the waters, freed by Indra’s  slaying of Vr̥tra, to flow forth. The speaker whom the singer is quoting might  be Indra, speaking of himself in the 3rd person or perhaps the Maruts. But in  either case we the audience are three levels down: we are listening to the hymn’s  poet (supposedly Nema Bhārgava) imitating an unnamed singer in dialogue  with Indra, and the singer is in turn imitating Indra or some other eyewitness  of the mythical scene. The following verse (8) returns to straight narration, of  the falcon’s flight with the soma. In verse 9 we are back to the Vr̥tra battle, but  notably the description is in the present tense, as if still from the point of view  of an eyewitness, and it depicts a curious, indeed unprecedented episode, Indra’s  mace lying covered with water—a scene that reminds us of the dead Vr̥tra, who  is famously described as lying defeated with the waters streaming over him in  I.32.8, 10.
As complex and uncertain as our reading of these first nine verses is, the fol lowing two verses (10–11) are considerably more mystifying. It is not that the  language or the content is difficult in itself; the verses concern the goddess Speech  (Vāc) and present the common image of Speech as a milk-cow (vss. 10–11) and  the common theme of the four divisions of speech (vs. 10). The perplexing part is  why Vāc should make her appearance at this point in the hymn. The best answer  to this question was given by Oldenberg well over a century ago (1885): he cited a  story in later Vedic prose (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa IV.1.3) relating a dispute between  Indra and Vāyu after the Vr̥tra battle. Vāyu, as the swiftest god, was sent to make  certain that Vr̥tra was dead, and he was rewarded with the first offering. Indra  wanted a share of it (thus the opposite of the issue in our first two verses) and  promised Vāyu in return that speech would be intelligible. The two gods then  wrangled over their proper shares, and Indra received only a quarter, not the half  he was expecting. Therefore he decreed that only a quarter of speech would be  intelligible. The details of the story match in many ways those in the two verses  in question, and it may well be that with these verses we return to the beginning  of our hymn and the bargaining between Vāyu and Indra, in a sort of thematic  ring composition. However, the Brāhmaṇa story is narratively confused and,  as just noted, assigns the roles of petitioner and share-giver exactly opposite.  It could therefore also be an after-the-fact attempt to rationalize the peculiari ties of this part of the R̥gvedic hymn. We reserve judgment, and also point out  that the cow in association with speech is celebrated at the end of the next hymn  (VIII.101.15–16). And then there is the final verse, addressed to Viṣṇu and echoing the first  two verses verbally:  the initial vocative “comrade” matches Indra’s offer of  comradeship to Vāyu in verse 2c, and the promise “we two will smite Vr̥tra [/the  obstacle]” matches the almost identical phrase in 2d “we two will keep smashing  obstacles.” The close similarity of these verses led Geldner to assume that Viṣṇu is  the speaker in verse 1, not Vāyu. In our opinion this assumption is unnecessary.  We think rather that the final verse is an attempt to identify Viṣṇu with Vāyu,  or to transform the older god Vāyu (who has a good Indo-Iranian pedigree)  into the emergent and increasingly important god Viṣṇu, whose roots are not  so deep.
Like many late R̥gvedic hymns, the difficulties here lie not in the language  or the imagery, as is the case in earlier hymns. A major question in this hymn  is what ties all the parts together. If we are correct that the first nine verses  mark the progress from the morning to the midday rituals, via the gods (Vāyu,  Maruts) associated with Indra at those occasions and their negotiations with  Indra about their sacrificial share, and if Oldenberg is correct that the verses  concerning Speech (vss. 10–11) conceal the story about the dispute between  Indra and Vāyu after the Vr̥tra slaying, then we confront two different and  superficially contradictory possibilities of hymnic unity. On the one hand, it  may be a ritual unity—the progress of the ritual day—but then the Speech part  awkwardly returns us to the beginning of the day. Or it may be a mythological unity, with the Vr̥tra battle viewed from different angles by different partici pants—but this leaves the ritual real time, with the prominent role of the singer,  out of consideration. It is possible, but extremely speculative, that the final  Viṣṇu verse gives us a way to reconcile these two approaches. As we have noted  frequently elsewhere, the Third Pressing of the soma sacrifice was most likely a  ritual innovation, slowly adopted by various clans at different times through the  R̥gvedic period and after. Viṣṇu’s most famous deed, the most prominent theme  associated with him in the R̥gveda, is the cosmogonic taking of “three strides,”  which define and measure out the three worlds. It is possible that because of his  association of “three,” the introduction of Viṣṇu at the end of this hymn brings  us to the end of the new ritual day, to the Third Pressing, while maintaining the  mythic focus on the Vr̥tra slaying.
We do not claim to have solved the manifold difficulties of this hymn, but we  hope that readers can still enjoy and respond to the intense directness of the dia logues and the stimulating if destabilizing rapidity of the transitions from one  vignette to another.
1. [Vāyu:] “Here I go with my body before you. All the gods advance  toward me from behind.
When you will have secured a portion for me, Indra, only after that will  you perform manly deeds along with me.”
1210 VIII.100
2. [Indra:] “I establish a draught of the honey for you at the beginning (of  the sacrifice). Let the pressed soma be established as your portion, and you will be my comrade on my right side. Then we two will keep  smashing obstacles in abundance.”
3. [Singer:] “Proffer praise as you all seek the prize—real praise to Indra,  if he is the real thing.
‘Indra does not exist,’ so says many a one. ‘Who has seen him? Whom  shall we praise?’”
4. [Indra:] “Here I am, singer: see me here. I dominate all created things  with my greatness.
The instructions of truth [=hymns] strengthen me. As the one who  keeps breaking open (Vala), I keep breaking the worlds.
5. [Indra:] “When the trackers of truth mounted to me, sitting alone on  the back of the delightful one [=fallow bay/soma?],
my mind just responded from the heart: ‘My comrades have cried out  (to me) like children.’”
6. [Singer:] “All these (deeds) of yours are to be proclaimed at the  pressings, those which you did, bounteous Indra, for the presser— when you uncovered the goods, stemming from afar, brought together  by many, for Śarabha of seers’ lineage.”
7. [Singer:] “‘Now, (waters,) run forth each separately: he who obstructed  you is not here.
Indra has let fly his mace down onto Vr̥tra’s mortal place.’
8. [Singer:] “Going at the speed of thought, it crossed the metal  stronghold [=sky?].
The fine-feathered (falcon), having gone to heaven, brought the soma to  the mace-bearer.
9. [Singer:] “Within the sea it lies—the mace covered over with water. Streaming forth in front continuously, they [=waters] bring it tribute.”
10. When Speech, saying indistinguishable things, sat down as gladdening  ruler of the gods,
she milked out in four (streams) nourishment and milk drinks. Where  indeed did the highest of hers go?
11. The gods begat goddess Speech. The beasts of all forms speak her. Gladdening, milking out refreshment and nourishment for us, let  Speech, the milk-cow, come well praised to us.
12. Comrade Viṣṇu, stride out widely. Heaven, grant a place for the mace to  prop apart.
We two will smite Vr̥tra; we two will give leave to the rivers. Let them,  unleashed, go at the impetus of Indra.

Jamadagni Bhārgava
16 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; satobrhat ̥ ī 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; gāyatrī 3; triṣṭubh 14–16,  arranged (for the most part) in pragāthas.
As the above summary of the deities and the meters demonstrates, this hymn is  structurally quite complex, and indeed it may consist of several original hymns.  (See Oldenberg 1888: 218 n. 1.) The divisions we see are somewhat at variance with  the Anukramaṇī’s analysis. The first six verses appear to belong together, with two  pragāthas (vss. 1–4) to Mitra and Varuṇa and a third (vss. 5–6) expanding to include  the Ādityas in general, the three best known (Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman) named  and the rest subsumed under the title “kings.” The focus is on the gods’ journey to  the sacrifice and the praise presented to them there, save for the second pragātha  (vss. 3–4), which gives a notable description of Mitra and Varuṇa’s missile and the  threat it poses.
There follow a pragātha to the Aśvins (vss. 7–8) and one to Vāyu (vss. 9–10),  focused even more strongly on their journeys to the sacrifice. The following pragātha  to the Sun (vss. 11–12) contains some of the most flat-footed verses in the R̥gveda;  it is hard to tell whether the poet’s inspiration gave out, or if there is some deeper  purpose that escapes the modern reader.
In our opinion the praise of divinities stops here, and the remainder of the hymn  (vss. 13–16) depicts the ritual moment. In verse 13 an oblation of butter or some  other milk product is poured into the fire by the priests; verse 14 (the most difficult  verse in the hymn) appears to concern the offering of soma. The final two verses  (15–16) exalt the cow, who appeared briefly in verse 13, in the most extravagant  terms, as kin to major groups of gods, source of immortality, and a goddess asso
ciated with speech. This association (vs. 16) reminds us of the somewhat intrusive  presence of the goddess Speech as a milk-cow at the end of the immediately preced ing hymn (VIII.100.10–11).
1. That mortal has labored just so for the conclave of the gods, each one  by one,
who has now brought Mitra and Varuṇa here for their preeminence, for  our giving of oblations.
2. The two possessing highest dominion and broad vision, superior men,  kings of longest fame,
with their wondrous skill as if with their arm-strength they drive their  chariot, together with the rays [/reins] of the sun.
3. Who ran forth as your quick messenger, o Mitra and Varuṇa,
copper-headed, hasty in his exuberance,
1212 VIII.101
4. Who does not come to rest to negotiate, nor to be called back, nor to  come to agreement—
from collision with that one deliver us today, deliver us with your  two arms.
5. (Sing) forth for Mitra, forth for Aryaman, o you rich in truth, a speech, a companionable, pleasurable, protective praise song—sing to  Varuṇa, to the kings.
6. They rouse their own ruddy, noble treasure, the single son of the three  (mothers) [=Agni].
They, undeceivable, watch over the immortal foundations for mortals.
7. (Drive) here to my upraised speeches, the most brilliant ones that are to  be performed—
drive, Nāsatyas, both of one accord, to make tracks toward the
oblations.
8. When we call to you for your giving without animus, you two rich in  prize mares,
come, advancing the advancing ritual offering, you superior men, as  you are sung by Jamadagni.
9. Drive here to our sacrifice that touches heaven, Vāyu, with the  well-disposed (gods).
(The one soma drink) within the sieve above is being mixed; this pure  (soma) here has been held out to you.
10. The Adhvaryu pursues (you) along the straightest paths, (for you) to  receive the oblations.
Then, teamster, drink of both of ours—the pure soma and the one  mixed with milk.
11. Yes indeed! you are great, Sūrya; yes indeed! Āditya, you are great. The greatness of you who are great attracts admiration. Certainly, god,  you are great.
12. Yes indeed! Sūrya, you are great in fame; in every way, god, you  are great.
Because of his greatness the lordly one was set in front for the gods, as  the extensive undeceivable light.
13. Here is the one [=butter offering] who is heading downward,  accompanied by chants, her form created by a ruddy (cow).
Like brilliant (Dawn) she has appeared opposite, coming hither within  the ten arms.
14. Three offspring [=soma-drinks/pressings] have made their traversal (of  the filter); the others have settled down around the chant.
Loftily he has stood among the creatures; the self-purifying (soma) has  entered within the golden (flames). 15. Mother of the Rudras, daughter of the Vasus, sister of the Ādityas,  navel of immortality—
I now proclaim to observant people: do not smite the blameless
cow—Aditi.
16. Knowing speech, rousing speech, reverently approaching with all  visionary thoughts,
the goddess, coming hither from the gods, the cow—*let not a
small-witted mortal appropriate me.
The final group of hymns consists of 102–103, dedicated to Agni.
## 102 (711) Agni
Prayoga Bhārgava or Agni Pāvaka Bārhaspatya or Agni Grhapati Sahasa ̥ ḥ Sūnu and  Agni Yaviṣṭha Sahasaḥ Sūnu (together or one or the other)
22 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
For most of its length, this hymn is a conventional treatment of Agni’s ritual  activities, but with particular stress on his role as kaví “poet” or “sage poet”  (vss. 1, 5, 17, 18). In general there is little internal unity in the tr̥cas, and indeed  the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is particularly disjointed, making a false start with two  unconnected sentence fragments (vs. 7), followed by a purpose clause with no  main clause (vs. 8). However, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a refrain, and a curi
ous one at that:  “Agni, whose garment is the sea.” This description probably  references several different Agni themes: his identification and ultimate merging  with Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters” (see esp. II.35); the myth about Agni’s  flight from his ritual duties, in which he hides in the waters; and the sprinkling  of the fire with consecrated water in the Agnihotra, a ritual action also referred  to in verse 14, where the associated act of laying ritual grass around the fire is  also mentioned. Verse 14 may also recall Agni’s flight and his concealment in the  waters.
The conventional hymn appears to end with the sixth tr̥ca (vss. 16–18), solemnly  treating the generation and installation of Agni as the conveyor of both the gods  and the oblations. The next tr̥ca (vss. 19–21) has a light and self-deprecating tone.  The poet claims to have neither of the barebones requisites for even a simple offer
ing to Agni, a cow for the oblation and wood to feed his flames (vs. 19). All he has  is “something like this”—namely the hymn he has just produced. This is clearly  false modesty, and indeed the poet treats the standard wood and ghee rather slight ingly in the next two verses (20–21). In the final appended verse (22, not part of a  tr̥ca), he proudly pronounces that a man should kindle Agni with his mind and his  vision (not, the implication is, with mere wood and ghee), and indeed that he has  just done so.1214 VIII.102
1. You, Agni, establish lofty vitality for your pious server, god, as sage poet, houselord, youth.
2. Along with the one [=offering ladle] who reverently invokes the gods,  who offers friendship to them, o far-radiant Agni,
as observant one, convey them here to us.
3. With you as best inciting yokemate, o youngest one,
we become dominant to win the prize.
4. Like Aurva and Bhr̥gu, like Apnavāna, I call upon the gleaming one, upon Agni, whose garment is the sea.
5. I call upon the sage poet, whose rush is the wind’s, upon his might,  whose roar is thunder’s,
upon Agni, whose garment is the sea.
6. As if upon the stimulus of Savitar, upon the benefit of Bhaga,  I call upon
Agni, whose garment is the sea.
7. Toward Agni, the strengthening one, best of many for your  ceremonies...
for the mighty child (of might)...
8. So that this (Agni) here will be at hand for us, as Tvaṣṭar is at hand for  the forms to be crafted,
with his will—the will of this glorious one ...
9. This Agni here is master over all the splendors among the gods. He will come near to us here with prizes.
10. Praise here the most glorious of all Hotars,
Agni, foremost at the sacrifices,
11. Sharp, pure-flamed, who shines preeminent in the houses,
of longest fame.
12. Sing him, o poet, like a winning steed, the tempestuous one, who arranges the peoples in their places, like Mitra.
13. Those akin [=waters?], constantly directing to you the hymns of him  who prepares the oblation,
have approached you in front of Vāyu.
14. Whose ritual grass still stands uncut, not yet triply bundled— even his footprint you waters have deposited.
15. The footprint of the generous god, with his unassailable forms of help, is an auspicious sight, like the sun.
16. O god Agni, heating up with your flame through visions of ghee, convey the gods hither and sacrifice to them.
17. The mothers, the gods begot you, the sage poet, o Aṅgiras,
as immortal conveyor of the oblation. 18. You, o sage Agni, a discerning messenger worthy to be chosen,
have they installed as conveyor of the oblation.
19. Because I have no cow, nor an axe in a wooden (tree),
I therefore bring just a thing like this to you.
20. When, Agni, we set any pieces of wood whatsoever in you,
enjoy them, youngest one.
21. What the little termite eats, what the ant creeps over,
let all that be ghee for you.
22. Kindling Agni with his mind, the mortal should follow his visionary  thought.
I have kindled Agni with the dawning lights.
## 103 (712) Agni (1–13), Agni and the Maruts (14)
Sobhari Kāṇva
14 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1–4, 6; virāḍrūpā 5; satobrhat ̥ ī 7, 9, 11, 13; kakubh 8, 12; gāyatrī 10;  anuṣṭubh 14. One trca (1–3), 5 prag ̥ āthas (4–13), final verse (14).
Another metrically complex hymn, consisting mostly of pragāthas in various com binations of meters, but beginning with a tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and ending with a single  verse (14). Proferes (2007: 38–40) argues that the opening tr̥ca concerns the forg ing of a unified power from multiple clans by commitment to their mutually wor shiped fire, which is identified as belonging to Divodāsa, the great Bharata leader  (vs. 2). The territorial expansion and the overcoming of other populations therein  are treated in verses 2–3.
Though the pragātha that follows (vss. 4–5) does not explicitly continue the  theme of victory through centralized leadership, it does promise rewards to the  man who devotes himself to Agni—particularly the renowned “imperishable fame”  (ákṣiti śrávaḥ, vs. 5), a phrase whose Indo-European antiquity has been known  and discussed for a century and a half. And “heroic glory” (vīrávad yáśaḥ, vs. 9), as  well as goods and protection, are the rewards for service to Agni in the following  pragāthas (vss. 6–11). The final pragātha (vss. 12–13) seeks to avert Agni’s anger.  In the summary verse (14) the poet names himself and invites Agni to the sacrifice.
1. He has just appeared, the best pathfinder, in whom they have established  the commandments.
Right up to him just born, the increaser of the Ārya, to Agni have our  hymns reached.
2. The Fire allied to Divodāsa (has gone) forth, as if (all the way) to the  gods with his might.
He has unrolled himself along Mother Earth; he has taken his stand on  the back of the firmament.
1216 VIII.103
3. Before whom the communities tremble, as he performs (deeds) to be  constantly acclaimed,
the one who by himself wins thousands as if at the winning of
wisdom—serve Agni with insightful thoughts.
4. The mortal whom you wish to lead forward for wealth, who does pious  service for you, good one,
he acquires a hero who proclaims solemn speech, who fosters a
thousand by himself, o Agni.
5. With a steed he bores through to the prize even in the stronghold; he  acquires imperishable fame.
In you among the gods might we always acquire all things of value, o  you of many goods.
6. He who distributes all goods, the gladdening Hotar of the peoples— like the cups of honey that go first to him, the praises go forth to Agni. 7. Those of good gifts, seeking the gods, groom (you), the charioteer (of  the ceremonies), like a horse, with hymns.
Deliver both our progeny and our posterity (to safety), o wondrous  clanlord; deliver (to us) the generosity of the bounteous ones.
8. Sing forth to the most munificent one, to truthful, lofty, pure-flamed Agni, o Upastutas.
9. The bounteous one will gain heroic glory (for us)—he who is brilliant  when kindled and bepoured.
Surely his benevolence will come here to us anew along with prizes?
10. O Āsāva, praise the dearest of the dear ones, the guest,
Agni, the controller of chariots,
11. The one deserving the sacrifice who at sunrise, as finder of tied-down  goods, will turn them hither,
whose waves [=flames] are difficult to cross, like the waves in a torrent,  when he seeks to win the prize with his insightful thought.
12. Let the guest not be angry at us, this good Agni, proclaimed by many, who is the good Hotar of good ceremony.
13. And let those not suffer harm who (approach you) with invitations here  in sundry ways, o good Agni.
For even a weakling reverently invokes you for a mission if he is a man  of good ceremony who has bestowed the oblation.
14. O Agni, drive here, as comrade of the Maruts, along with the Rudras,  for soma-drinking.
(Drive) to the good praise of Sobhari. Make yourself euphoric in the  presence of Svarṇara.Volume III

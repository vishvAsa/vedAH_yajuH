57 (1026) Aśvins
Medhya Kāṇva
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This sequence of verses inviting the Aśvins to the soma sacrifice is unremarkable save  for a few features. The first verse explicitly establishes the context as the Third Pressing,  which, as we have discussed elsewhere, was probably a recent addition to R̥gvedic rit ual. And especially in verse 2 there are insoluble textual problems. Since the verse itself  is not terribly interesting in content, the difficulties can safely be left aside here.
## 1
You two, o gods worthy of the sacrifice, yoked by your age-old purpose,  with your chariot
come here to the powerful (soma?), o Nāsatyas, with your skills. You will  drink this Third Pressing here.
## 2
You two have the gods, the thrice eleven, (called upon); those realest of  the real have appeared in front.
Taking pleasure in our sacrifice, our pressing, drink the soma, o Aśvins,  as ones for whom the fire glows.
## 3
This deed of yours, o Aśvins, is to be wondered at. The bull of heaven, of  the dusky realm, of the earth,
and the thousand chants, which (are performed?) at the quest for cattle— drive up to all those, to drink (the soma).
## 4
Here is a portion deposited for you, you worthy of the sacrifice; here are  hymns, o Nāsatyas—drive up to them.
Drink the honeyed soma among us. Foster the pious man with your skills.

30 (650) All Gods
Manu Vaivasvata
4 verses: gāyatrī 1, puraüṣṇih 2, br̥hatī 3, anuṣṭubh 4
The final hymn in this Viśve Devāḥ series consists of four verses in four different  meters, though since they are all different combinations involving eight- and twelve syllable pādas, the difference in meters is not jarring. Much more jarring—and,  in our opinion, deliberately so—is the contrast between the slangy and popular  register in verse 1 and the solemn, almost stilted rhetoric of the second verse, which  explicitly represents itself as quoting the first one. The remaining two verses express  conventional prayers for aid and protection, in much the same style as verse 2. 1. “Since there isn’t a little runt among you, gods, nor a little kid,
(you are) all just entirely great.”
## 2
Thus shall you be praised, you who care for the stranger, who are the  three and thirty,
you gods who deserve the sacrifice of Manu.
## 3
Protect us; help us; speak on our behalf.
Do not lead us far away from the path of the fathers, of the sons of
Manu, into the distance.
## 4
O gods, all of you who are here and belonging to all men—
to us hold out extensive shelter, and to our cattle and horse.

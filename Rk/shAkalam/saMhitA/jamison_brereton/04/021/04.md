Who is master of substantial, lofty wealth, him will we praise at the  ceremonial distributions—Indra,
who is the winner along with Vāyu when (refreshments) consisting of  cows are at stake and who boldly leads (us) forth to a better state. 5. Whoever, piling reverence upon reverence, rouses speech, begetting it in  order to perform the sacrifice,
aiming straight, granting many favors, he should bring Indra here to  the (ritual) seats with his hymns—he, the Hotar [=Agni?].

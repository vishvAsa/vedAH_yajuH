[Indra’s Mother:] It was not because of me that the cobra, having  pierced you down, smashed apart his jaws (to swallow) you, o
bounteous one.
Then, (though) pierced down, having gotten the upper hand, you utterly  crushed the head of the Dāsa with your murderous weapon. 10. [Narrator:] The heifer gave birth to the sturdy, powerfully charging,  unassailable bull, the brawny Indra.
The unlicked calf—his mother impelled him to wander, seeking by
himself a way for himself.

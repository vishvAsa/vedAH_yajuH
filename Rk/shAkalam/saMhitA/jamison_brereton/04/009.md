Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: gāyatrī
Like II.1 and II.11, this short hymn enumerates Agni’s ritual roles by identifying  him with various priests, but it is considerably simpler and more straightforward  than either of those two hymns. The order of the priestly offices here is close to that  found in II.1.

## 01
Agni, be gracious. You are great—you who have come here to the  god-seeking people,
to sit on the ritual grass.
## 02
He, the immortal difficult to deceive, pursuing (his ritual duties) among  the clans stemming from Manu,
has become messenger for all.
## 03
He is led around his seat as the Hotar, gladdening at the rituals of  day(break),
and he sits down as the Potar.
## 04
And Agni (leads) the Wives (of the Gods) at the ceremony [=Neṣṭar],  and he is Houselord in the home,
and he sits down as the Brahman.
## 05
You pursue (your ritual duty) as Upavaktar for the people who perform  the ceremony,
and you pursue the oblations of the sons of Manu.
## 06
And you also pursue the (ritual) mission of him whose ceremony you  will enjoy—
to convey the oblation of the mortal.
## 07
Our ceremony enjoy, our sacrifice, o Aṅgiras;
hear our call.
## 08
Let your chariot, difficult to trick, encircle us on all sides,
the chariot by which you guard the pious.

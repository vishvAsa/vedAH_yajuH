32 (744) Soma Pavamāna
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Although this hymn begins with the almost ubiquitous journeying forth of the  soma juices (see, e.g., the first verses of IX.10, 17, 20, 24, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 41, 44,  all beginning, like this, with prá “forth” followed by a verb of motion somewhere in  the verse), it breaks the pattern of the recent collections of Soma clichés, especially  with the cascade of similes in verses 3–5. This expert handling of the constricted  form of gāyatrī soma hymns may lend credence to the Anukramaṇī’s attribution to  Śyāvāśva Ātreya, the ingenious poet of the Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V. 1. The soma juices, arousing exhilaration, pressed at the rite, have
marched forth
for the fame of our benefactor.

Then the maidens of Trita [=fingers] impel him, the tawny one, with the  stones,
the drop for Indra to drink.
## 3
Then, just as (the lead) wild goose (sets) its flock (to honking), he has  made the thought of everyone bellow.
Like a steed he is anointed [/driven together] with the cows.
## 4
O Soma, looking down on both (worlds?), like a great wild bird launched  in flight you rush,
settling down on the womb of truth.
## 5
The cows have lowed to him, like a young woman to her dear lover. He has gone to (them?) as to a contest that has been set.
## 6
Destine brilliant glory for us, both for our benefactors and for me— wisdom and fame as our winnings.

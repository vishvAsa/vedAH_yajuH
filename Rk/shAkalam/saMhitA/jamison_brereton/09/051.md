51 (763) Soma Pavamāna
Ucathya Āṅgirasa
5 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn sets Soma in relation both to the humans involved in his prepa ration, namely the Adhvaryu priest (vs. 1) and the praiser (vs. 4), and to the gods  who consume him, Indra (vss. 1–2), the gods in general, and the Maruts (vs. 3).  The entry into the filter, mentioned in verses 1 and 5, provides an elementary ring.

## 1
O Adhvaryu, send the soma, pressed by stones, surging into the filter. Purify it for Indra to drink.
## 2
The highest beestings of heaven, the most honeyed soma—
press it for Indra who bears the mace.
## 3
Of your stalk, of your honey, o drop, do these gods eat;
of you, the self-purifying one, do the Maruts.
## 4
For you, Soma, are strengthening when you are pressed for fervent  exhilaration,
to help the praiser, you bull.
## 5
O wide-gazing one, pressed in a stream, rush into the filter
to the prize of victory and to fame.

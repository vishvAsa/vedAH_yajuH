Soma Pavamāna
Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn begins with a martial theme that is not developed in what follows. Instead,  beginning with verse 3, the focus is on the wealth that Soma will bring us, and the  repetition of vocabulary in these four verses induces a sense of claustrophobia,  with the same elements recycled: “o Soma,” “o drop,” “purifying,” “bring us,” and  “wealth.” Although claustrophobia is to some extent endemic to the IXth Maṇḍala,  most hymns make some attempt to vary the lexicon and phraseology.
## 01
Becoming purified, the limitless one has attacked all the scorners.
They [=poets] beautify the inspired poet with their inspired thoughts. 2. The ruddy one has mounted to the womb; the bull, when pressed, will go  to Indra.
He sits in the steadfast seat. 3. Now for us, o drop, for us all all around, o Soma, attract great wealth in thousands, in purifying yourself.
## 04
O self-purifying Soma, o drop, bring all brilliant things hither;
you will find refreshments in thousands.
## 05
Being purified, bring hither wealth and an abundance of heroes to our  praise singer;
strengthen the songs of the singer.
## 06
Being purified, o drop, bring hither double-lofty wealth—o Soma, bullish drop—bring us wealth worthy of hymns.

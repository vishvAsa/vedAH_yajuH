17 (729) Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
8 verses: gāyatrī
A straightforward hymn: the soma juices flow quickly on their journey through the  filter into the vessels and thence to Indra and the gods, a journey compared to that  of the sun. The role of speech in the soma sacrifice is also emphasized, with soma  both inspiring speech and being strengthened by it.

Like rivers along a downward slope, smashing obstacles, turbulent, the swift soma juices have been sent surging.

As they are pressed, the drops, the soma juices, like rains to the earth, have flowed to Indra.

## 3
The exhilarating drink of exhilaration, the soma, rushes into the filter  beyond the waves,
smashing aside the demons, seeking the gods.
## 4
He runs into the tubs; he is poured around into the filter.
He grows strong through the hymns at the sacrifices.
## 5
You blaze beyond the three luminous realms like the (sun) ascending to  heaven, o Soma.
Sending forth (speech), you have spurred it on, like the sun.
## 6
The inspired poets, the bards, have roared to him at the head of the  sacrifice,
keeping the dear one in their sight.
## 7
The men, the inspired poets, seeking help, groom you, the prizewinning  horse,
with their insights, for the divine conclave.
## 8
Flow following the stream of honey. You, the sharp (soma), have taken  your seat,
pleasing to be drunk for truth.

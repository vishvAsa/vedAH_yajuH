Soma Pavamāna
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The poet of the next three hymns (IX.44–46) seems to owe his Anukramaṇī identifi cation to the word ayā́sya “irrepressible” in the first verse of this first hymn, where it  is applied to Soma. Insofar as there is a theme in this hymn, it is Soma’s relation to  the gods (vss. 1, 3, 5) and his intermediary role between the gods and us, especially  us poets (vss. 2, 5).
## 01
O drop, you rush forth for our great extension, like (a river) bearing a wave, irrepressible, toward the gods.
## 02
Soma is impelled in the distance, delighted by the thought, impelled by  the insight
of the inspired poet—(Soma himself) a sage poet—in a stream.
## 03
This one, wakeful among the gods, goes pressed into the filter.
Soma the limitless is making his journey.
## 04
Purify yourself for us, seeking prizes, making the dear ceremony your own. The one with the ritual grass [=priest] seeks to lure (you) here.
## 05
He whose heroes are poets, growing ever stronger for Bhaga, for Vāyu— Soma will guide us to the gods.
## 06
You who find the will, who best find the way—in order to give us goods today, win the prize and lofty praise.

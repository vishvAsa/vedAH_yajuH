59 (771) Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
Each of the four verses contains at least one form of “purify oneself/self-purifying,”  with three such imperatives in verse 2. That verse seems to contain a trio of elemental  substances, which are also connected with the ritual: waters, plants, and, in our interpre tation, the hearths as holy places, representative of fire. Soma as finder of good things  for us provides a thematic ring for the hymn; in verse 1 he finds the material and psy chological goods men desire, while in verse 4 he has raised the stakes to the cosmic level.
## 1
Purify yourself, Soma, as cow-winner, horse-winner, all-winner,
joy-winner.
Bring here a treasure consisting of offspring.
## 2
Purify yourself undeceivable for the waters; purify yourself for the plants; purify yourself for the Holy Places.
## 3
Purifying yourself, Soma, cross all difficult passages.
As poet sit down on the ritual grass.
## 4
Self-purifying one, you find the sun; on just being born, you became great. Drop, you dominate all.

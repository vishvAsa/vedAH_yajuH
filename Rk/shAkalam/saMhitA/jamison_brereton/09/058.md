58 (770) Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
A curious little hymn or hymn-fragment. All four verses have a pāda-length refrain,  which is entirely applicable to Soma, and the hymn begins with this same refrain.  The first verse is clearly a soma verse throughout, but verse 2 is more appropriate to  Dawn and verses 3 and 4 appear to be an abbreviated dānastuti. The patrons named  in verse 3 are identified as protegés of the Aśvins in I.112.23 (though with the first in  slightly different form); middle Vedic literature also has a confused tradition about  these same personages.

At (the hands of) Dhvasra and Puruṣanti we take thousands.
– In crossing, the invigorating one runs.
## 4
At (the hands of) those two we take thirty and thousands in extent. – In crossing, the invigorating one runs.

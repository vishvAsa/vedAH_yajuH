Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
6 verses: gāyatrī 1, 2, 6; uṣṇih 3; triṣṭubh 4; jagatī 5
The hymn has three divisions that correspond to the offering of the puroḷāś, the  “sacrificial cake” in the three soma-pressings: verses 1–2 belong to the Morning  Pressing, verse 4 to the Midday Pressing, and verse 5 to the Third Pressing. The  hymn is metrically mixed in an arrangement corresponding to the later tradition  that assigns the gāyatrī meter to the first pressing, the triṣṭubh to the second, and  the jagatī to the third. In part because the hymn is so closely tied to a specific parts  of the liturgy, it likely represents a more advanced stage in the development of the  Vedic ritual than is found in most R̥gvedic hymns. In the classical rite there is an  offering of rice cakes—in the earlier period they were barley cakes—to Indra at  each of the three soma-pressings. After each cake offering, there is an additional  offering to Agni Sviṣṭakr̥t, and, as Oldenberg (1897: 301) points out, Āśvalāyana  Śrauta Sūtra V.4.6 prescribes III.28.1, 4, and 5 for these offerings, according to  the order of the soma-pressings. See also III.52, which also concerns the sacrificial  cakes offered to Indra offered in the three pressings.
The remaining two verses (3 and 6) cannot be so readily connected with the three  daily pressings. Verse 3 is not in any of the meters associated with the pressings, but  rather in the rare uṣṇih meter. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, but it is at the end of the hymn,  not at the beginning where we would have expected the “morning” verses to appear.  These are also the only two verses in which the description tiróahnya appears. The  term means “aged overnight,” or more literally, “having passed through the day.”  This word describes soma that is offered to the Aśvins in the early morning of the  day following the soma-pressing day. In the classical Atirātra or “overnight” soma  ritual, an offering of a puroḷāś accompanies this soma offering to the Aśvins, and  these offerings of soma and puroḷāś may also be followed by a sviṣṭakr̥t offering of  puroḷāś to Agni. These two verses thus likely refer to one or another of these final  offerings of an Atirātra rite. Indeed, according to ĀśvŚS V.6.25, verse 6 is the yājyā or “offering” verse of the sviṣṭakr̥t rite for exactly this final offering.
If the term tiróahnya helps locate the ritual context of verses 3 and 6, it also  poses an interpretive problem. Geldner and Renou both understand tiróahnya as an adjective describing the puroḷāś-cake. However, it is unlikely to be literally  true that the cake is “aged overnight.” Rather, as is the case in the classical rite, it  would have been prepared on the morning it was offered. Recognizing this problem,

Elizarenkova understood tiróahnya to mean the soma “aged overnight,” in accord  with the consistent usage of the term elsewhere. But soma is not mentioned in the  hymn, and neither verse gives any indication that tiróahnya describes something  other than the puroḷāś. Therefore, we think that tiróahnya describes the puroḷāś
but is not intended to describe it literally. Rather, it associates the puroḷāś with the  accompanying offering of the soma “aged overnight.”
In the classical Atirātra, the Āśvinaśastra, the recitation that accompanies  the final soma offering to the Aśvins, follows the form of Prātaranuvāka, the  early-morning litany, which opens the soma-pressing day (cf. Staal 1983 I: 683). The  two recitations thus create a ritual ring, in which the end recapitulates the begin
ning. In this hymn verse 3, although connected with the end of the rite, is located  immediately after the verses that mark the rite’s beginning, and thus it becomes an  icon of the conjunction of the beginning and end of the rite. This is reflected in its  meter as well. Like gāyatrī, the meter associated with the morning rite, the uṣṇih  meter of verse 3 consists of three pādas, but its final pāda has twelve syllables like  jagatī, the meter associated with the end of the rite. The metrical form thus com
bines the morning and evening liturgies. Verse 6 is in gāyatrī, which again brings the  hymn metrically back to the beginning of the rite, although the verse is placed at  the end. For a more detailed discussion of this hymn, see Brereton (forthcoming b).
Another incongruous description appears in verse 5, which characterizes the rite  (adhvará) as “bearing treasure” (rátnavant) and “wakeful” (jā́gr̥vi). Especially the  latter is an adjective that often describes Agni (e.g., I.31.9, III.2.12) and Soma (e.g.,  IX.36.2, 44.3, 71.1). Here it is an epithet transferred from the sacrificial fire or from  the priests who have drunk the soma to the rite, which both Agni and the priests  wakefully maintain through the night. See also III.39.1, 2, in which the “thought”  of the poet is “wakeful.”
## 01
O Agni, enjoy our offering, our sacrificial cake, o Jātavedas,
at the Early Morning Pressing, o you who are rich through insight.
## 02
The sacrificial cake has been cooked, o Agni, or rather, perfected for you. Enjoy it, o youngest one.
## 03
O Agni, seek after the offered sacrificial cake “aged overnight.”
You are the son of strength, installed in the rite.
## 04
At the Midday Pressing, o poet Jātavedas, enjoy the sacrificial cake here. O Agni, the wise do not diminish the portion that belongs to you, the  youthful one, at the ritual distributions.
## 05
O Agni, since at the Third Pressing you will take pleasure in the
sacrificial cake offered you, o son of strength,
then (establish) the rite among the gods, amid their admiration; establish  it, bearing treasure and wakeful, among the immortals.
## 06
O Agni Jātavedas, becoming strong, enjoy the offering, the
sacrificial cake,
“aged overnight.”

Let the bullish mountains with stable dwelling places hear us, as they  become exhilarated on the refreshing drink.
Let Aditi with the Ādityas hear us. Let the Maruts extend to us  beneficial shelter. 21. Let our path be always easy to travel, abounding in food. Gods, saturate  the plants with honey.
(Let there be) a share in your fellowship for me, Agni. You should not  be neglectful. Might I reach the seat of wealth consisting in much
livestock.

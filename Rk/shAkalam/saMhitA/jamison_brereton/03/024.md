24 (258) Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1
This is a brief, almost staccato hymn. Every verse begins with an invocation to  Agni, and most verses follow with an imperative, urging Agni to take his place on  the ritual ground and to grant the wishes of the poet and his people. The first three  verses refer either directly or indirectly to the brightening fire, which may find its  counterpart in the swiftness and brevity of the hymn.
## 1
O Agni, overwhelm in battles and cast away evil intents!
Hard to overcome but overcoming hostilities, establish luster for the one  whose vehicle is the sacrifice. 2. O Agni, you are kindled by the ghee-libation—you, the immortal one,  pursuing the gods as Hotar.
Take pleasure in our rite!
## 3
O Agni, who are awake with brilliance! O son of strength, to whom  offering is made!
Sit here on this ritual grass of mine!
## 4
O Agni, exalt our songs together with all the fires, with (all) the gods, and those who are the respected (priests) in the sacrifices.
## 5
O Agni, to the pious man give wealth full of heroes, a profusion (of heroes)! Sharpen us to be endowed with sons!

Commentary III
[III.1-7 JPB]
## 008
Sacrificial Post
On the structure of this hymn, see the publ. intro.

### 01
Note the future impv. dhattāt.

### 04
Kane (HDŚ II.1.269) suggests that the image in this vs. is that of a young boy,
well dressed and encircled with his sacred thread (yúvā suvā́sāḥ párivītaḥ), at his
Upanayana, whom they “lead up” (ún nayanti), in an idiom close to the úpa √nī of
the Upanayana. Acdg. to Kane, several gṛhya sūtras employ this mantra in the
Upanayana.

### 06
There is number disharmony between the 2nd plural enclitic vaḥ (a) and the
voc. singular vánaspate (b).The simplest way to account for this is to assume that the
voc. has simply been repeated from the 1st vs. of the hymn (1b) in this 1st vs. of the
2nd (half of the) hymn, which switches its subject from a singular post to plural posts.
Or Lord of the Forest may refer to the forest itself or a single tree that produces
multiple posts.

### 08
The rarer dual dvandva dyā́vā-kṣā́mā substitutes for the more common
dyā́vā-pṛthivī́, with pṛthivī́, perhaps in its lit. meaning ‘broad one’, pleonastically
following the dvandva.

### 10  
Contrary to the standard tr., I think there is a change of subject in the 2nd
half-verse. Rather than calling on the posts to help us, we turn again to the gods, who
are the likely subject of avantu, just as they were in 8c. The types of help we ask
them for are distinct but complementary: help for our sacrifice in 8c, help in battle
and competition in 10d, a theme introduced by the vihavá- ‘competing invocation’ in
10c. The vā of 10c signals this disjunction and the return of the gods as subject.
Although Klein (DGRV II.203) suggests reading vā here as if for vaí, given that the
hymn contains several loosely construed vā-s (1d, 6b), this does not seem like a good
idea.
[III.9-29 JPB]
## 030
Indra
As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is characterized by hapaxes and very
rare words, often with affective suffixes, and unusual phonology. These words
include dhā́yuḥ (7a), gehyà- (7b), kúṇāru- (8b), píyāru- (8c), alātṛṇá- (10a),
yāmakośá- (15a), salalū́ka- (17c).

### 01
The desid. títikṣante used to be assigned to √tij ‘sharpen’ (e.g., Wh Rts, Gr),
but has for quite awhile been taken to √tyaj ‘abandon’ instead. See EWA s.v. TEJ
and TYAJ, Gotō (1st cl., 165-66 n. 268), and in some detail Heenen (Desid. 59-60 and
147-48). Curiously WG render it as (if) an intensive to √tij: “Sie schärfen (sich)
immer wieder (gegen) …,” despite Gotō’s own published views to the contrary. (In
the WG tr., acdg. to the title pg., Maṇḍala III is Witzel’s responsibility, however,
which may account for the discrepancy.) The desiderative stem has the idiomatic
sense ‘endure, support’, and the semantic channel from (putatively) ‘desire to
abandon’ to this idiom is not entirely clear. I am not convinced by the suggestions of
either Gotō or Heenen (59-60). Instead, I think the middle voice is the key: if we
assume a reflexive ‘abandon oneself to’, ‘give oneself over to’, it is not difficult to
imagine this development.
The sense of the final pāda depends on the meaning of praketáḥ, and like
many derivatives of √cit this word is slippery. In my view, it means both ‘sign’ and
‘insight’ (that is, it reflects both the ‘appear’ and ‘perceive’ values of √cit). In this
particular passage I take it in the former value; the point is that Indra is showing no
sign of his presence or imminent arrival, and so we are subject to abuse from our
rivals. For a similar usage cf. II.17.7, where the poet beseeches Indra for good
fortune, and then demands kṛdhí praketám “make a visible sign,” further asking for
him to bring the good fortune here. In X.104.6 Indra is himself called the adhvarásya
praketáḥ “the visible sign of the ceremony.” Ge interpr. the word as Losung (‘motto,
watchword, password’), which is, I suppose, possible, but I don’t understand what it
would mean here; Re as “le signe-pré(monitoire),” which is somewhat opaque to me,
but seems closer to my interpr than Ge’s; Old as “Helle” (light, brightness). WG take
it as an agent noun: “Wahrnehmer.”
### 02-03
The next two vss. develop the theme sounded in pāda d of vs. 1.: Indra’s
absence. In vs. 2 we point out that for Indra nothing is very far away, so he could,
and should, easily come here, where the sacrifice is invitingly set out for him. In vs.
3 we provide a flattering description of Indra’s great powers and then plaintively ask
where these powers are now.

### 03
The 2nd member of tuvikūrmí-, an epithet of Indra, is generally now derived
from the seṭ root √cari
, a derivation already found in AiG I.24, 141, 152 -- hence my
‘powerfully ranging’. See EWA s.v. tuvikūrmí-. The older deriv. from √kṛ (e.g., Gr.,
Wh Rts; explicitly rejected by AiG II.2.776) is nonetheless still reflected in the
standard tr.: Ge “der Tatenreiche,” Re (with hesitation) “aux actes (?) puissants,”
WG “der mächtig Wirkende” -- even though AiG I (1896) predates all of them by a
good margin, well over a century in the case of WG!
There is number incongruence between the neut. sg. yád of the rel. clause and
neut. pl. tyā́… vīryā̀ṇi. The yád is, as it were, an anticipatory collective: “what(ever)
you did … where are those deeds?”

### 04
As has often been pointed out, the redupl. pres. to √han, jíghnate, almost
always takes plural objects, and so, at least in this formation, reduplication seems
correlated with repetitive action. This semantic nuance is strengthened here by the
syntactic construction, with the redupl. pres. in the participle (jíghnamānaḥ)
construed with a quasi-auxiliary cárasi. (Cf. 14b below.) Although cárasi does have
lexical meaning (‘you range/roam/wander’), the lexical value is weak enough here
that the verb can seem to be a marker of the progressive present: “you go about /
keep / are (constantly) smashing.” On the other hand, it is possible that √car in its
lexical value may be resonating with tuvikūrmí- ‘powerfully ranging’ in 3b (see
comm. there). However, it is hard to know whether that root connection would still
be perceived by the contemporary audience -- it certainly has escaped most of the
modern audience -- given the phonological distance between the two words and the
fact that tuvikūrmí- is simply an epithet of Indra and its own lexical value may have
become attenuated.
There is a faint phonological echo between vṛtrā́in b and vratā́(ya) in d,
which occupy the same metrical position.

### 05
I am not certain how to construe śrávobhiḥ. The publ. tr. takes it with the
voc. puruhūta: “much invoked with acclamations.” But I am not entirely happy about
construing a full noun with a voc. that ordinarily stands alone (as in, e.g., 7d, 8a). Ge
tr. “rühmlich,” which seems designed to be as untethered to the sentence as possible.
Re takes it with the speaking of pāda b: “… seul avec tes remons tu as parlé (un
langage) ferme,” but I don’t understand what that means; WG like Re, except tr. “mit
Ruhmes(taten),” which again I don’t follow.
I have given the idiom dṛḷhám √vad a mildly slangy turn (similarly in
X.48.6); the collocation of a verb of speaking and an adverb referring to a physical
quality seems to invite it. “Speak firmly” would be a more neutral rendering than
“talk tough,” but pāda d, which describes heaven and earth as a mere “handful” for
Indra, also seems to belong to a vivid and informal register.
The participial phrase vṛtrahā́sán contains, unusually, a non-concessive
nominative of the pres. part. of √as ‘be’. It seems here to be definitional and to pick
up and summarize 4b éko vṛtrā́cárasi jíghnamānaḥ “you alone range about [/keep]
smashing obstacles.” As discussed immed. above, the redupl. pres. part. combined
with a quasi-auxiliary depicts this as repetitive, indeed habitual, action -- and the
ékaḥ indicates that only Indra engages in it. Our phrase here, vṛtrahā́sán, comes to
the appropriate conclusion: since you and you alone keep smashing obstacles, you
are The Obstacle-Smasher, par excellence.

### 06
Sāy. supplies ‘chariot’ as the subj. of pāda a, and in this he is followed by
the standard tr. as well as Old. Although this is perfectly harmless and certainly
possible, I do not understand why supplying a subject not found in the context is
desirable, much less necessary. I admit that it would allow us to use the etu of prá …
etu in b as the gapped verb with the prá of a, but Rigvedic poetic syntax is flexible
enough to allow a 2nd ps. substitution in such a gapped phrase (prá … *ihi,
4
anticipating prá … etu). The fact that 2b has a similar phrase with Indra as the 2nd sg.
supplied subject -- ā́tú prá yāhi … háribhyām -- also supports my assumption that
the default subject is Indra.
Unfortunately the voc. indra in 6a was omitted in the publ. tr. The pāda
should read “(Come) forth along an easy slope with your two fallow bays, o Indra.”

### 07
dhā́yuḥ is a hapax. The stem is generally listed as dhā́yu- (so Gr) and would
therefore have to be a masc. nom. sg. here, but the standard tr. render it as obj. of
ádadhāḥ. This interpr. requires it to be a neut. -us-stem, which is easily possible (see,
e.g., Old). Old suggests that it belongs to √dhā and that dhā́yur ádadhāḥ is an
etymological figure like ábhaktam … bhajate in b. I prefer the analysis suggested in
AiG II.2.470 linking it to √dhā(y) ‘suckle, nourish’, thus a neut. -us-stem exactly
parallel to neut. dhā́yas- ‘nourishment’. This analysis seems to be reflected in Re’s
“tu as accordé la satisfaction-nourricière,” though Re’s (in)famous hyphenated
portmanteaus are capacious enough to include many possibilities.
I am not entirely sure what pāda b is about: is this a legal issue, having to do
with what is held in common? or with what hasn't (yet) been divided by inheritance?
Or is it simply that nobody has distributed the goods yet? X.112.10d, adduced by Ge,
is similar: ábhakte cid ā́bhajā rāyé asmā́n, but that pāda follows one in which Indra
is urged to do battle and so the most likely interpr. there is that we are asking for a
share in the as-yet-undivided spoils of war. Here, however, the goods are specifically
identified as gehyà- ‘belonging to the household’. This is the only occurrence of this
stem in the RV; it is found in AVP (VI.14.8, VII. 11.3; see Arlo Griffiths ed. and tr.)
and later, and gehá- ‘house’, from which it is derived, first occurs in VS. The
etymology of gehá- is quite unclear (cf. EWA s.v.), as is its relationship to
synonymous gṛhá-. The former is quite widespread in MIA, beginning already in
Aśoka, but it cannot be simply a Middle Indic form of gṛhá- at least acdg. to the
standard sound laws (pace older accounts such as AiG I.39), though it is quite
possible that it has guṇa in an adj. derived from MIA gihi(n) ‘householder’ (<*gṛhin-
), (a-)giha-. In any event it seems likely that the word was imported into Vedic from
MIA and that the use of this unusual stem here signals a particular social or legal
institution for which we have no other evidence.

### 08
This vs. contains two difficult words, kúṇāru- (b) and píyāru- (c). It is surely
no accident that they appear pāda-final in successive pādas and are rhyme forms. The
former is a hapax (though the vs. is repeated in the VS [Mā XVIII.69, Kā XX.5.2]). It
has been glossed ‘lame in the arm’ on the basis of a supposed connection with Ep, Cl
kuṇi- ‘id.’ (cf., e.g., AiG II.2.288, KEWA s.v. kuṇiḥ, EWA s.v. kuṇāru-). But the
chronological and morphological distance between the two words speaks against this
connection, as does the fact that kuṇi- is likely a Dravidian borrowing (see KEWA).
Moreover, since Vṛtra is a snake and is specifically called ‘handless’ here, it is
unlikely that he would have an arm to be lame in. Wiser heads generally take it as a
PN (so the standard tr., as well as Mayrhofer PN [though with ?]). However, this
cautious course is not very satisfactory either. The enemy is most definitely Vṛtra:
5
his name appears in c, his mother’s (Dānu) in a. Why would he be called by a
different name, esp. one that never appears elsewhere? Unfortunately I do not have a
strong alternative. However, I would point to kúṇapa-, which means something like
‘carrion, corpse’ (AVŚ XI.9.10, 10.10.4, 8; MS IV.9.19; ≅ kuṇapá- TS XI.2.10.2,
where human and equine kuṇapá-s are distinguished) on which various nasty critters
are invited to feed, and to various later forms of (-t)kuṇa- referring to various bugs
(cf. Kuiper [Aryans passim], Turner [CDIAL s.vv. kúṇapa-, kuṇa-], and Pāli
mankuna-). On the basis of these shaky parallels I suggest that kúṇāru- means
something like ‘vermin’ or perhaps even ‘corpse’. It owes its pejorative -āru-suffix
to píyāru-; cf. also śarā́ru- in X.86.9, which I tr. ‘noxious creature’. Of course, ku- is
a common pejorative prefix as well. Perhaps the word is simply constructed of
pejorative affixes with a hiatus-breaking ṇ! Or -- a better possibility -- it may
represent *ku-nara-āru- ‘ill-manly’, with haplology and MIA retroflexion of the
nasal. My point here is not to claim any of these suggestions as definitive, but to
show that this completely opaque word resonates with other words in several
different directions and therefore assuming a lexical meaning rather than taking it as
a PN is the better course. However, in the publ. tr. ‘vermin’ should be followed by a
question mark.
The 2nd difficult word, píyāru-, is by comparison much simpler. It must be
derived from √pī ‘sneer, taunt’, whose pres. pī́yati is attested 3x already in the RV. It
contains the same pejorative -āru-suffix as kúṇāru-, śarā́ru- -- though it should be
noted that not all -āru-suffixed words are pejorative: vandā́ru- is quite positive, and
the mysterious hapax jábāru- (IV.5.7) is at worst neutral but probably positive.

### 09
The pf. of √sad is generally intrans.(/reflex.) ‘sat (oneself) down’, but in
several instances must be trans. ‘set down’, as it is here. See Kü 542-43.
There is no agreement on the meaning of the adj. sāmaná-, found in the RV
only here and in the wedding hymn (X.85.11). Gr ‘gemeinschaftlich’ (fld. by WG),
Ge ‘gütige (?)’, Re ‘abondante’ (but in EVP XVI, ad X.85.11, he suggests that in our
passage it means ‘attelée-avec’ with which ‘heaven’ should be supplied), AiG
II.2.136 ‘reich’. I suggest that it’s a vṛddhi deriv. of sámana- ‘gathering’, meaning
‘related to the gathering/aggregate’, hence ‘whole’. This does not work so well in
X.85.11, but there there is a pun on -sā́man- ‘tune’, and the word seems simply to
mean ‘together’ vel sim.

### 10  
On alātṛṇá- see comm. ad I.166.7. In this passage though ‘unquiet’ does
not seem a normal feature of Vala, it can be applied proleptically, characterizing its
opening up in fear of Indra’s blow.
Note the phonetic figure in ab: alā.. vala … vrajo ... vy āra, with -tṛṇ- … -
ndr- nestled in the 1st pāda; the d pāda also has phonetic rep.: prāvan vāniḥ.
The standard tr. all supply the Maruts with vā́ṇīḥ ‘choir’. But as Schmidt (B+I
141) points out, the Maruts do not ordinarily participate in the Vala myth; it is the
Aṅgirases who are Indra’s back-up band. See III.31.4ff.
6

### 11  
Pāda a begins with an elementary numerical figure: éko dvé “the one the
two,” subject and object of ā́paprau respectively, both of which are identified in the
2nd pāda. The juxtaposition of the two numbers is responsible for my tr. éka- as ‘the
one’, rather than ‘alone’ as elsewhere in the hymn (vss. 4, 5).
Because of the voc. śūra, at least pāda d (and probably also c) shows a switch
to 2nd ps. from the 3rd ps. of ab. Since there are no verbs in cd, at least one needs to be
supplied. Most tr. (Ge [/WG], Klein [DGRV I.442], Scar [431]) take c and d as
separate clauses, supplying impvs. “come” and “bring” respectively. This is possible,
but I follow Re in taking cd as a single clause -- though do not follow his interpr. of
iṣáḥ as a verb (‘envoie’, presumably to √iṣ ‘send’).
All tr., incl. Re, take samīké as “in battle” (or, closer to the root sense in my
opinion, Scar “Treffen”). Although this noun generally has the meaning ‘encounter’,
it is a straightforward derivative of samyác- ‘united, conjoined’, and here I take it to
refer to the “join” of Heaven and Earth, which would define the midspace. Note that
pāda-final samīké matches pāda-final du. samīcī́in a, referring to Heaven and Earth.
I supply ‘bring’ as the verb of cd, with sayújaḥ … vā́jān as obj. There are
several possible interpr of iṣáḥ. As just noted, Re takes it as a verb. Assuming (with
everyone else) that it belongs to the root noun íṣ-, there are two possible analyses, as
gen. (/abl.) sg. or nom./acc. pl., although in the latter case we would prefer it to be
accented íṣaḥ (cf. the acc. pl. íṣaḥ in 18b). Both Klein and Scar take it as acc. pl.; I
agree with Ge (/WG) in construing it as gen. sg. with rathī́ḥ.

### 12  
The grammar of ab is so straightforward that it is easy to overlook how
odd the statement is. It is not surprising that the sun does not confound the quarters
or directions (díśaḥ); after all, the layout of the cosmos is not likely to be altered by
the sun as it passes through. But what does it mean that these same díśaḥ are
prasūtā́ḥ every day by Indra? The ppl. can only belong either to √sū ‘propel’ or √sū
‘give birth’, far more likely the former (pace WG, who seem to take it to the latter):
only the former is found with prá and in fact 9d contains an exactly parallel
expression, tváyā … prásūtāḥ “propelled by you.” Ge tr. “vom Falbenlenker
bestimmten,” but ‘determined, fixed, set’ seems the exactly opposite of what prá √sū
ordinarily means, including in nearby 9d. Such a meaning makes more sense of this
vs. but at the expense of arbitrarily assigning a unique meaning to this rather
common lexeme. If we take the idiom seriously, the hemistich seems to be saying
that while the sun respects the placement of the parts of the cosmos, Indra pushes
them around in some fashion, remaking or reconfiguring the cosmos daily. I simply
do not understand this; I must be missing something. Perhaps Indra arranges the
díśaḥ every day in a slightly new way for the sun’s road?
The sun is presumably the subj. of ā́naṭ; so the standard tr.
The cmpd háryaśvaprasūta- technically has three members -- that is a 2nd
member ppl. (prásūta-) whose 1st member is itself a cmpd. This would be somewhat
unusual for the RV, where cmpd size is quite limited. But the bv. háry-aśva- is so
frozen as an epithet of Indra that it was probably not fully perceived as a cmpd. Cf.
the exactly equivalent índra-prasūta- (1x).
7
Ge (/WG) seems to interpr. ádhvanaḥ as acc. pl. (“Wenn sie ihre Wege
vollendet hat”). Because I am not at all certain that √naś can be used that way with
an acc., I take ádhvanaḥ as gen. sg., with a supplied ‘end’; cf. V.54.10 ádhvanaḥ
pārám aśnutha with the same root. So apparently also Re.
áśvaiḥ is an instr. of separation with vimócanam.

### 14  
On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ (here tr. ‘udder’ perhaps misleadingly) as a pl. tantum,
see comm. ad X.27.16.
carati bíbhratī is another instance of quasi-auxiliary √car + pres. part. (also to
a redupl. pres.); cf. 4b. Here, carati seems to have more lexical value than in vs. 4.

### 15  
The sense of the hapax yāmakośá- is unclear. Ge takes it as traveling
trunks: “Die Reisetruhen sind bereit”; sim. Old. But the image of Indra standing by
overseeing the loading of his luggage verges on the absurd. Old suggests rather that
it is we who have come with empty suitcases, hoping Indra will fill them. Re takes
yāma- to √yā ‘beseech’ rather than √yā ‘drive, travel’, yielding “les vases de la
prière.” Since there is no comm. in EVP XVII, we will never know what he meant by
that; it is certainly not transparent. My tr. “journey-bucket” is meant as a slangy term
for chariot (‘bucket’ can be so used in English for an old or badly maintained car);
certainly the use of kóśa- ‘bucket, cask’ to refer to (a part of) a chariot is clear from
VIII.20.8, 22.9. WG’s “Wagenkörbe” is similar.
I also think that the chariots in question belong to the enemies mentioned in
cd; this might account for the slangy designation of their vehicles -- rather like
referring to a rival’s car as a jalopy. In any case it would seem odd to command Indra
to stand fast and them immediately get on a chariot and go traveling.

### 16  
The standard tr. all take the ghóṣa- to be emanating from the foes, but the
instr. amítraiḥ with śṛṇve should make it an agent of the hearing (“is heard by …”)
not a source of the sound. Ge’s (/WG’s) “von” and Re’s supplied “(faite) d’ennemis”
show their need to overrule the syntax. I see no reason why it should not be Indra’s
battle-cry, striking fear in all who hear it.

### 17  
salalū́ka- is yet another peculiar word that brings our interpr. to a standstill.
The current standard interpr. is “indulgence, patience” vel sim. (Ge [/WG]
“Nachsicht”). I do not understand where such a meaning would come from.
Mayrhofer (KEWA s.v.) suggests √sṛ in the meaning ‘sich erstrecken’, but the
semantic channel from one to the other seems blocked to me. Although a deriv. from
√sṛ seems likely, a more literal sense of that root, ‘run, flow’, provides better sense.
(The older interpr. of the word was ‘zerflossen’ or ‘umherschweifend’ [Gr, etc.].)
Both the l’s and the affective -ū́ka-suffix suggest a slangy or low-register word --
hence my “send scooting.” Gr suggests a preform *salsalū́ka-, presumably because -
ū́ka- is often added to intensively reduplicated stems (see AiG II.2.498)(cf. jāgarū́kaIII.54.7). This seems possible (though not, of course, necessary), and “send scooting”
is also meant to reflect an intensive/iterative sense. Note that salalū́kam
8
phonologically resembles sahámūlam in pāda a (in almost the same metrical
position), which may help account for the presence of salalū́kam in the vs. and could
also have facilitated a dissimilation from *salsalū́kam.

### 18  
It is difficult to know how to construe the first pāda of this vs. I take it as a
nominal main clause expressing the purpose of the subordinate clause in b. Ge (/WG)
as a parallel subordinate clause with pāda b, for which a verb (ausziehst ‘set out for’)
must be supplied -- all dependent on pāda c. Re as part of a single subord. cl.
introduced by yád in b, also all dependent on c. Each of these solutions has
drawbacks. Mine requires nothing to be supplied (Re’s supplies less than Ge’s), and
it also avoids two problems produced by Re’s interpr: a worrisomely late position of
yád and an untethered ca in the middle of pāda a. But mine comes with a certain
awkwardness of expression and an ill-assorted conjoined pair (“for well-being and
with horses”).
However the various interpr. of ab differ, they all agree in taking āsátsi as the
verb in the subor. cl. introduced by yád, thus showing the older non-imperatival (that
is, subjunctive) value of the so-called “-si imperative.”

### 19  
Gr analyses dhīmahi as passive, but this is rightly rejected by all standard
tr.: the numerous other examples of this form are all transitive. What then should we
supply as object? I take the line of least resistance, importing bhágam from the
preceding pāda. I take the b pāda to mean that we hope to take the portion Indra
brings us now and put it together with the superfluity of his previous gifts (and those
to come) (deṣṇásya … prareké). Ge (sim. WG) does not construe these two nouns
together, but takes deṣṇásya as a partitive genitive, supplying the obj. of dhīmahi
(“Wir möchten von deiner Gabe etwas auf Vorrat zurücklegen”), while Re takes the
verb as reflexive: “puissions nous nous placer …”
The Pp. and all standard analyses take ūrvá as underlying nom. ūrváḥ; I,
however, take it as loc. ūrvé. Though Ge and Re tr. the word as ‘sea’, it really refers
to the container, in this case the sea-basin, and so logically what stretches out is not
the container itself but the liquid in the container. (WG tr. Behälter, but keep it as
nom.)

### 20  
The conjoined verbs in ab, mandayā … papráthaś ca, are in different
moods, imperative and subjunctive respectively. Or so it seems: in the sandhi context
mandayā góbhiḥ the apparent impv. mandayā could represent subjunctive *mandayās.
However, I don’t think this is necessary; impv. and subj. are both future-oriented
moods, and in fact in this passage the pairing functions as a sort of covert
conditional: “(if) you invigorate it, it will spread.” Kü (321), fld by WG, construes
candrávatā rā́dhasā with the 2nd verb, but both the accent on papráthaḥ and the
position of the ca make it clear that papráthaḥ must begin a new clause.

### 21  
Schaeffer (136) sees no particular repetitive function in the well-attested
intensive dárdar-; she considers it simply lexicalized. Therefore my “keep breaking
9
open” may impose a semantic nuance that does not belong to this stem. However, at
the very least it takes pl. objects here (gotrā́, gā́ḥ), so it could be considered
“objektsdistributiv” (for which term see Schaeffer 86-87).
## 031
Indra
As indicated in the publ. intro., the hymn presents multiple difficulties, esp.
in its first three vss. I will not attempt to represent the many conflicting interpr. of
these vss., but simply lay out some parts of my own and point to some of the many
puzzles that remain. As also noted in the publ. intro., I think the cosmic incest theme
imposed on these vss. by others is faint at best, and also think that the ritual occasion
depicted is not the original generation of the ritual fire but the removal of the
Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya.
In the publ. intro. I say that Indra is not named in the narrative of the Vala
myth until vs. 11, but this is false: the last word of the 1st verse of the Vala treatment,
4d, is índraḥ. He is also named in the last vs. of the Vala section, 11b -- thus
producing a satisfying ring.
Vss. 3 to the end are tr. and discussed by H.-P. Schmidt in Bṛhaspati und
Indra (pp. 166-75).

### 01
The female line of descent implied in the 1st pāda, duhitúr naptyàm “the
(grand)daughter of the daughter,” is striking. As noted already, I believe that this
kinship succession refers to the production of the offering fire (Āhavanīya) from the
householder’s fire (Gārhapatya) and the removal to the east of the former. Obviously,
however, this can’t refer directly to the fires, because agní- is masc.; it is rather, I
think, a reference to the hearths, which word (dhiṣánā- in some uses) is fem. The
conveyor (váhniḥ) who has come (gāt) is the fire itself (often called váhni-), which
has made the journey from the Gārhapatya hearth to the Āhavanīya hearth. The
offering is being made there by the father (pitā́), whom I take as the priest. I do not
see allusion to the cosmic incest of Heaven and his daughter, in part because it is
difficult to identify who the granddaughter would be. (See Old.) The ritual
identifications of váhni- = Agni and pitā́= priest are pretty standard; it is the identity
of the females that causes dispute.

### 02
I do not see sufficient evidence in this vs. for the legalistic interpr. having to
do with inheritance rights advanced by Old and Ge (fld. by WG). Again, my interpr.
involving the two fireplaces is at least thinkable, though there are a number of loose
ends (in everyone’s interpr). In the first pāda in my interpr. the fire that has been
taken out of the Gārhapatya leaves nothing behind. The two other occurrence of
āraik have womb as obj. + a dative (as if it were our pāda b): I.113.1 evā́rā́try uṣáse
yónim āraik “so night has left behind the womb for dawn” and I.124.8, which even
has a sister: svásā svásre jyā́yasyai yónim āraik “The (one) sister has left the natal
place to her older sister.” In both the idea seems to be that one has vacated the space
for the other -- not left as legacy, as the legalistic inheritance interpr. requires.
Problematic for my interpr. is the fact that rikthám should be the equivalent of the
10
womb itself (the fireplace), not the detritus that the fire might leave in it. Moreover,
the two hearths that had been daughter and granddaughter now become sisters -- but
a certain fluidity in modeling kinship relations would not be surprising.
In b the site of the new fire, the Āhavanīya, is the womb of this new fire and
“the repository of the winner” (the winner being the fire itself).
The second half-verse is fairly clear (for this hymn) in its description of the
churning of the fire: the mothers are the fingers, the two good workers are the two
kindling sticks. See the fire-churning passage with kindling sticks in nearby III.29.1.
The yádī opening the second half-verse is better taken as yád ī, with the
enclitic pronoun. See 6a below.

### 03
In the first pāda the instr. juhvā̀can be read simultaneously as “with his
tongue,” construed with réjamānaḥ and referring to the flame(s) of the fire, and as
“by the offering-spoon,” construed with jajñe and indicating that the ghee poured
from the spoon “begets” the fire by making it flame up.
The second pāda is likewise ambiguous and initiates the transition to the
Indra-Aṅgiras-Vala myth portion of the hymn. The “sons of the great ruddy one”
(mahás putrā́m̐aruṣásya) can be the flames of the fire, that is, of Agni himself -- and
the infinitival prayákṣe ‘to display’ is esp. appropriate to this interpr. But they can
also be, as they are identified by most commentators, the Aṅgirases, the sons of
Heaven, who will figure in the Vala myth about to be related, but who are also
associated with Agni, who is sometimes called áṅgirastama- (e.g., I.75.2; see Macd,
Vedic Myth. 143). The “birth of these” (jātám eṣām) in c can likewise refer to both
the flames and the Aṅgirases. Indra’s appearance in d strengthens the Aṅgiras
reading and provides a transition to the next portion of the hymn.
The lexeme prá √yakṣ has been variously interpreted. For ‘display’ see Gotō
(1st class, 153 and n. 572), EWA s.v. Curiously WG tr. it as if to √yaj ‘sacrifice’,
despite Gotō’s own disc. just cited -- though the other possibility is suggested in the n.

### 04
Pādas a and c contain feminine plural nom./acc. forms: jaítrīḥ and jānatī́ḥ …
uṣā́saḥ respectively. Although the default assumption would be that they are
coreferential and both refer to the Dawns, the familiar plot line of the Vala myth
suggests rather that they identify two different subjects: the (unexpressed) Aṅgirases
in ab, the (expressed) Dawns in c. (So Ge, Re, Schmidt [B+I, 167]; Old agrees that
the Aṅgirases should be supplied as subj. in a, but takes jaítrīḥ as obj. [presumably
alongside clear acc. spṛdhānám], while WG take the Dawns as subj. of a, but supply
the Aṅgirases as subj. of b.) The Aṅgirases are Indra’s back-up band in the Vala
myth, as noted above ad III.30.10, and would be expected to accompany him, as pāda
a depicts, while the Dawns are still confined within the Vala cave and only in c
recognize Indra’s song and come out of the cave. The problem for an Aṅgiras
reading of pāda a is of course the fem. gender of jaítrīḥ. Here it is probably best to
follow Sāy. in supply víśaḥ ‘clans’ (so Ge, etc.); cf. I.121.3 viśā́m áṅgirasām.
However, note that the Aṅgirases are referred to by the fem. pl. vā́ṇīḥ ‘choir’ in the
preceding hymn, III.30.10, and that noun could be supplied here.
11
The cows of d are surely the dawns, as often; Indra becomes their páti-, a
word meaning both ‘lord’ and ‘husband’. On the naming of Indra here, see the intro.
remarks above.

### 05
The Aṅgirases, now presumably in the masc. (though both dhī́rāḥ [a] and
víprāḥ [b] are technically ambiguous), remain the implicit subjects of abc, with Indra,
also unnamed, taking this role in d. The cows, also not identified, are represented in
pāda a by the fem. pl. part. satī́ḥ. In fact, though these identifications are fairly easy
to make for those familiar with the story, they remain covert, and, further, both b and
d have unidentified objects as well. In b Ge (/WG) tr. áhinvan without object; I have
supplied the cows (so apparently also Lü [Varuṇa 510-11], Schmidt [B+I 167]),
while Re’s parenthetic “(l’)” in “(l’)incitèrent” presumably refers to Indra.
In d there is an expressed object, but it is merely a 3rd ps. pronoun, which is,
furthermore, ambiguous in sandhi: tā́in tā́námasā can represent either neut. pl. tā́or
fem. pl. tā́ḥ. The Pp. opts for the former, a decision endorsed by Old. The issue is
further complicated by the fact that the form could be construed with either (or both)
of two verbal forms, part. prajānán or pf. ā́viveśa. Old takes tā́to refer vaguely to
things that Indra knows and construes it with prajānán; sim. Re: “sachant ces choses.”
Ge [/WG], contra Pp., restores tā́ḥ, which he takes to refer to pl. pathyā̀ḥ, generated
from pathyā̀m in c. My tr. is closer to Schmidt and to Lü, in restoring tā́ḥ (like Ge),
but assuming its referent to be the cows, into whose company Indra enters. With Lü
and Schmidt, I also take prajānán as having an implicit object inspired by pathyā̀m in
c, but prajānán is generally used absolutely to mean “knowing (the way)” and so a
form of pathyā̀- need not be supplied. The publ. tr. should have parentheses:
“knowing (the way).”

### 06
Ge (/WG) interpret ab as a direct quotation from the gods, for reasons that
are unclear to me. Although an immediate past reading might help account for the
injunctive aorists vidát (a) and kaḥ (b), in fact the second hemistich also contains two
injunctives, nayat (c) and gāt (d), the latter of which is also an aorist. So there is no
clear grammatical distinction between the two half-verses, and the subject (Saramā)
also remains the same throughout (by most interpr.), with all four pādas focusing on
the same narrative. Other interpreters (Re, Lü, Schmidt) ignore this odd decision of
Ge’s.
In a yádī should be read yád ī; see 2c above.
In b pā́thaḥ ordinarily means ‘fold, pen’, but here refers to the herd confined
in the fold: the shift from container to contained is a common one in semantic change.
ákṣarāṇām in c most likely has double reference, both to the cows that are
being released from the Vala cave and the syllables of the Aṅgirases’ song that
effects that release.
Ge makes the point (n. 6d) that ráva- in this context otherwise only refers to
the Aṅgirases’s song; this leads him to switch the subject to Uṣas, as the first out of
the cave, coming in response to the sound of the Aṅgirases. This seems, on the one
hand, over-finicky -- why introduce another female character in the middle of a vs.
12
without signaling it? -- and, on the other, rather deaf to the possibility of multiple
meanings that always lurks in RVic discourse. One of the points of the Vala myth in
general seems to me the mirroring of sounds: the song that releases the cows and
their joyous counter-mooing in response -- an obvious place for a poet to allow a
single word to do double duty. This same double reference is found in the preceding
pāda in ákṣarāṇām. Schmidt (B+I 167) also takes the ráva- to be that of Indra and the
Aṅgirases and in fact makes Uṣas the subject of the whole 2nd hemistich. I do not see
the need for this.

### 07
Note that all pādas begin with 3rd sg. preterite verbs: a ágachat, b ásūdayat,
c sasā́na, d (modified initial pos.) áthābhavat (which most likely represents átha
abhavat, though áthā bhavat is possible). All but the perfect in c are augmented
imperfects; this contrasts markedly with vs. 6, which, as was just noted, contains four
3rd sg. injunctives, three of them aorists. Three of the four pādas of vs. 7 also end
with nom. sg. masc. pres. participles: a sakhīyán, c makhasyán, d árcan.
Pāda b configures the release of the cows from the Vala cave as a birth, but a
birth overlaid with metaphor (“brought to sweetness”).
In c the standard tr. (save for Re and Klein, DGRV II.67) take makhasyá- as
‘being generous’ vel sim. But in all three occurrences of this verb stem (here and
IX.61.27, 101.5) the ‘do battle’ sense is primary. Since it co-occurs with sasā́na ‘won’
in this pāda, the ‘battle’ sense seems esp. appropriate. So Re “comportant-encombattant.” For further on makhá- see comm. ad I.18.9.
My tr. of d, áthābhavad áṅgirasāḥ sadyó árcan, differs in an important way
from the standard. In my opinion it states that Indra became an Aṅgiras as soon as he
sang; the others that the Aṅgiras [=Indra] right away became a singer (e.g., Ge “Da
ward sogleich der Aṅgiras zum Lobsänger”). On the one hand, I’m not certain that
√bhū + pres. part. can yield this sort of predication, esp. with the pres. part. standing
in, in effect, for an agent noun. So -- a syntactic argument, though I have not
examined the evidence in detail. Another syntactic/lexical argument: sadyáḥ +
participle is frequently used to indicate the circumstances under which the action of
the main verb takes place. This is esp. common with sadyó jātáḥ “just born” / sadyó
jajñānáḥ “having just been born” -- e.g., the next hymn, III.32.9 sadyó yáj jātó ápibo
ha sómam (≅10) “Just born, you drank the soma” (and cf. III.29.3). But the
prevailing interpr. here requires the sadyáḥ to go with the main verb, despite its
position directly before the participle -- e.g., Klein “And then did the Aṅgiras
straightway become a singer.” And finally a semantic objection: the proposed tr.
seems to me thematically backwards. Indra joins the category of the Aṅgirases
because he joins them in song, which is their principal function in this myth; he is not
an Aṅgiras by nature who happens to start singing. (This point is made, more or less,
by Schmidt [173], despite his contrary tr.)
### 07-08
Given the thematic weight the part. árcan carries (see comm. immed.
above) and given that it occupies pāda-final position in 7d and 8c, it should have
been tr. the same way in these two vss. I would emend the publ. tr. to ‘chanting’ in
13
7d, or else 8c to ‘singing’ and arkaíḥ in 9b, 11b to ‘songs’. The instr. arkaíḥ
reappears in pāda-final position in 11b.

### 08
Ge (/WG) take this vs. as a quotation of the Aṅgirases’ praise-song of Indra.
I do not see why. The vs. seems to follow easily from the preceding one, and in fact
at the end of vs. 7 it’s Indra who’s singing (/chanting), not the Aṅgirases. We might
expect such a quotation to be signposted in some way. I do not consider the 1st pl.
enclitic naḥ in c to be a sufficient signal.
The presence of Śuṣṇa in b is a bit puzzling, since the smiting of Śuṣṇa is not
part of the Vala myth. Perhaps with Schmidt (173) he is mentioned because Indra is
uncontestably Śuṣṇa’s killer, and this extra-mythic (or extra-Vala myth) association
makes it clear that the unnamed subject of this vs. must indeed be Indra.
The standard tr. take c as a separate clause from d and supply a verb of
motion with prá (e.g., Ge “[ging] … voran”). This is certainly possible, but cd can
also be read as a single clause (so Schmidt, 168), since prá is frequent with √muc.
This interpr. allows, but does not enforce, a coreferential interpr. of naḥ (c) and
sákhīn (d), as in my tr. (flg. Schmidt).
What calumny? Ge (n. 8d) suggests the dishonor because of the loss of the
herd.

### 09
Ge’s suggestion that this vs. concerns the Aṅgirases’ Sattra, a months-long
ritual, seems completely convincing. Note the verb sedur ‘they sat’ in pāda a and the
nominal sádanam ‘sitting’ in c. I am less convinced by his interpr. of c (fld. by Re,
WG), that this Sattra is frequently (bhū́ri) repeated now, though I admit that both the
hic-et-nunc prn. idám and the particle nú might support his view. I prefer Lü’s interpr.
(Varuṇa, 511, fld. by Schmidt 168), who takes bhū́ri as ‘long’ and the hemistich as a
further description of the Aṅgirases’ Sattra in the Vala myth.
My interpr. of d (based on Lü and Schmidt) deviates further from Ge (Re,
WG). All of the latter take yéna … ṛténa as coreferential and the equivalent of …
*ṛtáṃ, yéna -- that is, *ṛtám in the main cl. as antecedent to yéna. The main cl. *ṛtám
would be an appositive to sádanam “the Session, (that is,) the ṛtá by which they …”
However, I separate the two instr. in d and take the antecedent of yéna to be sádanam
(“the Session by which …”), leaving ṛténa to mean ‘by/through truth’ as so often.
They also take māsā́n as the obj. of ásiṣāsan (“they sought to win the months”), but
this acc. pl. can easily be an acc. of extent of time (again, as so often), and the true
object of their desire to win can be supplied as the cows.

### 10  
What “the milk of the age-old semen” means is unclear to me. Ge suggests
that they’re milking their old cows, but the rhetoric seems rather overblown just to
express that. Lü (620-21, fld. by Schmidt 168) identifies the semen as ṛtá- and the
milk as the Kultlied of the Aṅgirases. This may well be, but nothing imposes this
explanation, and Schmidt in fact worries briefly (173) that logically the Aṅgirases
should already have their Kultlied since they should have used it to free these very
cows.
14
On niṣṭhā́- ‘outstanding’ see Old, Scar (648-49). The word must be derived
from nís √sthā, not ní √sthā and in fact goes literally into English as ‘stand out’, with
the same idiomatic meaning. In addition to two occurrences of the simplex (this and
IX.110.9), it is found in several compounds: karma-niṣṭhā́- X.80.1 a hero who stands
out through his work, puruniṣṭhā́- V.1.6 (of Agni), VIII.2.9 ‘standing out among
many’ of soma. Ge (unaccountably) takes it as ‘Verteilung’ (fld. by Re, Lü 528-29,
Schmidt 168), an interpr. about which Old comments rather acidly. Old’s own interpr.
is essentially reproduced here and was also adopted by WG.
Note the partial responsion between ghóṣa in c and góṣu in d, in the same
metrical position.

### 11  
My interpr. of the first hemistich differs from the standard; I take it as
consisting of two separate clauses, each identifying Indra in one of his most
important mythic roles -- in the Vṛtra-slaying and in the freeing of the Vala cows --
along with his associates in those enterprises, the Maruts and the Aṅgirases
respectively. It is important to note that this naming of Indra, in conjunction with the
first appearance of his name in 4b (see comm. there and in the intro. remarks),
frames the treatment of the Vala myth, and, by mentioning Vṛtra, it also sets the
stage for the opening out of this hymn to treat other exploits of Indra.
Others take vṛtrahā́in pāda a simply as an auxiliary epithet of Indra in this
account of the Vala myth, but I do not think that Vṛtrahan would be so promiment in
a treatment of the Vala myth, and I also cannot otherwise account for the séd u in the
middle of pāda a without assuming that a new clause begins there. (Lü [517] gets out
of this difficulty by accepting Ludwig’s emendation to a bahuvrīhi svéduhavyaiḥ
‘having sweating oblations’ [=Aṅgirases], but though this is ingenious, esp. as sweat
figures in the same myth in X.67.6-7 as Ge points out, it requires too much alteration
for a sequence that can make sense on its own.) In the first brief clause, vṛtrahā́is the
predicate, and jātébhiḥ refers to the Maruts, who are well known for being ‘born
(together)’ (e.g., V.55.3 sākáṃ jātā́ḥ). Ge suggests, but rejects, an emendation here to
sajātébhiḥ (for transmitted sá jātébhiḥ), an idea also of Alsdorf’s (see Schmidt 169);
I would modify that by proposing haplology from sá *sajātébhiḥ. The rest of ab
concerns the Vala myth, which has been the subject of the past seven vss. The myth
is readily identifiable by the VP úd usríyā asṛjat “sent the ruddy (cows) surging up”
and by the arkaíḥ, repeated from 9a. Since the chants in 9a clearly belonged to the
Aṅgirases, there need not be any even oblique reference to the Aṅgirases here: the
bare arkaíḥ will be enough.

### 12  
The first pāda contains two datives, pitré and the prn. asmai. Because of its
lack of accent, asmai cannot be a demonst. adj. with pitré. Ge gets out of the
difficulty by interpr. pitré as a simile, which allows asmai to be independently
construed, but this depends on his frequent assumption that cid can be a simile
marker, a role I do not think it can have. Instead I give the VP cakruḥ sádanam a
double reading: acdg. to the first the Aṅgirases perform a Sattra for their father (see
9c), but in the 2nd they also prepare for him a literal seat. Because cakruḥ sádanam
15
participates in two clauses, each can have an independent dative, though in my
opinion the datives are coreferential.
It is unclear what the referent of the object in b is, described as máhi tvíṣīmat
“great and turbulent.” Ge, flg. Sāy, takes it as a further reference to the seat, Re the
all-purpose “quelque chose,” Schmidt the eye of the sun, WG sim. the sun-god. My
own candidate is the pā́thaḥ of 6b, also described as máhi there. In vs. 6 the word is
used to indicate the herd, which is contained in the fold (see comm. there); here I
think it is the container, the fold or pen, itself -- representing the cosmic space and
also the ritual ground. When they survey it they see that this space needs organizing,
which they proceed to do -- by propping apart Heaven and Earth (a deed usually
ascribed to Indra) and preparing and propping up a seat for Indra. They thus make
the whole cosmos into Indra’s ritual ground, and in the next vs. (13ab) Earth herself
serves as the emplacement allowing Indra to pierce Vṛtra.
The position of the hí is somewhat anomalous: since the whole b pāda forms a
single clause, we would expect the hí in Wackernagel’s position. However, there is a
general tendency when a preverb precedes its verb late in the clause for hí to
intervene between them, as here: … ví hí khyan#. More specifically, 1) when there's
a hí in a clause containing a verbal form of √khyā, it always immediately precedes
the verb -- sometimes in normal Wack. pos. (e.g., I.81.9), sometimes not (as here and,
e.g., VI.15.15). 2) With one exception, all injunc. forms of √khyā are preceded either
by hí or by a preverb ending in -i, which prob. led to a sense that √khyā should be so
preceded. Note also in this passage the phonetic echoes #máhi … vi hí khyan#, which
also resonates with pāda d … ví minvan#. It is perhaps worth noting in this
connection how many pādas in this hymn begin with máhi or mahī́: 3d, 4b, 6b, 12b,
13a, 14a, 14c, 15a (esp. clustered here); cf. also mahás 3b, mahā́n 3c, 18d. I assume
that a pāda opening *máhi hí would be avoided; in any case there are none in the RV.
In d most tr. take the sun as the referent of the object. I instead supply the seat.
The root √mi often takes ‘seat’ as obj.: not our sádanam admittedly, but sádmanII.15.3 (with ví), X.20.5, I.173.3, IX.97.1, sā́dana- X.18.13. This is a fairly large
percentage of the attested forms of the verb, and since ‘seat’ is already present in this
vs., it is easily supplied here.

### 13  
I take yádi here as a shortened form of yád *ī with enclitic pronoun (as in
2c and 6a), though it unfortunately appears before a word beginning with a single
consonant. An “if” makes no sense here, and it is also desirable to have an acc. pron.
in this pāda to serve as obj. of dhā́t and subj. of the infinitival śiśnáthe. This putative
*ī may anticipate and double the heavy acc. phrase of b, assuming that the latter
refers to Indra.
As noted just above, Earth herself serves as the foundation from which Indra
can launch his attack. Our passage is very similar to I.102.7 ... tvā dhiṣáṇā titviṣe
mahy, ádhā vrtr̥ ā́ṇi jighnase ... “The great (Earth), the Holy Place has sparked you ….
So you keep smashing obstacles ...,” with the same mahī́… dhiṣáṇā as here and even
a form of √tviṣ, like tvíṣīmat in 12b; cf. also VI.19.2 índram evá dhiṣáṇā sātáye dhāt
“The Holy Place positioned just Indra for winning,” with √dhā + inf. as here. The
16
same √dhā + inf. construction is found in 19d below: svàś ca naḥ … sātáye dhāḥ
“and set us up to win the sun.”
Although Gr assigns the hapax śíśnathe to a them. stem śiśnátha-, as Old
clearly states we expect a datival infinitive here, and so it more likely belongs to an
athem. stem śiśnáth-; cf. abhiśnáth-.
Re takes b as describing Vṛtra, Schmidt Indra; Ge’s tr. is not clear, though
Schmidt (169 n.) claims it’s to Vṛtra. I follow Schmidt in assigning the phrase to
Indra, though the poet may have intended its referent to be ambiguous, indicating
that the opponents are almost evenly balanced.
I follow the current standard view (represented already by Ge and Re) that
ánutta- is the ppl. to the lexeme ánu √dā ‘concede’; Schmidt and WG follow the
older deriv. from √nud ‘push’, hence ‘unpushable’ vel sim.

### 14  
Because vaśmi is unaccented, the first pāda would be more accurately tr. “I
long for your companionship ….” since vaśmi cannot begin a clause. I tr. as I did to
capture the parallelism of pādas a #máhi … sakhyám and c #máhi stótram, as well as
15a máhi kṣétram.

### 15  
Ge takes nṛ́bhiḥ as the agent with the part. dī́dyānaḥ (“von den Männern
entflammt (?)”), but this participle never elsewhere takes an agent. Better an instr. of
accompaniment, with most other tr. That Indra is described as shining may be
connected to the fact that three of the four things he generates shine too: the sun, the
dawn, and fire. There is some disagreement about who the men are: the Aṅgirases or
the Maruts. Given the general prominence of the Vala myth earlier in the hymn, but
the more recent concentration on the Vṛtra myth, I imagine the ambiguity is
intentional and both sets of Indra’s helpers are to be thought of.

### 16  
My interpr. of this vs. differs significantly from the standard, beginning
with the disposition of the pādas. Most take abc together, with d as a separate clause,
while I divide the vs. into two hemistichs, which express parallel notions. In ab, in
mythological time, Indra sends the waters surging; this is the standard happy
denouement of the Vṛtra myth. In cd priests (even perhaps the Aṅgirases) impel
another collection of liquid, the streams of soma -- the ritual equivalent of Indra’s
cosmogonic release of the waters. Although the standard interpr. tacks pāda c onto ab,
as describing the waters, it contains vocabulary that is strongly associated with soma:
mádhu- ‘honey, sweet’, √pū ‘purify’, and pavítra- ‘filter’, and I cannot offhand think
of another instance in which waters are said to be purified, though they are purifying.
In ab note the return of several lexical items: vibhū́- (13b) and sadhryàñc-
(6b). The cid ‘also’ also links this vs. with a previous part of the hymn, namely 11b
where Indra sends surging another group of fem. entities (ruddy [cows]): úd usríyā
asṛjad índro arkaíḥ.
I do not understand why Indra is called dámūnāḥ ‘master of the house’. The
word is generally an epithet of Agni (understandably), and there is nothing in this
passage that seems to me to link Indra to the domestic sphere.
17
In c mádhvaḥ is taken by most as fem. acc. pl. (by Schmidt as masc. nom. pl.).
Several exx. of this form are analyzed by Gr as either masc. nom. pl. or fem.
nom./acc. pl. However, none of these supposed examples is convincing, and it is best
to take it here as the gen. sg. it usually is. It then needs a head noun. Old adduces
nearby III.36.7 mádhvaḥ punanti dhā́rayā pavítraiḥ “they purify it in a stream of
honey with purifying filters,” which is very similar to our pāda c. I therefore supply,
with Old, a form of dhā́rā- ‘stream’ upon which gen. mádhvaḥ depends. The precise
form I supply is acc. pl. dhā́rāḥ, modified by the (fem. acc.) part. punānā́ḥ and
coreferential with dhánutrīḥ ‘runners’ at the end of the vs. The conceit in the phrase
hinvanti … dhánutrīḥ is that the priests are spurring on the streams of soma (like)
horses. As for the subj. of hinvanti, I take it as (the current) priests (as in the sim.
passage III.36.7 just quoted; also III.46.5, where Adhvaryus are the subj. of hinvanti).
It could also be, with Re, the Aṅgirases, who have been operating as priests in the
Sattra depicted earlier.
Ge (/WG) take kavíbhiḥ as an adjective with pavítraiḥ (Ge: “mit geistigen
Filtern”), but in my opinion there are no adjectival uses of kaví-. Instead it is used as
a defining appositive (poets as filters), as I take it, sim. Re, or it is a separate agent
with punānā́ḥ (“being purified by poets with filters”), with Schmidt (170).

### 17  
As Ge points out, pāda a is very similar to IV.48.3 ánu kr̥ṣṇé vásudhitī,
yemā́te viśvápeśasā “The two black treasure chambers [=Night and Dawn], with all
their ornaments, have directed themselves after each other in turn.” Bloomfield (RR
ad III.31.17) cleverly comments, “The words kr̥ṣṇé and vásudhitī are both dvandva
ekaçeṣa 'black (Night) and (Uṣas)' is a way of saying náktoṣā́sā; conversely 'treasuregiving (Morn) and black (Night)' is uṣā́sānáktā.”
“The magnanimity of the sun” is a slightly surprising expression. Is it that the
sun makes the succession of Night and Dawn possible by his transit across the sky,
and this is considered generous on his part? Or is it an indirect reference to the
distribution of the dakṣiṇā at dawn. A related, but opposite, sentiment is found in
VII.81.4 uchántī yā́krṇ̥ óṣi maṃhánā mahi, prakhyaí devi svàr dr̥śé “You who in
dawning make through your magnanimity the sun to be visible for seeing,” with the
magnanimity credited to Dawn.
The only other occurrence of pl. ṛjipyá- (II.34.4) is at least indirectly used of
the Maruts; the standard tr. all assume they are the referents of cd, which seems
correct. Here they seem to be functioning as priests, attempting to bring Indra to a
sacrifice.

### 18  
Note the alliteration in b (… viśvā́yur vṛṣabhó vayodhā́ḥ) and the rather
elementary etymological figure in d (mahā́n mahī́bhiḥ); although sakhyébhiḥ śivébhiḥ
is neither the one nor the other, it seems to function as a bridge between the two.

### 19  
Pāda b, návyaṃ kṛṇomi … purājā́m “I make new (the hymn) born of old,”
is about as succinct a summary of the RVic poetic enterprise as we can find in the
text: the poets’ focus on ever new expressions based on traditional techniques and
18
themes. In this particular case, Ge suggests that purājá- refers to the Preislied of the
Aṅgirases, about which we heard in vss. 7-8.
On the √dhā + inf. construction, see vs. 13 above.
### 19-20
Note the echo of 19d #s

vaś ca naḥ in 20b s

vastí naḥ.

### 20  
The mists are probably in part metaphorical -- menacing threats and mental
darkness -- but may also refer physically to morning mists, which are clearing as the
dawn sacrifice begins. Note also that pāda-initial míhaḥ is a mirror image of máhi,
which opens so many pādas in this hymn (see comm. ad 12b).

### 21  
I follow Schaeffer (Intens., 133-34) in taking the medial intens. dédiṣṭe in
the meaning ‘display (one’s own X)’ -- hence my different tr. of ádediṣṭa (a) ‘has put
on display’ and diśámānaḥ ‘allotting’.
I interpr. b as having a more complex construction than the standard interpr.
The trouble is the antár phrase: when antár governs the acc., it is only used with dual
(or plurals conceived as duals -- jātā́n ubháyān [IV.2.2], e.g.), but kṛṣṇā́n has no
overt partner here. I suggest that it is an elliptical plural-for-dual: “black (nights) and
(bright days)”; cf. VIII.41.10 śvetā́n ... kr̥ṣṇā́n used for days and nights. The elliptical
kṛṣṇé used of Night and Dawn in 17a would support this, and in 20a the clearing of
the mists at daybreak (if I’m right) might provide the other half of this elliptical
duality. If this is correct, Indra comes between (antáḥ … gāt) the nights and days with
the entities appearing in the instr. (aruṣaíḥ dhā́mabhiḥ). aruṣá- ‘ruddy’ can of course
be used of Dawn and her various associates, esp. her “cows”; dhā́man- is a
frustratingly multivalent word, but here I think it means ‘manifestation’ vel sim, and
the phrase refers to the dawns, who of course come temporally between night and
full day.
The positioning of ca in d is somewhat disturbing, but I see no other way to
explain it than Klein’s (DGRV I.225, II.102 n. 28): it conjoins the first and second
half-verses, but takes Wackernagel’s position in the 2nd pāda of the 2nd half-verse
“following an intervening participial phrase.”
svā́ḥ ‘his own’ is in a very prominent position, as the last word in the last real
vs. of the hymn (before the refrain, vs. 22). Why it should be emphasized that the
doors that Indra opens are his own I do not know, beyond the fact that anything
belonging to Indra is highly noteworthy. But I would point out that svā́ḥ may be a
pun on s
ú
vaś (s
ú
vaḥ in pause) ‘sun’ initial in 19d (though unfortunately svā́ḥ is not
distracted here as it so often is).
## 032
Indra

### 01
The impv. píba is accented, though it is located mid-clause. There is no
obvious reason for this. Old suggests weakly (ZDMG 60: 736) that it is an emphatic
accent, but this is of course a circular argument: any verb bearing an unexpected
accent can be called emphatic. I find the accent esp. disturbing because the identical
19
phrase, minus the initial voc. índra, is found without accented impv. elsewhere:
\#sómam somapate piba# (V.40.1=VIII.21.3) versus our #índra sómaṃ somapate
píbemám#. There are several possible contributing factors. First, three pādas at the
beginning of this hymn begin with accented píbā (2b, 3d, 5b), and our form may
have had its accent added redactionally. However, I think that píba has special status
and can be accented in positions that strict syntactic rules would not allow. (This is
rather like Old’s “emphatic” argument, except that I limit the effect to a single verb
form.) See esp. I.15.1, II.37.1-3 and comm. there. The unsanctioned accent may arise
partly because píba ‘drink!’ is a particularly rousing verb in RVic discourse. It also
often occurs in non-initial position when it nonetheless legitimately has accent --
after init. vocatives (e.g. índra píba III.36.2, etc.) or at the beginning of a clause after
another short clause (or clauses) (e.g., VIII.4.8 tū́yam éhi drávā píba “Come here
swiftly! Run! Drink!”), and this may have led to the sense that it can be accented in
non-initial position in general. I also note in Lub’s conspectus that unaccented piba
generally occupies either final position in its pāda or second position, while accented
píba, besides being common and expected in initial position, tends to avoid both
those positions except when 2nd position follows an initial voc. (as in III.36.2, etc.) or
final position opens a new clause (as in VIII.4.8). Note that if this distribution holds,
the “identical” phrases I cite at the beginning of this comment are not the same after
all, because unaccented piba is pāda-final and our accented píba is followed by
another element. However, there are a few counterexamples with pāda-final pibȧ not
beginning a new clause (e.g., VIII.4.3, 65.5). One can speculate on why 2nd and final
position would favor the unaccented verb while full medial favors the accented form:
namely, that 2nd position is of course Wackernagel’s position, where enclitics
typically migrate, and, assuming a basic SOV underlying order, absolute final
position is the default position for unaccented main-clause verbs. Still, the full medial
position where we find accented main-clause píba does not otherwise favor or
impose accent on other verbs that appear there, so if this hypothesis holds, it is only
for this special verb.
Ge rather charmingly suggests that praprúthya represents “brr machend” to
stop the horses. Although “whoa” would be the equivalent English word/vocal
gesture, given the object ‘lips’ (śípre), I wonder if it’s the “horse training voice
command” (gleaned on the internet) called “smooching” -- defined as “kissing sound
with lips used to ask a horse to move on or up a gait.” I rather like the idea of Indra
smooching to his fallow bays.

### 04
Ge (and in part Re) take mádhumat as referring to speech (“… wurden
beredt in süssen (Worten)”), but though mádhumant- occurs several times with
vácas- and the noun vípra- ‘inspired poet’ demonstrates that √vip ‘become inspired’
can have a strong verbal component, still the focus of this hymn is soma -- and the
default referent of mádhumant- ‘honeyed’ is soma. Here the underlying word must
be neut. (which sóma- of course is not), but the neut. sávana- ‘pressing’ is found
elsewhere with this adj. (cf. X.112.7 mádhumattamāni … sávanā), and sávana- is
found three times in the first five vss. of this hymn (1b, 3c, 5a).
20
Note the insistent repetition of ma in pāda d (amarmáṇo mányamānasya
márma), anticipated by mádhumad in a and marútaḥ in b, and continued by the first
word in 5a manuṣvád. This phonetic figure may be signaling the Maruts’ name. See
also vs. 7.

### 05
The rendering of vavṛtsva in the publ. tr. (“let yourself be turned hither”), a
sort of passive reflexive, now seems over-elaborate to me; I would substitute “be
turned.” The other examples of this mid. pf. impv. seem more straightforwardly
simply “turn” or “turn yourself,” but if yajñaíḥ has true instrumental force, a passive
rendering is more natural. Possible, however, is Re’s “grâce à (nos) sacrifices.”
The referent of saraṇyúbhiḥ is not totally clear. Sāy. (fld. by Re) suggests the
Maruts, while Ge adds horses or waves as possibilities. The other ex. of a plural to
this stem (also instr.) in I.62.4 is in a clear Vala context, with the Navagvas and
Daśagvas in the same vs., which would suggest the Aṅgirases -- but, although the
Vala myth and the Aṅgirases were prominent in the preceding hymn III.31, they are
not found in this hymn, which is dominated by the Maruts and which mentions only
the Vṛtra myth (here and in the following vs.). I therefore think it likely that Sāy. was
correct. Note that saraṇyú- … sisarṣi is an etym. figure, continued by sártavaí in the
next vs. (6b).
The rendering of the phrase apó árṇā as “the flooding waters” in the publ tr.
assumes an emendation to fem. pl. árṇāḥ, with Gr and numerous others (see Old),
contra the Pp and not reflecting the expected sandhi of such a form, which should be
árṇāḥ. As Old points out, the emendation is not nec.: árṇā could easily be a neut. pl.
to the thematic stem árṇa-. In this case the tr. would better read “the waters, the
floods.”

### 06
This vs. appears to have no main clause. I take it as loosely attached to the
preceding vs., while Ge attaches it to the next one. Old (fld. by WG) disputes the
Nebensatz analysis, pointing first to the odd doubly accented Pp. analysis of prā́sṛjaḥ
as prá ásṛjaḥ: if the verb is accented, we would expect univerbation with the preverb
and loss of the preverb accent. He instead suggests that yád is to be construed with
the participial phrase vṛtráṃ jaghanvā́n, as if it contained the finite verb jagántha -- a
mixed construction. I am in general reluctant to allow a subordinating conjunction to
have domain over a participle, and in this particular case this assumption would
further require bits of the main clause and the subordinate clause to be interwoven in
a fashion unprecedented (as far as I know) even in RVic syntax: the major part of the
subordinate clause would be plunked down between the object of the main verb,
apáḥ, and that verb (prā́sṛjat), and the 2nd half verse would consist of NPs modifying
the object of the subordinate clause but following the end of the main clause. I do
admit that the position of yád dha in pāda a suggests a close relation with the
participial phrase, but I do not consider that position sufficient to override the
arguments against that analysis.
The vs. contains several nice oppositions: śáyānam … cáratā “(him) lying
(still) with (your) moving (weapon)” and the etymological devī́r ádevam “the
21
goddesses, godless …” In addition note the etymological pun: vṛtrám …
vavrivā́ṃsam.

### 07
The ma- phonetic figure that dominated 4d returns in this vs.: cd …
mamátur …, … mahimā́nam mamā́te. This figure is reinforced by the first words of
pāda a, yájāma ín námasā, and the uninterrupted sequence of -am acc. singulars in
ab: … vṛddhám índram, bṛhántam ṛṣvám ajáram yúvānam. Although a side-effect of
the grammar, it is my impression that a skilled RVic poet would break the monotony
of such a string -- unless it served some other poetic purpose, here to provide the
mirror-image -am to ma- and perhaps to evoke the Maruts.
The two forms of the perfect to √mā ‘measure’ in the 2nd hemistich, act.
mamátuḥ and med. mamā́te, share the same subj. and obj., with the 1st clause positive
and the second negated. Clearly the poet is playing with two different senses of √mā.
Gr, Ge, and Old neatly convert the word play to “messen” (‘measure’) versus
“ermessen” (‘gauge, grasp, realize’)(or so I understand them). My “measure” /
“measure up to” is a similar attempt whose purport is close to Kü (378) and WG:
“sich messen.”

### 09
The juxtaposition of adroghá- ‘undeceptive’ and satyá- ‘real, true’ is also
found in III.14.6 adroghéṇa vácasā satyám.
The standard tr. take pādas a and b together, with cd separate. I think it makes
more sense to take b with cd, as supplying the reason (Indra’s early soma drinking)
that he couldn’t be obstructed.
The standard tr. also take dyā́vaḥ as ‘days’, whereas the publ. tr. agrees with
Hoffmann (Injunk. 242) in tr. ‘heavens’. The problem, as I saw it then, was its cooccurrence with áhā likewise ‘days’, which led to awkward duplication. However, I
have now rethought this; the series of temporal expressions in this hemistich (áhā,
mā́sāḥ śaradaḥ) invites a temporal reading of dyā́vaḥ as well and makes “heavens”
seem out of place. In X.7.4. and 12.4 the two stems also co-occur and I tr. “daytimes
and days.” I would now substitute that tr. here as well.
varanta here and in 16b is formally ambiguous; it can be either an injunctive
or a subjunctive to the root aor. (see Hoffmann 239-40); Hoffmann takes it as a
subjunctive. It does not work terribly well as either one; in both passages I tr. it as a
preterital modal (“could obstruct”), but this interpr. is not firmly based in the
morphology. I sense that in this vs. and the next the poet is struggling to express a
verbal category that isn’t found in the Skt. verbal system, namely anteriority: modal
anteriority here, temporal anteriority in 10cd.

### 10  
As just noted, this vs. contains an apparent attempt to express anteriority:
the pluperfect ā́viveśīḥ seems to function like an English pluperfect (rather than the
standard Vedic plupf., a past tense to a presential perfect), to express an action that
happened before the action of the main verb, an interpr. more or less endorsed by Kü
(500).
22

### 11  
The standard tr. (save for Hoffmann, Injunk. 100, sim. to my interpr.) take
… sphigyā̀kṣā́m ávasthāḥ as “you covered/ clothed the earth with your hip,” but the
medial root pres. to √vas means ‘wear’ and takes an acc. of the garment rather than
an acc. of the entity being clothed (the construction found with vāsáya-). See the
similar ex. at VIII.4.8 and the comm. there, as well as the similar sentiment found in
I.173.6, where Indra wears Heaven and Earth as various accessories. The point of
course is to emphasize Indra’s vast size by making Earth (and Heaven) seem puny in
comparison. A similar point was made in vs. 7d, as well as in the immediately
preceding pāda 11c.

### 12  
yajñá- is the focus of this vs., with 5 occurrences of it or a transparent
deriv.
I take várdhanaḥ as the predicate of pāda b as well as pāda a (“the meal is also
your strengthener”); the standard tr. take b as an independent nominal clause with
priyáḥ as its predicate (“the meal is dear to you”). There is no way to tell for certain;
the absence of te in b gives some support to my interpr., but that support is
undeniably weak. The difference between the two tr. is also not large and has no
effects on the interpr. of the rest of the vs.
The second hemistich expresses the reciprocity of the sacrificial enterprise,
neatly shown by the balanced verb forms to the same root √av ‘aid, help’: impv. ava
(c), impf. āvat (d). But the reciprocity is curiously indirect: Indra is asked to aid the
sacrifice (rather than the sacrificer[s]), and the sacrifice aided Indra’s mace (not
Indra himself). In both clauses the direct object is an inanimate entity standing in for
an animate one, and in the second clause the subject is inanimate as well. Only Indra
is animate and capable of acting.
The nom. sg. pres. part. sán ‘being’ is not used concessively (“although being
…”) as it normally is. I think it may have the same force as it does in III.30.5, a
“definitional” one: Indra is by definition the one deserving of / derivationally
associated with the sacrifice, and therefore he is the one who should aid it.

### 13  
The reciprocity expressed by complementary verbal forms to √av found in
the 2nd half of the last vs. is here wrapped up in one word, the instr. ávasā, which I tr.
twice: I use the aid provided by the sacrifice (cf. 12d) to bring Indra here with his aid
(cf. 12c). In Ge’s tr. it is only Indra’s aid, but he allows for the other possibility in n.
13a. Re and WG also associate it only with Indra. Given the balanced expression of
12cd, I think it is meant to have a double reading.

### 14  
The standard tr. (see also Kü 186) take the two verbs vivéṣa and jajā́na as
parallel in the yád clause, with mā obj. of the first and possibly of the 2nd. I prefer to
take vivéṣa as the main clause verb, followed by the yád clause, whose (sole) verb is
jajā́na. vivéṣa then owes its accent to its initial position in the pāda. This interpr.
allows mā to take a more natural place, and it also saves us from positing a personal
object to vivéṣa, which otherwise is not so construed. (Note that Kü’s second tr. of
this passage [p. 502] is entirely different from his first: he distributes the clauses as I
23
do, but takes vivéṣa as first sg.) And what does it all mean? In my view the dhiṣáṇā
‘holy place’ is here the ritual ground, and she is credited with the “birth” of the poet
qua poet. After this birth, the poet can produce the praise of Indra that he is credited
with in pāda b, and this in turn leads to the good results in pāda c.
Pāda c contains two different subordinators, yátra ‘where, when’ and yáthā
‘so that’, with a single verb, subjunctive pīparat. Ge’s explan., that we simply have a
doubling of relatives, seems to me the best account; this is reflected, more or less, by
Old’s “wo (und) wie …,” though Old goes on to suggest a complex crossing of two
different constructions, which seems over-elaborate. In the publ. tr. I have rendered
yátra as a temporal adv. (“at that time”) with no subordinating force, since I think
yáthā expresses purpose and controls the subjunctive.
Rather than taking áṃhasaḥ as an ablative, with most others, I supply pārám
‘far shore’, a word related to pā́rya- in pāda b and to the verb pīpárat itself, and
found in this context elsewhere; cf. II.33.3 párṣi ṇaḥ pārám áṃhasaḥ. Here as well
áṃhasaḥ is then a gen. dependent on *pārám. Although it unfortunately involves a
breach of the pāda boundary, I also take nāvéva with the preceding pāda, because this
simile is almost entirely limited to passages containing verbal forms to √pṛ (I.46.7,
97.7, 99.1, V.4.9, 25.9, VIII.16.11, 18.17, IX.70.10). I also find it hard to imagine
Indra traveling by boat, even metaphorically.

### 15  
The agent noun séktar-, which forms an etymological figure with sisice,
presumably refers to a habitual or practiced ‘pourer’. So Tichy (-tar-stems, 159, fld.
by Kü 570). I have taken kóśam as the obj. in the simile rather than the frame, contra
the standard tr., though it could certainly go in the frame or in both without
appreciably affecting the sense.
The pf. form lacks retroflexion on its root initial, as does one of the other two
forms of this pf. in the RV (sisicuḥ II.24.4), as opposed to expected siṣicatuḥ in
VIII.33.13. I have no explanation for the lack of retroflexion.

### 16  
On varanta see comm. ad vs. 9.
Ge (fld. by WG) takes sákhibhyaḥ as a dat. of benefit, but I think it more
likely that it’s an ablative with agentival force. See Re, who simply tr. it as an agent.
The mythological episode is surely the Aṅgirases’ energetic help to Indra in the
breaking of Vala.
## 033
Viśvāmitra and the Rivers

### 02
índreṣite echoes víṣite in 1b, though they belong to two different roots: √iṣ
‘impel’ and √sā ‘tie’ respectively. The basis for calling the rivers índreṣite is given
in 6ab.
In c ūrmíbhiḥ can be construed with both participles, samārāṇé ‘clashing
together’ and pínvamāne ‘swelling’, between which it is positioned.
Although by my rule (“Vedic anyá- ‘another, the other' …”; Fs. Beekes 1997,
111-18), forms of anyá- found initial in the pāda should be indefinite (‘another’) not
24
definite as here, the anyó‘nyam (“the one … the other”) construction works
differently.

### 04
The reference of the rivers switches from dual to plural here and remains so
(save for two singulars in 10cd). There is no obvious reason for this change, though it
may reflect the fact that when the two rivers merge into each other they form a third.

### 05
Ge renders voc. ṛ́tāvarīḥ as ‘ihr Immerfliessenden’ without comment. But
this is simply the fem. stem to the possessive ṛtā́van- ‘possessing ṛtá-’, which he
elsewhere tr. “gesetzestreuen” (e.g., I.160.1, III.54.4) et sim.
In 5c avasyú- ‘seeking help’ answers the question posed by the rivers in 4c
kiṃyú- ‘seeking what?’ and in the same position in the vs.

### 06
In this vs. the rivers indirectly respond to Viśvāmitra’s command “Stop!”
(rámadhvam) in the previous vs. (5a), by asserting that they flow because of the
efforts of and at the pleasure of the gods: Indra dug their channels and, by smashing
Vṛtra, removed the barrier to their movement; Savitar led them and they flow at his
impulsion. Without explicitly refusing Viśvāmitra’s request, they make it plain that
they won’t comply by stopping.
The stem prasavá- ‘forward thrust, impulsion’ occurs here for the third time
in this hymn (2a, 4c, 6d; see also 11c) and is here associated with its etymological
divinity Savitar, the Impeller.

### 07
This is the central vs. of the hymn; in it Viśvāmitra practices the kind of
praise poetry that the rivers will ask him to reproduce in perpetuity in vs. 8, couched
in high formal style. In fact it can be seen as a variant of the opening of the great
Indra hymn I.32.1: índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocaṃ, yā́ni cakā́ra … Here we have the
gerundive pravā́cyam for prá vocam, vīryàm matching vīryā̀ṇi, índrasya as in I.32,
and the nominalization kárma for the pf. cakā́ra. The serpent, the mace, and the
signature verb √han are then found in the rest of b and in c, as they are in I.32.1. As
Watkins points out (Dragon, 309), here the verb √han has been displaced from its
standard formulaic role, with áhim as object, to an adjacent part of the myth. Watkins
also points out (86 n. 2) that there is “a veritable constellation of inherited words and
roots relating to poetry in this passage” (apropos vss. 7-8).
Note the etymological and phonetic figure ā́yan … áyanam in d.

### 08
Though med. juṣáte overwhelmingly means ‘enjoy’, the addition of the
preverb práti sometimes yields a transitive ‘favor in return, in response’ with
personal obj. See disc. ad IX.92.1.

### 10  
Although the two rivers refer to themselves collectively in the 1st pl. in ab,
the second hemistich consists of two contrasting statements in the 1st sg., each
presumably made by one of the rivers. This balanced contrast accounts for the accent
on the 2nd verb śaśvacaí.
25

### 11  
As in the immediately preceding hymn III.32.9-10, the poet here seems to
be trying to express verbal nuances that are not coded systematically in the Vedic
verbal system, in particular another variety of anteriority. Here the sequence of
moods is unusual: pres. optative in the subord. cl. (saṃtáreyuḥ), pres. subjunctive in
the main cl. (árṣāt). With the optative he seems to be aiming at a future perfect
(“will/would have crossed”) whose prospective action precedes that of the main verb,
namely the subjunctive referring to future time. Although I have not examined the
entire RV with this in mind, these experiments in anteriority seem confined to -- or at
least especially pronounced in -- the work of this poet. Note also that the poet makes
no attempt to generate an opt. to the pf. tatāra or to use the already existing pf. opt.
tuturyā́- (RV 5x). This provides further evidence, if more were needed, against
Dahl’s claim that the pf. opt. denotes “epistemic possibility and anterior aspect”
(Time, Tense and Aspect, p. 402 and in general pp. 392-402). If this were a stable
function of the pf. opt., surely Viśvāmitra would have availed himself of that
formation.
The vs. reprises much of the vocabulary from earlier in the hymn: iṣitá
índrajūtaḥ is an elaboration on índreṣita- in 2a; the oft-repeated prasavá- returns
again in the expression prasaváḥ sárgataktaḥ repeated from 4c.

### 12  
The prospective action expressed by the opt. saṃtáreyuḥ in 11a is
announced as completed by the aor. átāriṣuḥ … sám ‘they have crossed’, and the
poet urges the rivers to flow again with a sequence of imperatives, elaborating on the
subj. árṣāt in 11c.

### 13  
Hoffmann (Injunk, 93 n. 184) thinks the first impv. is concessive: “Mag
eure Welle an die śamyās schlagen, die Geschirre lasst frei” -- this may well be, but a
little hard to tell given our lack of teamster texts.
## 034
Indra

### 01
Gotō (1st class, 173-74) posits a separate root √di ‘destroy’ to account for 5
occurrences of dáyate ordinarily taken to mean ‘divide’ with the other occurrences of
dáyate. (The forms in question are found in III.34.1, IV.7.10, VI.6.5, 22.9, and
X.80.2.) He is followed by Lub and (at least in this passage and IV.7.10) WG. I see
no reason to split the present into two and posit a second root; ví dayate ‘divide into
pieces, fragment’ is simply another of the vivid images of destruction that RVic poets
gloried in.

### 02
I have tr. the nominal phrase asi … pūrvayā́vā, which comes out rather
stiffly in English (“you are the fore-traveler”), into a smoother verbal expression.
26

### 03
The first two pādas of this vs. are rhetorically parallel, consisting of an
etymological figure of augmented verb plus some part of the object (vṛtrám avṛṇot a,
māyínām amināt b), ending with a bv. formed with -nīti- ‘leading, control’.
This interpr. of vyàṃsa- follows Schmidt (KZ 78 [1963]); see EWA s.v.
áṃsa-.
In the second half-verse the subject takes an odd turn: after mention of Indra’s
iconic deed (besides the explicit mention of Vṛtra in a, see the echoes of the great
Indra hymn I.32 in b māyínām amināt [I.32.4 māyínām ámināḥ prótá māyā́ḥ] and c
áhan vyàṃsam [I.32.5 áhan … vyàṃsam]), there is an abrupt switch to Agni
phraseology. The same phrase uśádhag váneṣu “burning at will in the woods” (?) is
used of Agni in the Agni hymn III.6.7; cf. also uśádhag vánāni also of Agni in the
Agni hymn VII.7.2. The final pāda concerns the appearance of visible entities from
the night, which also better fits an Agni context. For this reason I see a syntactic
break in the middle of pāda c and take uśádhag váneṣu with d, contra the standard tr.
On the curious and problematic word uśádhak- see Scar (197-99) at length.
On dhénā- ‘milk-stream’ see comm. ad I.2.3 and Schmidt (Gs. Nyberg).
Schmidt there suggests that the referent in this pāda is the dawns emerging out of the
dark of the night. This occurs of course at the same time as the kindling of the ritual
fire and would account for the shift in diction to Agni phraseology. This image can
then be secondarily applied to Indra bringing the dawn cows out of the nocturnal
darkness of the Vala cave.

### 04
The phonetic echo of uśádhag (3c) in uśígbhiḥ (4b) reinforces both the
thematic connection between these two vss. -- Indra’s production of light -- and the
superimposition of Agni traits on Indra. As Schmidt (B+I 59) points out, the Uśijpriests, ordinarily associated with Agni, sometimes substitute for the Aṅgirases in the
Vala myth, but we should also note that it is esp. in Maṇḍala III that Agni is himself
identified as an Uśij (III.2.4; 3.7,8; 11.2, 27.10); note also the Uśij-priests attending
on him in III.2.9, 15.3.

### 05
The metaphorical use of viveśa ‘entered’ + an action (‘thrusts’) reminds me
of the somewhat slangy English “get into” for “become enthusiastic about /
energetically do (some action).”
The stem barháṇā- otherwise only appears as an adverbial instr. ‘mightily’,
and I am tempted to take it so here (as WG seem to do), rather than as the acc. pl.
assumed in the publ. tr. However, the sandhi context is against this interpr.; note
Old’s tart “Gewiss nicht barháṇā Adverb (Hiatus!).”
As Ge points out, the referent of fem. gen. pl. āsām must be dhíyaḥ ‘insights’.
For insights having bright color or hue, see the passages adduced by him (n. 5d):
I.143.7 śukrávarṇām dhíyam and III.39.2, where dhī́- wears silver garments. The
várṇam here plays off áryam várṇam in 9d.

### 06
Another etymological figure appears in c: vṛjánena vṛjinā́n “… the bent
ones [i.e., morally twisted or corrupt] with his band [i.e., his circle of helpers bent
27
around him],” both derived from √vṛj ‘twist’, though the semantic connection is
somewhat less obvious than in the etymological figures in 3ab.
There is another, thematic connection between vss. 3 and 6. As there, Indra
here achieves his victory first with his comrades (śárdha- 3a), then with his tricks
(that is, by “out-tricking” [amināt] with his shape-shifting abilities, várpa- 3b). In
such cases his overwhelming strength might be almost superfluous -- hence my
parenthetical “(though).” Note that abhíbhūti- (abhí √bhū) is a different lexical
realization of abhiṣṭí- in 4b (if to abhí √as, as is the common opinion; cf. EWA s.v.).

### 08
The intense concentration on the root √san ‘win’ noted in the publ. intro.
and the concomitant s-alliteration begin here.

### 09
The slightly awkward tr. “of many benefits” for purubhójasam, modifying
the cow in d, is meant to capture its etymological relationship with bhógam in c.
The contrastive pairing of dásyu- and ā́rya- is striking here.

### 10  
I do not see any semantic/functional difference between the imperfect
asanot in a and b and the insistent pf. sasā́na of vss. 8-9, though we might assume
that the poet made the choice apurpose. Both Ge and Re render the forms in the same
way (as do I); WG tr. sasā́na as ‘er hat erlangt’ and asanot as ‘gewann’. Although I
find the idea of rendering the two different grammatical forms differently appealing,
I’m not sure that losing the root connection is worth it.
## 035
Indra

### 01
The first pāda is somewhat oddly expressed: Indra is urged to mount the
horses yoked to the chariot, but not only is horseback riding very rare in the RV, but
no one is likely to mount a horse being used to pull a vehicle. This must be an
awkwardly expanded version of the usual “mount the chariot” (see 4c below).
The niyút- ‘team’ is generally associated with, indeed belongs to, Vāyu, who
is regularly called niyútvant- ‘possessing niyúts’. However, the word is sometimes
used in a reciprocal value: just as Vāyu and Indra drive to us with their niyúts, so do
our niyúts, the ‘teams’ of poetic thoughts, drive in return to the gods, in passages
where niyút- is parallel to words for ‘thought, hymn’, etc. Cf., e.g., I.134.2, 135.2,
VI.35.3, 47.14, VII.23.4, 90.1, X.26.1. It is therefore not nec., with Bloomfield
(RVReps ad loc.) to assume that “niyúto is for niyúdbhiḥ.”

### 02
The most natural reading of yáthā in c is as a subordinator in a purpose
clause (‘so that’) with the subjunctive ā́vahātaḥ in d, and this is how the standard tr.
take it. But there is a major stumbling block: the verb is unaccented. Old seems
willing to emend to an accented verb; Ge suggests that if the unaccented verb is
bothersome, assume an ellipsis in c. I have, in somewhat ad hoc fashion, taken yáthā
as a sort of simile marker with dravát. I am not entirely satisfied with this solution,
but it does more or less fit category 4) in Gr’s lemma yáthā, and I am quite reluctant
28
to put an unaccented verb into a subordinate clause. A similar phrase in the next
hymn, where yáthā marks a localized comparison, gives support to the interpr. here;
see III.36.6 prasaváṇ yáthā “like a shot” (tr. similarly by all standard tr.).

### 03
Medial nayasva is one of the relatively few middle forms to this pres. stem.
It is presumably used here because Indra is leading his own horses.
The crux in this vs. is the hapax cmpd. tapuṣpā́-. Gr glosses it ‘warmes
trinkend’, perhaps referring to the gharma drink; in this he is tentatively fld by
Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. tápuṣ-). But this -us-stem, tápus-, refers only to heat,
generally menacing scorching heat, and in any case the horses shouldn’t be drinking
the gharma drink (or probably any hot drink at all). The word is discussed by Scar
(305-6), who offers several possible interpr. The interpr. is made more difficult by
the uncertain grammatical identity of the form. It appears in sandhi as tapuṣpṓtém, is
taken by the Pp. as tapuḥ’pā́, and is generally analyzed as a dual, modifying the
bullish (horses) -- so Ge, Re, Scar, WG. However, Ge suggests in n. 3a that the form
could represent irregular sandhi for tapuṣpā(ḥ) utá (that is, a double application of
sandhi, first losing the final -s before vowel and then coalescing the vowels) and
therefore be a nom. sg., modifying Indra. I have adopted this solution; it doesn't
make much sense for the horses themselves to be doing the protecting, but Indra’s
protective role would fit with the impv. ava ‘help’ in the next pāda.
In the last pāda Indra is urged to eat the roasted grains (addhi dhānā́ḥ). The
same grains are prepared for the horses to eat in vs. 7: it seems somewhat surprising
that Indra and his horses receive the same fodder, as it were -- though calling the
horses Indra’s “comrades in joint revelry” in the next vs. (4b) suggests that they
consume the offered meal together. I also don't understand why the grains should be
“of the same appearance every day.” This phrase is essentially repeated in III.52.8,
which also contains 5 occurrences of dhānā- (or deriv.). Perhaps the point is that we
unfailingly make the same offering to Indra daily; he needn’t worry that we will
substitute inferior food.

### 04
The double etymological figure in pāda a is almost awkwardly heavy:
bráhmaṇā te brahmayújā yunajmi, an awkwardness necessarily reflected in the tr.

### 07
All the clauses in this vs. are nominal sentences with past participle as
predicate (stīrṇám, sutáḥ a, kṛtā́ḥ b, rātā́ḥ d). It is therefore misleading to tr. the last
as “are given” (versus “has been strewn,” etc.) as in the publ. tr. I would change to
“have been given.”

### 08
prajānán vidvā́n repeats 4d. The particular relevance of this phrase in either
vs. isn’t clear to me.

### 09
Kü (477-80) discusses the stem vāvaś- at length, rejecting the usual
connection with √vaś ‘desire, want’ and assigning it instead to √vāś ‘bellow’. (WG
follow this interpr. in our passage; Lub still assigns this form to √vaś.) Kü’s
29
morphological arguments -- lack of u-redupl. and of root ablaut -- are strong.
However, although I would concede that the form was derivationally original only to
√vāś, I would argue that once a stem vāvaś-, built to √vāś ‘bellow’, became
established, it was available to “migrate” to √vaś ‘desire’, especially because the
shortening of the root syllable in this metrically driven formation makes the form
look more like √vaś than √vāś. Although the meanings of the two roots might seem
so far apart that it would be hard to confuse one for the other, in fact the usual
context of √vāś forms narrows the semantic gap considerably: cattle bellow because
they want something. Kü allows for the possibility of semantic overlap as well.

### 10  
The occurrence of 2nd sg. act. pres. impv. píba and aor. impv. pāhi, both to
√pā ‘drink’, in a disjunctive vā construction should give us a good opportunity to
discern the functional distinction between the imperatives to these two tense-aspect
stems, esp. since, as far as I can see, both imperatives would fit either of the metrical
slots occupied. I have in fact tr. as if there is a functional difference: ‘drink’ versus
‘take a drink’, but I am not at all convinced that this is correct. Cf. the disc. of the
positional tendencies of píba ad III.32.1 and note that the same pāda opening índra
píba is found in the next hymn, III.36.2d. However, the same sequence of pres. and
aor. to √pā is found in III.36.3, so it may well be meaningful. (The standard tr.
render píba and pāhi identically here.)
I take práyatam in c with yajñám in d, contra the standard tr.
## 036
Indra

### 01
I confess to being somewhat puzzled by the first half vs., beginning with the
identity of the 2nd ps. subject. My assumption is that it is the priest setting out the
offering for Indra, not Indra himself, who is the 3rd ps. subject in cd. Pāda b (“being
united with help”) would then express the priest’s receiving of Indra’s help, though
the expression seems a little odd. The only similar passage I can find is V.42.8
távotíbhiḥ sácamānāḥ … “being accompanied by your help,” of the ritual patrons. It
might instead be possible to take b with cd, modifying Indra “being at one with his
(own) help.” The dvandva śáśvac-chaśvat in b matching suté-sute in c might weakly
support such an interpr. (contra the standard tr. as well as my publ. tr.).
Unfortunately the pres. yā́date is not well enough attested to allow us to determine its
usual subjects; of its 5 occurrences, 3 involve rivers uniting with the sea (as in 7a in
this hymn).
The other question in this half-verse is how exactly to construe sātáye dhāḥ.
The standard tr. take prábhṛtim as the subj. of an active infinitive sātáye -- perhaps
most clearly in Keydana (Infinitive, 317 n. 132) “Mach, dass diese Darbringung
siege,” taking Indra as the subject of dhāḥ (contra my identification of the priest as
subj.). But I doubt that the prábhṛti- itself is the agent of winning. My publ. tr. takes
sātáye as a passive, with (perhaps) Indra the implied agent: the offering is to be won
by him. This interpr. may be supported by 2c prayamyámānān práti ṣū́gṛbhāya
“Grasp at (the drinks) being offered,” with prá √yam expressing the same notion as
30
prá √bhṛ in 1a and Indra’s gaining control of them in both passages. It might also be
possible that sātáye is not being used as a real infinitive, and the phrase should be tr.
“set this offering here for (our) gain” -- that is, when Indra takes the offering set out
by the priest, there will be general gain for all of us but neither the offering nor Indra
is the agent of an infinitival use of this dative. (This seems to be close to the WG
interpr.)

### 02
vídānāḥ is another -- very clear -- example of a tense-stem participle serving
as predicate. Pace Gr (fld. by Re) it most likely belongs to ‘know’ rather than ‘find’.

### 03
Both the pres. and the aor. stems of √pā ‘drink’ occur here, as in III.35.10.
The situation is in fact even a bit more complex: as in III.35.10 both stems deploy
imperatives here, píba opening pāda a, pāhi in d, but the latter is also in a complex
diptych with the impf. ápibaḥ (“just as you drank [ápibaḥ] …, so [take a] drink
[pāhi] today …”). As in III.35.10 I have translated as if there is still an aspectual
difference between the two stems, but I am not certain this is the case.

### 04
Indra in pāda a is identified with a large drinking vessel, in this vs. that
emphasizes his size and capacity.
The b pāda begins and ends with etymologically related words: ugrám (adj.)
and ójaḥ (noun), though each is part of a different NP.
As Kü demonstrates (503-6), the pf. of √vyac is always presential.

### 05
The vs. begins with the two words that began the first two pādas of the last
vs.: 4ab mahā́m̐…, ugráṃ; 5a mahā́m̐ugró.
Ge (/WG, Scar [209]) take samā́cakre in b as transitive and supply ‘cows’ as
object, from c. Although it is true that the middle pf. of √kṛ is generally transitive, in
this context, parallel to intrans. vāvṛdhe in pāda a, a nonce passive value can be
imagined. In fact see (in this same maṇḍala) III.1.8 vṛ́ṣā yátra vāvr̥dhé kā́vyena
“where the bull has grown strong through our poetic craft,” of which this pāda seems
to be a variant, with the vāvṛdhe there anticipated in our previous pāda. Cf. Re “il
s’est empli … de pourvoir-poétique,” also intransitive. (Ge suggests this possibility
in his n. 5b.)
Scar (209-10) makes heavier weather of vājadā́(ḥ) then seems necessary. He
points out that the cows shouldn’t be giving prizes, which is logically true enough,
but surely the point is that Indra is so generous that even the prizes he gives, the
cows, give prizes of their own (the trickle-down gift economy). Their gifts are
presumably, on the one hand, milk products and, on the other, new calves.
### 06-08
The next three vss. ring changes on the theme of large bodies of water
and large containers of soma.

### 06
On prasaváṃ yáthā see disc. of dravád yáthā ad III.35.2.
31
In b the problem is the simile rathyèva -- more precisely what the nominal in
that sequence represents. The Pp. resolves it, not surprisingly, as rathyā̀. Gr takes this
as an instr. to rathī́- ‘charioteer’; Ge also takes it as an instr. but to a stem rathyā̀-
‘Fahrstrasse’ (see Old, ZDMG 61 [1907] 831-32 = Kl.Sch.262-63). Old himself (so
apparently also Re) favors a nom. pl. rathyàḥ with double application of sandhi. This
is possible (see similar possible situation in III.35.3), but I wonder if it does not
reflect the du. rathyā̀it appears to be. This hemistich reads like a brief reprise of
Viśvāmitra and the rivers (III.33). For one thing, the past tenses (impf. áyan a, pf.
jagmuḥ b) don’t make much sense if the point of the half-vs. is simply to serve as the
standard of comparison for Indra’s width (pāda c), whereas the past tense does work
in a brief re-narration of the situation in III.33. The word prasavá- here also echoes
III.33, which contains 4 occurrences of that stem. And III.33.2 contains an undoubted
example of the dual rathyā̀also marked as a simile in a similar context: áchā
samudráṃ rathyèva yāthaḥ “you two drive like two charioteers to the sea,” referring
to the two rivers, the Vipāś and the Śutudrī. The mixture of numbers, with pl. rivers
in the frame and du. charioteers in the simile, is not surprising; even in III.33 the dual
reference to these rivers soon gives way to plural. This mythic snatch having been
told, the sea, so filled, is available to be compared, unfavorably, to Indra. Kü (77, 156,
fld. by WG) also takes it as du, but as referring to two chariot horses. If the form is
accepted as a dual here, it will have to be detached from rathyèva in VII.95.1, which
see comm. ad loc.

### 07
The standard tr. take pāda a as a simile, with the rivers compared to the
priests of cd. I instead take the rivers as referring to the soma-purifying waters and
consider b the predicate to a, with the pres. part. bhárantaḥ substituting for the main
verb. At least in the transmitted text their simile would be unmarked, though most
interpreters manipulate the text to produce a marker. Bl (RRs ad loc., referring to an
earlier art. of his) suggests emending to samudré ná as in the otherwise identical
pāda VI.19.5, a suggestion seemingly endorsed by Old and fld. by WG. However, the
instr. ūtíbhiḥ with yā́damānaḥ in 1b supports the instr. reading of samudréṇa here,
and in 4 of its 5 occurrences yā́damāna- is construed with an instr. This suggests that
VI.19.5 has altered the formula, rather than vice versa. Ge follows a different path to
a simile marker, haplology of samudréṇa *ná. Since the text makes sense as is, I see
no reason to change it.
The verse contains two parallel morphological word-plays: bhárantaḥ …
bharítraiḥ and punanti … pavítraiḥ, each containing a neuter -tra- instrument noun.
The latter, pavítra- lit. ‘instrument for purifying’, is of course very well attested in
the RV, referring to the soma-purifying filters, but bharítra- is a hapax, obviously
generated to match pavítra-, including the -i-liaison vowel appropriate only to the seṭ
root √pū, not to aniṭ √bhṛ. It is tr. ‘arm’ by all (going back to the Naigh.), but
milking with the arms doesn’t make sense in either life or metaphor. I think it means
rather ‘hand’ and participates in a different word-play within its pāda: an ‘instrument
for carrying’ can easily be a hand, and so it is synonymous with hásta- ‘hand’ found
in the immediately preceding word hastín- ‘hand-ed’. There is a further implied
32
verbal twist, at least with my interpr. of ab: the rivers don't have hands but carry
anyway, while the priests do have hands but use their carrying appendages for
something else. I’m afraid the publ. tr. needed to be quite heavy-handed to convey
the deftness of this little play.

### 08
On kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987 (Ged. Cowgill).
As Ge also comments, the chronological sequence of pāda d seems reversed,
assuming (as I generally do) that the perfect participle regularly expresses
anteriority: Indra drank the soma before smashing Vṛtra. The primary VP here,
avṛṇīta sómam is found in the great Indra hymn I.32.3, but with a different opening
(vṛṣāyámāṇaḥ).

### 09
Most tr. take Indra as the implied obj. of mā́kiḥ … pári ṣṭhāt, thus displacing
etát into an adverbial role (Ge/WG ‘dabei’). This is possible, but I take it as
anticipating dátram in c.
On the form of dátra- see comm. ad IV.17.6.
### 09-10
Note that the vocabulary of the beginning of the hymn is being turned
around reciprocally at the end: bhara (9a) and prá yandhi (9d, 10a) are imperatives
addressed to Indra, urging him to bring/offer things to us, whereas in 1a prábhṛtim
(at least in my interpr.) and 2c prayamyámānān the same lexical expressions refer to
things we offer to Indra. Other ring compositional echoes are the dhāḥ + datival
infinitive (1a sātáye dhāḥ and 10c jīváse dhāḥ) and the stem śáśvat- (1b, 10d).
## 037
Indra
I have endeavored to preserve in tr. the consistent position of índra- in each
vs., for which see the publ. intro. Other elements have had to be juggled; as is often
the case, it is harder to honor the half-verse division in Gāyatrī than in trimeter.

### 01
On the retroflex in pṛtanāṣā́hya- see comm. ad IX.88.7.
### 03-04
As Ge also suggests, Indra’s names (nā́māni) in vs. 3 form a
complementary pair with his hundred dhā́man- ‘forms, embodiments’ in 4.

### 05
Given vā́jeṣu beginning vs. 6, vā́jasātaye would have better been tr. “to win
prizes.”

### 06
And here a plural “when the prizes (are set)” would be more accurate.

### 07
The vs. contains 5 locatives, 4 of them plural, and so the issue -- though not
a particularly pressing one -- is to sort out what goes with what. I have taken them
pāda by pāda. Different tr. distribute them slightly differently.

### 09
On the indriyā́ṇi dispersed among the five peoples, see Proferes (2007: 65).

### 10  
Note the alliteration in pāda b: dyumnáṃ dadhiṣva duṣṭáram.
The root √tṝ contributes two forms here: duṣṭáram (b) and úd … tirāmasi. It
is difficult to convey their root connection in Engl.
## 038
Indra
In addition to the usual tr., it is worth consulting Re’s alternative tr. in his
Hymnes spéculatifs (29-31 + nn.), in addition to his later one in EVP XVII.
My interpr. both in detail and in overall outline differs significantly from
others, but it is internally consistent and attempts to fit the many puzzling details into
an overall schema. That this sometimes requires making interpretive leaps is a price
I’m willing to pay. I lay out and support my choices in the comments on individual
vss., though I do not chart every deviation from the various other tr. and defend them
against those tr.

### 01
The 1st sg. pf. dīdhayā is taken by all as a straight indicative; the Pp. reads
dīdhaya with short final vowel. My tr. “I ponder” reflects this analysis (Kü [257-60]
having demonstrated that the indic. pf. of this root is always presential). However, I
now wonder if this form could be a subjunctive with the unextended 1st sg. subj.
ending -ā. Although lengthened forms of the indic. pf. ending -a do exist (e.g., védā
9x), they are relatively uncommon. And a subjunctive “I shall ponder …” would
open this speculative hymn nicely.
The standard tr. take priyā́ṇi … párāṇi as coreferential (e.g., Old “die fernsten,
lieben (Dinge, Ereignisse)”). I prefer to take the two as contrastive, the nearby
familiar things dear to the poet and far-away matters almost beyond his ken -- with
the intensive (i.e., frequentative) part. mármṛśat conveying the restless activity of his
mind. Realizing that he needs the steadying hand of poetic tradition to help control
his racing but fertile thoughts, in d he expresses his desire for poets belonging to that
tradition to give a full account of what he is seeing -- though he does not deny that he
himself has wisdom.

### 02
As I see the movement of the verse, in pāda a the poet sets himself to
question the older generations of poets about their creative activity. Pāda b concerns
this activity in the past and identifies mánas- ‘mind’ as the foundation (√dhṛ) for the
creative act. (I might now alter the tr. to make this clearer, to “making their minds
the foundation.”) In cd we turn to the present time and to the poet (te) (who
addressed himself in a); the praṇī̀- in c (on which see further below) are the products
or models derived from the creative activity in b. In d it is made clear that these
precedents, actively sought by the current poet’s mind, rest on the dhárman-
‘foundation’ not only of the mental activity of the former poets but also of his own
mind.
The first technical issue in this vs. is whether pṛcha + ACC. here means “ask X”
or “ask about X” (in German terms “fragen” vs. “fragen nach”); both uses of the
accusative are possible with √pṛch. Related to this question is what jánimā means in
34
this context: ‘births’, ‘generations’, ‘races’? With Ge and Klein (DGRV I.453-54), I
take jánimā kavīnā́m to be the personages addressed, not (with Old, Re, Hoffmann
[Inj. 225], Scar [276, 288], WG) the topic of the question. The poet is widening his
range of interlocutors from the current poets (1d) to the long series of generations,
back to the poets who themselves participated in the creation (2b).
With all modern tr./comm, I take takṣata as a med. 3rd pl. middle to the
athematic present to √takṣ, rather than a 2nd pl. act. of the thematic stem, as Gr
classifies it. I have added the self-beneficial “for themselves” to the tr. because,
though the root √takṣ is abundantly attested, this appears to be the only middle form
in the RV. In keeping with my larger interpr. of the hymn as concerning two
creations, the second of which was the product of poets conjuring up the
differentiated cosmos by their verbal powers, I think the medial takṣata here signals
the intimate engagement of the poets in the act of creation and the interpenetration of
the things created and the creators themselves. Note also that our current poet lays
some claim to this primal act by calling himself in 1a a táṣṭar- ‘craftsman, fashioner’,
the agent noun to the root √takṣ, which supplies the verb of creation in 2b.
The root-noun cmpd. praṇī́- is found only here in the RV, but the lexeme prá
√nī, lit. ‘lead forth’, is very common as a verb form and in other cmpds. The word
here has received a not particularly instructive variety of renderings, which I will not
repeat. I think it means ‘precedent’ -- that is, the work of creation engaged in by the
kavis of old provides the model for the current poet. This seems a reasonable
semantic extension of ‘leading forth’. The precedents keep “growing stronger /
increasing” both because the elements of creation keep proliferating and because the
current poet becomes more familiar with them and adept at employing them.
In the last pāda these precedents that the poet has sought with his mind take
up their position in his mind, ready to serve for his own creative endeavors. The
older generations of poets were called “firm in mind, holding their minds firm” (or,
see above, “making their minds the foundation”)(manodhṛ́t-) in b; it is fitting that
their models, which he “sought with his mind” (mánovāta-), should now in turn take
up their position on his own mind’s support (dhármaṇi). On the basis of the cmpd.
manodhṛ́t- in b I supply ‘mind’ as the possessor of dhárman-. Most tr. (Ge, Re
[twice], Hoffmann [Inj. 225], Klein DGRV I.453-54) interpr. the loc. dhármaṇi as a
rather vague adverbial (Ge, Hoff “in rechter Weise,” sim. Klein). I think it needs to
be interpr. in full locatival sense; Scar (276) and WG in separate ways do give it a
locatival interpr. but their tr. do not reflect its connection with manodhṛ́t- in b.

### 03
Before addressing the question of what pādas a and b have to do with each
other thematically, we must first consider the small technical issue of the placement
of utá at the beginning of pāda b. Since pāda a contains a participle (dádhānāḥ) and
pāda b a main verb (sám añjan), it is unlikely that utá is conjoining the two pādas.
Instead, with Klein (DGRV I.396-97), I think it is probably conjoining this hemistich
with the preceding vs., with utá displaced to the beginning of pāda b after the
participial phrase in a. This is very reminiscent of III.31.21, in this same Indra series,
35
where the same explanation accounts for a rightward displacment of ca into the
beginning of the second pāda of the clause.
As indicated in the publ. intro., I think this vs. describes the role of the poets
in the second creation. It fleshes out the laconic takṣata dyā́m “They crafted heaven”
in 2b. But what are they depositing in pāda a, and why? The first question can be
restated as -- what should be supplied with gúhyā? The most common nouns
appearing with that adjective are nā́man- ‘name’ and padá- ‘traces, track’; either of
these could work here because both can be used of the esoteric verbal production of
the poets. “Secret names” would refer to the act of creation that involves dividing
and naming the inchoate mass of material pre-creation; “secret traces” would refer to
the esoteric poetry more generally. Here they seem to have pooled and deployed
these secret elements, to use in their poetic ornamentation -- that is, in their detailed
elaboration -- of the originally undifferentiated matter of the two worlds. Note that
the participle is middle: it is their own names/traces that are in play.
In both Hymnes spéc. (1956) and EVP XVII (1969) Re tr. sám añjan as “ont
consacré,” as an allusion to royal unction. The dat. kṣatrā́ya ‘for dominion’ makes
this a tempting idea, though sám √añj is not a standard technical term in the royal
consecration. I certainly think this is a secondary meaning of this pāda, but in
keeping with the rest of the hymn, I think the primary meaning must be creation
through poetic elaboration. Since royal consecration does in fact make the person in
question a new entity, the king, it can be conceptualized as a creation as well.
The 2nd half-verse is more clearly concerned with creation. The root √mā
‘measure’ is of course regularly used in this connection, and as I said in the publ.
intro., the separation of the two worlds in d is a standard cosmogonic image. Ge’s
interpr. of c is rather aberrant and in part dependent on a passage in the PB, and his
interpr. has not become the standard. Because of the accent on mamiré, I have
supplied ‘when’ with the first half of pāda c, though the accent may simply result
from the adjacency of the two verbs mamiré and yemúḥ.
The verb in d, antáḥ … dhuḥ, is not a standard expression for ‘separate’ and
in fact might be expected to mean ‘place between’. WG tr. in that way, supplying
“Luftraum” (antárikṣa-): “Zwischen die beiden … (Welten) setzten sie (den
Luftraum) …” This is a clever solution and it may be the original sense of the lexeme,
which, however, I believe has evolved to mean, without an object, ‘place apart’, that
is, separate by putting something in between.
I take dhā́yase as belonging to √dhā ‘suckle, nourish’, like the rest of the
occurrences of this -as-stem. Re (EVP), Kü (395), and WG all follow this root
assignment, but Ge and Re (Hymnes spéc.) take it to √dhā ‘place’: “damit sie (die
Herrschaft) ausüben” and “pour qu’ils se tiennent stables,” respectively. The
separation of the two worlds is often presented as a boon for humans, so the ‘nourish’
interpr. seems more fitting, and the usual analysis of dhā́yas- supports it.

### 04
As noted in the publ. intro., I believe that this vs. turns to the first creation,
before the poets’ intervention that was presented in vss. 2-3. It is appropriate that the
entities described here are unidentified, for this is the time before the poets brought
36
their verbal skills to bear. The central figure in this vs. is introduced merely by an
acc. participle (ātíṣṭhantam ‘mounting’). The form makes it clear that the referent is
masculine and singular, but no other information is given; there is not even a
pronoun. Likewise the subj. of the verb pári … abhūṣan ‘they tended’ is given only
as víśve ‘all’. Again we know the gender (masc.) and the number (pl.), but not the
identity: poets (from vs. 2)? gods (the frequent default referent of víśve)? Rather than
suggesting referents for these two entities as the standard tr. do, I think we should
accept that the lack of referential clues is deliberate.
Certainly it continues through the verse, though some details accumulate. In b
the ‘mounting’ entity of pāda a is now presumably the subject. He wears beauties
(śríyo vásānaḥ) and is self-luminous (svárociḥ); these descriptions begin to narrow
the field, but not enough. (The only other occurrence of svároci- modifies the Maruts,
who are not likely to be in question here. And a number of different gods acquire śrī́-
.) In c he is identified as both a bull (or bullish one, vṛ́ṣan-) and a lord (ásura-),
neither particularly diagnostic, and the pāda claims to provide us with his “great
name” (mahát … nā́ma). Indeed d seems at first to give us that name: viśvárūpaḥ.
But the joke is on us, for not only is viśvárūpa- not a name but an epithet, but its
literal meaning tells us that the lack of a single identifiable referent in this verse is
the point. The word means “having all forms,” and so the entity we’ve been chasing
through the vs. is in fact protean and cannot be pinned down to a single identity.
He/it is creation before differentiation. (For a similar figure in a similarly mystical
hymn in this maṇḍala, see III.56.3, where the androgynous figure is also called both a
bull and viśvárūpa.)
The final pāda forms a tight ring with the first, in that the verb ā́√sthā returns,
and this time we get some indication of what he is mounting. But even this further
specification falls short: it is simply amṛ́tāni, a neut. pl. adjective with multiple
possible referents. This repetition makes the unfolding creation seem somewhat
circular, but also incremental, in that new details accumulate, if slowly. But what
seems to me an important clue has generally been ignored in the standard interpr. I
find it impossible to believe that the repetition of ā́√sthā was not deliberate, but all
the standard tr. (save in part for Re, Hymnes spéc, though he fell in line in EVP)
render the two occurrences quite differently: the first literally (‘mount’), but the
second with the idiomatic meaning ‘assume’, with Ge and WG supplying ‘names’
with the adj. ‘immortal’ (Ge “… hat er unsterbliche (Namen) angenommen”). There
are two obvious things wrong with this interpr: 1) the lexeme ā́√sthā is extremely
common and I know of no passage where it means ‘assume’; 2) translating it thus
completely ignores the intra-vs. repetition, which at least to me is extraordinarily
salient: the first word of the vs. is ā́tiṣṭḥantam, the last tasthau. I therefore assume
that the pf. in d also means ‘mount’ and that the referent of the pl. ‘immortal’ is
deliberately unspecified, but is something one could stand on -- in this case probably
‘worlds’ or some kind of solid ‘things’. Cf. VIII.52.7 (Vālakh.) ā́tasthāv amṛ́taṃ diví
“[it] has mounted to the immortal (world?) in heaven” and (with adhí √sthā) I.35.6
amṛ́tā́dhi tasthuḥ “they have taken their place on his immortal (foundations?).” The
specification of a place to stand on enlarges the cosmic picture. Consider also 9c
37
below with tasthúṣo vírūpā “of him surmounting the various forms,” with √sthā and
-rūpa-.

### 05
The unidentified creature in vs. 4, finally identified as a bull or as bullish
(vṛ́ṣan- 4c), returns in this vs., with a slightly different ‘bull’ designation (vṛṣabhá-).
Here it is depicted as androgynous: though masc. in gender and called a bull, it gives
birth (ásūta). Androgyny is a powerful signal of the lack of differentiation I have
been discussing, since perhaps the fundamental, universal binary contrast is male :
female.
The bull’s act of birth results in the desired differentiation that characterizes
creation. This is expressed both by ‘many’ (pūrvī́ḥ) in b and, indirectly, by the
address to the two sons of heaven (dívo napātā) in cd. These two then seem to
establish control over what has been created in the earliest time (pradívaḥ ‘from
olden days’) and therefore implicitly preside over time.
I would now be inclined to interpr. pāda b as an expression of possession,
“His are these many proliferating riches.” Cf. VI.3.3, also IV.23.8. However, the
context is not definitive.
I interpr. and construe vidáthasya in c differently from most, who take it with
dhībhíḥ, with the interpr. further complicated by variant renderings of vidátha- (Ge
“im Geiste der Weisheit”; Re [EVP] “grâce aux visions-poétiques de la cérémonie”;
WG “mit den Einsichten der (Beute-)Verteilung”). None of these makes a lot of
sense to me, and therefore, despite the adjacency of vidáthasya and dhībhíḥ, I
construe the former instead with kṣatrám “dominion of/over the (cosmic) division.”
On this sense of vidátha- see comm. ad VIII.39.1: though the word generally refers
to the ceremonial distribution of wealth and then to the ceremony where this happens,
it can also refer to other types of division, including the parts of the cosmos. It may
be somewhat more daring to assume that kṣatrá- can take a genitive of what is ruled
over -- I do not now have parallels -- but keep in mind that the root √kṣā from which
kṣatrá- is derived regularly takes such a genitive. If my interpr. is correct, the
vidátha- refers to the cosmic divisions produced by the 1st creation.
As noted in the publ. intro., a number of referents have been suggested for the
two sons of heaven, and as I also said there, I think this is missing the point. We
remain in the realm of the 1st creation where entities may begin to proliferate but they
are still not named. I suggested there that the two may be the two world halves (note
that kṣatrá- was associated with them in vs. 3b and see 8c below), but it is also quite
possible that the focus should be on the “two,” not on who exactly the two are: the
first splitting of the primal unity.

### 06
The first half of vs. 6 simply expands on vs. 5. The same two kings have as
their sphere of activity an increasing number (“three, many, all” trī́ṇi … purū́ṇi …
víśvāni) of “seats,” that is (in my opinion), separated places, in the cosmic division
(vidáthe) also repeated from vs. 5. Note that the same verb pári √bhūṣ ‘tend to’
returns from 4a, where ‘all’ was the subject, not the object as here.
38
In the 2nd hemistich the poet, who has been absent since vs. 2, returns, with his
mind (mánasā), and sees the whole of creation in detail (or so I surmise), down to the
wind-haired Gandharvas -- all subject to the commandment of the two kings.

### 07
This vs. summarizes both creations. The first is dealt with glancingly in the
first pāda. I take the neut. prn. tád ‘this’ as a reference to the not-yet-differentiated
proto-creation, which belonged to and arose from the androgynous bovine of 5a, here
explicitly identified first as masculine (asya: since this pronoun is unaccented, it does
not modify what follows but functions as an autonomous pronoun), then as both bull
(vṛṣabhásya, as in 5a) and milk-cow (dhenóḥ). This is the first appearance of any
explicit feminine principle in this hymn.
The rest of the vs. concerns the second creation, with the original unitary tád
divided and fitted out with names and forms. Note the return of the creation verb
√mā ‘measure’, with ā́… mamire (b) and ní … mamire (d) echoing sám … mamire
in 3c. The curious phrase sákmyaṃ góḥ has caused some puzzlement among interpr.
Although by formation the hapax sákmya- appears to be a neut. abstract derived from
√sac ‘accompany’, the standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take the phrase as the equivalent of
an animate creature, remarking that the companion of the cow must be the bull. But
this not only ignores the abstract nature of sákmya- but also assumes that góḥ here
refers narrowly to a female bovine, though the stem is regularly used as a cover term
for bovines of both sexes. I take the phrase as meaning “the fellowship of the cow”
(or better, though more awkwardly, “the fellowship of the bovine”) as a poetic
description of what was depicted in pāda a, the joint activity of the bull-and-cow and
its product. This undifferentiated creation is then measured out into individual parts
and equipped with names. The subject of ā́… mamire in b is not identified, but I
assume it is the same māyínaḥ as the subject of ní … mamire in d, whom I take to be
the age-old poets we met in vss. 2-3.
Just as pāda b refers to the individual names, so does d refer to forms: the
classical pairing of name-and-form (nāmarūpa) is thus distributed across the vs., as
Ge already pointed out (n. 7b). I take asmin here as referring to the creation (it),
rather than to a putative ‘him’ (as most tr. do). In the course of their creative activity
the poets assume various powers (pāda c) to enable their individualizing work.

### 08
As was indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. is in certain ways a rephrasing
of vs. 7, but updated, as it were, to the present day. The vs. begins exactly as vs. 7
did: tád ín nv àsya, followed by a genitive specifying the identity of the asya
(vṛṣábhasya 7a, savitúḥ 8a), a signal that vs. 8 is a second version of the immediately
preceding vs. Hence, by my interpr., savitár- is the equivalent of the original creator,
the bull-cow of 5a and 7a. I therefore do not think that this refers to the god Savitar,
but is rather to be taken in its literal sense as “the impeller.” Or rather, since b =
VII.38.1b (a Savitar vs.), the poet is identifying Savitar in his most generic sense
with the Ur-creator, the one who “set in motion / impelled” the creation.
The poet disclaims any part in that original creation (nákir me), and the firmly
fixed golden emblem of b seems to me to represent the static, undifferentiated result
39
of the first creation. It reminds us of the hiraṇyagarbha of X.121, another image of
undifferentiated creation.
But in cd (at least in my view -- the interpretations vary quite a lot) the poet
identifies himself with the poets of old (of 7bcd). In c most tr. supply a verb, with the
ródasī phrase as its object. I think, by contrast, that this is a nominal sentence with
ródasī as subject. The two world-halves are credited with a role in the second
creation, the same role they may play in 5cd (see comm. there): they set everything
in motion. But they do so through the stimulus of a suṣtutí-, a ‘good praise-hymn’,
and I take this praise-hymn to be the product of the 1st ps. poet, who disavowed a role
in the first creation in 8a, but takes credit for contributing to the second creation in 8c.
The puzzling pāda to me is d, and my publ. tr. is opaque even to me. I have
now rethought it and will propose here a modified tr. and interpr. First, I suggest
returning to Gr’s grammatical analysis of vavre as a 1st sg., not a 3rd sg. (as all
subsequent tr. have taken it, incl. my publ. tr.). I take the pāda now as the current
poet’s boast, asserting his place in the poetic lineage. The lexeme ápi √vṛ means
‘swaddle, cover over’, as the simile of the woman and her children (one reading of
jánimāni here) makes clear. But such a meaning can both be protective and
somewhat arrogant or threatening. To understand the sense of the frame here, we
need to go back to 2a, where the tremulous poet asked the previous generations
(jánimā) of poets about their creative acts. I think these same poetic generations are
what’s referred to here, but here our newly confident poet “covers” them -- on the
one hand, in a protective sense, like the young woman swaddling her children. He
protects their legacy by continuing it. But ‘cover over’ can also mean ‘conceal’, and
in this sense the poet boasts that he will (or has?) become more skilled than they and
cover up their achievements with his own. I would therefore retranslate the pāda as
“I have covered over / swaddled the (poetic) generations like a young woman her
children.”

### 09
As discussed in the publ. intro., I take this vs. as showing both contributors
to the second creation -- the two (world-halves) from 8c and the masters of artifice
(mayínaḥ) from 7d -- bearing witness to our poet’s new skill. In the first half of the
verse the two (world-halves) begin by bringing to success the first creation of “the
age-old great one” (pratnásya … maháḥ). I supply the equivalent of tád in pāda a,
picked up by yád at the end of the pāda and further specified by daívī svastíḥ
beginning b. The standard tr. instead take a and b as separate clauses, with daívī
svastíḥ somewhat loosely construed with b.
In c the sequence gopā́jihvasya is variously interpr. Ge (/WG), Re (Hymnes
spéc.), and at least partially Old read it as two words, the first nom. gopā́, the 2nd
emended to jīvásya (Ge, WG) or jagatas (Re; he gives no accent, but it should be
jágatas) -- attaching pāda c to b and taking d as a separate clause. I see no reason in
this case to go against the Pp, which considers the form a cmpd, much less to emend
the text so severely. Instead I take the two apparent genitives in c (gopā́jihvasya
tasthúṣaḥ) as referring to the current poet: he boasts that his tongue is a herdsman --
that is, it marshals words -- and that he surmounts the various forms (vírūpā) -- that
40
is, he has (verbal) control over the differentiated forms of the second creation. The
poet has achieved his vocation. For the tongue, see vs. 3 of the following hymn
(III.39.3b), where the poem, the hymnic vision, “mounts the tip of (the poet’s)
tongue.” A form of the root √sthā is also found in the same pāda.
## 039
Indra
Though nowhere near as obscure as the previous hymn, the first three vss. of
this one also portray poetic craft and, especially, poetic inspiration.
Morphological parallelism and lexical repetitions dominate the rest of the
hymn.

### 01
√vañc means ‘move crookedly, meander’, but encompasses a number of
different types of such motion, including circular or wave-like motion. Here I think it
refers, rather charmingly, to a bending, curling movement made in order to come out
of a small opening. (English ‘scrunch’ might be accurate, but is also inelegant.) The
poet’s heart is thus configured as a smallish container from which his thought must
gracefully exit -- a characteristically female gesture perhaps. I very much doubt that
she is galloping, à la WG.
The publ. tr. should be altered to “when being recited” to reflect the present
participle and to match the identical phrase in 2b.

### 02
Ge (/WG), Scar (142) take diváḥ as temporal (“noch vor Tag geboren”).
This is possible and would fit with the jā́gṛviḥ ‘wakeful’ and, perhaps, with the
silvery garments of c (if they refer to dawn). Nonetheless, with Re (see also Ge’s n.
2a, where he suggests that the spatial interpr. is better), I take it as spatial “from
heaven.” The vs. contrasts the immediate presence of the dhī́(séyám asmé “this one
right here in us”) with her origin as a product of age-old divine and ancestral
inspiration (sanajā́pítryā), and diváś cid … pūrvyā́seems to me to participate in this
balanced contrast.

### 03
The first pāda of this vs. is a definitional truism: the cmpd. serving as
subject, yama-sū́ḥ ‘twin-bearing’, is split into its component parts in the VP, yamā́…
asūta ‘bore twins’. The question is who are the twins. Given the context, I find Old’s
suggestion (fld. by Re) that this is a metaphor for speech production and that the
twins are, perhaps, the verse (ṛ́c-) and sāman more plausible than Ge’s interpr. (flg.
Sāy.) that the twins are the Aśvins and the birth-giver is Uṣas. I take the mother to be
the dhī́- who was the subject of the previous vs.; note that dhī́ḥ is the last word of vs.
2.
Since I take the same noun to be subject of b, pátat emerges as a problem,
since it is presumably a neut. nom./acc. act. participle but qualifies the action of the
proposed fem. subj. Given the tendency for neut. NA forms to be used adverbially, I
so interpr. it here (as Re also seems to: “en volant”), rather than (with Ge [/WG])
introducing neut. mánaḥ ‘mind’ here for it to modify.
41
This hemistich echoes some of the vocabulary and themes found in the
previous hymn. asūta in pāda a matches ásūta in III.38.5a, and note that the apparent
product of this birth is also a dual in III.38.5c. As noted ad III.38.9c, both the tongue
and the mounting in that pāda are found in our 3b. I do not think the same events and
entities are referred to in these passages, but they do seem to have a similar view of
the relation between poetic speech and creation.
The standard tr. interpr. c as meaning that the pair just born associate with
some kind of generic beauty (Ge “Schönheit,” Re “les formes-de-la-beauté”), but
vápūṃṣi are esp. associated with Agni in Maṇḍala III, where he assumes or bears
these wondrous forms (cf., e.g., III.1.8, 18.5, 55.9, 57.3; though admittedly he is not
the only entity that has such forms). I think the vápūṃṣi of Agni are at issue here, and
the pair -- verse and sāman -- accompany them as the ritual speech being recited
when the ritual fire is blazing.
Unfortunately the verse-and-sāman interpr. does not fit as well in pāda d,
where we might wish the dual “smashers of darkness” to be endowed with light one
way or another. The only other occurrence of this stem modifies Agni, and Agni is
several times subj. of the phrase támaḥ √han (V.14.4, VIII.43.34). This phrase once
has a dual subj. (VI.72.1 víśvā támāṃsy ahatam), but the subj. there is Indra and
Soma, whom we surely do not want to introduce here. It is worth noting that the
Aśvins, the subjects here acdg. to Ge et al., are not found as subj. of this expression.
Since I think there is good support for the verse-and-sāman interpr. in the rest of the
vs., I would argue that these forms of ritual speech are called smashers of darkness
because of their role in the dawn sacrifice.

### 04
The next part of the hymn seems driven by the rhetoric of morphology, both
parallelisms and contrasts. In this vs. note the heavy -i/anā-vant- forms mā́hināvān
and daṃsánāvān stationed at the end of successive pādas (c, d), which are followed
by dákṣiṇāvān at the end of 6d and the neut. barháṇāvat at the end of 8d.
Pādas a and c contain what appear to be matching sequences that conceal
morphological differences:
\#(nákir) eṣāṃ ninditā́…
\#(índra) eṣāṃ dr̥ṃhitā́…
The two -itā́forms are respectively an agent noun (ninditā́) and a neut. pl. ppl.
(dṛṃhitā́), though the two eṣām have the same grammatical identity and referent and
the first word in each pāda is the subject.

### 05
The interweaving of lexicon and morphology continues in this vs. Pāda a
contains two forms of the same stem: sákhā … sákhibhiḥ, and the instr. pl. is found
four more times in the vs. (adjacent návagvaiḥ, b sátvabhiḥ, c daśábhir dáśagvaiḥ the
last pair with their own etymological play). Pāda-final dáśagvaiḥ also parallels
návagvaiḥ ending pāda a, and sátvabhiḥ of b is more subtly connected with satyám
beginning c.
On abhijñú- see Scar (344-45).
42

### 06
The 2nd hemistich has intensely alliterative (partially) etymological figures:
gúhā hitáṃ gúhyaṃ gūḷhám apsú, háste dadhe dákṣiṇe dákṣiṇāvān. The first half is
more restrained but note the morphological pair padvát … śaphávat and the
repetition of viveda from 5d.
The phrase náme goḥ is puzzling; Ge refuses to tr. náme. Old suggests
‘Sichneigen’, which is essentially literal and not very helpful; Re ‘domaine’, which
makes sense but is not clearly related to its supposed etymon; WG “beim Zuteilen
der Kuh,” also without accounting for the semantic development (or assuming a
derivation from the separate PIE root *nem, as in Greek νέμω ‘distribute’?). Like
Old I also take it literally, as the loc. sg. of a thematic noun to √nam ‘bend, bow’, but
suggest that “the bend of the cow” is some sort of homely spatial metaphor drawn
from knowledge of cow anatomy indicating a hidden or protected place. English
‘oxbow’ for a U-shaped configuration of a river is a similar application of pasturage
terminology to physical space. Cf. also ukṣṇó rándhram (VIII.7.26) “the loins of the
ox,” which I also think is a way of referring to the Vala cave. See comm. ad loc.

### 07
The IXth class vṛṇīta in pāda a is ambiguous: it can be either injunctive or
optative; the standard tr. take it as the former, expressing straight past time. I instead
interpr. it as optative, primarily because of the parallelism with 8a, where the light
chosen in 7a, “should suffuse the two world-halves” with opt. ánu ṣyāt (note also
syāma in 7b, 8b). However, the ambiguity of vṛṇīta allows it serve as pivot between
the past-time narration of vss. 4-6 and the expressed wishes of 7-8.
The rendering of purutámasya in the publ. tr. makes it seem to qualify the
hymns, not the bard. The tr. could be slightly emended to “… of the bard, who is the
latest of many.”

### 08
Pāda b seems to pose an almost deliberate syntactic challenge. The adverbial
āré ‘at a distance’ is normally construed with an ablative, as in 7b āré syāma duritā́t,
but in 8b we have the same phrase but with the noun in the genitive: āré syāma
duritásya bhū́reḥ. Or so it is taken by everyone, including me. But I now wonder if
the ambiguous form bhū́reḥ, which could be genitive or ablative, is in fact the latter
and is not modifying duritásya but rather governing it: “May we be at a distance
from an abundance of difficulty.”
## 040
Indra
### 01-02
The difference, if any, between pāhi (1c) and píba (2c) is as usual not
clear. See disc. ad III.35.10. If we are looking for ways to distinguish them, ā́vṛṣasva
“drench yourself in it,” immediately following píba in 2c, might support a more
durative interpr. of the pres. impv., as perhaps would the adj. tā́tṛpi- if it has
intensive semantics ‘ever satisfying’.

### 03
The adj. dhitā́van- is not entirely clear. It is a possessive -van-stem to the ppl.
dhitá- (√dhā); as Debrunner points out (AiG II.2.560), it unusually preserves the dh-
43
that is found in this ppl. only as 2nd member of a cmpd or under certain sandhi
conditions. The final has been lengthened as is normal in these stems: in the RV only
maghávan- has a short final vowel before the -van-suffix. Cf. also the numerous -āvant-formations in the previous hymn (III.39.4, 6, 8). But what does it mean? The
form occurs only here and in III.27.2, modifying Agni. Gr (flg. BR) glosses it as
‘gabenreich’, Ge “der das Erwartete (?) bringt,” whose connection to √dhā I don’t
understand. Both Re’s “pourvu (d’offrandes) présentées” and WG’s “das Vorrat
habend” may be closer to the mark. But what is most characteristically hitá- at the
sacrifice is the ritual fire, ā́√dhā being the technical term of establishing that fire,
and I therefore suggest that the sacrifice with its fires established is at issue here.
Some support for this interpr. may come from the last phrase stavāna viśpate “o you
who are praised as clan-lord.” The epithet viśpáti- is ordinarily used of Agni, so
Indra is here being praised as Agni, and it is Agni who both is and oversees the ritual
fires.

### 05
This is the first vs. that doesn’t begin with voc. índra; the voc. surfaces only
in the middle of b, an unprominent position. But its place is somewhat taken by
phonologically similar índavaḥ at the end of the vs., and initial índra reappears in 6c.

### 07
Contra Old and WG, I agree with Ge and Re that vanínaḥ is the ‘wooden’
word and is not a derivative of √van ‘win’. The focus in this hymn is very narrowly
on the ritual situation.

### 08
This is the only vs. in the hymn without a form of índra- (7 of the 8 of those
forms being vocatives, the lone exception índram in 7b). Here voc. vṛtrahan is
substituted.
### 08-09
On the “magic square” of these vss., see publ. intro. Vs. 9 actually seems
to be covering the logical possibility that Indra might not be either far or near but
somewhere in between, and in that case the exhortation in vs. 8 to come from nearby
or far away might not work.
## 041

### 01
The 1st persons naḥ and madryàk are somewhat awkwardly doubled. With
Ge I take naḥ, found in (modified) Wackernagel’s Position in pāda a, with
sómapītaye in b, and madryàk ‘in my direction’ with the verb of motion in c.

### 06
It is curious that the impv. mandasvā is not accented in this clause, despite
the hí, nor is it in the identical vs. VI.45.27 or in VI.23.8 also with sá mandasvā hí ...
I have no explantation; Old notes the lack of accent and gives a ref. to his treatment
in ZDMG 60, but in fact there he does nothing more there than note the passages.
44

### 07
The 1st pl. them. jarāmahe is perfectly ambiguous between ‘(be) awake’ and
‘sing’, and all other tr. assign it to ‘awake’ -- incl. WG, though Gotō (1st class, 154)
assigns it with certainty to ‘sing’. I have also tr. as ‘sing’, though nothing is at stake
between the two renderings.

### 08
Most take hári-priya- as ‘loving the hári’ (e.g., Re “qui aimes les alezans”);
I have reversed the direction of affection: “dear to the fallow bays,” primarily
because better attested puru-priyá- means ‘dear to many’ not ‘loving many’, though
the accent difference between them may signal a difference in meaning. (However,
the special accentual behavior of compounded puru- muddies the waters.)

The relative clause in c is somewhat tricky. The standard tr. (though Ge
hesitates in his n. 1c) take the subject to be soma and take háribhyām with ab,
starting the rel. cl. with yáḥ in 2nd position (type “come with your fallow bays to our
soma, which is for you and seeking us”). I am reluctant to break the pāda in that way
-- though given ukthébhiḥ at the beginning of 4c, which must go with the preceding
pāda, with a new clause beginning kuvíd, this is not much of an argument. More
importantly, since tvám asmayúḥ in the immediately preceding hymn (III.41.7) has
Indra as the referent, I am reluctant to have identical asmayúḥ modify soma here.
(Old cites some passages in IX where this adj. does modify soma, but those cases
describe the preparation of soma and his/its journey towards us, the priests, whereas
here the soma is stationary and Indra is journeying towards it and, as its preparers,
us.) My interpr. leaves te as the problem -- where to construe it and whether it can be
coreferential with yáḥ. The 2nd question can be answered affirmatively; nothing
forbids yáḥ from 2nd ps. reference here. As for the first, I take it with háribhyāṃ, a
solution I find somewhat unsatisfying, since possessive genitives are not usually
necessary in these situations. But cf. máma in 3a below, also in a situation where the
possessor doesn’t need to be overt.

### 03
Note the alliteration framing the first two pādas: #índram itthā́… iṣitā́itáḥ#.
## 043
Indra
The publ. tr. attempts to convey the density and distribution of the many
words for ‘here’, ‘nearby’, ‘close’.

### 01
The standard tr. take úpa barhíḥ with the next pāda (“call you to the ritual
grass”); Sāy. agrees with my version (see Ge’s n. 1c). There is no principled way to
decide, and very little depends on it.
It is not easily possible to register the pun of havya(vā́haḥ) ‘oblation’ (to √hu
‘pour’) and havante (to √hvā ‘call’).
45

### 04
The reference to Indra changes from 2nd ps. in ab to 3rd in cd. It would be
possible to attach ab to the preceding vs., which also has Indra in 2nd ps., and take cd
as a new sentence. But the fact that both ab and cd have subjunctives (váhātaḥ and
śṛṇavat) suggests that the two clauses go together.
Because of the accent on váhātaḥ, the ca is likely subordinating, as in fact the
standard tr. (and I) take it. However, the sequence ā́ca (…) √vah shows unexpected
accent on the verb form elsewhere (I.74.6, X.110.1), so it is possible that ab is a main
clause with the verbal accent produced by this curious formulaic usage; see comm.
ad I.74.6.

### 05
2nd ps. reference to Indra returns here, in kuvíd clauses otherwise parallel to
the one in 4cd with 3rd ps. ref.
Ge (fld. by WG and by me) takes the pf. part. papivā́ṃsam as expressing the
cause of Indra’s action.
The transmitted Saṃhitā text ma ṛ́ṣim must be read contracted, as márṣim (so
HvN) to achieve a Triṣṭubh line; the Pp. correctly analyzes this sandhi sequence as
mā ṛ́ṣim.

### 06
The final word of this vs., mūrā́ḥ, is generally taken as distinct from mūrá-
‘stupid, foolish’ and as an acc. pl. fem. with ā́tāḥ (e.g., Ge “die verschlossenen (?)
Töre”). I follow Old’s final suggestion that it belongs to the normal stem mūrá- and
refers to the horses; English “dumb beast” is a reasonable analogue.
## 044
Indra
On the extended pun in this hymn, see publ. intro.

### 02
The two pāda-final -áya-causatives, arcayaḥ (a) and arocayaḥ (b), are also
near phonological matches.

### 03
This is the middle vs. of the hymn and (comparatively) more complex than
the rest. As in 2ab, the first two pādas end with morphologically parallel formations,
the accusatives hári-dhāyasam (a) and hári-varpasam, both with -s-stems as 2nd
member and hári- as 1st
. The standard tr. obscure this parallelism by giving them
quite different interpr., with hári- in the first cmpd serving as apparent obj. to
dhāyas- (Ge “der den Goldigen nährt,” sim. Re and WG; also Gr), while the second
cmpd is rendered as a straight bahuvrīhi. By this interpr., in the first cmpd. hárirefers to soma (so Gr, Re) or soma or the sun (Ge [/WG]), while the hári- in the 2nd is
simply a term of color or material. Given the structure of this vs. and the parallel
structure in vs. 2, I think the two cmpds should be interpr. in a similar manner and
that the “golden nourishment” of heaven would be the sunlight. However, I do
concede that in other X-dhāyas- cmpds the 1st member may be the recipient of the
nourishment (e.g., arí-dhāyas- ‘having nourishment for the stranger’, kārú-dhāyas-
‘having nourishment for the bard’), and so I would consider a tr. ‘having
nourishment for the golden’, though I think this is the less likely possibility.
46
In c I assume a clause break after ádhārayat and take the rest of cd as a
nominal cl. with bhójanam as subj. For a similar constr. with bhójanam cf. VII.68.5
citráṃ ha yád vām bhójanaṃ nv ásti.
The poet has cleverly managed to gather the root √dhṛ into the pervasive
verbal play of the hymn, by stationing the dual form háritoḥ in a sandhi position
where its initial surfaces as dh, hence ádhārayad dháritor. This dh repetition
resonates with (hári-)dhāyas- in pāda a. Meanwhile in c the double dh-alliteration of
the first two words is matched by double bh-alliteration in bhū́ri bhójanam.

### 04
Pāda-final rócanam (b) echoes pāda-final arocayaḥ (2b) symmetrically
around the central vs., as well as rhyming with pāda-final bhójanam in 3c.

### 05
As noted in the publ. intro., the insistently golden vajra of vs. 4 (háritam …
ā́yudham … vájram … hárim) is transformed into a silvery one (árjunaṃ, vájram),
but keeps the har phonology in the participle haryántam ‘gladdening’, also
modifying the vajra. A different color-type term, śukrá- ‘gleaming, bright’ is also
used of the accoutrements of the weapon; the instr. pl. śukraíḥ is again a surprise: we
would expect háribhiḥ.
And in fact we get two forms of the latter in the last hemistich. In one of them
the poet uses the sandhi trick he employed in 3c to produce an initial dh: (ápāvṛṇod)
dháribhiḥ, which allows the sequence dháribhiḥ ádribhiḥ to read as a virtual anagram.
This last half-verse introduces Vala-myth phraseology (ápāvṛṇot, úd gā́ḥ …
ājata) in a hymn that otherwise lacks any mythic references. This Vala theme seems
particularly out of place because the soma and the vajra play little or no role in the
Vala myth but are strongly associated with the Vṛtra myth. I am uncertain of the
identity of the háribhiḥ who participate in the driving up of the cows in d. Ge and Re
confidently supply ‘horses’, and that is of course the default interpr. of this form in
an Indra context. But Indra’s horses are not actors in the Vala myth elsewhere, as far
as I can remember. His helpers in the Vala myth are the Aṅgirases, so perhaps they
qualify as golden here. Or perhaps it refers to the golden lights of the dawns and is an
instr. of accompaniment with gā́ḥ (“drove up the cows along with the golden [dawn
lights]”).
## 045
Indra

### 01
Although I use the Engl. word ‘gladdening’ here as in the last hymn, the
repetition is misleading. The Skt. word here tr. is mandrá-, whereas in the last hymn
it was haryatá-.
The simile concerning the bird and the snare is reminiscent of the much more
obscure image in I.125.2, in which an animal of some kind seems to be bound up and
captured.

### 02
In the string of agentive phrases that entirely make up this vs. the poet
manages a certain variety of syntactic patterns: standard tatpuruṣa with 1st member
47
obj. (vṛtrakhā́dá-), tatpuruṣa with accusative 1st member (valaṃrujá- [note that
without the acc. marker it would be a metrically unfavorable four light syllables]),
agent noun with genitive (pāda bc, 4x with 3 separate agent noun types: purā́ṃ
darmá-, apā́m ajá-, sthā́tar- ráthasya, háryor abhisvará-), agent noun with acc.
(dṛḷhā́… ārujá-). The relentless repetition of nom. sg. agent phrases makes it quite
certain that the Pp. loc. sg. reading abhisvaré should instead be taken as nom. sg. -aḥ,
with Old. All standard tr. agree. The only argument against this that I can see is that
háryor abhisvaráḥ would be the second GEN + simple -á-stem agent phrase (after
apā́m ajáḥ in b), and if the poet was serious about producing the phraseological
variety I have just catalogued he might have avoided a repetition by couching this
phrase in the loc. (“at the calling of the two fallow bays”). The only other occurrence
of abhisvará- is in the loc. (-e in sandhi, also pāda-final) and means ‘call’, not ‘caller’
(X.117.8). Still, I do not think this arg. is strong enough to counter-balance the
pressure of the nom. sg. sequence.

### 03
As noted in the publ. intro., this is the middle vs. of the hymn, and it
contains four similes, which are interlocked in interesting ways. In the first halfverse both similes target krátum ‘resolve, will’. In the first the term held in common
(gambhirā́n ‘deep’) has been attracted in number to the upamāna (udadhī́n ‘pools’),
though the position of the iva probably shows that ‘deep’ lies outside the simile
proper (gambhirā́m̐udadhī́m̐iva, krátum …). This simile is not dependent on the
verb, while the second one (krátum puṣyasi gā́iva “you foster it like cows”) requires
the fosterage of the verb puṣyasi for the comparison to make sense. That is, Indra’s
will is like cows only in that he cultivates it and helps it prosper, whereas it is “deep”
regardless of any verb that might govern it.
The second hemistich contains two parallel similes, both bipartite, with a nom.
pl. referring to entities that reach an acc. goal: cows / pasturage, brooks / lake. The
first, the bovine one, seems generated from the cow simile of pāda b, esp. as the adj.
sugopá- (c) contains the same gó- as gā́ḥ in b. The interesting thing about this halfverse is that the frame, the upameya, is not expressed at all. There is neither an overt
nom. of the entity(/-ies) in motion nor an acc. goal -- simply the simile marker iva.
The comparison is wide open. Sāy. suggests that soma drinks are the subj. to be
supplied, and he is followed by the standard tr. (and Old). Old suggests that the goal
is either “you” (=Indra) or his krátu-; Re shares his uncertainty, while Ge (/WG)
supply “dich.” Although it is true that āśata takes soma drinks as subject in other
passages (see Ge’s n. 3cd), this hymn does not otherwise mention soma, and I am
wary of supplying it out of nowhere. I prefer to take krátu- as subj., either in the pl.
(‘resolves’ as in the publ. tr.) or, as Ge. suggests in n. 3cd, as a sg., with the verb
attracted to the number of the subjects of the two similes. And I take āśata in a
different sense in the frame than in the similes -- without expressed goal as “reach
fulfillment, achieved (their goal),” although I recognize that the overwhelming
number of occurrences of this verb do have expressed goal.
48

### 04
The simile in b is not clear, in great part because práti √jñā appears to be
employed in some technical sense that we have no handle on. The lexeme is not
common in Vedic and seems to mean ‘greet, welcome’ (or perhaps just ‘recognize,
acknowledge’) in the Vāstoṣpati hymn, VII.54.1, and in other texts ‘acknowledge,
respond’ vel sim. In post-Vedic Skt. it means ‘promise’ or the like. Since áṃśa-
‘portion’ may also have a technical or legal sense, this phrase may belong to a
stratum of language that we have no access to at this period. My feeling is that it has
to do with the acceptance or rejection of something offered, as prati √grah signals
acceptance of a properly given gift (see Sac. Wife 199-201). But I cannot get further
than that.

### 05
The first hemistich contains three forms with sva- ‘self’: svayúḥ … svarā́ṭ
… sváyaśastaraḥ, and the second hemistich opens sá v-, with a scrambling of the
phonetic elements. Other patterning is seen in the comparative sváyaśastaraḥ ending
the first hemistich and the superlative suśrávastamaḥ ending the 2nd, both built to -asstems and compounded with the phonological variants sva- and su-.
smáddiṣṭi- occurs 4x in the RV. It is a cmpd. of smád- ‘altogether, together
with’ and the -ti-abstract of √diś ‘direct, assign, allot’, and as Ge says (n. 5b), it
appears to be a technical term in dānastutis. In its other three occurrences (VI.63.9,
VII.18.23, X.62.10) it modifies the gift, while here it qualifies the giver, Indra. As
Old points out, medial √diś is used of the allotting of gifts in V.36.6, and such a
sense seems to fit here as well. For further see Old’s detailed disc.
The splv. suśrávastamaḥ is rendered by the standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) as ‘best
listener’. Since it is built to the noun śrávas- ‘fame’ rather than directly to the root
√śru, I find this meaning unlikely. In some other passages the word simply means
‘most famous, having the best good fame’ (e.g., VIII.13.2). Here because of the
involvement of ‘us’ (naḥ), I take it as ‘receiving the best good fame’, i.e., with ‘fame’
being the praises we offer him. In only one passage does ‘best hearer’ seem a likely
interpr., and there that meaning is induced by the presence of the verb śṛṇuṣvá:
I.131.7 śṛṇuṣvá suśrávastamaḥ “listen (to us) as the one who listens best.”
## 046
Indra

### 01
This vs. is cunningly constructed, in that until the very last word of the third
pāda it consists entirely of genitives with nothing to depend on; neut. pl. vīryā̀ṇi at
the end of c breaks this string and provides the necessary grammatical support --
joined by the matching adj. mahā́ni at the very end of the vs.

### 03
All four pādas begin with prá; the verb of a, ririce, should be supplied with
the other three pādas.
Note the phonological plays in a: prá (mā)trā(bhī) and ririce roca(mānaḥ).
49

### 04
The string of untethered accusatives in the first 3 pādas reminds us of the
string of genitives in vs. 1. Here the syntactic tension is resolved only by the verb ā́
viśanti that ends the verse and allows the accusatives to serve as its goal.
I do not entirely understand the function of abhí in pāda a. It matches nearby
III.48.4c … janúṣābhibhū́ya#, where abhí is part of gerund. It may also recall
abhíbhūtim ugrám (I.118.9, IV.38.1, sim. VI.19.6), which in turn is a variant of
abhibhūty-ójas- (cf. nearby III.48.4a, the vs. just cited for the gerund). In any case
the abhí seems pretty functionless in this passage; my “over(whelmingly)” is an
attempt to give it some function.
## 047
Indra

### 03
The aor. impv. pāhi here implicitly contrasts with the pres. impv. píba in 1b,
2b, 4d. As usual, it is difficult to know how much semantic or functional difference
to read into this contrast. See disc. ad III.35.10. In this particular case the root noun
cmpd. ṛtupāḥ may have triggered the immediately following pā(hi).
Re tr. ṛtupāḥ as ‘guardien des temps-rituels’, with √pā ‘protect’ rather than
√pā ‘drink’. I think it unlikely in a dull little hymn like this that there would be a pun
of that sort, and the sequence ṛtúbhir ṛtupāḥ pāhi, with the two elements of the cmpd.
extracted from it and flanking it, seems to impose etymological identity.
The second hemistich refers to Indra’s allowing the Maruts a share in the
soma because of their support in the Vṛtra battle. For a dramatization of this ritual
situation, see I.165 and associated hymns.

### 05
The first word of this final vs., marútvantam echoes the first word of the
hymn, marútvān.
## 048
Indra

### 01
Though Gr classifies prábhartum as an infinitive, and Old’s and WG’s tr.
seem (indirectly) to reflect this analysis (“dass man ihm darbrachte …”), the form
seems to be simply a -tu-abstract (somewhat concretized)(so tr. Ge and Re). As is
well known, the -tum form that serves as the only infinitive in Classical Sanskrit is
hardly found in early Vedic. Macd. (VG §586b) registers only five in the RV (not
including this one) and an equal number in the AV. prábhartu- here seems more or
less equivalent to prábhṛti- or prábharman-, though the -u-stem datives bhártave
(IX.97.50) and ápabhartavaí (X.14.2) are infinitival.
Notice the near rhyming openings to the two half-verses, a: #sadyó h(a), c:
\#sādhóḥ.

### 02
It is appropriate that the “beestings” (pīyū́ṣa-), that is, the colostrum or first
milk, should be given to the new-born Indra.
The preverb pári in pāda a is presumably to be construed with ā́siñcat in b, a
verb with which it is frequently found. I do not understand the position of this pári,
50
in the middle of the pāda, right after the caesura but breaking up the NP mātā́… yóṣā
jánitrī.

### 03
It is not clear who the “others” (anyā́n) are whom he keeps away, but the
medial pf. in the next pāda (cakre) implicitly claims that he did the great things
(mahā́ni; cf. vīryā̀ṇi … mahā́ni in III.36.1cd) by himself, that is, without the help of
others.
### 03-04
I assume that purudhá-pratīka- in 3d refers to Indra’s shape-shifting
powers; the cmpd seems to be “unpacked” in 4b “he made this body as he wished”
(yathāvaśáṃ tanvàṃ cakra eṣáḥ).
These two vss. are noteworthy for containing 3 gerunds, upasthā́ya,
abhibhū́ya, and āmúṣyā. The quest of the poet(s) of the Indra hymns in III to find a
way to express anteriority (see disc. ad III.32.9-10, 33.11) is successful at least in
this passage.
## 049
Indra

### 01
The first word śáṃsā is read śáṃsa by the Pp., i.e., as a 2nd sg. impv. This is
quite possible, of course, and is the interpr. of Ge (/WG) and Old. With Re I take it as
a 1st sg. subjunctive because this is more in keeping with the 1st ps. diction in
annunciatory initial praise vss. like I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam, but nothing
depends on the analysis either way.

### 02
The 2nd hemistich is universally tr. (save for Scar, 656) as a single rel. clause,
but amināt is unaccented and so d must be a separate clause.
In c the standard tr. (incl. also Scar) construe the instr. pl. śūṣaíḥ with instr. pl.
sátvabhiḥ (e.g., Ge “mit seinen mutigen Streitern”). This of course would be the
default assumption. However, in almost every occurrence of the stem śūṣá-,
including all the other examples of the instr. pl., it refers to hymns or praises,
whether with a limiting noun or not. I therefore separate it from the other instr. in the
pāda and take it as having its usual referent. The poet claims that Indra’s strength is
at least partially dependent on our strengthening praises.

### 04
The ppl. pṛṣṭá- ‘asked (about)’ is a little odd. Ge tr. ‘gesucht’, which would
make it less odd, but I don’t think √prach means that. It may be referring to the fact
that Indra’s existence and whereabouts are often questioned in the RV.
In b Ge and WG take the simile to be rátho ná vāyúḥ. This of course conforms
well to the structure of the pāda and of similes in general, but it has the undesirable
consequence of requiring rátha-, a word whose meaning is about as well known as
any in the RV, to stand not for ‘chariot’ but for ‘chariot-warrior’ (vel sim.; cf. Ge’s
Wagenheld). I therefore, somewhat reluctantly, follow Re. in taking the simile to be
ūrdhvó, rátho ná “erect like a chariot.” Re then takes vāyúḥ as a (pseudo-)genitive:
“(se tenant) droit comme le char (de) Vāyu,” which is unacceptable for this clear
51
nominative. I instead take vāyúḥ as the beginning of another, unmarked simile. Cf.
IX.88.3 vāyúr ná yó niyútvān, with simile marker.
## 050
Indra

### 02
On dheyuḥ and related forms, see my “… dheyām revisited” (Ged. Schindler,
1999).

### 03
The first hemistich poses some difficulties: the subject is not expressed, and
it is not clear what it should be; there is an abundance of acc. sg. masculines, not all
of which are coreferential; the root affiliation of dhā́yase is disputed; the value of
gṛṇānā́ḥ is unclear.
To begin with the last, which has implication for some of the other questions:
the standard tr. take gṛṇānā́ḥ as transitive, with Indra as object. But of the over 50
examples of this middle participle, only one other occurrence is transitive, I.181.9,
where this value was induced by contextual pressure (see comm. ad loc.). I therefore
take it as passive here as well.
If it is passive, then the missing subject must be something capable of being
praised. Gr takes the subject to be the horses of vs. 2; since they were the overt
subject of a form of √dhā in 2c (dheyuḥ) and would be the subj. of another one here
(dadhire), this makes implicit sense. And it is possible that they might be praised or
sung. However, the question is whether the horses can be thought to establish or
deposit soma, as 2a requires. Priests would make more sense for this action (so Re),
but priests would not ordinarily be praised -- hence the anomalous transitive interpr.
of gṛṇānā́ḥ by most tr. In the end I would opt for the horses, but not very happily --
the contextual arguments pull in opposite directions.
Now, as for the accusatives: mimikṣúm ... supārám, índram, I agree with the
standard tr. that the first refers to soma, seeking to be mixed with milk, and of course
that the last, índram, is separate from it. The question is where supārám belongs. The
standard tr., in different ways, take it with soma. Since in all its singular occurrences
the word refers to Indra, I take it with índram here as well.
The final question is the root affiliation and value of dhā́yase. The standard tr.
all take it to √dhā ‘place’, construed with jyaíṣṭhyāya and with Indra as implicit subj.
(e.g., Ge “dass er [=Indra] die Oberhoheit ausübe”). However, all clear cases of
dhā́yas-, which mostly appears in the dat., belong to √dhā ‘suckle, nourish’ (incl. at
nearby III.38.3 [though see the minority opinion discussed in comm. ad loc.]). I take
it as such here, with índram as its object (thereby avoiding the necessity to construe
this acc. with either dadhire or gṛṇānā́ḥ). The procuring of soma to nourish Indra is a
logical progression -- though I’m still concerned that the horses might be the agents.
### 04-05
On the sequence of two repeated vss. see publ. intro.
## 051
Indra
52
### 01-02
These two vss. have the same structure: pādas acd are just accusatives
qualifying the acc. índram in b, and the b pādas are essentially the same, with nom. pl.
gíraḥ + a verb that governs the accusatives. Though vs. 3 breaks the syntax, Indra
still appears first by name in pāda b.

### 02
The standard tr. take arṇavám as an unmarked simile, serving as goal to the
verb in b: “my songs go to Indra, as if to the sea [Ge “(wie) zu dem Meere,” Re “(tel)
un océan,” WG more accurately but less persuasively “(wie) zu wallender Flut”].
The word is therefore only indirectly associated with Indra: they are both goals but
need have nothing else in common. But given the parallelism in structure of vss. 1
and 2, I am reluctant to break the pattern of accusatives characterizing Indra by
introducing this syntactic disjunction, and further the simile only makes good sense if
arṇavá- really is a sea or the like, not an undulating flood. I think instead that Indra is
directly described as a flood, the flood itself being characterized as śākín-
‘possessing powers’.
The water-crossing mentioned here may simply be a reference to Indra’s
general leadership in crossing rivers and gaining new territory, but it may more
specifically point to the famous crossing of King Sudās dramatized in III.33 and
referred to again in III.53.9, even though the poet Viśvāmitra, not Indra, is the major
actor there. The crossing is mentioned again in 9a.

### 03
Although panasyate might make more sense if tr. “expresses admiration,”
the other occurrences of this denom. stem and the related adj. panasyú- all mean
‘attract/invite admiration’. Here the poet is hoping for a good reception from the
recipient of his hymns, which he indeed receives in pādas b and c. I have tr. the loc.
phrase ākaré vásoḥ as if ablative, to make the sense clearer. It could have been
rendered “… seeks admiration at (the hands of) him …”

### 04
Though this vs. begins a new tṛca in a different meter, it partially restores
the syntactic structure of vss. 1-2: the first pāda presents Indra in the acc., the second
one directs praises to him. Note also that nṛṇā́m … nṛ́tamam picks up náram of 2a.
The structure is somewhat complicated by the fact that both (unnamed) Indra in pāda
a and the (unnamed) subjects of the impv. arcatā in b are addressed in the 2nd ps.
This leads both Ge and Re to separate the two pādas: Ge pronounces pāda a an
anacoluthon or ellipsis, while Re supplies “(je te chante).” This fastidiouness seems
unnecessary to me: the two referents of the 2nd persons are in different grammatical
numbers and unlikely to be confused with each other for other reasons, and in a ritual
situation both should be present (“at the seat of Vivasvant,” 3c) and could both be
directly addressed. The two instrumentals in pāda a (gīrbhír ukthaíḥ) also go better
with the verb in b; cf., e.g., VI.22.1 índraṃ táṃ gīrbhír abhy àrca ābhíḥ.
Pāda d consists of two clauses, the nominal námo asya and the short verbèd
clause pradíva éka īśe, and so, contra Gr’s suggestion (s.v. īś, col. 236, #8), the verb
doesn’t take an acc. here. For supposed exx. of √īś with the acc., see comm. ad
VII.32.18.
53

### 05
The stem niṣṣídh- and related forms are difficult (see, inter alia, Scar 596-
97). As Scar points out, there is no obvious direct way to connect it with either
√sādh ‘succeed’ or √sidh ‘repel’, and neither of these roots appears with níḥ in the
RV (though the latter does in post-RVic texts, but without relevant meaning; see
Gotō, 1st Kl., 328). On the other hand, the semantic range of the word itself in context
is relatively clear. It usually refers to something offered by inferiors to superiors.
Ge’s Tribut (see his brief disc. in n. 5b) works pretty well. If we want to connect it to
the root √sādh ‘succeed, realize, reach the goal’, it may be seen as the material
representation of the fulfillment (this is the √sādh part) of an obligation, and the níḥ
‘forth’ may reflect the proffering of these material goods.
I supply ‘streams’ with jīráyaḥ on the basis of the other occurrence of this pl.
in II.17.3 prá jīráyaḥ sisrate … as well as the well-attested jīrá-dānu- ‘possessing
lively drops’. There is general agreement in the standard tr. that jīrí- refers to
flowing water.

### 06
Note the chiasmic structure túbhyam bráhmāṇi gíraḥ … túbhyam.
Ge persuasively identifies ávaso nū́tanasya as a genitive of quality.

### 07
This vs. contains yet another implicit contrast between the aor. and pres. of
√pā ‘drink’: pāhi … yáthā … ápibaḥ. See comm. ad III.35.10, 36.3, 40.1-2, and 47.3.
It is not clear whether a contrast is also meant between the acc. sómam with pāhi
(also 8a) and the (potentially partitive) genitive sutásya with ápibaḥ and, if so,
whether it is signaling some sort of aspectual distinction.
The verb ā́vivāsanti lacks an object here, though it usually is construed with
one. Ge (/WG) interpret it as ‘invite’ (presumably supplying ‘you’), while Re
supplies the gods as object. I think the object slot has been intentionally left blank:
with Indra’s guidance and in his shelter they hope to win whatever they fancy, hence
my somewhat awk. tr. “seek their win.” Oberlies (Rel.RV I.403) suggests that this is
a poetic contest, but I don’t see any evidence of this beyond the plural.
Given the usual rendering of kaví- elsewhere in the publ. tr., I would change
the tr. here to ‘sage poets’ or just ‘poets’.

### 08
The connection between the two hemistichs in this vs. is not clear. The first
unambiguously presents the here-and-now of the sacrifice, with an impv. and the adv.
ihá ‘here’, while the second harks back to Indra’s primordial birth and the gods’
attendance on it, expressed by an augmented imperf. (ábhūṣan). There is no way to
reconcile the temporal disjunction directly, so I have adopted Ge’s makeshift:
supplying “(wie damals),” though there is no overt representation of my “as” (or his
“wie damals”). There does not seem to be much semantic connection between the
two halves either, unless we, the pressers and offerers, are being identified with the
gods who served Indra at his birth.
54

### 09
The abrupt temporal shifts continue in this vs., exacerbated by shifts in
person. The poet first addresses the Maruts in the 2nd ps. and asserts something about
Indra in the present time (or so I [and the other standard tr.] take the nominal
sentence without overt copula). In pāda b the Maruts are then referred to in the 3rd ps.
-- though they are not named in this pāda, the other two occurrences of dā́ti-vararefer to them, and ánu √mad is a signature verb of theirs -- and in the past, in the
augmented impf. ámandan. (Though the Saṃhitā text transmits ‘mandan, the
augment is metrically guaranteed.) This pāda seems an aside, reminding the audience
of the Maruts’ previous involvement with Indra. The vs. then shifts to the present
time again, with the Maruts remaining in the 3rd ps., as potential drinking companions
for Indra.
In 6c Indra was urged to become “a friend of present help”; what that present
help was/should be is spelled out here, a friend “at the water-crossing.” For watercrossing see comm. ad vs. 2 above. It is presumably not directly related to the Maruts’
applause in pāda b, for they provide material and moral support at the Vṛtrasmashing, not in crossing waters.
III.51.9-10. Note that pibatu takes an acc. in 9cd, but a gen. in 10c, as with ápibaḥ in
7b.

### 10  
The first two pādas of this vs. are variously translated. The problems are 1)
the referent of idám and 2) the absence of a verb. My interpr. is closest to Ge’s. If the
referent of idám is the soma, we need only find a synonym for soma that is neuter;
sávanam fits the bill and is elsewhere modified by sutá-, as it can be here. As for the
verb, I assume a form of √as: the idiom ánu √as means ‘be at hand’.
## 052

### 02
pacatyà- occurs only here; it does not seem to have any gerundival sense,
nor does its base pacatá-, though -ata-adjectives often do (darśatá- ‘sightly’, not just
‘seen’); see AiG II.2.168. I assume pacatyà- is a nonce creation to provide an extra
syllable here in the versified recipe. And perhaps pacatá- was fashioned as a clearer
alternative past participle to pakvá-, which can of course also mean ‘ripe’, though it’s
quite commonly applied to cooked food.

### 03
The accent of ghásaḥ is unexpected, but it presumably results from its
juxtaposition with immed. following joṣáyāse, which can owe its accent to its pādainitial position. Although ca can be subordinating (‘if’) and induce verbal accent, that
doesn't seem to be its function here.

### 08
The phrase vīrátama- nṛṇā́m ‘most virile of men’ is a variant of the fairly
common formula nṛṇā́ṃ nṛ́tama- ‘most manly of men’, an occurrence of which is
found in the preceding hymn, III.51.4. This vs. is repeated at IV.32.16.
55
## 053
Indra, etc.

### 01
The curious dual dvandva indrā-parvatā ‘o Indra and Mountain’, only in the
vocative and therefore unaccented, occurs 3x: I.122.3, 132.6, and here. As discussed
ad I.122.3 and 132.6, I believe that the ‘mountain’ is Indra’s vájra-.

### 02
The verb in pāda b, yakṣi, is simply an injunctive 1st sg. s-aor. to √yaj, but it
is rendered as a future/modal in all the standard tr. (including this one). This value
seems also found in the identical form in X.52.5, though not in X.4.1. (Gr’s ex. in
VI.16.8 is better taken as a 2nd-sg. act. -si impv.) I don’t know why this particular
form should have this value, save for the general functional flexibility of the
injunctive. But perhaps the fact that the formally identical 2nd sg. act. -si impv. is so
common and (as an old s-aor. subjunctive) is used in both imperatival and
subjunctive-future value may have allowed that value to spill over onto its formal
twin.

### 03
The 1st dual subjunctive (śáṃsāva) coupled with a sg. voc. (adhvaryo) is a
rough and ready way to express a 1st ps. inclusive. This type of construction contrasts
with the 1st ps. exclusive found in phrases like VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca
nā́vam “When we two, Varuṇa and I, mounted the boat …” with a nominative
explicitly conjoined with ca to an implicit ahám.
The injunctive bhūt in d must also, like yakṣi in 2b, be modal/prospective or
even imperatival, since the áthā ca indicates that it temporally and/or logically
follows the impv. sīda in c.

### 04
The dismissal of Indra and the sending him off home comes rather early in
this hymnlet; he just got here (vs. 1) and at that point we urged him to stay put (vs. 2).
Vs. 3 seems to depict the sacrifice proper, and the remaining 3 vss. of this portion of
the hymn (vss. 4-6) are an extended farewell. In this vs. the poet seems to be
reassuring Indra that if he goes home, he still won’t miss out on anything here: we’ll
send Agni to fetch him whenever we press soma.

### 05
párā yāhi “drive away” comes awfully soon after 2a mā́párā gāḥ “don’t go
away.”
The genitive phrase vājíno rā́sabhasya is ambiguous: does it refer to two
animals or one? Re opts for the former: “… du (cheval) gagnant-du-prix (et) de
l’âne.” But the same phrase in I.34.9 makes it likely that the two words belong
together as the designation of a single animal. So Ge (/WG).
### 06-07
See the publ. intro. for the thematic and lexical connections between these
two vss., despite their belonging to different sections of the hymn. See there also for
the connection of vs. 7 with III.31, via the identification of the current poet with the
Aṅgirases, ur-sacrificers and givers of dakṣiṇās (on which see Ge’s n. 7a).

### 08
As Schaefer points out (p. 162), the intens. bobhavīti construed with an
āmreḍita rūpáṃ-rūpam must signal repetitive function (“Gestalt um Gestalt”).
In c I read diváḥ twice: once as ‘day’ with tríḥ in the meaning “three times a
day” (cf. nearby III.56.5, 6 trír ā́diváḥ, also X.95.5 tríḥ … áhnaḥ), once as ‘heaven’
with following pári “from heaven.” The latter reading, adopted by Sāy., is rejected
by Old and Ge (n. 8c) because we should expect the close sandhi divás pári. This
argument is subject to criticism on two grounds. First, I think the double reading of
diváḥ would preclude close sandhi for one of the readings. Moreover, none of the
other cited exx. of divás pári is broken over the caesura as here. As Mark Hale has
discussed at length, close sandhi of NOUN + POSTPOSITION is blocked at the caesura.
See “Preliminaries to the Study of the Relationship between Syntax and Sandhi in
Rigvedic Sanskrit,” Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft 51, pp. 77-96, 1990;
this view is cited here after the 1995 draft, Wackernagel’s Law in the Language of the
RV, pp. 38-50.
The ritual situation in the 2nd hemistich is puzzling for several reasons. First,
Indra’s appearance at the sacrifice “three times a day” is what we expect, since there
are three soma pressings. Then why is he characterized as ánṛtupāḥ ‘drinking out of
season’? Ge (/WG) gets out of this bind by supplying a parenthetical “(oder)”: he
either comes three times a day or drinks unseasonably. This works, but the “or” is of
course a complete invention. More problematic is the fact that Indra is drinking
unseasonably at all. In this same Indra cycle he has been apostrophized as ṛtupāḥ
(voc., III.47.3). The apparent breaking of the ritual rules here is esp. striking because
he is called ṛṭā́van- ‘possessing the truth, truthful’ at the same time, made more
striking because this is the only place in the RV where ṛtā́van- qualifies Indra.
Lüders (Varuṇa II, 547-48) suggests that ṛtā́van- is used here only as word play with
ánṛtupā́-, since Indra has essentially no connection with ṛtá- (“dass er zum Ṛta so gut
wie keine Beziehung hat,” p. 548). But this seems unlikely, esp. given that the
unnegated expression ṛtupā́ṛtā́vā in the same metrical position is used of Agni in this
same maṇḍala (III.20.4). Some point is being made, that Indra can be ṛtā́van- despite
his un-rule-governed behavior.
I think the clues to a solution are found in the first half of the verse, where
Indra is depicted as constantly shape-shifting and enveloping himself in māyā́ḥ.
Perhaps Indra is impersonating other gods through the various rūpa-s he assumes,
and his unseasonable drinking involves his taking their places in the rota (ṛtú-) of
soma-recipients (the Ṛtugraha treated in I.15 and II.36-37). What then are “his own
mantras” (svaír mántraiḥ), which accompany the unseasonable drinking? Lüders (p.
548) suggests that when he drinks outside of the three pressings he has to recite his
own mantras. Though this is clever, I do not think it is correct, nor do I follow my
own published tr. “by (the power of) his own (magic) spells” -- though I do think the
mantras may be semantically linked to māyā́ḥ here. But my current thinking is that
the phrase should be tr. “with their own mantras,” referring to the mantras
appropriate to the gods whose forms he has appropriated and whose turns he takes in
the drinking. As to how he can be called ṛtā́van- when his behavior seems not to be
precisely aboveboard, perhaps he has gained the epithet from the gods whose
57
identities he’s stealing: Agni, Tvaṣṭar, and Mitra and Varuṇa, all called ṛtā́vanelsewhere in the RV, all occur in the Ṛtugraha sequence (I.15; II.36-37). Or perhaps
the epithet alludes to Indra’s most enduring adoption of another identity, that of
Bṛhaspati. Though Bṛhaspati is called ṛtā́van- only once in the RV as far as I am
aware (VI.73.1), the role of ṛtá- in association with Bṛhaspati in the Vala myth is
very significant; see, e.g., Lüders p. 549. Or perhaps we can simply say that Indra’s
“truth” -- his inherent nature -- is his ability to assume other forms and act out of turn
and impose his will without following rules.
III.53.9-10: The use of somewhat inappropriate epithets continues in these vss. The
subject of 9ab, the “great seer” (mahā́m̐ṛ́ṣiḥ) is Viśvāmitra, mentioned by name in c.
A mortal, he is described as ‘god-begotten’ (devajā́-) and ‘god-sped’ (devájūta-) but
‘possessing a man’s sight’ (nṛcákṣas-); the last is also used of the Kuśikas,
Viśvāmitra’s family, in the next vs. Curiously it is the epithet with nṛ- ‘man’ that
appears to be misapplied, not those with devá- ‘god’: the stem nṛ-cákṣas- is found
approximately 40 times in the RV, and in all other occurrences (with the possible
exception of the next hymn, III.54.6) it qualifies a god, who either has his (divine)
gaze on men or attracts the gaze of men. Thus, the status of Viśvāmitra and his kin is
implicitly raised by receiving a descriptor usually used of gods. That the Kuśikas
drink soma with the gods in 10cd is a sign of this enhanced status. What the adj.
means here is unclear to me: is it that they too attract the gaze (and thus admiration)
of other men, or that they, despite possessing only a man’s sight, still manage feats
sufficient to match the gods, esp. Viśvāmitra’s stopping the rivers in full flood?

### 10  
The publ. tr. does not recognize or render the idiom ví √pā, found
generally in the middle, for which see also comm. ad VII.22.3. As is indicated there,
in later Vedic and already in late RV, the idiom is specialized for the separation of
surā from another liquid in the Sautrāmaṇī ritual, but earlier can refer more generally
to the extraction (“drinking out”) of a liquid from another source, e.g., by the
pressing stones in IV.16.3 and VII.22.3. What the idiom is doing here is less clear to
me. Ge (n. 10d / WG) thinks this is a reference to the (much later) notion that haṃsas
can separate liquids and so it belongs with the Sautrāmaṇī passages -- the haṃsa
being found in pāda a, though only in a simile unrelated to drinking. I think this
unlikely. It may simply be that the pressing stones are involved: the Kuśikas may be
“drinking out” the soma by means of the pressing stones found in pāda a (ádribhiḥ).
However, it is also possible that the ví represents the cross-species aspect of the
drinking party: the mortal Kuśikas are urged to drink along with the gods, but the
gathering may be segregated. So perhaps a tr. “drink apart, along with the gods”;
such a notion seems to underlie Re’s “Buvez séparément avec les dieux.” It would
contrast with a true symposium expressed by sám √pā also in the middle (see
IV.35.7, 9) and in fact might allude to that idiom, given the well-known polarization
of ví and sám. Another possibility is Sāy’s parasparavyatihāreṇa ‘by mutual
interchange, alternately’. I am weakly inclined towards the pressing stone
58
interpretation, though also somewhat drawn to the cross-species one. And I would
also point out the resonance of the preverb ví with viśvā́mitraḥ (9c) and viprāḥ (10c).

### 11  
This vs. is supposed to depict the Aśvamedha of King Sudās, and the
releasing of the horse in b and the smiting of obstacles in all directions in c, followed
by a sacrifice in d, certainly support this interpr.
cetáyadhvam is variously rendered, but most generally as ‘pay attention’ vel
sim. I instead take this middle full-grade -áya-formation as a reflexive transitive
“make yourselves known” based on the ‘make perceive’ sense of cetáya-. Re’s
alternative “faites vous remarquer” is closest to mine.
As Watkins points out (Dragon, p. 208), although this form of the intens. of
√han has a singular object (somewhat unusually), it is “serially plural,” in that the
vṛtrám is located in one cardinal direction after another; see also Schaeffer 204-5.

### 12  
The first hemistich, couched in the 1st ps., consists only of a rel. clause,
which breaks off. The “I” is clearly Viśvāmitra, whose name opens the hemistich and
whose protective bráhman- is mentioned there -- making it very likely that pādas ab
constitute this bráhman-, though it’s not quite clear what is protective about this
truncated utterance.
The plupf. átuṣṭavam should not exist, at least in my opinion, since the two
forms of the indicative pf. tuṣṭuvúḥ (VIII.6.12, 18) also appear to have preterital
value. However, the contexts in VIII.6 do not guarantee that value -- it is possible
that they are presential “they praise” (see comm. ad VIII.6.12). The existence of a pf.
subj. tuṣṭávat at VIII.98.16 also suggests that the indicative pf. is, or originally was,
presential. The only other pf. forms in the RV, the act. part. tuṣṭuváṃs- (3x) and mid.
part. tuṣṭuvāná- (1x) are generally tr. as preterital, but again context does not dictate
this rendering.

### 13  
The tr. of the last pāda might better begin “Just he will make …” to reflect
the íd.
### 15-16
As indicated in the publ. intro., the subject of these two vss. is the
mysterious feminine sasarparī́-, which has been interpr. as differently as
“Kriegstrompete” (BR, fld. by Gr), “Sangesgeweise” of the Viśvāmitras (Ge), and
Vāc (Anukramaṇī, Sāy.). The interpr. of these vss. has been further complicated by
the later tradition that sees them as concerning the supposed rivalry between
Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, for which I see no evidence at all in the RV.
Although I do not think all the puzzles are ultimately solvable, some clues can
get us some distance. First, sasarparī́- is a vṛkī-type fem., and as Debrunner points
out (AiG II.2.369), the major use of this inflectional type is for female beings (human
and animal). This lends some credence to the opinion that the sasarparī́- is a cow of
some sort (e.g., Re “La (vache) Sasarparī”). That vs. 14 concerns the ritually
worthless cows of the Kīkaṭas would also support a contrast with an eminently
worthy cow found among us. Second, these two vss. sound rather like a dānastuti
59
(see jamádagnidatta- in 15b and yā́m me palastijamadagnáyo dadúḥ in 16d), and
since the next part of the hymn goes off in a completely different direction, this could
serve as a hymn-capping dānastuti for what precedes. Cf. I.126.2, a dānastuti hymn,
where, after Kakṣīvant is given cows, he stretches the king's unaging fame to heaven:
diví śrávo ‘járam ā́tatāna, highly reminiscent of our 2nd hemistich … tatāna, śrávo
devéṣv amṛ́tam ajuryám.
Even if this sketch of the function of the vss. and of Sasarparī is accepted (a
big if), it remains to analyze the word. I consider it a portmanteau pun. On the one
hand it is a kind of anagram for the intensive of √sṛp ‘creep’, found in the RV only
as the hapax adj. sarīsṛpá- (X.162.3), which I tr. ‘squirming’. On the other hand, it is
also phonologically reminiscent of sabar-dúgha-, -duh- ‘sap-yielding’, of milk cows
-- two occurrences of which are found in nearby III.55 (vss. 12, 16) qualifying Night
and Dawn, one of whom bellows (mimāya as here) in vs. 13. (Acdg. to Griffith, Gr
associates Sasarparī with Sabardughā, though this is not registered in the dictionary.)
Just as the Sasarparī brings fame in 16, so does a sabardúh- in VI.48.12-13 “milk out
immortal fame” (śrávò ‘mṛtyu dhúkṣata). Another possible association is sarpís-
‘melted butter’, adduced by Mayrhofer as a possible relative of sasarparī́- (EWA s.v.
sarpís-). My tr. “squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī” reflects my sense that all
of these words have contributed to the designation sasarparī́- and these contributions
are positive: sabardúgha- and sarpís- reflect the fecundity and richness associated
with juice and fat, sarīsṛpa- the uncontainable vitality of a squirming young animal.
Needless to say, this is highly speculative and does not rest on properly chaste
etymological principles, but it is difficult to see what could with regard to this
maddening but phonologically delectable word.
The next question to ask is why Sasarparī “banishes neglect” (ámatim
bā́dhamānā). Again this phrase supports the notion that the referent of sasarparī́- is a
cow. In I.53.4 and X.42.10 ámati- is overcome by cows; the word is paired with
hunger (kṣúdh-) in VIII.66.14, X.42.10, and X.43.3. Hunger and neglect can be
combatted with cows and their nourishing products, and one of the combatants is
Sasarparī.

### 16  
Besides the continuing problem of sasarparī́-, the other difficulty is the
hapax pakṣyā̀in c. Gr takes it as ‘aus Monatshälften bestehend’ (flg. BR), Ge (/WG)
‘auf meiner Seite stehend’, Re as ‘ailée’ or ‘prenant parti (pour moi)’. The publ. tr.
strikes out on its own (though closest to Re’s first alternative). It involves reading
sā́pakṣyā̀against the Pp (but involving no change in the Saṃhitā text), to be divided
sā́apakṣyā̀. The latter would be the instr. of a nominal abstract in -
i
yā- (see AiG
II.2.840), a rare but attested type built primarily to -a-stems. Here potentially to
apakṣá- ‘wingless’ (cf. AV XI.5.21), hence ‘winglessness’. What might this bizarre
confection have to do with the passage? The rather flimsy connection is via the
daughter of the Sun (sū́ryasya duhitā́in 15c) and a possible reference to Dawn in
16c: the same phrase návyam ā́yur dádhānā is used of Dawn in VII.80.2). (Like) the
former, Sasarparī has stretched the Kuśikas’ fame to the gods; (like) the latter, she
has brought fame to all the five peoples. These feats might be expected to require
60
special forms of transport, such as wings, if the agent is not a supernatural traveler
like Dawn or the Sun’s Daughter. But Sasarparī is a cow, hence wingless.
I realize how fragile -- and potentially ludicrous -- this suggestion is, however,
and it might be better to play it safe with something like ‘on my side’.

### 17  
As noted in the publ. intro., this verse and the rest of this little section are
reminiscent of the final vs. of III.33.13, against disaster on a journey, specifically
there a river crossing.
The hapax pātalyè is entirely unclear, besides being a dual referring to some
part of the chariot.
On the thematic medial stem dáda- in the sense ‘hold, keep safe’, see Gotō (1st
Class, 171-72, flg. Wackernagel).

### 19  
On abhí vyayasva see comm. ad VII.33.4. I assume ‘engird’ refers to the
ends of the axle being embedded in the wheel hub.
The loc. spandané is generally taken as a third type of wood (besides khadiráand śiṃśápā-), but while the other two words are standard designations of trees,
spandaná- is ordinarily not, but rather refers to a type of motion -- jerking or kicking.
I take it to refer here to the elasticity or flexibility of Dalbergia sissoo (śiṃsapā-), a
quality it has (at least acdg. to the internet).

### 20  
On the problematic ā́vasā́ā́(Saṃhitā) / ā́ava’saí ā́(Pp.), see detailed disc.
by Scar (576-77), who lays out the various phonological and morphological
possibilities. As he points out, the reading of Holland van Nooten, ā́ávasā ā́, with
accent on the first a (possible on the basis of the Saṃhitā text) and deaccentuation of
the final ā of the noun (contra both Saṃhitā and Pp), makes no sense (and does not
conform to the transmitted text). The nominal form between the two ā́’s is by most
accounts a root noun cmpd of √sā + áva. The question is what the case form is. I
follow Whitney (§971a) and Old in reading -ās, contra the Pp., interpreting it (with
Whitney and Old) as an irregular abl. sg. to this root noun cmpd. (expect *avasás) in
infinitival usage. The parallelism in the hemistich supports this interpr., but see the
other possibilities offered by Scar.
### 21-24
As noted in the publ. intro., these vss. are traditionally taken as
depicting the rivalry between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, but I see no sign of this here;
certainly Vasiṣṭha is not mentioned. The verbal link is supposed to be VII.104.16
adhamás padīṣṭa “let him fall lowest,” a curse uttered in a Vasiṣṭha hymn that echoes
our 21c ádharaḥ sás padīṣṭa. But in neither case is the opponent named, and there is
no reason to assume that Vasiṣṭha directs this at Viśvāmitra or vice versa.
The first vs. of this sequence (21) is quite straightforward; vs. 22 is more
complex, but I feel fairly confident in its interpr. But vss. 23-24 are very difficult,
and my interpr. is correspondingly quite provisional.
61

### 22  
With Old, I reject the interpr. of cid in abc as a simile particle (contra Sāy
and Ge); in all three cases the cid can be interpreted in its usual ‘even, even though,
just’ sense. However, I differ from Old on the purport of the vs. He thinks it
describes concrete events, possibly as a “Beschreibung von Zauberhandlungen,”
while I think it contains two figurative descriptions of the impotence of the enemy --
in this I am closer to Ge’s notion of similes than to Old. I also find myself in the odd
position of being in general agreement with Griffith’s interpr. (based on Ludwig’s).
Each hemistich describes an action involving great effort and drama that produces
trivial and insubstantial results. In ab an ax is thoroughly heated, but this formidable
weapon only cuts off the blossom of a silk cotton tree. (That silk cotton tree flowers
are a vivid red might remind the audience of the real blood that might have been shed
by a blazing hot ax.) In cd a pot, also heated, is boiling (yéṣantī), indeed has boiled
over (práyastā), but all it produces is foam.

### 23  
In my opinion, at least the first half of this vs. continues the sentiment of vs.
22: the enemy is powerless, despite bluff and bluster. In pāda a older translations
supply an unidentified subject (“he”) for cikite, but the medial perfect of √cit is
always pass.-intrans. and with Kü (176) I take the verb as an impersonal passive with
an oblique subj. in the genitive; cf. I.51.7 táva vájraś cikite with the subject in the
more normal nom. The point here is that the opponent’s missile (sā́yaka-) is so
inconsequential as not to attract or deserve notice.
In b the first problem is the hapax lodhá-, which is universally taken as a red
animal of some sort, a horse (Ge, Re), fox (Gr), or goat (Old, tentatively EWA). My
quite different tr. ‘clod’ assumes (again, very tentatively) an association with a loose
set of words for lump, clod, etc.: loṭṭha (Pkt., etc. =Vedic loṣṭá-, perhaps by
hypersanskritization) (Turner 11157), *lottha / *lodda / *loddha (Tu. 11137), *luṭṭa
(Tu 11077). The point would then be that “they” (whoever they are) lead (to
sacrifice?) a lump of earth or the like, thinking that it’s an actual (sacrificial?) beast.
This situation reminds us of the chariot race of Mudgala and Mudgalānī (X.102) in
which a block of wood is yoked with a bull, and the oddly assorted pair still wins the
race (X.102.8-9). It might also remind us of X.28.9 in which an earth clod (logá-, not
too distant phonologically) splits a stone. The other morphological fact of note in this
pāda is that páśu is neut. and initially accented (versus the ubiquitous masc. paśú-).
This may be a deep archaism, matching Lat. pecu, Goth. faihu (cf. AiG II.1.20,
II.2.474), or it may be a nonce attempt to de-animatize the word in this peculiar
context.
Like vs. 22 and 23a, 23b describes an undesirable situation exactly contrary to
what was aimed at: having mistaken a lump for a sacrificial animal, the actors will
surely not get the results they wanted -- although X.102.8-9 and X.28.9 may point to
success in unlikely circumstances. But the second hemistich depicts situations in
which, though a mistake was possible, it was not made: they don’t set a bad horse
(ávājin-) to race with a good one; they don’t put a donkey before the horses. The
question is whether the subjects of the three 3rd pl. verbs (nayanti b, hāsayanti c,
nayanti again d) are the same, or are the deluded weaklings of ab being contrasted
62
with more clear-headed and successful actors in cd? Common sense suggests the
latter, but the morphologically identical sequence of verbs with no overt subject or
change of subject the former (as Old points out). I cannot make up my mind, esp.
because the following vs. muddies the waters even further.
Given the interpretational difficulties, the grammatical identity of áśvān is a
minor problem. In the publ. tr. I take it as acc. pl. áśvān, but the Pp. interprets it as
abl. áśvāt, with the final -n in sandhi before the nasal of nayanti. Either is possible
(“lead before the horses” / “lead before the horse”), and given the uncertainty of
meaning, there is no obvious way to choose. The abl. is supposed to be construed
with puráḥ, but in fact ABL. + puráḥ is not a robust construction.

### 24  
The good sense / bad sense problem continues, or returns, here. The sons
of Bharata are ceremonially presented to us, with the here-and-now deictic imé. And
we know from vs. 12 that the Bharata people (bhā́rata- jána-) are our people. But
here they (or the subjects of the three 3rd pl. verbs: cikituḥ b, hinvánti c, pári ṇayanti
d) seem to make the same bad choices that were visible in vss. 22-23, esp. 23b. The
continuation of the 3rd pl. verbs invites us to make the Bharatas subjects also in vs. 22.
Is this a jokey anti-dānastuti? Are the “bad choices” I just mentioned meant to show
that even if they do stupid things, they will still beat the incompetents depicted in vs.
22? Or that bad choices can still sometimes unaccountably lead to good? I am baffled.
The mealtime prapitvá- is well attested in the RV, but apapitvá- is found only
here. Both Ge and Re take the words in some kind of figurative sense (e.g., Re
apapitvá- ‘la retraite’, prapitvá- ‘l’élan-en-avant’), but since the -pitvá- compounds
are otherwise only used of meals and the times of day associated with them, it seems
best to maintain that sense here; so WG ‘die Nachessenzeit’, ‘die Voressenzeit’. In
its contrast with pra here, I take apa as meaning ‘leaving the meal, post-prandial’ and
therefore ‘non-meal’. My interpr. is influenced by my sense that the lesser choice is
the one being made in each case in this vs.
In c the standard tr. take ná as a simile marker: “they incite their own horse
like an alien one.” But given the paired negative clauses in 23cd and the undoubted
negative (or at least undoubted by the standard tr.) in the immediately preceding pāda
(24b), where the ná takes the same position as in c, the pattern seems to impose
another negative here. Under either interpr. the action is not a very smart one:
spurring your own horse like an alien one should presumably mean that you don’t
spur it at all.
The accentuation of jyā̀- in the bahuvrīhi jyā̀-vāja-, against simplex jyā́-, is
attributed to the shift to initial accent in some other bahuvrīhis: AiG II.1.293 with
Nachtr. 81. The standard tr. avoid the problem of the sense of this cmpd by
attributing to -vāja- a sense it doesn’t otherwise have: Ge (WG; cf. Gr) Schnelligkeit,
Re la force. But vā́ja- means ‘prize’ and bahuvrīhis with it as 2nd member ‘having X
as prize’. I here assume that winning only a bowstring (minus the bow) would not be
a glorious outcome.

All Gods 
63

### 01
All four pādas contain a distracted -
i
ya- form immediately after an early
caesura.
The expression “listen with his … faces” is somewhat comic, though clearly
domestic and heavenly “faces” refer to Agni’s aspects in those two places.

### 02
With Ge (/WG) I supply “to those two” in b, to provide both a goal for icháñ
carati and an antecedent for yáyoḥ in c.
III.54.3-4: The co-occurrence of ṛtá- and satyá- in these two vss. (3a, 4b) is striking.
In keeping with my estimation of the difference in meaning between the two, I tr. the
first as ‘truth’ and the latter as ‘real(ity)’. In both cases here the sense of satyá- is
close to the English idiom “come true,” that is, “become real.” In 3a the poet is
asking that the cosmic truth(s) associated with Heaven and Earth be realized in our
own sphere, that H+E put themselves out, as it were, for our benefit. 4ab also
concerns the truth(s) associated with H+E -- hence the adj. ṛ́tāvarī ‘truthful’ -- and
the older poets, in finding these two entities that possess their own truth(s), spoke
words (presumably about and in praise of H+E) that both reflected the reality of
those truths and that also came true (satyavā́caḥ). This vs. esp. emphasizes the poets’
process of discovery of the truths about H+E.
As Re points out, the vs. contrasts the priests or poets in ab with the warriors
in cd.

### 05
The first pāda is also found in the famous cosmogonic (or anti-cosmogonic)
hymn X.129, as 6a. The final pāda of that hymn, X.129.7d, ends with an incomplete
sentence “or if he does not know …?” (yádi vā ná véda). Though all the standard tr.
of this vs. here find a way to incorporate our 5d into the syntax of the verse, I by
contrast think the same trailing off into uncertainty is found here as in X.129.7. The
lower seats of the gods in heaven can be seen, but not the ones in the higher realms.
We can only discover so much. As for grammar, I take the yā́of d as a neut. pl.
referring to sádāṃsi in c (so also Re, though with a slightly different interpr. of the
rest). Ge (/WG) instead take it as a fem. nom. sg. referring to the pathyā̀in b, with c
as parenthetical. I do not entirely understand the vratéṣu in d. The hidden
commandments may be the laws that govern the further reaches of the cosmos.

### 06
On the somewhat anomalous use of nṛcákṣas- here see comm. ad III.53.9.
The first pāda of this vs. seems to imply that, though the higher seats of the
gods are not generally visible (5d), a kaví-, despite having only a man’s sight, has
been able to see (abhí … acaṣṭa) Heaven and Earth whole, and that he is cognizant of
the crucial paradox about them --- that they are joined but still distinct -- a paradox
treated in the rest of the vs. and the following one (7).
The interpr. of b is hampered by the hapax víghṛte. On the surface it appears
to belong to the root √ghṛ ‘sprinkle’, but it is difficult to make this yield immediate
sense. It appears to serve the same function as víyute ‘separated’ in the next vs. (7a),
64
and it has therefore been suggested that -ghṛta- actually belong to the root √hṛ ‘take’
or is a byform thereof (see, e.g., KEWA III.578). My publ. tr. reflects a tacit
acceptance of such a view (or at least a willingness not to probe it too deeply), but I
now wonder (without full conviction) whether in the context of mádantī ‘becoming
exhilarated’ a sense that connects víghṛte to √ghṛ ‘sprinkle’ might be possible:
“sprinkled separately but becoming exhilarated (together).” In any event I take it as a
dual fem. acc. (with Ge [/WG]), not, with Re, a loc. sg. with yónā.
My tr. also depends on assuming that the exhilarating is happening jointly, in
contrast to whatever type of separation is indicated by the ví-prefixed ppl. -- the same
contrast between unity and separation found in cd. The place where this is happening
in b, “the womb of truth” (ṛtásya yónā), may refer to two different places, the ritual
ground (as so often) and, perhaps, the distant invisible seats referred to in 5d.

### 07
The -ū́ka-stem jāgarū́ka- in b is found only here in Vedic. I wonder if it
owes its -ka-suffix to the femininized context of c, where H+E are identified as
“sisters and young women” (svásārā yuvatī́) despite their oppositely gendered names.
On -ka- in women’s language, see my “Women’s Language in the Rig Veda?” (Gd.
Elizarenkova, 2008) and “Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-ka-Suffix:
A Marker of Colloquial Register” (IIJ 53 [2009]).
Note the virtual mirror image of víyute (a) and yuvatī́(c).
I do not understand the use of ā́d u here. Ordinarily this old ablative has a
fairly strong temporal (“just after that”) or logical (“because of that”) sense, but since
c has a concessive force (“although being …”), it is difficult to get ā́d to have logical
force, and the fact of being sisters but called different names does not seem to have a
temporal dimension. It reminds of the ca … ā́d in 11cd, but there ā́d easily expresses
a standard temporal sense. It is possible, but extremely speculative, that the ā́d does
reflect some sort of cosmic temporality: H+E, originally joined together, had a single
identity and gender, but after the cosmogonic separation they received different, and
genderedly oppositional, names. The monism of the next vs. (8cd) might (barely)
support such an idea; note that “the One” there is neut. (ékam).
The standard interpr. (see Ge, etc.) of mithunā́ni nā́ma is that their names are
of different genders when they are given separate names, with dyaúḥ generally masc.
and pṛthivī́fem. But they are also paired sisters, with the fem. du. designation ródasī.
This seems correct, and the publ. tr. should probably have reflected this sense of
mithuná- better. I am somewhat puzzled by why the names are in the plural, however.

### 08
The notion of the pair of H+E, separate but unified, is, in the 2nd hemistich,
replaced by an even starker contrast, the One (ékam, neut. as noted in comm. to
previous vs.), which controls the Many, with the Many first configured as
oppositional pairs in the neuter: the moving and the fixed (éjad dhruvám), the
walking/roaming and the flying (cárad patatrí). ékam is found at the end of its pāda,
just as it is in the refrain to the next hymn (III.55).
65

### 09
On the meaning of this vs. see publ. intro. It is the final vs. of the hymnwithin-the hymn, vss. 2-9 dedicated to Heaven and Earth. The 1st ps. poet reappears
here; he is first found in vs. 2, the beginning of this self-contained portion, and has
been absent since, though he may be related to the 3rd ps. kaví- in vs. 6.
As indicated in the publ. intro., I think this vs. has a double meaning, aided by
the double readings of two items in it: ádhi √i, which means both ‘go upon’
(literally) and ‘study’ (‘go over’, figuratively), and the unnamed dyaúḥ, present both
as the divinity Heaven alluded to in the phrase in b “great father, begetter” (gen.
maháḥ pitúr janitúḥ; for this as a designation of dyaúḥ cf., e.g., I.164.33 dyaúr me
pitā́janitā́) and as heaven the place, suggested by the locational adv. yátra ‘where’ in
c, introducing the place where the gods take their stand. The poet is both studying the
ancient cosmic mysteries he has been attempting to understand in the previous vss.
(esp. 5-6) and is embarking on the path that leads to the place where the gods are
established, beyond the ken of mortals. Recall the question in 5b “What is the
pathway that leads to the gods?” (devā́m̐áchā pathyā̀kā́sám eti), a question followed
by the statement that only the lower seats of the gods are visible. Here purāṇám in
pāda a can qualify ‘path’ -- not the fem. pathyā̀in 5b but the more familiar masc.
pánthā-, qualified as purāṇá- in IV.18.1 (cf. also purāṇám ókaḥ ‘ancient home’ in
nearby III.58.6, referring to the Aśvins’ dwelling, presumably also heaven). The gods
are themselves on a separate path (pathí vyùte d) in the same place, at least by my
interpr. Despite their different representations in the (written) Saṃhitā text and in the
Pp., vyùta- here and víyuta- in 7a must be the same form, ppl. to ví √yu; in recitation
they would be identical. The verb unoti to the supposed root √u to which vyùta- is
sometimes referred (see, e.g., Ge n. 9d) is actually also a form of √yu, in the
sequence vyùnoti in V.31.1, also meaning ‘separates’. Cf. EWA II.503.

### 10  
This vs. forms a sort of ring with vs. 1, enclosing the Heaven and Earth
hymnlet of vss. 2-9. Like vs. 1 it begins with imám followed by a word for hymn (1a
imám … śūṣám, 10a imáṃ stómam), and with 1cd it contains a verb form of √śru
‘hear’ with god(s) as subject (10b).
On ṛdūdára- see EWA s.v. ARD, though he is somewhat cagey about its
formation. I assume the 2nd member is udára- ‘belly’, with the literal sense ‘moistbellied’ being equivalent to our ‘tender-hearted’. This assumes a bahuvrīhi with an
adjectival first member of the form ṛdu-, a shape (disyllabic adj. ending in -i- or -u-)
that often triggers (or is at least associated with) 2nd member accent in bahuvrīhis
(see AiG II.1.296ff.).

### 11  
The first hemistich is either a syntactic fragment -- a long NP in the
nominative establishing the topic -- or pátyamānaḥ is a predicated pres. part. (The
publ. tr. takes it as the former.)
In c ca appears to be subordinating, given the accent on the verb áśreḥ. I
would now be inclined to delete the “and” in the publ. tr. and remove the parens.
from “when.”
66

### 14  
I am not entirely certain why “victorious Bhaga” is brought in here in a
simile in this Viṣṇu vs. I suppose that our praises are making a triumphal procession
to Viṣṇu, and the mention of Bhaga may suggest our hope that these praises will be
met with a satisfactory portion of goods in return. See 21c below.
In cd it is tempting (see, e.g., Old) to make mardhanti the verb of the rel. cl.
beginning with yásya, which otherwise lacks a verb and appears truncated. But
mardhanti is stubbornly unaccented. Construing yásya pūrvī́ḥ as a relativized
expression of possession, we can assume that it asserts that Viṣṇu has a large female
entourage; these females are further characterized in the independent clause in d as
“generatrices” (jánitrīḥ), for which “mothers-to-be” seemed a more acceptable
English rendering, who attend on him and do not neglect him. What this is all about
escapes me, though Viṣṇu is associated with the wives of the gods in I.156.2.

### 15  
The standard tr. construe the instr. víśvair vīryaìḥ as the object of
pátyamānaḥ (“being master of all vīryá-), but when pátya- takes an object, it is in the
acc., including once in this hymn: 8c patyate víśvam. In the only other passage in
which Gr identifies the verb stem as taking an instr., VI.13.4, I take the instr. as here,
as expressing the means by which the subject displays his mastery.

### 16  
The first half-vs. treats the kinship we share with the Aśvins, a theme
occasionally touched on elsewhere (e.g., VIII.73.12 adduced by Ge). The
grammatical problem in the hemistich is the (pseudo-)root noun cmpd. bandhupṛ́ch-,
which has been interpr. both actively (“asking about [their] kinship”: Gr, Ge [/WG],
Lü 526, Scar 328-29) and passively (“asked about [their] kinship”: Re). I have
followed the Re path, on the assumption that it is more likely that humans are asking
the Aśvins about it than that the Aśvins are wondering about it themselves. But in
general I prefer root noun compounds to have active meaning, and it is possible that
the majority position is the correct one. It does not seem to have too much effect on
the interpr. of the rest.

### 17  
There is phraseological connection between the first pāda of this vs. and
the previous vs.: cā́ru nā́ma “dear name” repeats verbatim the end of 16b, and though
they are etymologically unrelated, kavayaḥ in 17a echoes ákavaiḥ in 16d.
The first half of the verse most likely refers to the Ṛbhus, though they are not
named until c. The “dear name” of these unnamed subjects is probably “gods,” the
predicative voc. devā(ḥ) in b. The Ṛbhus were not originally divine, but achieved the
status of gods because of their wondrous acts in the sacrifice. So to be addressed as
“gods” by Indra is precious to them indeed.
The second half-vs. consists of a pāda (c) with a sg. nom. (sákhā) referring to
Indra, accompanied by a pl. instr. (ṛbhúbhiḥ) and no verb, followed by one (d) with a
2nd pl. impv. (takṣatā). It is tempting to construe the two pādas together, with a
mixture of constructions: the sg. nom. + instr. serving as the equivalent of a pl. subj.
to the verb in d, but I have kept strictly to the grammar, as do the standard tr.
67

### 18  
Ge (/WG) takes pl. yajñíyāsaḥ as predicated of aryamā́… áditiḥ with pāda
a simply a nominal clause; this is strictly impossible, since the predicate adj. should
be dual. Ge explains the plural on the grounds that the poet is thinking of the other
Ādityas. This is possible, but I prefer to take yajñíyāsaḥ as a third term referring to
an unspecified set of other gods (quite possibly the rest of the Ādityas), and all three
terms as the subj. of pl. yuyóta in c. (So also Re.) The naḥ in pāda a then simply
anticipates the same form in c, and b is parenthetical.
### 19-20
The call to the gods to hear us, found first in vs. 1, returns here at
almost the end of the hymn (19c, 20a, 20c). Note that in 19c the verb is sg. (śṛṇótu)
with a series of sg. subjects (and one pl., ā́paḥ, in the middle), while in 20a it is pl.
(śṛṇvantu) with a grammatically pl. subj. In 20c a sg. nom. with an instr. pl. of
accompaniment (rather like the construction I suggested in 17c) takes a sg. verb,
which suggests that my suggestion for 17c is incorrect.

### 21  
The standard tr. take bhágaḥ as the subj. of mṛdhyā(ḥ) in c; e.g., Ge
“Bhaga [das Glück] möge in meiner Freundschaft nicht fehlen, o Agni.” With such a
3rd ps. subj., this requires mṛdhyāḥ to be a precative (Re calls it a “pseudo-précatif”
for some reason) rather than a straight 2nd sg. opt. This is, of course, not impossible.
But the desire expressed here, that Agni make sure that Bhaga does the right thing,
does not seem the usual type of prayer addressed to gods in the RV. I take pāda c as
consisting of two clauses, the first nominal, the 2nd, addressed to Agni, consisting
only of a negative and a verb (cf. for this construction with this verb, ná mardhanti in
14d above), with Agni the subj. I take bhágaḥ as a common noun in the publ. tr.;
alternatively it might mean “(May) Bhaga (be) in partnership with me.”
The final word of the vs., the gen. purukṣóḥ ‘consisting in much livestock’, is
a bahuvrīhi variant of the phrase bhū́ri paśváḥ ‘abundance of livestock’, likewise
ending its vs. in 15d.

### 22  
Old is disturbed by tā́m̐in c and suggests emending pṛtsú tā́m̐to pṛtsutā́,
loc. sg. of pṛtsutí-. Because of the peculiar mid-pāda position of tā́n, I favor this
suggestion though it requires erasing one accent.
## 055
All Gods
As noted in the published introduction, this hymn is notable for its refrain,
“great is the one and only lordship of the gods” (mahád devā́nām asuratvám ékam),
with its juxtaposition of devá- and ásura-.

### 01
The perfect in b, ví jajñe, is entirely ambiguous between √jan and √jñā, and
I think it likely that both are meant. In this context there is not too much difference
between a syllable being born and being discerned. The “track of the cow” is
presumably here the ritual ground, and the reference is to the ritual speech of the
dawn sacrifice.
68
Re astutely notes the juxtaposition of akṣára- and padá-, reinforcing the
speech theme, even though padá- has the sense of ‘track, footprint’ here. See padáin the next vs. (2b) for a possible reference to speech.
The standard tr. all supply a first-person subject in c, with a verb like “I
proclaim.” No one but Old attempts to justify this addition, and his attempt is halfhearted. I instead take c as continuing b and take the underlying form of prabhū́ṣan
to be prabhū́ṣat, neut. nom./acc. sg., before a following nasal, against the Pp. The
participle modifies akṣáram in b. In my interpr. the “syllable” (that is, the essence of
speech) attends to the gods’ commandments, perhaps by giving them imperishable
verbal form. I also suggest that the “great syllable” is actually the refrain found in d;
note that mahā́t in b takes the same position as it does in the refrain. The refrain may
also be the most important of the gods’ vratas; see also 6c.

### 02
For juhuranta see comm. ad I.43.8; I take the form to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly’,
not √hṛ ‘anger, be angry’. The point here is that the gods and the ancestors, who
themselves know the path/word, should not keep us from following this same ritual
cursus. There is no question of anger that I can see.
The standard interpr., that c refers to the beacon of the kindled ritual fire
visible between heaven and earth, is surely correct. This kindled fire is referred to
more straightforwardly in the next vs., 3c sámiddhe agnaú.

### 03
The flying, scattered desires of the poet here and his turn, in a ritual context,
to the old ways of doing things reminds us of the opening of III.38, a hymn about the
development of a poetic vocation within the age-old tradition, esp. III.38.1cd. In this
connection it’s worth noting that our refrain, mahád devā́nām asuratvám ékam, finds
an echo in III.38.4c mahát tád vṛ́ṣṇo ásurasya nā́ma “Great is that name of the bull,
the lord.” Ge also appositely adduces VI.9.6, also about a poet’s training and his selfconscious assumption of the mantle of tradition, with his inspiration deriving from
the ritual fire.
The ṛtá- that we wish to speak may again be the refrain that follows
immediately.

### 04
The ví … purutrā́of the preceding vs. (3a) returns here, though with the
preverb bound to a ppl. (víbhṛtaḥ); the phrase is contrasted with samāná- to express
the theme of unity and diversity in balance. The “common king” is of course Agni,
and the image is both of this single god being found on many different ritual grounds
and of the ritual fire on any particular ritual ground being divided into three.
With Ge, I assume that the pair in c is the kindling sticks. Cf. III.31.2d and
X.27.14b, esp. tasthaú mātā́“the mother stands still,” comparable to our kṣéti mātā́
“the mother rests peacefully.” The epithet ‘having two mothers’ (dvimātár-) used of
Agni in 6a and 7a is a reference to the paired kindling sticks.

### 05
As is generally acknowledged, the feminine plurals in the first hemistich
refer to plants; the idea is the common paradox that fire is covertly present in all
69
plants because overt fire is produced from wood. Here the three types of plants must
be 1) ‘older’ (pū́rvā-) = woody and easily burned, 2) ‘later’ (áparā-) = still green and
obviously growing and fire grows up with them, 3) tender (táruṇī-) = sprouting ones,
which are hard to burn, but he's in them already anyway. Most tr. take sadyáḥ with
Agni, not the new-born plants -- e.g., Re “est d'un coup au dedans des (plantes)
nouvelle(-ment) nées” -- but sadyáḥ is strongly associated with forms of √jan, esp. in
III (e.g., III.5.8 sadyó jātáḥ; sim. III.32.9, 10; 48.1), in the sense of “just born.”
The covert presence of fire is the topic of the paradox in c: he is always within
the plants (antárvatīḥ) even though they have not been impregnated (ápravītāḥ)
sexually.

### 06
There seems to be a consensus that the phrase śayúḥ parástāt in pāda a
refers to a form of Agni in the other world, that is, to the sun in some manifestation
(see esp. Ge n. 6ab). This seems to me entirely unnecessary and a cosmic intrusion in
a sustained description that is otherwise entirely focused on the ritual fire (vss. 1-9).
Instead the hemistich seems to contrast the fire that was immanent and motionless
(śayúḥ) in the plants, as described in vs. 5, released after birth and roaming restlessly,
as a newly kindled fire does. The depiction of his resting place as ‘far away’
(parástāt) may seem exaggerated if only plants are involved, but conceptually, and to
a certain extent physically (since the kindling wood has to have been gathered from
somewhere), it seems to me appropriate.

### 07
Pāda b is a elaboration on and corrective of 6b. It is not the whole fire that
wanders untethered, only the top of it (ágram), while the base stays put on the hearth.
Most tr. take ágram as an acc. with ánu; I follow Re (who in turn follows Bergaigne)
in taking it as the neut. nom. subj.
The accent on cárati is contrastive with the immediately following kṣéti,
which opens a new clause.

### 08
This verse contains quite oblique phraseology. The first half-verse appears
to describe the increasingly aggressive ritual fire after it has been kindled. I take āyát
as the neut. pres. part. to √i + ā́‘come’, substantivized to mean ‘approach, advent’,
and I supply a gen. ‘of him’, which is parallel to the gen. simile in pāda a. The
growing fire is compared to a fighter involved in close combat. I have rendered
pratīcī́nam, lit. ‘turned outward, opposite, face to face’, as the slangy ‘right in your
face’ to convey the belligerent nearness of the fire’s approach.
The c pāda is likewise hard to interpret. As Ge notes, the lexeme antár √car is
generally used for the journey between earth and heaven undertaken by Agni, the
messenger or “go-between” for the earthly and heavenly realms. This usage is found
in fact in the very next vs., 9b, where Agni is clearly the subject and is journeying
through the space between heaven and earth -- as well as in numerous other passages
(see esp. X.4.2). As Ge also points out, in I.173.3 it is ‘Speech’ (vā́k) who plays this
role. Similarly, in our passage ‘thought’ (matí-) -- i.e., as often, thought that has
taken shape as ritual speech -- is the subject and undertakes the role of messenger. As
70
for the tribute of the cow (niṣṣídhaṃ góḥ), with Ge I take this as referring to the
bovine product that serves as oblation, namely ghee. Thus, ritual speech makes the
swift journey to the gods in heaven from the ritual ground, bringing the news of the
oblation or serving as its envoy. On niṣṣídh- see comm. ad III.51.5.

### 09
In pāda a the “gray messenger” is Agni, gray because of his ash; I take the
fem. pl. āsu as referring to the plants (see vs. 5) that provide the fuel that feeds
Agni’s flames. The fire “bears down on them” (/ “keeps pursuing them”; ní veveti) as
it spreads over the firewood. (A reference to his hearths is also possible, but I think
less likely.)
In contrast to the earthly spread of the fire depicted in pāda a, b shows it
rising towards heaven in its messenger role. I take rocanéna as an instr. of extent of
space, rather than referring to Agni’s own luminosity with the standard tr. However,
taking it in the latter way would not appreciably alter the sense of the pāda.
The publ. tr. is somewhat misleading, in having ‘bearing’ for both ní veveti in
a and bíbhrat in c, though of course English ‘bear’ has entirely different senses in the
two idioms.

### 10  
This verse continues the theme of vss. 8-9, Agni’s role as go-between. Its
point is to show us that Agni as messenger reaches to the highest places in heaven,
those defined by the endpoint of Viṣṇu’s famous striding. But the introduction of
Viṣṇu also initiates the transition from the exclusive focus on Agni and his kindling.
Note the alliteration: (go)pā́ḥ paramaṃ pāti pā́thaḥ, priyā́…

### 11  
The yád in pāda c has no obvious function. JSK (I.136) interprets the pāda
as containing an “X and which Y” construction (“the dusky one and [the one] who is
ruddy”), with yád instead of yā́by attraction to the anyád of b. Although this is a
tempting way to account for the yád, in addition to the wrong gender the rel. is
wrongly positioned: we should expect *yád/yā́ca áruṣī. Ge’s suggestion, that this
contains the izafe-like [not Ge’s term] yád that attaches appositives in Vedic prose,
may be correct. It’s also worth noting that the structure of c is identical to 12a mātā́
ca yátra duhitā́ca dhenū́, with two nom. singulars conjoined by double ca, a yasubordinator between them, and a dual nom. at the end of the pāda referring jointly
to the two singulars. So it is possible that the yád of 11c comes from the model of
12a, where yátra has function.

### 12  
With Ge I interpret this fem. pairing to be Night and Dawn, who in the
previous vs. were identified as sisters. They jointly nurse the infant fire at the early
morning sacrifice; the reference is probably to twilight, the transition between Night
and Dawn. Re prefers to identify them as Heaven and Earth, but this requires him to
interpret Heaven as a female, and it also makes less ritual sense. On the other hand,
the same fem. dual samīcī́is used in vs. 12 of Heaven and Earth.
71

### 13  
The pāda-initial position of anyásyā(ḥ) strongly suggests that it is
indefinite (‘another’, not ‘the other’), contra the standard tr. Since definite anyá- …
anyá- (“the one … the other”) is correctly positioned in 11b, 15b, and 17ab, I think
we should take the contrastive positioning seriously and connect this phraseology
with 4c, which also contains initial anyá- (anyā́vatsám bhárati kṣéti mātā́“Another
bears the calf; the mother rests peacefully.”). In that passage the “mother” of the fire,
the lower kindling stick, rested, while the upper kindling stick, identified as “another,”
carried the infant fire. Here the situation is reversed: the anyā́- form refers to the
mother of the calf/fire, which is now being licked by a different feminine entity -- in
this case, in my opinion, the ghee oblation. A second pairing also imposes itself,
however: in vs. 12 we had a different feminine duo: Night and Dawn. Their
proximity in 12 invites an alternative reading of 13a, underscoring the temporal
transition, with Night functioning as the mother of the fire, but Dawn taking over,
tending it and bellowing over it. This latter interpr. seems to be continued in the next
vs. (14ab).
I confess that I do not entirely understand the purport of pāda b (nor, as far as
I can see, does anyone else). The hemistich is found identically also in X.27.14cd,
though given the virtual impenetrability of that hymn, this doesn’t help much. Contra
Ge (/Gr, etc.), I do not think bhū́- here is ‘world’, nor that the instr. expression káyā
bhuvā́means “in welcher Welt” (see Old for objection to this tr.). Instead I take bhū́-
as ‘form’ or (with Old, etc.) ‘existence-form’, with the phrase meaning “in what
shape or guise.” I suspect that the pāda asks how the surrogate mother/cow, who took
over from the fire’s mother in pāda a, will deliver nourishment (symbolized by her
udder) to the infant fire. The answer may be given in pāda c: it is “the milk of truth”
(ṛtásya … páyas-), which we might further translate into “the milk of correct ritual
speech.”

### 14  
Ge (/WG) takes pádyā as merely a locational ‘unten’, contrasting with
ūrdhvā́at the beginning of the next pāda. It seems unlikely that a formation with so
much lexical content would be used in so colorless a manner, esp. given the
deployment of padá-forms elsewhere in the hymn (padé iva níhite beginning the next
vs. [15a], padé góḥ 1b, padajṇā́ḥ 2b). The “feet” of Dawn are presumably, in
naturalistic terms, the light of dawn nearest to the horizon; shining through morning
mists it will take on various shapes and colors. (Lü [617 n. 3] suggests that the
various shapes and forms are vegetation on the earth, which is also worth
considering.) But in mytho-ritual terms, if Dawn is the cow nurturing the young fire
in 13b (as well as pāda b in this vs.), the “wondrous forms” (vápūṃṣi) she clothes
herself in and the “many shapes” she possesses (pururū́pā) are the forms and colors
of the fire over which she stands. That the scene is set on the ritual ground is
suggested by pāda c, where “I” roam across “the seat of truth” (ṛtásya sádma), which
I take as a reference to seat of the ritual. Ge (/WG), however, interpret the pāda as
simply meaning “I wander ‘im Geiste’” -- I think because of the vidvā́n ‘knowing’,
though that word usually refers to knowledge of the ritual or to cosmic knowledge
related to the religio-ritual system.
72
With Ge (/WG) I take pururū́pā as fem. nom. sg.; however, it can equally be
neut. acc. pl. (with Gr and Re) modifying vápūṃṣi. The choice actually has almost no
effect on the sense of the pāda.
### 14-15
The publ. tr. is somewhat misleading, in that vápūṃṣi in 14a is tr. as
“wondrous forms” and dasmé in 15a as “the wondrous one.” I might substitute
“marvellous forms” for the first, to avoid the impression of an etymological
connection.

### 15  
This vs. seems to continue the theme of Night and Dawn. The anyád …
anyád construction of pāda b echoes that in 11b, where Night and Dawn were first
introduced, and in fact our pāda b, with one hidden and one visible, paraphrases 11b,
with one shining and the other black, and forms a small ring.
Moreover, the two “set down within the wondrous one” echoes 12c ṛtásya té
sádasy īḷe antáḥ “I reverently invoke the two within the seat of truth.” I take dasmáto refer to the ritual fire/ritual ground, and one of the marvels is that two such large
entities (Night and Dawn) can fit into something so small.
The vs. also recycles various thematically significant lexical items: padá- (see
comm. ad 14); nihité echoing ní dadhe (13b); antár (12c and passim: 2c, 5b, 5c, 8c,
9b, 12c; antár is in a sense the signature word of this hymn); anyád … anyád 11b.
The ‘pathway’ (pathyā̀) takes us back to III.54.5 where a question about “the
pathway leading to the gods” (devā́m̐áchā pathyā̀) initiated the mysteries that have
dogged us ever since.

### 16  
The miraculous milkers in this vs. are taken by all standard tr. as rain
clouds, flg. one of Sāy.’s suggestions (the other being the heavenly regions). In
context this interpr. seems perverse. The verse forms part of a tight little section
(beginning with vs. 11) concerning Night and Dawn and their nourishing of the
infant ritual fire. Our vs. esp. echoes vs. 12: dhenávaḥ … sabardúghāḥ …
ápradugdhāḥ “milk-cows, sap-yielding, not milked out” is the equivalent in the
plural of 12ab dhenū́, sabardúghe dhāpayete “the two milk-cows, sap-yielding, give
suck” in the dual. I find it highly unlikely that the vocabulary here repeated from 12
would refer to entirely different entities (clouds), which, moreover, have no
connection with the dawn ritual depicted here. Instead, in the course of this section
the joint nurturing activity of Night and Dawn (11-12) has given way to the
dominance of Dawn over Night (13ab, 14ab), and though both Night and Dawn are
present in vs. 15, one of them (Night) is hidden (15b). This trend accords with the
natural phenomenon: at dawn, light dissipates darkness. In our vs. 16 the plural cows
either represent the Dawns in general -- the plural of Dawn being often
interchangeable with the singular -- or the beams of light, the “dawn cows,” of a
single Dawn. The expression “becoming new ever again” (pāda c návyā-navyā
yuvatáyo bhávantīḥ) might favor the former possibility, since it reminds us of the
daily parade of ever-new youthful Dawns. My identification of the cows with the
dawns here admittedly leaves the noisiness (“let them be noisy,” ā́… dhunayantām)
73
unexplained. I would suggest either that there is also a reference to the crackling of
the fire wood as the ritual fire is kindled at dawn, or that it refers to the general noise
attendant on dawn as the various creatures awake, including real cows mooing to be
milked. Note that already in vs. 13a Dawn (in my interpr.) ‘lows’ (mimāya) over the
infant fire. I think we can safely banish the putative rain clouds.

### 17  
As indicated in the publ. intro. I consider this vs. to be transitional between
the fire-kindling vss. and the arrival of Indra at the sacrifice. I therefore think that the
reference is ambiguous. In the publ. intro. I suggested a trio of possible referents:
Agni, Soma, and Indra. I now think it is only Agni and Indra and that Agni is the sole
referent in ab, with transition from Agni to Indra in c.
This opinion is very different from the standard, which takes Parjanya as the
subject here (flg. on the supposed rain cloud vs.). The issue is further complicated by
the fact that in the next hymn (III.56.3) yet another being, possibly Tvaṣṭar or
Tvaṣṭar’s son, is described as retodhā́vṛṣabháḥ “a bull, depositor of semen,” which
matches our vṛṣabháḥ … ní dadhāti rétaḥ. Although I must concede that Parjanya is
described with the same phrase as III.56.3 in VII.101.6 and is said to deposit semen
also in V.83.1, such designations are not exclusive to Parjanya. In I.128.3 it is Agni
who is … réto vṛṣabháḥ kánikradad, dádhad rétaḥ kánikradat “a bull ever-roaring,
depositing his semen’ (with √krand, rather than √ru, ‘roar’), and I think Agni is the
referent here as well. I do not entirely understand the two herds of cows, but suggest
that it may have to do with the embryonic doctrine of the cycle of waters that is later
developed in the Upaniṣads, whereby rain falls from heaven and causes plants to
grow; the plants, as fuel, produce/give birth to the fire, whose smoke goes to heaven
and becomes clouds from which the rain falls, and the cycle begins again. Our
passage may have an abbreviated form of this: the bull Agni is roaring (that is,
crackling as fire) among one set of cows (plants as firewood); the smoke goes to
heaven and the rain (his semen) falls to earth and produces plants (the other herd).
Note vs. 5 much earlier in the hymn, where it is said of the plants “Having (him)
within, (though) unimpregnated they give birth to (him).”
The transition from Agni to Indra occurs in pāda c, in my interpr. Both Agni
and Indra can be called kṣápāvant- (/kṣapā́vant-) ‘earth-protector’, indeed
simultaneously. (See X.29.1 and my “Śleṣa in the Rig Veda?” [Fs. Gerow], 163-64.)
Indeed this epithet is even more flexible: as I discussed in the Gerow Fs., the first
element may be either kṣá(m) ‘earth’ or kṣáp- ‘night’. (For the possible
morphological analyses, see the loc. cit.) Under the latter analysis, the epithet would
be appropriate only for Agni, but under the former to both Agni and Indra, so the
first word in c may slip from clear reference to Agni to double reference. The
following two words, bhága- and rā́jan-, are also used in the RV of both Agni and
Indra, though ‘king’ is more common for Indra than Agni. The transition is complete.

### 18  
In my interpr. this vs. announces the arrival of Indra with a splendid team
of horses. This new topic is signaled by prá nú vocāma beginning pāda b. The exact
arrangement of the six and five isn’t clear to me. Re suggests that the double nú
74
indicates that there are two separate clauses here. He may be right (“now there is an
abundance of horses of the hero; we will proclaim (it) now”), though the difference
in sense is slight.
### 19-21
I’m not sure why Tvaṣṭar appears here. The previous vs., with the
arrival of Indra at the sacrifice, may mark the end of the ritualistic vss. that
dominated the hymn up till now. The few remaining vss. then celebrate the
prosperity and abundance that our good relationship with the gods, via the sacrifice,
will produce: teeming life provided by Tvaṣṭar (19), goods filling the two worlds
provided by Indra (20), peace provided by Agni (21), and the inanimate earthly
supports for all this prosperity, which provide their gifts to Indra (22).

### 19  
It is striking that pāda a is reused in the famous Yama-Yamī dialogue
hymn (X.10.5b), where Yamī claims that Tvaṣṭar made them a married couple in the
womb. I do not think there is an echo of that story here; the point of intersection is
simply the association of Tvaṣṭar with conception, pregnancy, and birth (cf., e.g.,
X.184).
Acdg. to the standard interpr. (Ge [/WG], Re; cf. Klein DGRV I.218, Kü 314),
prajā́ḥ is to be construed with pupóṣa, on the basis of X.170.1 prajā́ḥ pupoṣa
purudhā́… This is not impossible, but it seems unnecessary, esp. as the latter hymn
is quite late. It also implies that purudhā́should also be construed with pupóṣa, but
this is impossible because jajāna is unaccented. It is also unlikely that prajā́ḥ and
purudhā́should be separated, given purudhā́prajā́vān in the next hymn (III.56.3b).
At best we can take prajā́ḥ purudhā́with both verbs: “thrives with regard to
offspring in great quantity and has begotten them [=offspring in great quantity]” or
perhaps “thrives with regard to offspring and has begotten them [=offspring] in great
quantity.” Such an interpr., with an acc. of respect and a fundamentally intransitive
verb, follows that of Kü (314). I do not believe that pupóṣa here can have the
transitive/causative sense that the other tr. ascribe to it (e.g., Re “a fait fleurir les
créatures”).

### 20  
I assume that the subject of this vs. is Indra. One of his standard
cosmogonic deeds involves the creation and separation of the two worlds, the
separation here implied by the material crammed between them. Indra is of course
commonly identified as a vīrá-; he also “finds goods” (e.g., II.13.11, VIII.61.5),
though so do other gods as well as mortals.

### 21  
The first three pādas here are almost identical to I.73.3abc, where Agni is
definitely the referent. For disc. of some of the detail, see comm. there.
## 056
All Gods
I will not attempt to further identify the referents in these enigmatic vss.
beyond the sketchy suggestions given in the publ. intr. Ample disc. can be found in
75
the standard tr. As in many such mystical hymns, the grammar is mostly quite
straightforward; it’s the purport that remains cloaked in obscurity.

### 01
The standard tr. take b as obj. of minanti in a, which is certainly possible,
while I take it as a separate nominal clause. The choice has no real implications.
In c I take ródasī as subj. of the infin. nináme in d, along with párvatā(ḥ), but
the standard tr. (also Thieme, ZDMG 95: 90) supply a different infinitive in c,
generated from minanti in a. So, e.g., Ge “Weder die Zauberkundigen noch die
Weisen schmälern … / Nicht sind Himmel und Erde … (zu schmälern) …” I do not
see the need for supplying additional material. The only possible semantic arguments
might be 1) that the two worlds would not be subject to being bowed down (but I
don’t see why), or 2) that vedyā́- wouldn’t be capable of performing something
physical (like bowing down) but only mental/moral (like transgressing), but such an
action seems well within normal limits for the Vedic conceptual universe. Another
possible way to construe pāda c is to take ródasī as another subject of minanti: “nor
do the two worlds transgress the commandments.” This has the merit of not
supplying anything, but makes vedyā́bhiḥ harder to incorporate. Old suggests this
possibility as well as supplying nináme; he does not suggest supplying a different
infinitive in c.
The word vedyā́- can be either positive or negative depending on context.
Here it must be the latter; cf. also VII.21.5.

### 02
WG suggest that átyā(ḥ) is a hapax related to ánta- ‘border, edge’, ántya-, tr.
‘Begrenzungen’. Since no other forms show such a putative zero-grade, since ántyais not found in the RV, since the stem átya- is well attested, and since there is no
metrical advantage to reducing an *antyā(ḥ) here to átyā(ḥ), this suggestion doesn’t
merit adopting. In a hymn of this nature, the females might as well be steeds as
boundaries. For other attempts to reinterp. átyā(ḥ) see those rejected by Old and
another given by Ge (n. 2c).

### 03
On the basis of tváṣṭā … viśvárūpaḥ in the preceding hymn (III.55.19) I take
the subj. here to be Tvaṣṭar. Since Tvaṣṭar has a large role in the shaping and
begetting of offspring, the identification makes sense in this context.
As Ge (et al.) points out, the deriv. pājasyà- at the beginning of the Bṛhad
Āraṇyaka Up. (ŚBM X.6.4.1) in the list of the body parts of the sacrificial horse
seems to refer to the underbelly: dyaúṣ prṣṭḥ ̥ ám antárikṣam udáraṃ prthiv ̥ ī́pājasyàm
díśaḥ pārśvé ... “heaven its back, midspace its belly, earth the underbelly, directions
its flanks …,” which accounts for the standard tr. here ‘having three bellies’.
However, here in this passage with polarized gender and a sexual tone, I think it
should also contrast explicitly with tryudhā́(better *tryūdhā; see Old, who explains
the shortening on the basis of following purudhá) ‘having three udders’. On a fourlegged animal the underbelly would be the part that sags behind the ribcage, where
on a female paśu the udder would be. The corresponding male body part located
there would be the groin, hence my tr. The image is the common one of the ur-
76
creator as androgynous. See III.38.4-7, a deeply enigmatic hymn in this same
maṇḍala, where the creator is also both a bull and viśvárūpa-.
In c I suggest that patyate may be ambiguous between ‘be master’ and ‘be
husband’ (on the basis of páti-, which of course means both) because of the sexual
activity in d.

### 04
I have no suggestions for the identity of the singular referent of a, cd
(though the waters call to mind Indra), nor for the reason of what seems the intrusive
b.

### 05
On this vs. see Thieme, Untersuchung 43-44 and 47-48. He is responsible
for the second interpr. of vidátheṣu in b. See also vidátha- in III.38.5-6, a passage
already adduced above ad vs. 3, and comm. thereon: ‘cosmic division’ seems the
most likely interpr. of the stem there.
The three watery maidens in c may be evaluated in conjunction with II.5.5,
also with the three (apparently watery) women who nourish Apām Napāt in II.35.5,
and perhaps with the three goddesses of the Āprī hymns (Sarasvatī, Idā, and Bharatī).
Who they are here and what they are doing are unclear to me.
In d pátyamānāḥ ‘acting the master’ may be a sly joke, since it has females as
its subj. and it was just used (3c) for the hyper-virile inseminator.

### 06
The emphasis on the day here is striking. Two different ‘day’ words get
used: #trír ā́divaḥ …, divé-dive … trír no áhnaḥ#, with the two parallel expressions
polarized at the beg. and end of the hemistich. For another poss. passage with both
words, cf. IX.86.19 and comm. thereon, where the possible semantic difference
between the two words is explored.

### 07
Schaefer (196-97) nicely points out that the “intensive” (i.e., frequentative)
soṣavīti is the verbal equivalent of the āmreḍitas in 6cd (see comm. above) with the
simple verb suva.
I am not certain what to do with pāda b. The standard tr. take Mitra-Varuṇa as
parallel subjects with those in c, with the main verb in d. This is certainly possible,
but conceptually it seems a bit odd. Do Mitra and Varuṇa want things from other
gods? would they beg for such a gift? Also Savitar is regularly híraṇyapāṇi- (as in
III.54.11), so the -pāṇi- adj. here (supāṇī́) would associate M+V with him.
## 057
All Gods

### 01
The plural agent noun panitā́raḥ predicated of just two gods, Indra and Agni,
assumes other gods are covertly present; cf. III.54.9 in the same VD series, with
devā́saḥ … panitā́raḥ, after which the expression here may be modeled.

### 02
The standard tr. all take Indra and Pūṣan in pāda a as the subj. of duduhre in
b and as modified by prītā́ḥ in that pāda. There are several difficulties with this
77
interpr. First, pāda a has entirely dual reference: the two god names índraḥ and pūṣā́,
followed by two dual descriptors, vṛ́ṣaṇā suhástā, but both the adj. prītā́ḥ and the pf.
duduhre in b are plural. Although Old suggests that this dual/plural disharmony is
similar to (and therefore presumably no more problematic than) the pl. panitā́raḥ in
1d, I think the cases are different: Indra and Agni have no dual descriptors in 1d and
there is a plausible source nearby for the pl. panitā́raḥ.
Moreover, in 2ab Old and Ge (/WG) take Indra and Pūṣan as agentive milkers,
supplying what produces the milk (namely in this case the udder) as the object of
duduhre. But medial forms of √duh ordinarily take the milk-producer (cow or, by
synecdoche here, the supplied udder) as subject; if there is an object it is the milk,
either actual or metaphorical. This is exactly the use of the med. 3rd sg. pf. duduhe
(that is, the identical form to duduhre save for number) in 1c. It seems highly
unlikely that these two nearly superimposable forms would be used with entirely
different syntax/semantics in near adjacency. The construction that would be
reflected by the tr. of Old et al. is generally in the active; cf., e.g., I.64.5 duhánti
ū́dhaḥ “(The Maruts) milk the udder.” (Re avoids the syntacto-semantic difficult by
taking Indra and Pūṣan as the milk-producers -- “Indra donc, Pūṣan … ont donné un
lait inépuisable” -- but the number disagreement remains.)
To avoid these two problems, I propose taking 2a as a variant pairing
continuing 1d -- Indra and Pūṣan are often found together, as are Indra and Agni, and
could equally admire the cow. In fact, if 2a continues 1d, the pl. panitā́raḥ could be
accounted for by the addition of Pūṣan in 2a. (Alternatively 2a can be a nominal
clause with suhástā as predicate: “Indra and Pūṣan, the two bulls, have dexterous
hands” or sim.) I then take 2b as a separate clause, with prītā́ḥ a fem. nom. pl.
referring to cows, who are “pleased” because they are well-treated and produce milk
accordingly; they are the subj. of duduhre, and śaśayám refers to the milk they
produce. In this interpr. the unnamed cows in b stand for the inspired thoughts, the
poems, of “me” -- the poet who called his maniṣā́- a milk-cow (dhenú-) in 1ab. The
productive result of these poems in the sacrificial exchange, their “milk,” is
compared to the “(milk) of heaven,” namely, rain. This theme is further developed in
cd: when/if the gods take pleasure in her, i.e., the poet’s inspired thought offered at
the sacrifice, he hopes to get the reciprocal benefit of the gods’ benevolence. (Note
the echo of asyām in c and aśyām in d, though unfortunately they are in different
metrical positions.)
It might be objected that the cow in vss. 1-2 is otherwise singular (dhenúm 1b,
yā́duduhe 1c, asyāḥ 1d, asyām 2c), but the feminine plural dominates vs. 3 (jāmáyaḥ
3a, dhenávaḥ 3c), and this may simply anticipate the number shift.

### 03
Ge takes śaktím as an infinitive, governing a dat. vṛ́ṣṇe (flg. the Pp.): “…
dem Bullen einen Dienst zu leisten wünschen.” This somewhat wayward interpr. is
not followed by the other standard tr., where śaktí- receives its usual abstract sense --
though WG do preserve the datival interpr. of the ambig. Saṃhitā vṛ́ṣna (“die dem
Stier das Kraftvermögen wünschen”). The more natural interpr. is Re’s, with
78
underlying gen. vṛ́ṣṇaḥ: “qui recherchent la force-active du taureau,” and my tr.
reflects that.
As Ge suggests, the “sisters” in ab are the fingers of the officiant that
produced the ritual fire with the kindling sticks; the cows in cd may be the gheeoblations or (supported by vss. 1-2) the hymns accompanying the production of the
fire, or both.

### 04
The first hemistich faintly echoes 1a, with manīṣā́(4b) corresponding to
manīṣā́m and vivakmi (4a) reminiscent of vivikvā́n, though they belong to two
different roots (√vac and √vic respectively).
Various referents have been proposed for the feminine pl. in cd: dawns (Old),
tongues, flames (Ge), flame-tongues (WG). Though Re favors flames in his tr., his
comment in his notes is more illuminating: “Type d’ellipse d’un nom fém. pl.,
notamment dans le cycle d’Agni; plusieurs possibilités concurrentes.” This remark
seems esp. apt to this hymn, with its focus on feminine entities.

### 05
The two descriptors of Agni’s tongue, mádhumatī ‘possessing honey’ and
sumedhā́(ḥ) ‘very wise’, seem almost to clash in their juxtaposition, but they were
probably chosen to reflect two different aspects of the tongue. On the one hand,
Agni’s tongues of flame flare up when the libations are poured upon them; ‘honey’
presumably here refers to these libations (rather than to soma, despite the common
identification of soma with honey; soma would put the flames out if poured on them).
But real tongues, the kind that produce speech, can be qualified as ‘very wise’
because of that speech, and the crackling of the ritual fire often stands for ritual
speech.
[III.58-60 JPB]
## 061
Dawn

### 01
In the publ. tr. “with a rich prize” is slightly misleading, since it represents
only vā́jena, but “prize-giver with a prize” sounded flat.
“Young woman from of old” (purāṇī́… yuvatíḥ) reflects the usual paradox
that Dawn is both new every day and the same every day from the beginning of time.
She is “Plenitude” (púraṃdhiḥ) because she distributes the priestly gifts at the dawn
sacrifice.

### 03
The hapax caranīyámāna- seems an elaborate way to express what might as
easily have been simply cárant-. Re tr. ‘traçant la marche’ and comments that it has
“valeur durative-technique par rapport au simple cárantī.” My ‘making progress’
also attempts to differentiate it from the simple pres. to √car and to indicate its
denominative origins.
79

### 04
The puzzle in this vs. is the image in pāda a, áva syū́meva cinvatī́. Some
factors that contribute to this puzzle: 1) áva √ci is not otherwise found in Vedic. (In
epic/classical Skt. it means ‘gather’.) 2) áva need not be construed with cinvatī́, but
could go with yā́ti, esp. since tmesis in participles is considerably rarer than in finite
verbs. 3) There are several roots √ci. 4) The referent of syū́man- isn’t clear.
To begin with the last, most interpr. locate syū́man- in the realm of sewing
and garments. Ge tr. “die die Naht auszieht” (“who undoes/rips out a seam”), sim.
Old “… die Naht auftrennend,” Re “défaisant le fil.” Old suggest that it is the seam
that holds the darkness(es) together. Sāy. goes further, in suggesting that it refers to a
garment (vastram), which Dawn takes off. WG’s “Wie eine (Frau) den Gurt ablegend”
may also reflect this image, though their n. vacillates between sewing and equestrian
interpr. The problem with all of these attempts is that, in its few occurrences,
syū́man- is otherwise used of horse tackle, esp. of reins; cf. the PN syū́ma-raśmi-
(“*Band-Bridle” Mayrhofer, PersNam s.v.) and the cmpds syū́ma-gabhasti- (I.122.15
‘with hands as its guiding rope’), syūma-gṛ́bh- (VI.36.2 ‘pulling at the reins’), as well
as instr. syū́manā (I.113.17), all in horse/chariot contexts. Despite its derivation from
√sīv ‘sew’, it therefore seems unlikely that only here in the RV would it refer to
garment construction. And, although Dawn as a female might in principle be
connected with sewing (if that was Vedic women’s work), in fact she is usually not,
whereas her travels are a standard theme; note, e.g., her chariot in 2b, her horses in
2c, and her driving (yāti) in this vs.
We must then turn to the verb. If we use the later ‘gather’ sense for áva √ci,
the simile might mean “gathering up the reins (preparatory to setting out on a
journey).” A similar idea, though not related to horses, seems to be reflected in Ge’s
alternative given in n. 4a: “Wie (die Hausfrau), die das Halfterband (den Tieren)
abnimmt (um sie auf die Weide zu treiben),” relating it thematically to svásarasya
pátnī “mistress of good pasture” in the next pāda. I prefer to compare the lexeme áva
√tan ‘unstring, slacken’ of bowstrings (e.g., AV VI.42.1 áva jyā́m iva dhánvano
manyúṃ tanomi te hṛdáḥ “Like a bowstring from a bow, I make slack the fury from
your heart”; RVic exx. similar but without an explicit bowstring). The image is of
Dawn letting the reins go slack to give the horses their head. Curiously, Griffith’s tr.
is similar, “letting her reins drop downward,” though he thinks it refers to her
sending down rays of light. If this interpr. is correct, I assume that it belongs to the
root √ci ‘pile’, with a highly developed idiomatic sense. In fact combinations of √ci
+ PREVERB tend to show fairly extreme idiomaticity.
Arnold (Ved. Met., 300) suggests reading uṣā́ā́yāti for simple uṣā́yāti, which
would yield an 11-syl. line. Old is tempted but seems to favor the transmitted
reading; Re, however, is convinced. HvN reject it without explan. (“a rest at the 5th
place seems preferable”). I would follow Arnold and Re, and therefore the publ. tr.
should be emended to “drives here.”
Pāda d is taken by Ge and Re (and me) as containing one of the relatively rare
RVic occurrences of ā́+ following abl. in the meaning ‘all the way to’. The source of
this counterintuitive use of the abl. can be seen in passages like this, where ‘all the
way to’ and ‘all the way from’ are essentially identical in sense: the light of dawn
80
stretches throughout the midspace, and the directionality (from/to heaven/earth) is
irrelevant.

### 05
The standard tr. supply a form of √vac (Ge specifically vivakmi, invoking
áchā vivakmi in nearby III.57.4a) in pāda a, which is then taken as a separate clause:
“I (call) to Dawn for you …” Although I resisted this in the publ. tr., I now see its
merits, in accounting for the preverb áchā, the double vaḥ (pādas a and b), and the
acc. case of Dawn. I would therefore emend the tr. to “(I invite) for you the goddess
Dawn, radiating widely; proffer your well-twisted (hymn) (to her) with reverence.”
The standard tr. (also Lü 73, Kü 430) take rocanā́as a fem. nom. sg., in order,
as Ge says (n. 5d), to allow prá … ruruce to have its expected intrans. sense. But
well-attested rocaná- is otherwise only neut. (X.189.3 adduced by Ge, etc., as
another ex. of a fem. should be otherwise explained), and in the pl. it regularly refers
to the luminous realms. I would prefer not to create a separate stem to apply to a
single example, esp. because the default interpr. of the form would be neut. pl. There
is a simple solution that allows the neut. pl. analysis to be preserved without
imperiling the intransitivity of ruruce -- to interpr. the neut. pl. as an acc. of extent,
as often. The publ. tr. reflects this.

### 06
The phrase arkaír abodhi has double sense, since arká- can mean both
‘chant’ and ‘ray’ and abodhi both ‘has (been) awakened’ and ‘has been perceived’.
The ambiguity nicely captures the ritual situation: we ritualists (wish to) believe that
the natural world is set in motion and controlled by our ritual activity (in this case
chanting that makes Dawn awaken and dawn), but the ritual is itself set in motion by
phenomena in the natural world, in this case the appearance of the first light of dawn.

### 07
This vs. offers a surprising number of small puzzles. The first is how to
construe uṣásām iṣaṇyán. Most take gen. pl. uṣásām as the obj. of the participle,
despite its unexpected case. (Others, like Pischel and Lü [for details see Lü 596-97],
simply label uṣásām an acc. -- convenient but unconvincing.) I supply ‘cows’ (gā́s)
as obj. on the basis of III.50.3 (in this maṇḍala) sám … gā́iṣaṇya and IX.96.8. That
the bull (vṛ́ṣā) in the next pāda is the subject of ‘drive’ invites a bovine object. The
cows, as often, can be the rays of the Dawn (the “dawn cows”). They are driven “on
the foundation of truth” (ṛtásya budhné), that is, the earth and more specifically the
ritual ground.
The bull doing the driving is, in my view, the sun, which follows dawn and
could therefore be conceived as driving the rays of dawn before him. His “entering
the two world halves” is, of course, his rising above the horizon.
The standard tr. take candréva in d to mean “like gold,” but if the reference is
to the precious metal, it should be candrám iva, as they all acknowledge. With Gr
and Old I instead take it as the fem. nom. sg. it appears to be, referring to Dawn. But
who/what is the subj. of the frame? Most tr. take it to be the sun, who spreads his
radiance (bhānúm) far and wide. This is certainly possible, but it leaves the māyā́of
Mitra and Varuṇa announced in c rather orphaned. I therefore prefer to take māyā́as
81
the subject of ví dadhe, in intransitive usage (“the magic power spreads/is spread”);
the syntax of this frame is contrasted with the transitive but self-involved ví dadhe in
the simile: “as shimmering (Dawn) has spread her own radiance,” with bhānúm
belonging to the simile. This kind of syntactic disharmony is commonly exploited in
similes, as I have discussed at length elsewhere ("Case disharmony in RVic similes",
IIJ 24 [1982] 251-71).

Various gods

### 01
For the sense of this complex vs. and its relation to the rest of the hymn, see
publ. intro. The point of the verse appears be that our hymns, however frenetic (a),
are no longer effective (b), and therefore the activity of Indra and Varuṇa on behalf
of their partners [=us] is in abeyance (cd).
With the standard tr. I supply ‘hymns’ with the opening imā́(ḥ): imā́gíraḥ is
pretty common.
The praise hymns to Indra and Varuṇa appear to be whirlwinds (bhṛmáyaḥ) to
us, but they cannot be ‘thrust/brandished’ (ná tújyā(ḥ)) by the devotees of the gods --
that is, they have lost their oomph, their energy, and therefore their effectiveness. For
the connection between bhṛmí- and √tuj, cf. IV.32.2 bhṛ́miś cid ghāsi tū́tujiḥ “You
are a whirlwind, constantly lunging” of Indra. For the connection of hymns with √tuj,
cf. V.17.3 tujā́girā́. Despite its position, ná in b should be the negative, not the
simile marker. See Old.
On sína- see comm. ad II.30.2.
I take sma as indicating habitual action.

### 02
In ab the combination of an intensive (johavīti) and two superlatives
(purutámaḥ and śaśvattamám) gets its point across!

### 03
The “Shielding Goddesses” (pl.) appear here and in VII.34.22. In both cases
they are associated with śaraṇá- ‘shelter’. A singular várūtrī- also occurs 4x, once
(I.22.10) in association with hótrā bhā́ratī as here. Beyond their/her protective role,
the várūtrī appear(s) to be featureless.

### 05
Ge (/WG) take ā́cake as 3rd sg. (Ge: “Er liebt unbeugsame Kraft”). This is
certainly possible, but Schmidt (B+I, 131) makes good arguments for flg. Sāy and Gr
in taking it as 1st sg.; see also Re (EVP XVI, ad loc.).
### 05-06
Vs. 6 is entirely couched in the acc. and picks up from 5ab, where the acc.
phrase is obj. of namasyata; 5c is a parenthetical intrusion.

### 07
Ge suggests in his notes that this vs. could be a single clause, essentially
“This praise-hymn is recited to you by us,” with te (a) and túbhyam (c) tautological.
This is possible, but it seems rhetorically unlikely.
82

### 08
This vs. is more complex than it first appears, at least in my interpr. The
dominant reading is the one given by Ge: the simile in c matches the frame in a, with
b parenthetic. Nearby III.52.3bc [=IV.32.16bc] is nearly identical with minor
morphological variation in the frame: joṣáyāse gíraś ca naḥ / vadhūyúr iva yóṣaṇām.
This interpr. is undeniable. However, I think the intervening b pāda can also be seen
as a target of the simile, but in a syntactically twisted way. The object of the verb avā
‘help’ is the NOUN + PARTICIPLE phrase (in reverse order) vāyayántam … dhíyam “the
insight seeking the prize,” which, extracted from its role as object and presented as a
simple clause, would represent “the insight (nom.) seeks the prize (acc.),” with
subject/object syntactic relations. Thus reconfigured, the phrase in b would match the
simile in c: “our insight seeks the prize, as a bride-seeking man (seeks) a maiden.”
The syntactic transformation of one of the parts of the structural pair from clause into
acc. participial phrase does not disrupt their functional and semantic matching -- it
rather shows again the pleasure that RVic poets get from off-kilter correspondences.
(See, e.g., the simile/frame pair at the end of the previous hymn, III.61.7d with comm.
above.)
This secondary reading presents another twist. In the dominant reading the
subj. of the impv. juṣasva is a (male) god, the obj. a hymn (gír-), a word feminine in
gender. These genders match those of the simile: the subj. a bride-seeking male, the
obj. a maiden. But when we consider the underlying clause in b, the genders are
reversed: the insight (dhī́-) is feminine; she is the seeker, not the sought, while the
prize (vā́ja-) she seeks is a masc. noun.

### 09
The usual sharp polarity between the preverbs ví and sám is emphasized by
keeping the verb constant (páśyati) and explicitly conjoining the two verb complexes
with ca. My “looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole” is meant to
capture the contrast of the two preverbs in idiomatic Engl.
### 10-12
All three vss. in this tṛca contain déva- (…) savitár- (or vice versa).

### 10  
And here, buried in this not particularly noteworthy hymn, is the Gāyatrī
mantra, which is itself not particularly noteworthy on its own terms.
Note the play on dhīmahi / dhíyaḥ juxtaposed across the hemistich boundary,
belonging to different roots.

### 11  
I take púraṃdhyā as an instr. of accompaniment, not (with Ge [/WG]) an
instr. of means.

### 17  
The sense of the splv. instr. pl. drā́ghiṣṭhābhiḥ is unclear. This is the only
occurrence of the superlative in the RV, and neither dīrghá- nor the cmpv.
drāghīyas- occurs in the instr. pl. The standard interpr., that the splv. here is temporal
(Gr ‘in längster Dauer’), seems reasonable, but not assured.

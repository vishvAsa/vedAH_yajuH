saráyanta ā́paḥ (sarayánte out of sandhi) in 2d is reprised by sárann ā́paḥ in 3d. The two verbs seem semantically identical; the intransitive -áya-formation takes the post-(late-)caesura position also favored by metrically identical janáyanta.

Its medial ending is an example of -anta replacement of the usual type (cf. Jamison 1979: IIJ 21), though somewhat complicated by the fact that the form out of sandhi is actually primary -ante.

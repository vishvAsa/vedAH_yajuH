This sequence of vss. is marked by initial ayám ‘this one here’ (9a, 9c, 10a, 10b; cf. also asyá 9d). This near-deictic pronoun may indicate that Indra is currently present at the sacrifice. These vss. are also marked by present tense verbs describing Indra’s characteristic and habitual activities -- in contrast to vs. 11, which opens with an imperfect (sám … ajayat).

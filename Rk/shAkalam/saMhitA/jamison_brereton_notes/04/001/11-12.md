The repeated phrase “in the nest of the bull” (vṛṣabhásya nīḷé, 11d, 12b) is somewhat opaque, but I think Ge is basically right, that the vṛṣabhá- is Agni (not, with Hoffmann, heaven). His nest is, in my opinion, the ritual ground; its designation also as the “womb of truth” (ṛtásya yóni-, 12b) supports this identification. I find WG’s n. on this phrase incomprehensible, though it seems to follow Hoffmann in part.

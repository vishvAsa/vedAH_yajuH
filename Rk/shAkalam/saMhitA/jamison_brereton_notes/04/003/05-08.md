The list of gods to whom Agni will tattle on us follows a certain pattern.

Vs. 5 contains the standard great trio of Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, as well as a minor Āditya, Bhaga ‘Fortune’, who is, however, important for our welfare.

Although we might have expected the Sun here, because he serves as the Ādityas’ eye, observing our offenses, we have instead Heaven and Earth, which frame the cosmos. In vs. 6 the nearer gods of the midspace, particularly Vāta ‘wind’ and the Aśvins, are featured. Rudra appears in both 6 and 7; I don’t quite understand why, but recall first that Agni was identified as Rudra in vs. 1 and may be also in 10d (see also 14b). Moreover, in 6 the punishing aspect of Rudra is emphasized (‘mansmiting’, nṛhán-), while in 7 he is paired and/or contrasted with the benevolent Pūṣan under the ambiguous epithet súmakha-, which means both ‘good combatant’ and ‘very generous’, so his effects on human life are emphasized and he counts as a nearer god, who in fact is the giver of the oblation (havirdā́-). In the 2nd half of 7 Viṣṇu and his three strides return us to the contemplation of the whole cosmos, and vs. 8 functions ring-compositionally with vs. 5: we have the Sun we expected (and didn’t get) in 5, with Aditi standing in for the Ādityas in 5, and heaven (though probably the place, not the deity) is the final goal.

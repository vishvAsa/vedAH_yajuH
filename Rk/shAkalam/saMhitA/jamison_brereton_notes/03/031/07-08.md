Given the thematic weight the part. árcan carries (see comm. immed.

above) and given that it occupies pāda-final position in 7d and 8c, it should have been tr. the same way in these two vss. I would emend the publ. tr. to ‘chanting’ in 7d, or else 8c to ‘singing’ and arkaíḥ in 9b, 11b to ‘songs’. The instr. arkaíḥ reappears in pāda-final position in 11b.

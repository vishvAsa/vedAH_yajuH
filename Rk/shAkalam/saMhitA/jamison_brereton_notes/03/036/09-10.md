Note that the vocabulary of the beginning of the hymn is being turned around reciprocally at the end: bhara (9a) and prá yandhi (9d, 10a) are imperatives addressed to Indra, urging him to bring/offer things to us, whereas in 1a prábhṛtim (at least in my interpr.) and 2c prayamyámānān the same lexical expressions refer to things we offer to Indra. Other ring compositional echoes are the dhāḥ + datival infinitive (1a sātáye dhāḥ and 10c jīváse dhāḥ) and the stem śáśvat- (1b, 10d).

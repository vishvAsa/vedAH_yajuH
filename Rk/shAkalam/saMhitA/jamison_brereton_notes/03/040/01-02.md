The difference, if any, between pāhi (1c) and píba (2c) is as usual not clear. See disc. ad III.35.10. If we are looking for ways to distinguish them, ā́vṛṣasva “drench yourself in it,” immediately following píba in 2c, might support a more durative interpr. of the pres. impv., as perhaps would the adj. tā́tṛpi- if it has intensive semantics ‘ever satisfying’.

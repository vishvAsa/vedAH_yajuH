I assume that purudhá-pratīka- in 3d refers to Indra’s shape-shifting powers; the cmpd seems to be “unpacked” in 4b “he made this body as he wished” (yathāvaśáṃ tanvàṃ cakra eṣáḥ).

These two vss. are noteworthy for containing 3 gerunds, upasthā́ya, abhibhū́ya, and āmúṣyā. The quest of the poet(s) of the Indra hymns in III to find a way to express anteriority (see disc. ad III.32.9-10, 33.11) is successful at least in this passage.

Here the patrons, who have properly compensated the priest/poets, receive their own reward from Dawn. Interestingly it is not material, but rather yáśas- ‘glory’

-- though glory consisting of heroes (vīrávat), meaning, narrowly, sons, but also men belonging to our side who will perform well in warfare and acquire battle glory. The
emphasis on non-material rewards for the patrons continues in vs. 7 with “lofty brilliance and glory” (dyumna̐bṛhád yáśaḥ), while the poets receive material gifts, rā́dhāṃsi áśvyā gavyā́“benefits consisting of horses and cows.” For a similar split between material rewards for the singers and non-material ones for the patrons see V.86.6, where the patrons get “lofty fame” (śrávo bṛhát) and the singers get wealth and refreshment (rayím … íṣam).

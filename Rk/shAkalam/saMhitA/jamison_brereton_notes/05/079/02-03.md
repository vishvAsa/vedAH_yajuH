Is the comparative ‘mightier’ (sáhīyas-) used to assert that Satyaśravas Vāyya is mightier than Sunītha Śaucadratha? The Pp. reads accented ví even directly before accented aúchaḥ (2b, 3c), where we might expect univerbation and loss of accent on the preverb. The Saṃhitā text is of course ambiguous.

sā́with the 2nd ps. impv. ucha simply shows the common use of the sá/tám prn.

with 2nd ps. impvs.; see my 1992 “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?” Elaborate semantic/functional interpr., like Re’s “de la même manière, dans les mêmes conditions (heureuses)” (EVP 3, ad loc.) or WG’s yā́… sā́… “welche du … als solche du” are unnec.

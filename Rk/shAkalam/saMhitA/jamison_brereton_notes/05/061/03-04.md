The final word of vs. 3 is jánayaḥ, while the final word of the 1st hemistich of 4 is (bhadra-)jānayaḥ, showing the standard distribution of the ‘wife’ word, with simplex jáni- and jāni- as 2nd cmpd. member. The distrib. here is complicated by the fact that 3c … ná jánayaḥ produces an unusual cadence of four shorts, which

*jā́nayaḥ would easily repair. But since the long-vowel variant never shows up as a
simplex, we should presumably resist the temptation to emend.

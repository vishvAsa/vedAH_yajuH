The recital of Indra’s deeds now reverts to the past tense, to a series of insistently augmented imperfects: 7b ámimīthāḥ, 7c agṛbhṇāḥ, 7d asedhaḥ, 8b áramayaḥ, 8c ayātam, ávahaḥ. (In 8d the Pp. reads unaug. áranta, but in its sandhi situation [uśánā́ranta] it could as easily be ā́ranta; the accent should be on the augment because it’s in a subordinate cl., but ā + áranta would come out this way.

Either way, it’s not an imperfect, but either a plupf. or a root aor., but this is a minor quibble.) However, note that this series is introduced by 7a tád ín nú te káraṇam “Just this now is your deed,” where the current situation (nú) remains in the forefront of the poet’s mind.

With Ge (and contra WG, who suggest Śuṣṇa), I take the strong one (ugrám) in c as Uśanā. This is the usual, if wispy, account of Indra and Kutsa’s journey to Uśanā’s house for advice before the Śuṣṇa battle; cf. X.22.6.

The 2nd sg. ávaho ha kútsam “you (sg.) conveyed Kutsa,” following immediately on the 2nd du. ayātam “you two drove,” seems a quick correction or explanation. The 2nd du. ayātam may have seemed to suggest an equality and mutuality between Indra and Kutsa that might have seemed insulting to Indra’s divinity and greater power -- though the return of vām in d and the dual dvandva índrākutsā and dual verbs of vs. 9 show that the attempt to reestablish hierarchy was momentary.

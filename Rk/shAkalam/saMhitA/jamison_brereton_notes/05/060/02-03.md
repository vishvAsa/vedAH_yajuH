Note the concatenation: 2d … párvataś cit# // 3a #párvataś cit … The two vss. also hold the verb rejate/rejata steady (2d, 3b, though in slightly different metrical position, both post-caesura, with one pres. and the other injunc.), but in the first instance it’s earth (pṛthivī́) that trembles and in the 2nd (the back of) heaven (diváḥ, initial in its pāda like pṛthivī́). So the standard pair heaven/earth are contrasted and identically positioned, but they are grammatically non-parallel. There is also a repetition of ‘fear’, though again in different forms -- nominal bhiyā́in 2c, pf. bibhāya in 3c, both pāda-final. This kind of patterned and varied repetition may not reach the heights of poetic art, but it is a pleasing demonstration of the way a RVic poet infuses freshness into the clichéś that are his bread-and-butter.

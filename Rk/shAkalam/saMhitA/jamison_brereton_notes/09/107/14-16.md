title = "14-16"

+++
Like vss. 1-3, this pragātha has a two-pāda addition (vs. 16), also 12 8. Both 14 and 15 contain the part. pávamāna-; all three vss. contain forms of samudrá-, samudríya-, while 16 repeats the phrase rā́jā deváḥ from 15b. In 16 haryatáḥ recalls the same word in 13a, and vicakṣaṇáḥ those in 3b, 5d. The voc. of this stem is found in vs. 24.

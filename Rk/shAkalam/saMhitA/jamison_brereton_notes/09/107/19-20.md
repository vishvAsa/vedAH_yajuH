This is the first and only place in the hymn in which the 1st person is found. The speaker’s eagerness for fellowship with Soma, who is addressed directly, and his admission of his troubles give an intimate and almost confessional tone. Both vss. have the 1st sg. prn. ahám, a form of sakhyá-, a form of dív- ‘day’, and the voc. to babhrú- ‘brown one’ and are tightly connected, also structurally (see disc. ad 20).

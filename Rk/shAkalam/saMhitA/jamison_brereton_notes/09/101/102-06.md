The following 5 hymns are in Uṣṇih, technically 8 8 / 12 or 8 8 / 8 4 (see Arnold, p. 8). In some hymns, esp. IX.102, the latter variant prevails; that is, there is a word break before the last 4 syllables, which can seem like a syntactic afterthought.

In others, the last 4 syllables are not detachable, and we must assume a 12-syl pāda; see, e.g., IX.103.2 … kṛṇute háriḥ, with 5-syllable finale.

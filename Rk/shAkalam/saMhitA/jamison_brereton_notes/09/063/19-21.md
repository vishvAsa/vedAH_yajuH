This tṛca has more internal unity, as well as connection to the preceding tṛca, than usual. For its external connections, see 19a vā́je ná vājayúm picking up the vāj- forms just noted, mádhumattamam in 19c matching the same word (in the nom.) in 16a, and 20a kavím mṛjanti echoing 17a tám ī mṛjanti (note the identical vowel pattern in kavím / tám ī).

As for internal connections, see dhībhíḥ (20b, 21a), víprāḥ (20b, 21c), and vṛ́ṣā (20c), vṛ́ṣaṇam (221a).

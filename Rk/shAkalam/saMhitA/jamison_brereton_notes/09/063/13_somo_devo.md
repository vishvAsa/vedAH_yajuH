As in the tṛca vss. 7-9, Soma is again compared to the Sun - but curiously no clear point of comparison between them appears in the vs. The actions attributed to Soma here - purifying himself, being pressed by stones, putting his sap in the tub - are exclusive to him and certainly not characteristic of the Sun.

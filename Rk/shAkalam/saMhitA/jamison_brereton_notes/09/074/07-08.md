These two vss. seem to resolve the situation set up in vs. 1, esp. 1bc: the racehorse that was striving to win the sun (=milk) there (1b) has achieved this goal and “keeps company” with ritual speech and labor, as it did in 1c (and 5a) with more physical features of the ritual process. The repetition of the desid. síṣāsati from 1b in 7a and the resolution of the desid. into an achieved state via a pf. part. sasavā́n (8b) signal the relationship between vss. 1 and 7-8 - as does the repetition of sacate from 1c (/sácamānaḥ 5a) in 7c.

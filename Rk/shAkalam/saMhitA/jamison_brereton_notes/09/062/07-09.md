The tṛca shows no strong signs of internal unity, save for the “sitting” found in both 7 and 8, but it does echo some of the material earlier in the hymn: ásṛgram in 7b matches the same verb in 1a; ā́sadaḥ in 7c recalls ā́sadat in 4c, while sī́dan yónā (8c) is a different echo of 4c yónim ā́sadat; arṣa (8a) picks up arṣanti (3b); svā́diṣṭhaḥ in 9b expresses the result of svádanti in 5c; and varivo-víd in 9c is a paraphrase of kṛṇvánto várivaḥ in 2c. It may also be worth noting that this is the first place in the hymn that the divine recipients of soma are mentioned: índrāya 8a, áṅgirobhyaḥ 9b.

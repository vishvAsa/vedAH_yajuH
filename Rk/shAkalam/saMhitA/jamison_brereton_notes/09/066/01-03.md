The tṛca shows clear signs of unity, esp. lexically. Not only do all three vss.

contain a form of páva- (pávasva 1a, voc. pa/ávamāna 2b, 3c), but the stem víśva- is found 4x (1a, b, 2a, 3b), kave (3c) echoes kā́vya (1b), and pl. dhā́māni in 3a echoes du. dhā́manī in 2b. These “domains” of vss 2-3 are thematically connected to the voc. viśvacarṣaṇe ‘common to all the separate peoples’, in defining the spaces over which Soma holds sway.

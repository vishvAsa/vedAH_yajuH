Each vs. opens with a form of pávamāna-, which also connects it with the preceding tṛca (see above). An even stronger link to the previous tṛca is the gen. intens. part.

jáṅghnataḥ in 25a, which picks up the same stem (in the nom. jáṅghanat) at the end of the immediately preceding pāda, 24c. As for internal unity, note the free phrase háreś candrā́ḥ in 25b, which is transformed into the cmpd. háriścandra-(only here in the RV, though prominent as a PN beginning in the Br.) in 26c. Superlatives also figure in the last two vss.: rathī́tama- 26a, śubhráśastamaḥ 26b, vājasā́tama- 27b.

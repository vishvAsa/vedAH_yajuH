More chaining: vss. 4 and 6 end with rájaḥ; the exact phrase in 5c is uttamáṃ rájaḥ, whose uttamám is then picked up in 6a and augmented with uttamā́yyam in 6c.

Meanwhile, 3rd pl. pf. (vy) ā̀naśuḥ of 3c, 5b morphs into 3rd pl. root aor. āśata in 6b. As Old points out, √(n)aś is also represented by the desid. íyakṣantaḥ in 4c.

My “that is to be higher still” is meant to capture the pseudo-gerundive form of the nonce uttamā́yi ya-.

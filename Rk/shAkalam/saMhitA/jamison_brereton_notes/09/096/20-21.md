Again these two vss. belong to separate mini-hymns, but they are clearly concatenated: kánikradat “constantly roaring” in 20d is repeated in the same metrical position in 21b (and cf. krándan in 22d), and 20d camvòr ā́viveśa “he has entered the two cups” is immediately echoed by 21c camvòr ā́viśa “enter the two cups” (and cf. 22b kaláśām̐ā́viveśa).

title = "12-13"

The first vs. of the new hymn (13a) begins pávasva (see also pavasva in 14a), just as the last vs. of the previous hymn ended with pavasva (12c). Again, this concatenation may have led to the attachment of 13-16 at this point. Of course, pávasva is hardly a rare form in this maṇḍala.

title = "16-18"

This tṛca, ascribed to Jamadagni, is unifed first and foremost by its meter, Dvipadā Gāyatrī, the only representative of this meter in the hymn - and in fact in all of the RV (see Arnold p. 244). There is no particular unity in lexicon (though note mandáyan 16a and madíntamaḥ 18a), but the tṛca does mention the two gods who receive the first soma oblation, Indra (16) and Vāyu (18).

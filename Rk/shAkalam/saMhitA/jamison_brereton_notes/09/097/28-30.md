Attributed to Vasukra Vāsiṣṭha, who is not otherwise known - though a Vasukra Aindra is supposedly responsible for the devilish trio of hymns X.27-29.

The tṛca is marked by the repetition of ā́pavasva in the 2nd hemistich of each vs. (28d, 29c, 30d) expressing the various good things we want Soma to bring us through his self-purification. The root √sṛj ‘surge’ is also prominent in the 2nd two vss. (29a, 30a).

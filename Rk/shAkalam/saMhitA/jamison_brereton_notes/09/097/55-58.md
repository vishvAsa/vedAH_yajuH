title = "55-58"

The rest of the hymn consists of 4 vss. Old dithers about whether this consists of an odd vs., 55, followed by a final tṛca, 56-58 - or a tṛca 55-57, with a final independent vs. 58. At least to my mind, the latter analysis is clearly superior.

Vs. 58 has the “feel” of a hymn-summary vs., with the expression of “our” wish in ab, and its 2nd half consists of the Kutsa refrain. Nonetheless, there are no clear signs of cohesion in vss. 55-57, though one might point to the filters in both 55 and 56.

Happily none of the vss. presents us with the desperate difficulties of the preceding tṛca.

The first two vss. of this tṛca begin identically (prá te), and all three vss.

concern the swift journey of the soma drinks, which is compared to that of swift animals. Vss. 1 and 3 share the same verb (√ṛṣ: 1b arṣanti, 3a arṣa; ásṛkṣata in 2b is semantically similar) and the same goal, the kóśa- or ‘cask’, while vss. 1 and 2 both contain āś́vaḥ ‘swift’. Of course none of these features is unusual in the soma corpus, so they are not strong evidence for tṛca unity.

The first vs. of the new tṛca is in part a distillation of the previous tṛca.

The next two vss. end their first hemistichs identically: 5b, 6b GEN satáḥ pári yanti ketávaḥ “The beacons of the one being X circle around.” But as in the first tṛca, this identity conceals a fundamental difference of reference, with both a cosmic and a ritual dimension.

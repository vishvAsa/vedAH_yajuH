title = "19-21"

+++
No obvious signs of unity. The instr. manīṣíbhiḥ is found at the end of 19 and immediately afterwards at the beginning of 20. The dawn(s) and the rivers are found in both 19 and 21, but not in mutually reinforcing ways. As for external connections, the “partnership” (sakhyá-) of Indra and Vāyu in 20 is reminiscent of the companions/partners (implicitly Soma and Indra) in 16b. There are various lexical echoes (e.g., vicakṣaṇáḥ 19a = 11b), but the limited vocab. of the Soma hymns makes this unremarkable.

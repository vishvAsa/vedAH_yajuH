Cows (that is, the milk-mixture) are esp. prominent in this tṛca: there are seven in 25b (recalling the “thrice seven” that produced the milk-mixture in 21c), here called dhenávaḥ, with gā́ḥ in 26c and góbhiḥ in 27c. Other miscellaneous animals: the sheep’s fleece (ávye … vā́re 25a), buffaloes (mahiṣā́ḥ 26d), a steed (átyaḥ 26d), as well as the tawny one (hárim 25b, 27b), if that is specifically a tawny horse or, as in 31b (vṛ́ṣā … háriḥ), a tawny bull.

25b and 27b both open háriṃ navante, each followed by a diff. preverb to be construed with the verb (abhí, áva). In 27a asaścátaḥ recalls 18c ásaścuṣī.

For the first time in this hymn (save for briefly in vs. 18), this tṛca shows some interest in what Soma might do for us, particularly in the 2nd two vss.

Note in 38 first the enclitic naḥ and then the 1st pl. opt. syāma. The poet both asks for benefits directly and by implication, in the cmpds with 2nd member -víd- ‘finding’: góvid-, vasuvíd-, híraṇyavíd-, viśvavíd- “cow-finding, goods-finding, goldfinding, all-finding” and the bahuvrīhi suvī́ra- ‘possessing good heroes’. If Soma finds or possesses these things, he can distribute them to us. The connection between vss. 38 and 39 is nicely signalled by the near identity of 38c and 39a: 38c … pavasva vásumad dhíraṇyavat 39a … pavasva vasuvíd dhiraṇyavít where the suffix of possession (-mant-, -vant-) subtly gives way to the phonologically similar root-noun -víd-, suggesting that Soma possesses those things, which he can now find for us. The epithet nṛ-cákṣas- ‘having his gaze on men’, found several times previously in this hymn (vss. 23, 36), seems finally to take on its full lexical value in 38, where it is predicated of Soma (nṛcákṣā asi) and strengthened by viśvátaḥ ‘on every side’, to express Soma’s interest in us and our welfare. The reciprocal relationship between us and Soma is also expressed by the parallel pādas 38d and 39b, both containing bhúvaneṣu as the location of both us (38d) and Soma (39b).

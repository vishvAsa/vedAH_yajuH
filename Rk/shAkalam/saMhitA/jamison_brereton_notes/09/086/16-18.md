title = "16-18"

+++
The first two vss. of this tṛca begin with prá with a verb of motion, but otherwise there is little that unifies the tṛca. Nor is there much that connects with the rest of the hymn, save for 16a … ayāsīt … índrasya niṣkṛtám / 7b=32d … úpa yāti niṣkṛtám and the repetition of saṃyát- in 18a (cf. 15d and disc. there).

The next 8 hymns, the last ones before the lengthy hymns assembled from tṛcas (IX.61-68) that end the dimeter collection, are attributed to Avatsāra Kāśyapa. All of them contain four vss., and a number of them are structured such that the first three vss. form a unity, with the last vs. stylistically or thematically contrastive or completive. See esp.

IX.53-57. Old tends to analyze them as a tṛca with Schlussvers, which is strictly accurate, but I think the point is the interplay of 3+1.

Indra (misc. comments by SJ to JPB tr.)


## 02
This vs. is reminiscent of the more explicit I.173.6 sáṃ vivya índro vṛjánaṃ ná bhū́mā, bharti svadhā́vām̐opaśám iva dyā́m “Indra has enwraped himself in the earth, like a circlet. The autonomous one wears heaven like a headdress” and seems to refer to Indra’s “suiting up” in cosmic garb.

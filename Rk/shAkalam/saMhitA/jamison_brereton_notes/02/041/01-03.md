This tṛca is characterized by lexical chaining. The first pāda of vs. 2 reprises niyútvān from 1c, vāyo from (accented) vā́yo (1a), and ā́gahi (1b). Vs. 3 is less closely tied to what precedes, but śukrá- ‘clear’, which characterizes the first drink of soma, offered to Vāyu, is repeated in 3a from 2b, and niyútvant- also recurs from 1c and 2a. The impv. píbatam (3c) picks up (sóma-)pītaye from 1c. More subtly, ā́yātam repeats the preverb of ā́gahi (1b, 2a) and also echoes the unrelated verb ayāmi of 2b.

The phrases aryáḥ puṣṭā́ni (4d) and aryáḥ puṣṭī́ḥ (5c) with ppl. and fem.

abstract to √puṣ, both in the plural, do not seem to differ from each other semantically or functionally. The only possible (but weak) motivations I can see for the use of different stems are 1) metrical (neut. pl. puṣṭā́ni would not fit in 5c; however, the shorter neut. pl. form puṣṭā́would), and 2) gender matching between simile and frame. We don’t know the gender of the root noun pl. víjaḥ ‘stakes’, but it is clearly not neut. If it is underlyingly fem., puṣṭī́ḥ would be a better match. For aryáḥ puṣṭá-, see loc. pl. aryáḥ puṣṭéṣu in the Vṛṣākapi hymn, X.86.1. That the ppl. is used in this phrase elsewhere suggests that the ppl. is the more idiomatic form in this phrase.

As IH pointed out to me, dvitā́dadhur in 2b can be read, contra Pp. adadhur, as dvitā́dadhur, with perfect indic. or pres. injunc.; I now favor the unaugmented reading for reasons given below.

The contrast between the verbs in 2ab imám … (a)dadhur bhṛ́gavaḥ and 3ab agníṃ devā́saḥ … dhuḥ seems to encode the primal installation of Agni by the gods (3) and the recent installation, by men (2). Why the primal installation is expressed by a root aor. injunc. is not clear to me, but I would now alter the publ. tr. to “Agni did the gods install …,” from “Agni have the gods installed …,” to reflect the remote past. Note also that the opening of 3b is metrically aberrant, with an opening of 3.

HvN suggest a rest in 4th position. It would be possible to restore *dadhuḥ, which would match the same verb in the same position in 2b, but I think it’s more likely that the omission of a syllable is meant to call attention to the difference in verb stems. A rest in 3rd position, producing a syncopated dhuḥ might be better. If the two verbs are being directly contrasted, an unaugmented dadhur in 2 is more likely than augmented adadhur (in order to highlight the difference in stems). Discussion with IH has helped me clarify my interpr.

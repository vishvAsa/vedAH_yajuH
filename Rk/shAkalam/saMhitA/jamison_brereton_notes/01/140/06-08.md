This trio of verses treats the union (by burning) of the hyper-masculine Agni/fire and the plants (feminine). This must be the “der erotische Grundton” of the hymn that Ge mentions in his intro. This sexual union leads to the death of the plants (8b) and their regrowth and transformation into a different form (7cd, 8). Or so is my interpr.; acdg. to some, the flames are sometimes the referents, rather than the plants.

This proposed split reference seems to me to break the thematic unity of the verses and the climax in 8 of the death and renewed life of the females who unite with Agni.

The two 2nd dual middles, vahethe (2c) and āsāthe (3a), would both be better metrically with light 2nd syllables. On this phenomenon, see Arnole 129-30. A number of 2nd and 3rd dual middle forms invite this shortening. I do not understand it historically since Aves. has the ā in the athematic forms and the equivalent of e in the thematic ones (-aēte,- ōiϑe).

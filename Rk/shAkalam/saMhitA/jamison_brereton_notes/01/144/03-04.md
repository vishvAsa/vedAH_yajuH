The pair sávayasā ‘of the same vigor’ in these two verses have been variously identified: Sāy, Old (SBE, by implication), Hotar and Adhvaryu; Ge, Re, the two arms of the fire churner. I think it rather to be the two kindling sticks. As noted above, the dual participle in vitáritratā 3b here reminds us of the dual verb tarete in I.140.3, whose subj. is, by consensus, the two kindling sticks. In that same passage they are described as sakṣítā ‘sharing the same abode’, which matches samāné yónā … sámokasā “in the same womb … sharing the same dwelling” in our 4b.

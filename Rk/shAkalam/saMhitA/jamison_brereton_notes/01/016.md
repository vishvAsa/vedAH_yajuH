Indra


## 01
It’s not clear why Indra’s horses are called sū́racakṣas- ‘having the eye of the sun’, a word otherwise (3x) used of gods. The awkward doubling of the enclitic tvā (found in both a and c, as object of the same verb) might suggest that the c pāda was borrowed from elsewhere. And indeed this hymn gives the impression of being assembled from ready-made formulae; the proportion of repeated pādas is fairly high (see Bloomfield, RR), not to mention sub-pāda repetitions. JL suggests, however, that the repeated tvā might not be the result of careless doubling, but rather the stranded object of a gapped repetition of vahantu in pāda a.

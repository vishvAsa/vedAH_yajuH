Verse 5 is an intrusive Triṣṭubh in this Jagatī hymn. (The final verse is also in Triṣṭubh, but meter change is more usual in concluding verses.) The transition between the meters is cleverly managed here (as Old already pointed out): the final word of 4d (in Jagatī) and 5a (in Triṣṭubh) is áyugdhvam. The ending has the distracted reading -dhu vam in 4d, but is simply -dhvam in 5a. The reason for the change in meter is unclear to me.

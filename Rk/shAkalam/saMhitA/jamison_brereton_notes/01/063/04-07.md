tváṃ ha tyád provides the opening of the next four verses. Although tyád is a neut. pronoun and in 4a could function as the object of the otherwise object-less codīḥ, in the following verses it does not have pronominal function; the expression X ha tyád is a way of providing emphasis, particular of the 2nd ps. pronoun (cf., e.g., VII.19.2, VIII.96.16-18). I would now be inclined to tr. the vss. in this sequence with “It was just you who …” rather than the rather recessive “You then, …”

Contra Gr, áśva-budhya- cannot mean ‘durch Rosse bemerkenswerth’ with a gerundive to √budh, among other things because of the bahuvrīhi accent. Rather it belongs with áśva-budhna- ‘having a foundation of horses’, by way of *-budhnya-, an analysis that goes back to Aufrecht. All 3 occurrences of this stem (I.92.7-8, 121.14) qualify wealth or prizes. On the related hapax áśva-budhna- see comm. ad X.8.3.

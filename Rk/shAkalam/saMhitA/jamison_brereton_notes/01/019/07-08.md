Ge (sim. Re) supplies a verb (“kommen”) with 7b. I am, as usual, reluctant to do so, but as ET points out, swinging the mountains across the sea is a very peculiar image. I would prefer to supply the ‘stretch’ (ā́… tánvanti) of the next verse, since the b pādas of 7-8 are structually identical, producing a tr. of 7ab “Those who make the mountains swing, (as they stretch) across the undulating sea.” However, Ge/Re don’t construe the ‘stretch’ verb with 8b either.

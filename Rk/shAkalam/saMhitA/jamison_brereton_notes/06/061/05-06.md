This, the middle vs. of the tṛca, consists only of a rel. cl., which I consider preposed to vs. 6, though without a resumptive pronoun correlative with yáḥ. I supply one (‘him’) as obj. of ávā in 6b. Both Ge and Re instead supply ‘us’ as the obj. of that verb, leaving the rel. cl. in 5 without any syntactic tether. The middle vs. of the next tṛca (8) also consists just of a rel. cl.

The hymn begins with the near-deictic nom. sg. iyám, establishing the feminine subject immediately and emphatically (“this she here”). Since the just-given tr. is at best graceless and, more to the point, not English, I have opted to focus on the gender rather than the deixis. The next vs. also begins with iyám and the final vs. of the tṛca with the voc. sárasvati.

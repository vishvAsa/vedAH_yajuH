This tṛca has a more obvious unifying feature than the last several: the repeated ‘bull’ words, vṛ́ṣan- and vṛṣabhá-. I count 16 exx. of the two stems in the three vss. The bull(ish) grammatical subjects of the three vss. are different: 19 Indra’s horses, 20 the soma drinks, 21 Indra himself. The vṛ́ṣan- stem predominates; vṛṣabhá- only appears beginning in the last pāda of 20 (though prepared for by instr.

pl. vṛ́ṣabhiḥ in 20c). I do not see any appreciable difference in their usage; note the coreferential dative vṛ́ṣṇe … vṛṣabhā́ya in 20d and, even more striking, the use of the two stems in strictly parallel expressions in 21a and b: vṛ́ṣā … divó vṛṣabháḥ pṛthivyā́ḥ “the bull of heaven, the bull of earth” and vṛ́ṣā síndhūnāṃ vṛṣabhá stíyānām “the bull of the rivers and the bull of the standing waters.” Nonetheless, Ge carefully distinguishes them, with Bull reserved for vṛṣabhá- and vṛ́ṣan- rendered as Riese / riesig ‘giant’. But I very much doubt if the intent was “you are the giant of heaven, the bull of the earth,” etc.

The concentration on the bull words leaves little room or energy for other poetic flourishes.

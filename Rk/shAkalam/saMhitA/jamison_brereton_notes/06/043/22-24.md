As noted in the publ. intro., repetition also characterizes this tṛca: the ayám that opens every hemistich, along with two other pādas (23b, 24b). In all instances the referent is Soma, whose name, however, does not appear until the opening of the last pāda, 24d (though the reliable synonym índu- ‘drop’ is found in 22d). The beginning of the first vs., 22a, identifies the subject as a god (ayáṃ deváḥ), and the tṛca attributes powerful agency to him, including deeds generally associated with Indra, such as the defeat of the Paṇi (22b), the placing of light in the sun (23b), and the propping apart of the two worlds (24a). It is only the specification of Indra (in an oblique case) as the “yokemate” of “this god” early in the tṛca (22b índreṇa yujā́) that prevents the audience from assuming that ayáṃ deváḥ refers to Indra (who is, after all, the dedicand of the hymn). Nonetheless, the virtual identification of Soma with Indra is clear.

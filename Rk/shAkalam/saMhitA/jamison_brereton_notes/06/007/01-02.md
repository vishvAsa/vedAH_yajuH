These two vss. are paired, both ending with janayanta devā́ḥ and sharing an opening pāda with the structure ACC SG + GEN ACC SG + GEN; this NP structure is also found at the end of 1c and 2c (one iteration each), but is upended by GEN + ACC SG yajñásya ketúm in 2d. It is perhaps a measure of the sensitivity of the RV to subtle patterns that this syntactic metathesis feels strikingly disruptive. It may well be that the poet generated this disruptive order in order to call attention to this very phrase; see the importance of the word ketú- in vss. 5 and 6, with the comm. there. There is an important difference, however: here the “beacon of the sacrifice” must be Agni, whereas in vss. 5-6 it is the sun.

There are only three finite verbs in this two-vs. sequence, all injunctives: 1d janayanta, 2b abhí sáṃ navanta, 2d janayanta. The temporal reference is therefore unspecified. I tr. them as preterites (as do Ge and Re) on the assumption that Agni’s begetting by the gods happened only once in the mythological past. It would be different if priests were the subject.

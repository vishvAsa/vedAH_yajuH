These three vss. contain a series of perfect optatives, jagamyāt (8b), vavṛtyāt (9b), jagmyātam (10a), but they do not show any peculiarities of register or usage. The connection among the vss. is also signaled by utá, which opens the second two. Klein (DGRV I.424) notes the co-occurrence of the “optative series” (he does not mention that they are belong to the pf.) and the utá’s.

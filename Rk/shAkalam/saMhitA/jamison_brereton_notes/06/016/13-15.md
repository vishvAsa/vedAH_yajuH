title = "13-15"

+++
Another tṛca with fronted ‘you’ beginning all three vss., though here the 2nd two occurrences actually involve the enclitic with preposed pronominal prop: 14-15 tám u tvā, as opposed to 13 tvā́m. This tṛca is also characterized by snippets of mythology, contrasting with the otherwise monotonous focus on the standard ritual tropes. Unfortunately the snippets are just that -- they remain undeveloped.

This tṛca is recited in śrauta ritual during the churning of the fire; see Krick (Feuergründung, 297)

The last three vss. of this hymn are dominated by play on the syllable ví, which is also evident, though recessive, in the first part of the hymn. Starting with 5c every hemistich begins with ví: 5c víśve, 6a ví, 6c ví, 7a víśve; note also ví in the middle of 5d and 6a and beginning 6b. This sequence culminates in 7c vaiśvānaraḥ, whose first syllable is phonologically a vṛddhi form of vi and whose first member vaiśva- is morphologically a vṛddhi derivative of víśva-. That the two forms of víśve in 5c and 7a are in the syntagm víśve devā́ḥ “all the gods” and the 2nd member of vaiśvānará- is contrastively -nara- ‘man’ makes the pattern all the more pleasing.

And of course it is Agni Vaiśvānara who is the source of the poet’s revelation and therefore the focus of the hymn. The stationing of vaiśvānaráḥ at the beginning of the last hemistich of the hymn also forms a ring with the same form at the beginning of the second hemistich of the 1st vs. and reinforces the omphalos structure.

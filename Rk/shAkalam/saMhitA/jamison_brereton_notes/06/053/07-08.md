These vss. contains the delightful phrase ā́rikha kikirā́krṇ̥ u, whose playful sonic effects I endeavored to capture in my anachronistic tr. The word kikirā is of course a hapax (though cf. YV kikkiṭā́), and I doubt if a lexical meaning is to be sought for it.

I do wonder whether the original phrase read *kuru for *kṛṇu. The former is, of course, a late form, belonging to the irregular paradigm karóti, kuruté that will replace the well-behaved 5th cl. kṛṇóti after the RV. The impv. kuru is found in only two passages in the late RV, but in a colloquial hymn like this it would be at home, and the phonological patterning would be improved: ā́rikha kikirā́*kuru, with CV syllables containing repeated high vowels and a consonantal r in each word, in addition to the k’s. This *kuru would have been replaced redactionally by the kṛṇu standard in RVic discourse on the basis of kṛṇuhi in 10c. Vs. 10 displays a more formal level of discourse and imitates the final hymn-summary vss. found through the RV, and the standard RVic form of the pres. of √kṛ is in order there.

title = "11-13"

The first pāda of 12 recasts that of 11: with sutrā́mā matching trātā́ram and s u vávām̐ávobhiḥ matching avitā́ram; 13a then repeats sutrā́mā su vávān. The connections between 12-13 and neighboring vss. in this hymn make it less likely (at least to me) that they are direct evidence of the Sautrāmaṇī ritual here, instead of being pressed into service of that ritual later. See publ. intro.

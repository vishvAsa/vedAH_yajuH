Although the presence of hí, with its generally causal value, is often a puzzle when it appears in the first pāda of a hymn, this one helps signal the conceptual unity of this opening tṛca, with vs. 1 providing the various circumstances under which we call upon Indra and vs. 2 containing the contents of our latest address to the god -- a call for additional generosity from him.

The poet plays with the 2nd sg. pronoun. Historically -- and usually synchronically in the RV -- the nom. sg. tvám is disyllabic (t u vám) and the acc. sg.

tvā́m is monosyllabic, with occasional distraction to two syllables in analogy to the nom. But here the 1st vs. has three distracted acc. sg. t u vā́m, prominently pāda-initial (a, c, d), while the nom. sg. at the beginning of the 2nd vs. is monosyllabic. To match disyllabic t u vā́m, in 2a the two syllables are filled out by the addition of the pleonastic sá (#sá tvám), which is syntactically at home as subject marker of the 2nd sg. impv.

kira (see my 1992 “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?”). Since sá in such contexts is unnecessary, its presence draws attention to the metrical interchange between the nom. and acc. of the pronoun here.

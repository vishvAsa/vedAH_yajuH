As noted in the publ. intro., all three of these vss. contain the phrase “bring here to us”: in 6a and 7b na ā́bhara straddles the early caesura; in 8a ā́no bhara opens the vs. Since vss. 6-8 are the middle vss. of this hymn, this repeated phrase might identify an omphalos, but if so it is quite a weak one. The vss. are not particular noteworthy for their content, and the enclosing vss. do not provide the usual frame structure.

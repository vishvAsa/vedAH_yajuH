See the intro. for the curious density in this tṛca of the ppl. śuddhá- ‘cleansed’, which is not normal soma vocabulary. I do not understand what ritual or conceptual feature is at issue. Ge cites Sāy’s story about the purification of Indra after his killing of Vṛtra. This may be relevant, but there is no reference to Indra’s deeds or activities in this tṛca, save for the final hemistich in vs. 9, where we find vṛtrā́ṇi jighnase “you keep smashing obstacles” - an allusion to Vṛtra but couched in present time and plural number.

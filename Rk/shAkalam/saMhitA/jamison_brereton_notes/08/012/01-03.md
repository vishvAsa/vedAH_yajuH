This tṛca is unified by a series of relative clauses (mostly introduced by yéna) whose antecedent in the main clause is the tám that opens the refrain. The presumed referent of all the relative pronouns (and the tám’s) is mádaḥ in 1b, although it could be any power or capacity of Indra’s that comes to mind.

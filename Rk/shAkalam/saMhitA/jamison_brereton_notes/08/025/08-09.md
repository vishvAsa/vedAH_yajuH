Both these verses have a subject / VP construction that’s an etymological figure: 8c … kṣatríyā kṣatrám āśatuḥ, 9c … nicirā́ní cikyatuḥ. The latter is reinforced phonologically by the pāda-opening ní cin miṣántā. The unusual tmesis of preverb and participle, interrupted by the particle cid, may be (partly) accounted for by the desire to produce a ni ci- sequence matching the two that follow in that pāda.

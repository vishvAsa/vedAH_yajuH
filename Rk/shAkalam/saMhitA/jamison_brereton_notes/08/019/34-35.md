title = "34-35"

These two vss. are so interrupted by heavy voc. phrases addressed to the Ādityas that it is difficult to follow the thread. The poet identifies a mortal who is especially favored by the Ādityas (34b) and who therefore holds power among men (35b) and then expresses the hope that “we” might be “they” (vayám té … syā́ma, 35cd), that is, the fortunate man just identified. The switch in numbers is somewhat disconcerting, but can presumably be ascribed to attraction to the 1st pl. pronoun: “might we be he/that one” doesn’t work well in either Sanskrit or English.

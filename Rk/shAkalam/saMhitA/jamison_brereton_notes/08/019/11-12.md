The VP cáno dadhīta “should take delight” takes complements in two different cases (both found independently elsewhere), acc. stómam (11b), havyā́ (11c) and loc. rātíṣu (12b), all connected by vā (11c, 12a). Another ex. of the poets’ enjoyment of syntactically licensed case disharmony.

Note the alliterative v’s of 11c havyā́vā véviṣad víṣah (immediately preceded by 11b … viśvávāryaḥ and immediately followed by 12a víprasya vā …) and of 12d váso vividúṣo vácaḥ.

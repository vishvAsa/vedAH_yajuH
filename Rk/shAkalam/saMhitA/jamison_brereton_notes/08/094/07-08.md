I take the initial kád in both verses as a question particle, introducing a rhetorical question. Ge, Re, and Etter (p. 236) take the kád in 8 as a neut. acc. interrogative adj. modifing ávaḥ (“which help?”), though they all take the kád in 7 as a question particle. I do not see the justification for violating the evident parallelism of the two verses, and I also wonder if we get a choice of the kind of help the gods are going to provide us.

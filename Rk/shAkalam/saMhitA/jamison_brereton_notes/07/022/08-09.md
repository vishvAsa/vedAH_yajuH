The subject of the verb in 8b, úd aśnuvanti, is not specified. In my view the subject is postponed to 9ab: neither the older nor the younger poets are capable of expressing all of Indra’s powers in their formulations. Although this interpretation requires enjambment over a verse boundary, the main clause in 9c to which 9ab is supposedly subordinate has no appropriate referent for the relative pronoun (asmé works awkwardly at best), whereas 9ab neatly completes the thought of vs. 8.

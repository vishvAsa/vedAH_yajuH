The final pādas of both vss. are semantic variants of each other: “don’t hurt our children.” In 2d the negative is expressed by the privative on the adj.

anamīváḥ (… bhava) “be without affliction,” while 3d contains the stronger and more conventional prohibitive mā́… rīriṣaḥ “do not harm.” The word for ‘children’ is the fairly rare uncompounded root noun jā́- in 2d, replaced by the fuller and more familiar bipartite phrase toká- tánaya- “offspring (and) descendents.”

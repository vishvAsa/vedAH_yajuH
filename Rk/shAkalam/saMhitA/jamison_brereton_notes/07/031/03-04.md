Although these verses straddle a tṛca boundary, they are neatly responsive. The repeated tvám of vs. 3 is matched by the initial vayám of vs. 4, and the repeated -yú- (‘seeking X’) adjectives of 3 are again matched by the tvāyú- ‘seeking you’ of 4a. The final word of both verses is the voc. vaso. Even the gavyú- ‘seeking cows’ of 3b has its complement in 4b vṛṣan ‘o bull’.

There is no obvious noun to supply with asyá ‘of this’ in c. Ge supplies “Schrei,” and my “cry” follow him; Klein (I.175) instead “act.” The phraseology reminds us of the refrain of I.105 vittám me asyá rodasī, which I tr. “Take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world-halves.”

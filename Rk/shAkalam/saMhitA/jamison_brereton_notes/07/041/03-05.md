The concatenation continues in the next vss. The ending of vs. 3, … nṛvántaḥ syāma, echoes in the following two vss. The 1st pl. opt. syāma is repeated at the end of 4a and d and 5b, while the -vant-stem adj. shifts from nṛvántaḥ (3d) to another punning bhágavantaḥ (both ‘possessing a portion’ and ‘accompanied by Bhaga’) in bhágavantaḥ syāma (4a, 5b; cf. bhágavān 5a). And bhágavān in 5a matches maghavan in the same metrical position in 4c.

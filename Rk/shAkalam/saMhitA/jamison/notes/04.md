Commentary IV
## IV.1 Agni
I do not understand the emphasis on Varuṇa in the early parts of the hymn
(vss. 2–5; see also 18d), since the Vala myth and the unnamed Aṅgirases in the later
parts of the hymn have no obvious conceptual connection with Varuṇa and the
Ādityas (see also Aditi in 20a).

### IV.1.1  
Hymn-introductory hí is difficult to render. It does not have its normal causal
sense, though perhaps in this position hí is meant to explain why the hymn is recited
following a particular ritual action. It is noteworthy that the first hymn of Maṇḍala
VI (also, of course, to Agni) opens in exactly the same way: tváṃ hí agne.
With Ge (/WG) I take pādas def as the direct address of the gods to mortals,
with the speech introduced by íti krátvā in c. (This idea goes back to Bergaigne; see
Old SBE ad loc.) Rejecting this interpr., Old labors mightily to explain away the
apparent 2nd pl. actives yajata and janata as voc. and 3rd pl. middle respectively. (In
this he follows Sāy.) Re tries in addition to make yajata also a 3rd pl. mid. (see also
Gonda [Vedic Literature, 228], whose tr. renders both forms as 3rd plurals). Although
yajata could actually be a voc., 3rd pl. middles in -ata to thematic stems are
morphologically impossible, no matter how metrically unfavorable -anta would be.
Ge’s direct speech interpr. solves these grammatical problems and also makes sense
of the íti in c.
The poet plays with ā/a and the oppositional pair mártya- / devá- in de, with
chiastic #ámartyam … mártyeṣv ā́# in d, and devám ā́devam opening e. (See also
devā́so devám opening 1b.)

### IV.1.2  
As Arnold (VedMetre, 300) suggests (so also Old, HvN), deleting agne in
pāda a and reading vavṛtsu
va (as in 3a) yields a fine Jagatī line.

### IV.1.3  
The injunc. vidaḥ is functionally multivalent, but usually interpr. as an impv.
(so Ge, Re, though not WG). On this form see comm. ad I.42.7–9 and IX.20.3. I
would now allow an alternative translation as impv.: “find grace …”
The final pāda (g) is a combination of the opening of c (asmábhyam dasma)
and the ending of f (śáṃ kṛdhi).

### IV.1.4  
My “may you please placate” is meant to capture the precative (áva)
yāsisīṣṭhāḥ of the siṣ-aorist to √yā. Note the dissimilation (if that’s what it is) of the
middle sibilant from expected rukified ṣ to plain s.
Note the phonetic figure straddling the hemistich boundary: b yāsisīṣṭhāḥ / c
yájiṣṭhaḥ.
In 4c, likewise 6b, HvN note the caesura after three (4c yájiṣṭho váhnitamaḥ,
6b devásya citrátamā). I wonder if the splv. suffix -tama- here is semi-detachable for
metrical purposes, yielding an opening of 5 in both cases.
2

### IV.1.5  
The idiom áva √yā ‘placate, appease’ found in 4b finds a close variant in 5c
áva yakṣva ‘placate through sacrifice’ to áva √yaj. Though belonging to different
roots, they are phonologically and semantically similar. Another such variant is
found in d vīhí mṛḷīkám “pursue his grace,” which echoes 3d mṛḷīkám … vidaḥ “you
(will) find grace” -- again two different roots (vī and vid) but phonologically and
semantically similar.

### IV.1.6  
Because of the position of ná (ghṛtáṃ ná taptám) I follow Ge in taking śúci
as the shared quality between simile and frame and therefore “attracted” to the neut.
of the simile, though we would expect a fem. modifying the gapped saṃdṛ́ś-.
The distracted reading ághni
(yāyāḥ) ‘inviolable [cow]’ at the end of pāda c
echoes agní-, the divinity of the hymn.

### IV.1.7  
I take santi satyā́here as an etym. figure, a phrasal verb meaning “come into
existence” (“come [to be] true”), rather than taking santi as copula and satyā́as a
simple adj. with most tr. For one thing, pres. tense forms of √as in main clauses are
usually existentials, not copulas; for another trís should mean ‘three times’, not
‘three’ or ‘threefold’ as a copular reading seems to require (e.g., Ge “Dreifach sind
diese seine höchsten wahren (Geburten) …”). See also satyám astu in 18d. I am not
sure which three occasions are being referred to, but possibly to the production of the
three ritual fires -- though esp. given the word paramá- ‘highest’, it could be a
cosmic reference.
I do not know what “enveloped within the limitless” (ananté antáḥ párivītaḥ)
refers to. It may be the dense swirling smoke, lacking clear boundaries, that
surrounds a fire, or it may be the unborn Agni’s concealment in the kindling sticks --
though it’s hard to see how they would be anantá-. It is also possible that this is a
reference to the paridhi sticks that surround the ritual fire (see comm. ad IV.3.2
below); they would be “endless” because a circle has no end. Note the phonological
play of (an)anté antáḥ, despite their different etymological affiliations.
In d the standard tr. take ari
yáḥ as nom. sg. to the thematic stem aryá- (e.g.,
Ge ‘Herr’). I follow Thieme (Fremdling, 77–78) in interpr. it as gen. sg. to arí-.
Among other things, as Gr points out, this would be the only ex. of aryá- with
distraction, while arí- does have a few other distracted forms. There is no compelling
formulaic evidence either way, but V.34.9 ketúm aryáḥ “the beacon for the stranger,”
adduced by Thieme, resembles our passage thematically.

### IV.1.8  
In b the caesura appears to coincide with a compound seam (#hótā
híraṇya/ratho …), as HvN also note. This is reminiscent of the proposed caesuras in
4c and 6b, before the splv. suffix -tama. See also 19b.
The first cmpd member ráṃsu- is taken by Schindler (Rt Nns, 40) as the loc.
pl. to a root noun rán- ‘Freude’, an analysis accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. RAṆ).
3

### IV.1.9  
I follow Ge (n. 9a) in giving mánuṣaḥ a double reading, acc. pl. obj. of
cetayan and gen. sg. dependent on yajñábandhuḥ. Note that it is neatly positioned
between those two words.
I think yajñábandhuḥ has a more specific sense than simply ‘Opfergenosse’.
Rather, Agni is literally our ‘tie’ (bándhu-) to the primal sacrifice instituted by Manu
because he has always been present, always the same, at every sacrifice since then.
The referent of asya in c is taken as the mortal (márta-) in d by Ge (implicitly
also Re), as Agni by WG. Either is possible, both grammatically and contextually.
There is no requirement that a possessive coreferential with the subject be expressed
by a reflexive (svásya in this case), and though, technically speaking, an unaccented
oblique form of ayám should have an antecedent, the close proximity of mártasya
and the fact that the subject of the preceding verb (nayanti), though pl., is clearly
mortal would make asya = mortal unproblematic. And given the ritual intimacy of
Agni and his worshipper(s), the house belongs to both.
Note the phonological echo in sā́dhan (c) and sadhanitvám (d), even though
they are semantically unconnected. As for the latter, I now favor the alternative deriv.
proposed by Scar (291), from a base *sadhaní- ‘Teilhaber am gemeinsam Schatz,
Teilgaber, Genosse’ in turn built to sa-dhána- (ŚB) ‘gemeinsamer Schatz’ -- rather
than as a derivative of the [/a] root-noun cmpd sadha-nī́-, with shortening of the root
vowel before -tvá- (so AiG II.2.715). See sadhanyàm in X.50.3. In fact some or all of
the three forms assigned to the root-noun cmpd by Gr (IV.4.14, VI.51.3, X.93.5) may
also belong rather to Gr’s stem sadhanyà-. (Both Lub and Scar assign all four forms
[that is, incl. X.50.3] to the sadhanī́-, though, as just noted, Scar considers the
alternative analysis.) The problem with the root-noun analysis is that the semantic
connection between √nī ‘lead’ and the apparent sense of the derivative is quite
attenuated. It is, however, the case here that two finite forms of √nī (nayanti 9b,
nayatu 10a) flank sadhanitvám, so there may be at least a secondary connection
perceived.
IV.1.10–18: Hoffmann tr. and comments on these vss. in Injunktiv (pp. 175-78).

### IV.1.10  
In b I follow Hoffmann (Injunk., 175) in taking the rel. clause as
devábhaktaṃ yád asya, rather than just yád asya with the standard tr. The sense
doesn’t differ markedly.
More difficult is the configuration of cd. All the standard interpr. (incl.
Hoffmann), save for Old (both SBE and Noten), take final ukṣan as the voc. sg. of
ukṣán- ‘ox’, referring to Agni. I prefer, with Old, to take ukṣan as a 3rd pl. injunc.
main-clause verb (√ukṣ ‘sprinkle’), with the subj. the immortals of c. The image is of
the gods first creating the treasure and then bringing it to life like a watered plant. In
favor of the majority interpr, I must concede, is the common idiom satyám √kṛ
‘make real’, which would in fact complement my interpr. of santi satyā́in 7a, but I
find a voc. address to Agni in the middle of 3rd ps. reff. to him (10ab, 11, not to
mention vss. 6-9) awkward. Re refers to “l’étrangeté d’un tel Voc.,” despite
explicitly rejecting Old’s finite verb interpr.
4
And what is the treasure? A slightly different phrase rátnam … dyúbhaktam
(rather than devábhaktam as here) returns in vs. 18, where it seems to refer to the
light of Dawn in the form of the cows released from the Vala cave; here I think it
may be the light of the newly kindled ritual fire -- and of course the lights of Dawn
and the fire of the dawn ritual can be superimposed upon and identified with each
other. If the light of the new fire is the primary referent in this vs., ukṣan ‘sprinkled’
may refer to sprinkling ghee on the fire, which action would cause it to blaze up. The
next vs. (11), which describes the birth of Agni, fits this interpr.

### IV.1.11  
The vs. treats the birth of the ritual fire on earth, with the second hemistich
describing the amorphous shape and constant motion of physical fire. That it has
neither foot nor head (apā́d aśīrṣā́) presumably refers to the lack of consistent
vertical definition of a flickering fire; “concealing its two ends” (guhámāno ántā) is
reminiscent of 7c “enveloped within the limitless” (ananté antáḥ párivītaḥ), and the
explanations suggested there may apply here. In addition, the “two ends” may be the
non-existent foot and head just referred to.
IV.1.11–12: The repeated phrase “in the nest of the bull” (vṛṣabhásya nīḷé, 11d, 12b)
is somewhat opaque, but I think Ge is basically right, that the vṛṣabhá- is Agni (not,
with Hoffmann, heaven). His nest is, in my opinion, the ritual ground; its designation
also as the “womb of truth” (ṛtásya yóni-, 12b) supports this identification. I find
WG’s n. on this phrase incomprehensible, though it seems to follow Hoffmann in
part.

### IV.1.12  
I am in agreement with most of the standard interpr. that the referent of the
subj. of ab is the troop of Aṅgirases, expressed by the neut. s-stem śárdhaḥ (pace Gr,
who takes it as a thematic masc. nom. sg., referring to Agni, sim. Schmidt [B+I, 43 n.
21]), though this word generally refers to the Marut troop.
I part company with these interpr. with regard to the referent of c, however.
Most take this string of nom. sg. masc. adj. as further descriptors of the Aṅgiras
troop, while I think they refer to Agni. Agni and his births are referred to as spārháearlier in the hymn (6d, 7b); in 8c he is described as vapuṣyò vibhā́vā exactly as here.
The recycling of this characterizing vocabulary seems to me a clue that the subject
has changed here from the first half of the vs: it would be perverse to repeat this
phraseology with a referent other than the original Agni. Note also that yúvan-
‘young’ is regularly used of Agni, and in the context of his birth the word is esp. apt.
I take this nominal clause (/subclause) as annunciatory of the gapped object of d.
Ge, Re, and Old (SBE) take janayanta in d as intrans. ‘be born’ (e.g., Ge
“Dem Bullen wurden die sieben Freunde geboren”), but this medial form is a
standard ex. of -anta replacement of the undercharacterized act. -an and is therefore
transitive. See my “Voice fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd plural -anta in
active paradigms,” IIJ 21 (1979) 146-69. It is correctly interpr. by Hoffmann (Injunk.,
176) and WG. The form is an injunctive, contra the Pp.; so already Gr; see Old
(Noten), Hoffmann.
5
The “seven dear ones” (saptá priyā́saḥ) are most likely the Aṅgirases, here
referred to in the plural rather than the collective neut. sg. in pāda a. III.31.5 contains
“seven inspired poets” (saptá víprāḥ) in a clear Aṅgiras/Vala context. It is also
possible that the phrase refers to the Aṅgirases’ music, since saptá vā́ṇīḥ ‘seven
voices’ is a common phrase. The adj. priyā́saḥ could be either masc. or fem.

### IV.1.13  
This is the first of the Vala myth vss. As noted in the publ. intro., the actors
throughout must be the Aṅgirases, but they are never named.
The curious phrase ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ “panting over the truth” occurs three times
in IV.1–2 (also 2.14, 16). It expresses the energy and effort of the Aṅgirases in
singing the true song that opened the Vala cave and freed the cows. See Lü (514–15).
The med. part. huvāná- is ordinarily passive in value; pace Gr, only VII.30.3
is clearly trans. I therefore take huvānā́ḥ here as fem. acc. pl. modifying uṣásaḥ in
passive sense. The standard interpr. is masc. nom. pl. in trans. value, ‘calling to’.
This would of course make just as much sense; my choice is based on the usage of
the preponderance of occurrences of the stem.

### IV.1.14  
Med. marmṛjata is most likely reflexive, as I and most other interpr. take it,
though Sāy. and Re supply Agni as object. Although the reflex. interpr. seems a little
thin -- splitting stone is dirty work, so they had to clean themselves up -- Agni is out
of place in this Vala context and there is no other obvious candidate to be object.
Moreover, the middle voice suggests a reflexive sense.
The referent of anyé in b is not clear to me. By my placement rules (see
“Vedic anyá- 'another, the other': syntactic disambiguation,” Sound law and analogy,
Fs. Beekes [ed. A. Lubotsky], 1997, pp. 111-18), it must be definite (“the others”).
Most tr. take it as indefinite, though Hoffmann tr. it as definite and implicitly
contrastive with the unspecified subject of pāda a: “Die (einen) … Die anderen von
ihnen …” I think this approach is the correct one, though I don’t think we need or
want the group of Aṅgirases to be split into moieties. Instead, in my view, the
contrastive groups are the primordial singers, the Aṅgirases, and their modern
counterparts, the poets and singers of the current ritual. The injunctive ví vocan
would allow a presential interpr. (“they proclaim …”) with current singers as subj.
instead of or in addition to the preterital one in the publ. tr.
In c we return to the Aṅgirases, whose singing opens the Vala cave -- hence
“they sang the decisive act.” Most tr. take kārá- as a victory song of some sort (the
exception is WG: “… singen sie auf das Schaffen,” where kārá- is the subject of the
song. But I think the expression is more radical: as so often in the RV, our poet wants
to emphasize the power of words to make things happen, the connection between
song (the cause) and the act, the splitting of the rock (effect).
The hapax cmpd. paśváyantra- is puzzling in formation and sense, although
the parts it is based on are relatively clear. The 1st member is paśu- ‘livestock’ or a
derivative thereof, the 2nd is or contains yantrá- ‘binding rope’. The interpr. comes
down to deciding which is the lesser of two evils: positing an otherwise unattested
extended stem paśvá- beside paśú- but a relatively conventional bahuvrīhi ‘having
6
binding ropes for the livestock’ or rejecting the extended stem but ending up with an
anomalously formed and accented bahuvrīhi. Old argues strenuously for the former,
with the rather cumbersome tr. “in ihren Vorrichtungen zum Festhalten … das Vieh
haltend,” and some version of this analysis is followed by Hoffmann and WG. Ge
and Re (the latter with some hesitation) opt for the latter, with Ge suggesting a
reverse bahuvrīhi (for ayantra-paśu-). (He cagily fails to accent it.) In the end I
swallow some version of the second analysis, primarily because I find it unlikely that
such a common word as paśú- would display an unnecessary extended stem in just
this place in all of Sanskrit, particularly because there’s little metrical advantage to it
here. However, I do not follow Ge’s reverse bahuvrīhi interpr. (roughly, “having
livestock loosed from the binding ropes”), but assume that it is the Aṅgirases who
lack yantra-s to bind the cattle and do so with song instead. (This interpr. goes back
to Bergaigne; see Old SBE ad loc.) That some form of verbal expression could serve
as a yantrá- is shown by the cmpd. ślóka-yantra- (IX.73.6) ‘having ślokas as binding
ropes’. Unfortunately I do not see how to make this explanation work formally,
particularly with regard to accent, esp. as there exists a differently accented privative
cmpd. ayantrá- in X.46.6. I leave it at this, unsatisfactorily.
In terms of the structure of the vs., I now think the odd pādas (a, c) refer to the
Aṅgirases and the even ones (b, d) to the current singers. I would therefore slightly
modify the published tr., which presents pāda d as if it were the direct speech -- the
song -- of the Aṅgirases described in c. I now think d is what the other, current poets
were said to proclaim in b.

### IV.1.15  
The hapax dṛdhrá- is plausibly explained by Hoffmann (reported in EWA
s.v.) as a crossing of a redupl. nominal*dadhrá- (√dhṛ) and the ppl. dṛḍha (√dṛh),
the latter found in the second hemistich (15c).

### IV.1.16  
In the publ. tr. prathamám in the phrase té manvata prathamáṃ nā́ma is
rendered as an adj. with nā́ma (“the first name”). On the basis of VI.1.a tvám …
prathamó manótā “you (were) the first minder” I think it possible (but not certain)
that prathamám here is an adverb: “they first brought to mind the name …” The
agent noun manótar- is built to the verb stem manu- found in our passage, and
prathamám may qualify the action of ‘bringing to mind’ rather than the name
brought to mind.
A comma should be inserted in the publ. tr. after “(The cows)” in pāda c.
On vrā́- see comm. ad VIII.2.16 and Jamison 2003 (= “Vedic vrā́: evidence
for the svayaṃvara in the Rig Veda?” in Paitimāna: Essays in Iranian, IndoEuropean, and Indian Studies in Honor of Hanns-Peter Schmidt, vols. 1-2 [ed.
Siamak Adhami], 2003, pp. 39-56).
Because of its accentuation yaśásā should be adjectival; the question is what
head noun to supply. Flg. Lü (Varuṇa, 521, also fld. by Hoffmann, WG), I supply
‘name’, which appears in pāda a and appears to be the topic of the rest of the vs. Ge
and Old prefer ‘milk’, but this is contextually less likely.
7

### IV.1.17  
On néśat as a replacement for an original thematic redupl. aor. with radical
zero-grade (expected *na-nś-a-), with the vocalism of the first syllable replaced by
that of the weak perfect, see KH, Injunk. 64–65.
On dúdhita-, a qualifier of darkness, see EWA s.v., with ref. to Schindler
(1967), who separates it from dudhrá-, etc., and adduces possible Germanic and
Toch. color-term cognates.

### IV.1.18  
I interpr. the “treasure apportioned by heaven” (rátnam … dyúbhaktam) to
be in the first instance cows (as in I.73.6), those released from the Vala cave, but the
cows conceived of as dawns and therefore as light, including the light of the newly
kindled ritual fire. See vs. 10 above, with rátnam … devábhaktam. This buried “light”
motif works well with the houses in pāda c, where the ritual fire is at home (see vss.
9, 11 above), and provides an easy transition to the invocation of Agni in the next vs.
The subj. of dhārayanta in b I take as the gods in c (with Old, SBE, Hoffmann,
WG), rather than taking c as a separate nominal cl. (Ge, Re). Note the chiastic
morphological figure in c, allowing alliteration between the nom./loc. pairs: víśve
víśvāsu dúryāsu devā́(ḥ).
In d I supply the treasure (in the form of light) as the subj. of satyám astu (so
also Hoffmann). This VP should be interpr. in the context of santi satyā́in 7a. See
comm. there.

### IV.1.19  
In b HvN note a caesura after 3; I wonder instead whether the caesura
comes at the cmpd seam (#hótāraṃ viśvá/bharasaṃ …), a solution they themselves
suggest for 8b, where the caesura would otherwise come after 2. See also 4c, 6b.
On the cmpd viśvá-bharas- see comm. ad V.54.10.
The general opinion is surely correct, that the “gleaming udder of the cows”
(śúcy ū́dhaḥ … gávām) stands for the cows’ milk, which is compared to the soma
stalk, itself standing for soma. But I think that the udder also stands for the Vala cave,
which contained the cows. The root √tṛd ‘drill’ is used for breaching the Vala cave
in VI.17.1, 3, X.74.4. Ge finds the subj. of atṛṇat unclear, but surely Agni makes the
most sense (not the sacrificer, per Sāy.). In his ritual role, Agni causes the dawn to
dawn and therefore opens up the Vala cave on a daily basis. And at the same time he
brings the outpouring of ghee (in the sacrifice) and the morning dakṣiṇā and other
products of the cow.
The two soma-related terms aṃśú- and ándhas- are difficult to define and to
distinguish from each, esp. since both can be used in place of soma itself. However,
insofar as it’s possible to tell, they seem to refer to (parts of) the physical plant soma,
rather than its product, the juice also called soma. As far as I know, this is the only
passage in which the two terms occur together, with gen. aṃśóḥ dependent on acc.
ándhaḥ, which suggests that ándhas- is a part of the aṃśú-. This surmise supports the
interpr. given by EWA s.vv. (with lit.) that the aṃśú- is the plant and ándhas- is the
plant’s stalk. The use of both terms to refer loosely to the soma drink is similar to the
use of ‘grape’ or ‘vine’ to refer to wine.
8
I do not understand the position of ná. With the other standard interpr. I tr. it
as if it qualifies the verb it immediately follows (“he drilled, seemingly …”; Ge “er
zapfte gleichsam …,” etc.), but this is simply not a regular RVic usage: similes are
always nominal. I would like to connect it with the double usage of ū́dhaḥ just
discussed, but I’m not sure how. I wonder if the 2nd reading of ū́dhaḥ as equivalent to
the Vala cave hints at a simile like vrajám … gávām iva “like a pen of cows”
(I.130.3; cf. I.10.7, IV.20.8, etc.). This would allow us to tr. the phrase “He drilled
the gleaming udder of the cows [=milk] like the ‘udder’ [=pen/Vala] of the cows,”
which would restore ná to its normal function of marking nominal similes.

### IV.1.20  
Within the balanced phrases of the first hemistich -- víśveṣām áditir
yajñíyānām, víśveṣām átithir mā́nuṣāṇām -- the nearly identical nominatives áditir
and átithir make rhetorical sense. But why Agni is called, or identified as, Aditi (or
boundlessness or innocence, if it is used as a common noun) is unclear. Since Aditi is
the archetypal divine mother, perhaps Agni is being credited with a maternal relation
to the gods, as a deliberate paradoxical foil to vs. 1, where the gods install Agni and
are his de facto parents, and to the other accounts of his birth in this hymn. It is also
the case that Agni is closely associated with Varuṇa, a son of Aditi, early in the hymn
(vss. 2, 3, 4, 5, also 18), though in vs. 2 it is explicitly stated that Agni is Varuṇa’s
younger brother, certainly not his mother. For a different wordplay involving áditisee IV.2.11 in the next hymn.
## IV.2 Agni

### IV.2.1  
There seem to be deliberate echoes in this vs. of the 1st vs. of the preceding
hymn (IV.1.1) -- esp. pāda b devó devéṣu aratír nidhā́yi corresponding to IV.1.1b
devā́so devám aratíṃ nyeriré; also IV.2.1a … mártyeṣv amṛ́taḥ and IV.1.1f ámartyam
… mártyeṣv ā́. The first pāda is identical to I.77.1c, which continues (I.77.1d) with
hótā yájiṣṭhaḥ … as in our pāda c.
On trisyllabic mahnā́(restored as *mahinā́by HvN, though as *mahanā́by
Gr; see also Old Noten), see comm. ad I.123.4.
With Old (Noten, not SBE; also Re; Keydana, Infinitive im Ṛgveda, 54), I take
īrayádhyai as a causative inf. in passive construction, “to be roused,” rather than
Ge’s intransitive “um … zu fahren” or WG’s transitive reflexive “um sich … in
Bewegung zu setzen.” Note 7b átithim udīrat “will raise (you) up (as) guest.”

### IV.2.3  
The two rhyme words vṛdhasnū́and ghṛtásnū clearly form a rhetorical pair,
though they have different origins and grammatical analyses, as their different
accents show. ghṛtásnu- is generally taken as a bahuvrīhi with the reduced form of
sā́nu- ‘back’ as 2nd member. See Old ad loc. and ad I.16.2, and cf., with a different
designation of the same body part, ghṛtá-pṛṣṭha-. However, this cmpd. has a complex
relationship with the differently accented ghṛtasnú- as well as ghṛta-snā́- ‘bathed in
ghee’. See Scar (661–62).
9
As for vṛdhasnú-, Gr takes it as a root-noun cmpd, with snú- for snā, and
glosses ‘Segen triefend’; Scar (662) more or less follows this analysis, though he
proposes several different morphological pathways. Debrunner (AiG II.2.930), a bit
confusingly, takes it as a “Nachbildung” to ghṛtásnu- though containing a suffix -
asnu- (sim. Old SBE). (Debrunner does not gloss it; Old ‘mighty’.) WG seem to take
it as containing the same ‘back’ as ghṛtá-snu-, tr. ‘von hochgewachsenem Rücken’. I
agree with the general sense that vṛdhasnú- has to have been influenced by ghṛtásnu-,
hence my parenthetic ‘strong(-backed)’, but it cannot have been formed in direct
parallel because of the accent. I think it should be evaluated in the context of another
nearby form belonging to √vṛdh, viz. the irregular (pseudo-)participle vṛdhasāná- in
IV.3.6, a stem that occurs 3x in the RV. Since that stem was part of our poet’s
repertoire, I think it possible that he could create a reduced form of the “suffix” -
sāná- (intermediately *-sná-, just as -snu- is reduced from sā́nu-) with further
adjustment of the final vowel to match ghṛtásnu-.
The instr. mánasā must go with jáviṣṭhā given the close relationship between
the root √jū and mánas- (cmpds máno-javas-, etc.) throughout the RV; the question
is only how to construe the instr. with the splv. I take it as an instr. of quality, rather
like Re’s “les plus rapides par rapport à la pensée (même).” Flg. Sāy., Ge tr. the
phrase as if it were a comparative with an abl.: “… schneller als den Gedanken,”
which certainly makes sense but airbrushes the grammar. WG seem to take mánasā
as a dual acc. (“die beiden schnellesten Denkorgane des Ṛta”), which is
grammatically impossible for neut. mánas- (expect *mánasī). Masc. du. -as-stems do
have the ending -ā, but if the word here is meant to be masc., it should either be in a
cmpd. (type su-mánas-) or show accent shift to a derived poss. adj. *manás- ‘having
mind’, which is not attested. Others (Lü 454, Scar 662) simply detach mánasā from
jáviṣṭhā and tr. it elsewhere in the clause, but the formulaics speak strongly against
that.
In the second hemistich the 2nd sg. verb īyase and the 2nd pl. acc. prn. yuṣmā́n
comes awkwardly into English (“you [sg.] speed between you [pl.] and …”), but
neatly signals Agni’s natal affiliation with one of the two sides for which he acts as
go-between. See also 1a mártyeṣv amṛ́taḥ, 10b devó mártyasya, where Agni’s
divinity is juxtaposed with his mortal worshiper(s).
Contra Old (SBE and Noten) and Ge, I see no reason to take mártān (or, as
Old wants to read, *mártām) here as gen. pl. It is perfectly interpretable as an acc. pl.
appositive to víśaḥ. However, the same form in 11b is a somewhat harder case; see
comm. there, as well as nṝ́n in vs. 15.

### IV.2.4  
Unaccented gen. pl. eṣām must refer back to yuṣmā́n … devā́n “you gods” in
3d; evidently the poet only wants a selection of them to be brought to the sacrifice.

### IV.2.5  
The qualifier ‘long’ (dīrgháḥ) of wealth in d means, of course, ‘long-lasting’
(just as dīrgháṃ támaḥ [I.32.10, etc.] refers to “long(-lasting) darkness”). However,
since it is implicitly contrasted here with ‘broad’ (pṛthu-budhná- ‘having a broad
base’), it is clear that the image is one of physical dimensions, not merely temporal
10
ones. And, at least for me, “long darkness” is a more striking verbal formulation than
“long-lasting darkness.”

### IV.2.6  
Having described in the previous vs. what a (properly performed) sacrifice
can get us, the poet now tells us what we have to do to perform this sacrifice properly.
On the pf. subjunctives here, see my 2016 “The Vedic Perfect Subjunctive
and the Value of Modal Forms to Tense/Aspect Stems” (Fs. J L. García Ramón],
with disc. of the pf. subjunctives in this verse as well as the pres. and aor.
subjunctives in vss. 7–9. There I specifically dispute Kü’s interpr. (340, also 212,
595) of the pf. subj. as functioning “zur Bezeichnung der vollendeten Handlung für
den generellen Fall” (i.e., “… gebracht hat,” etc.).

### IV.2.7  
As he often does, Ge takes cid as a simile marker, but I do not think that is a
possible function of cid, and certainly in this case there is no need to interpret
ánniyate as a simile: Agni is regularly depicted as a greedy eater.
Contra Gr, all standard modern tr. and comm. take niśíṣat (so Pp.; niśíṣan is
also phonologically possible, though morphologically unlikely) as belonging to √śā
‘sharpen’ (common with ní), not √śās ‘instruct’ (not found with ní). There are
formulaic parallels with clear forms of ní √śā; see Ge’s n. 7b and esp. VII.3.5c. With
Old it seems best to emend to *niśíśat. He takes it as a short-vowel subj. to the redupl.
pres. śíśāti. So also Hoffmann (Aufs. II, 445–46 n. 14). This is certainly possible, but
it could also be a masc. nom. sg. act. part. to this same redupl. pres. Both a finite 3rd
sg. in a rel. cl. and a part. would be accented on the stem (not the preverb) as here,
and either form is contextually possible. It can simply belong3 to the string of
subjunctives in this passage that express ritual service. But note pāda a of the
previous vs. (6a), which has a subj. and a part. (jabhárat siṣvidānáḥ); one could argue
that in this sequence of vss. there is no more than one finite verb per pāda, though
that is not a particular telling argument.

### IV.2.8  
Because the loc. phrase své dáma ā́“in his own house” in c does not seem to
fit the equine simile there, in the publ. tr. I took it implicitly with ab. However, cf.
I.143.4 agníṃ táṃ gīrbhír hinuhi svá ā́dáme “urge Agni on with songs here in his
own home,” with a form of √hi and the same loc. phrase. If the hapax hemyā́-vant- is
derived from √hi (so Old, SBE and Noten, generally now accepted) and means
something like ‘possessing/receiving impulsion, much impelled’, the spurring or
impulsion may refer to hymns and be happening in Agni’s own home. So an
alternative tr. might be “receiving the spurring (of hymns) in your own house, like a
horse you will carry …” The separation of hemyā́vān from the simile áśvo ná invites
but does not require reading hemyā́vān primarily with the frame, not the simile.

### IV.2.9  
rāyā́… ví yoṣat shows the well-known instr. of separation.

### IV.2.10  
rárāṇaḥ in b is clearly the middle part. to √rā ‘give’. This form appears
frequently in this metrical position with just that meaning (e.g., in the preceding
11
hymn IV.1.5c). However, given the 2nd sg. subj. jújoṣaḥ ‘you will enjoy’ at the end of
the preceding pāda, I think it likely that there is a secondary association with the near
synonym √ran ‘enjoy, take pleasure’ and that rárāṇaḥ could be loosely interpr. also
as a 2nd sg. pf. subj. with irregularly strengthened root syllable and wrong accent
(contrasting with the properly formed pf. subj. rāráṇas, -at, etc.).
Ge unaccountably interprets hótrā in c as the Goddess of the Offering found
in the Āprī hymns rather than as a common noun meaning ‘offering’, an interpr. that
severs c from the rest of the verse.
Pāda d is a clear relative clause (yásya), though both Ge and Re render it as an
independent clause. Their tactic is understandable because pāda c, the only main cl.
in the vs., has no overt antecedent for the rel. prn. in d. We must supply a ‘his’ with
hótrā to produce the connection between c and d.
The identity of “we strengtheners” is a bit puzzling. The stem vṛdhágenerally refers to a god or gods who strengthen their worshipers. In X.147.3 it is
used of sūrí-s, human ‘patrons’, but patrons should not be the 1st ps. speakers in
Rigvedic discourse -- rather it should be those who receive their patronage, i.e., the
poets. I assume here it must refer to the group of ritual officiants, including the poet
himself, and the person they are strengthening is the Yajamāna (or what will become
the Yajamāna in later Vedic ritual).

### IV.2.11  
Note the phonetic figure in a, with the repetition of ci, followed by vi, which
is then doubled by vi(dvā́n): cíttim ácittiṃ cinavad ví vidvā́n.
On vītá- see comm. ad IX.97.17.
It is tempting here to take mártān here as a short genitive plural (see 3d
above), as Ge and Re do. However, in X.89.3 ví yáḥ pṛṣṭhéva jánimāni aryá, índraś
cikā́ya … “who has distinguished the races of the stranger, like the (straight and
crooked) backs (of horses),” the clear acc. pl. jánimāni ‘races, peoples’ suggests that
semantically similar mártān here can be the obj. of ví √ci.
I see no reason to supply a verb in c (like Ge); it can be easily construed with
d.
The pair dítim … áditim in d recalls the cíttim ácittim that opens the vs. The
standard interpr. take dítim áditim as a positive/negated pair, understandably. But this
requires one of the words to be positively valued and one negatively valued (not
necessarily corresponding to the privative form). The problem is that each of the
verbs that govern these accusatives (√rā ‘give’, uruṣyá- ‘make wide space, deliver’)
ordinarily takes positively valued objects. Attempts to give uruṣyá- a negative sense
(e.g., Old SBE “keep off Aditi”) founder on the large number of positive cases. I
therefore think that dítim áditim are not in an etymological relationship but are
actually a pun. díti- is the ‘giving’ goddess and derived from √dā ‘give’. For this
etymological relationship see VII.15.12 dítiś ca dāti vā́ryam “And Diti gives a thing
of value.” áditi- by contrast is both the familiar goddess Aditi and the common noun
‘boundlessness’ (derived from √dā ‘bind’). Each of these is the object of an
appropriate verb: a different root meaning ‘give’ for díti- ‘giving’, a verb meaning
12
‘make space’ for áditi- ‘boundlessness’. For a different wordplay with áditi- see
previous hymn, IV.1.20.

### IV.2.12  
I take paḍbhíḥ in this vs. as belonging to a root noun páś-, meaning ‘with
the eyes’, flg. Oldenberg (SBE [1897]) and Schindler (Wurzelnomen, 31). (However,
Oldenberg silently retracted this view in his short piece on paḍbhíḥ some ten years
later [ZDMG 63 (1909): 300-302 [=KlsSch 316–18].) As Schindler points out, other
hapaxes occur in etymological figures like our paḍbhíḥ paśyeḥ. All other exx. of
paḍbhíḥ belong to pád- ‘foot’, including the one two vss. later (IV.2.14). Although
such close proximity of identical forms might appear to weigh against assigning
them to two different stems, esp. since one of the stems would be a hapax, their
contexts seem designed to disambiguate: vs. 12 contains the etym. fig., while 14
juxtaposes the word with another body part frequently paired with it: paḍbhír
hástebhiḥ “with feet (and) hands.”

### IV.2.14  
The vs. modulates from the 1st pl. of the subordinate clause in the first
hemistich (yád vayám … cakṛmā́) to the 3rd pl. of the main clause of d (yemuḥ
sudhyàḥ) via the simile in c (ráthaṃ ná krántaḥ). The simile could belong either to
the subord. cl. or the main cl. and is grammatically and semantically appropriate to
either the 1st or the 3rd ps. subject of either.
On ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ see comm. ad IV.1.13.

### IV.2.15  
For the third time in this hymn a pāda-final acc. pl. might more comfortably
be interpreted as a gen. pl. -- here nṝ́n. In the cases of mártān in 3d and 11b we saw
that the acc. pl. reading was easily possible and an abbreviated (or re-formed) gen. pl.
interpr. was unnecessary. Here an acc. pl. interpr. seems more difficult, though
perhaps not impossible. If it is a gen. pl. the tr. would be “as the foremost ritual
adepts of/among men,” and most interpr. implicitly or explicitly accept this analysis.
(See also disc. in AiG III.119 and Old, ZDMG 55: 285–89 [=KlSch 744–78], though
Old in the Noten favors a nominative pl. analysis, also by preference ZDMG 55: 287
[=KlSch 746].) Certainly nṛ́̄n appears to be more multivalent in the RV than other
acc. pl., and, though reluctant, I cannot rule out a gen. pl. However, I think it is
possible that nṛ́̄n is a rough acc. of goal (“born to men”) or respect (“ritual adepts
with respect to men”).
Interestingly, here “we” aspire to a complete set of parents: Mother Dawn,
Father Heaven. Generally in the RV a single parent will do in any particular
rhetorical situation.

### IV.2.16  
On ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ see comm. ad IV.1.13.
This vs. has double temporal reference, to the Aṅgirases of long ago using
sacred speech to split the Vala cave and release the cows and to the current priests,
who imitate the speech of the Aṅgirases in order to release the dawns from darkness.
The failure to realize the double reference to both the opening of Vala and the
beginning of the current dawn sacrifice has caused interpretational difficulties.
13
To begin with, śúci in c has been puzzled over. Old (SBE) attempted to make
it a fem. adj. modifying dī́dhitim, but in the Noten opts rather for an adverbial neut.
Most other tr. interpr. it as an abstract ‘Klarheit’ vel sim. (Ge, Re, Scar [530], sim.
Schmidt [B+I 43-44]), while WG take it as the modifier of ṛtám in the preceding
pāda. I do not know of other exx. of śúci- in abstract value; I interpr. it rather in
conjunction with the phrase śúcy ū́dhaḥ … gávām “the gleaming/blazing udder of
cows” in the preceding hymn (IV.1.19). As noted in the comm. there, I take this as a
ref. to the Vala cave. But this “blazing (udder)” can also refer to the current sacrifice,
with the newly kindled fire at its focus. The priests approach this with their sacred
speech to set the ritual in motion and achieve dī́dhitim ‘visionary power’.
I think pāda c is appropriate for both the ancient Aṅgirases and the presentday ritualists, and so I would modify the publ. tr. somewhat. The verb ayan is a
subjunctive to the root present of √i and therefore primarily applicable to the
ritualists and the actions they will now perform. But I also think that it’s possible to
interpr. it as a backformed injunctive to the same root present. Since augmented
imperfects to stems beginning with a vowel always have lengthened augment (here,
well-attested 3rd pl. āyan ‘they went’), it would be possible to form an injunctive by
“subtracting” the augment a-, producing ayan, rather than the more proper yan
(found only in III.4.5). By such an interpr. the Aṅgirases could also be subjects of the
verb: they came (inj.) to the gleaming/blazingVala cave (represented by śúci), and
the priests will come (subj.) to the gleaming/blazing place of sacrifice.
The Pp. reads kṣā́mā in d as kṣā́ma, and most interpr. (save for WG) follow
the Pp. and take this form as a singular, tr. “splitting the earth” -- as a reference only
to the Vala myth (even though it is not the earth that gets split in that myth). But I
think we should take the Saṃhitā form seriously, as the elliptical dual it appears to be,
extracted from the dual dvandva dyā́vā-kṣā́mā. The phrase “splitting (heaven and)
earth” would refer to the visual experience of dawn, when the appearance of the
dawn light at the horizon seems to split sky from earth, allowing the light to flood in
through the resulting slit.

### IV.2.17  
And yet again we have a form that would be best interpr. as a genitive pl.,
but formally is not -- devā́or devā́ḥ [so Pp.] in devā́jánimā (cf. devā́nām … jánima
[or jánimā] in the next vs., 18b). It would be possible to interpr. devā́ḥ as nominative
subj. in the simile (“as the gods do metal”); on the other hand, reading devā́, some
have taken it as a neut. pl. adj. with jánimā. Here, however, I think a gen. pl. interpr.
is the correct one, but the poet is playing a little trick: the sequence ná devā́is to be
flipped to *devā́na à devā́nā(ṃ). The occurrence of the expected phrase in the next
vs. would be an example of immediate poetic repair (see my 2003 “Poetic 'Repair' in
the Rig Veda”).
The standard tr. take śucántaḥ as transitive, with agním as obj., but as most
comment, verb forms to this root are otherwise intransitive; see esp. identical
śucántaḥ in nearby 15d. It seems better to interpr. agním as the obj. of vavṛdhántaḥ
along with índram; there is no obstacle to such an interpr.
14
On the secondary present stem seen in the participle vavṛdhánt- here, cf. Kü
(471).

### IV.2.18  
This vs. closes the mythological section of the hymn and is so positioned to
seem as if it ought to be the denouement of the Vala myth. But it seems, at least to
me, to have no connection with that myth or, indeed, with anything else in this hymn.
I remain baffled by it, and my comments here will be only on matters of detail.
Ge (/WG) take the subj. of ab to be the leader of the Aṅgirases, possibly
Bṛhaspati. I follow Old (Noten) and Re in taking Agni as 3rd ps. subj., though he is
also addressed with the voc. ugra. In this vs. the discrepancy in person is the least of
our problems. My rather weak reason for preferring Agni as subj. is the fact that the
hymn, dedicated to Agni, is drawing to a close, and the final two vss. (19–20) are
explicitly Agni vss. I see nothing in the vs. to suggest that any Aṅgiras is involved,
save for the herds of livestock that remind us of the Vala myth -- but they are in a
simile.
Ge takes ā́√khyā as meaning ‘count’, but as Re points out, this sense is not
found earlier than the ŚB. A parallel passage shows a clear word for ‘watch over,
look at’: VII.60.3 sáṃ yó yūthéva jánimāni cáṣṭe, which supports ‘watch over’ for the
verb here. That passage also suggests that the jánima in b is the obj. of ā́… akhyat
and corresponds to yūthā́in the simile (similar Old, Noten). I therefore take the yád
in b to be a neut. sg. referring to jánima rather than the subordinating conj. (‘when,
since’) of the standard tr. -- and I also follow the Pp in taking sg. jánima as the
underlying form in the sandhi conglomeration jánimā́nti, rather than pl. jánimā as
assumed by others. (The jánimā of 17b does give me pause, however.) With Old I
supply ‘pasture’ with kṣumáti in pāda, rather than taking it as a personal designation
(Viehbesitzer, maître du bétail), though not much depends on it. In my (/Old’s)
reading, it would refer to the ritual ground. Old’s paraphrase of the first hemistich in
the Noten is “… dass Agni … vor sich die Götterscharen erblickte wie Viehherden
auf der Weides des Opfers.” His interpr. of the passage informed mine.
As to what the “nearby” race of gods consists of, I have no idea -- perhaps the
gods that come to the sacrifice. Recall that in vss. 3–4 the poet asked Agni to bring
(only) a selection of gods to the sacrifice.
The second half-vs. is even more puzzling than the first, because there seems
no reason to introduce Urvaśī and her retinue (pl. urvaśī́ḥ) and her son Āyu. I supply
jánima with mártānām rather than construing this gen. independently as most others
do; the parallelism of the passage supports this.

### IV.2.19  
The augmented 3rd pl. avasran is listed as an aor. to √vas ‘shine’ by
Whitney (Rts) and Gr and so tr. by Old (SBE), Re, and (somewhat attenuated) Ge. I
take it rather as an impf. to the root pres. of √vas ‘wear’ (so listed by Lub., so
interpr., more or less, by Kü, Stativ, 97–98); WG take it also to ‘wear’, but as an
ingressive aorist. Since the root already has a root present and there are no other
forms to a root aorist, this seems to multiply entities unnecessarily. What does it
mean for the dawns to wear/clothe themselves in truth? Perhaps either that they are
15
greeted by a (truly formulated) hymn that serves as their garment or that by dawning
they display the truth of the orderly functioning cosmos as their clothing. Although I
think that avasran belongs properly to √vas ‘wear’, this of course does not mean that
there is not a pun on √vas ‘dawn, shine’.
## IV.3 Agni

### IV.3.1  
I render vs.-final kṛṇudhvam twice -- once with vs.-initial ā́in the meaning
‘make = kindle’, rather than with most tr. ‘bring here’, and once with the quasiinfinitival dat. ávase.
It is not entirely clear why Agni is identified as Rudra here. The word is most
likely to be construed with the gen. adhvarásya as “the Rudra of the/your ceremony,”
on the basis of I.114.4 rudráṃ yajñasā́dham “Rudra bringing the sacrifice to success”
and III.2.5 (also of Agni) rudráṃ yajñā́nāṃ sā́dhadiṣṭim “the Rudra of the sacrifices,
bringing success to the offerings.” Perhaps the point of comparison is Rudra’s
healing powers and, esp. here, his ability to ward off threats of all sorts, in this case
the “unexpected thundering” (tanayitnór acíttāt) of pāda c.
ródasyoḥ can be either gen. (with most tr.) or loc. (so publ. tr.). There is little
riding on the choice.
As most interpr. take it, “unexpected thundering” is probably a reference to
all sorts of unforeseen dangers, rather than specifically of a sudden storm.

### IV.3.2  
All the standard tr. take the rel. cl. of pāda a (cakṛmā́yáṃ vayám te “[the
womb] which we have made for you”) as the frame for the simile in b, with “we”
matching the eager wife (jā́yā … uśatī́) and “you” (Agni) matching the husband. Old
(SBE) goes so far as to supply “marriage-bed” as the match for the womb: “… as a
well-dressed loving wife (prepares the marriage-bed) for her husband.” This is one
possible reading, but I don’t think it is the only (or even the dominant) one; in fact, I
think the simile can be matched to four different entities in the verse.
Let us begin by noting that pāda b, the self-contained simile, is found three
times elsewhere (I.124.7 of Dawn, X.71.4 of Vāc, and X.91.13 of praise [suṣṭutí-]
seeking Agni), in all cases of females or of entities conceived as female. An obvious
“entity conceived as female” is found in the nominal main clause of pāda a, ayáṃ
yóniḥ “here is the womb”: the womb, though grammatically masc., is a female
accoutrement and can be matched with the wife in the simile in b. This “womb”
(=fireplace) is well prepared (“richly dressed” suvā́sāḥ) and ready to receive Agni as
her husband. For womb = wife, cf. III.53.4 jāyéd … séd u yóniḥ “The wife -- just she
is the womb.”
But suvā́sāḥ elsewhere occurs in the same pāda with párivītaḥ (found in our
pāda c): III.8.4a yúvā suvā́
sāḥ párivīta ā́
gāt “As a youth, richly dressed, engirded, he
has come here.” Although the referent there is the sacrifical post, the vocabulary is
also appropriate to Agni. Therefore it could be the Agni of c who is like a wife, eager
for her husband identified with the womb in pāda a -- a gender reversal that would
16
appeal to the Rigvedic poets. (Note that the standard reading, where “we” the
ritualists match the wife, also requires some gender reversal.)
Finally let us consider pāda d. The subj. of d is fem., expressed by imā́u te …
pratīcī́h “these facing you.” Ge (/WG) supply “Frauen,” but in n. 2d Ge suggests
gíraḥ (inter alia); Re supplies “louanges.” I think gíraḥ must be correct: there are a
number of imā́u tvā/te … gíraḥ passages (e.g. VI.45.25, 28, VII.18.3, VIII.3.3), and
Ge/Re adduce V.12.1 for gir- as well: gíram bhare vr̥ṣabhā́
ya pratīcī
́
m. As was noted
above, in 2 of its 4 occurrences the “eager wife” simile has speech/praise as its
comparandum, so in fact that simile in our b works best with the hymns in d: these
hymns face towards you, like an eager wife to(wards) her husband.
Bloomfield discusses the simile at length ad I.124.7. He is rather sour about
our passage: the construction is “very loose indeed”; “the metaphor limps decidedly.”
Contra Bl I consider the deployment of the simile here as an example of the poet’s
extreme cleverness, with the simile applicable to every single entity in the vs. To
reflect the polyvalent status of the simile, the publ. tr. should probably be changed to
“(It is / we are / you are / they are) like …,” though this would be very clumsy.
As for párivīta- ‘enveloped’ in c, the question is what Agni is enveloped in. It
could be the paridhi sticks that surround the ritual fire (see, e.g., Ge ad I.128.1,
endorsed for that passage by Thieme [Unters. 19]); WG suggest dawn’s light or
hymns; Old (SBE) offerings and prayers. It’s useful to note that párivīta- occurs
twice with the loc. of yóni-: once in an Agni hymn X.46.6 párivīto yónau sīdad antáḥ
(note √sad here as well) and once in the riddle hymn I.164.32 sá mātúr yónā párivīto
antáḥ, so that the two concepts seem to be connected (“enveloped within the womb”).
This could fit the paridhi sticks forming a border of the fireplace conceived as a
womb. It might also refer to the kindling sticks, within which fire is hidden until he
is ignited (/born), hence also his womb. There is another important parallel in nearby

### IV.1.7  
ananté antáḥ párivīta ā́gāt “enveloped within the limitless, he has come here”;
see comm. there. On the multiple meanings of párivīta- in Agni context, see Thieme
(Unters., 19–20).
Modern tr. (almost) universally take the voc. svapāka- as ‘having a lovely
backside’ vel sim., related to ápāñc- ‘turned backwards’ and here implicitly
contrasting with pratīcī́ḥ ‘turned towards, facing’. The one exception is Old, who in
SBE (1897) tr. “O most skilful one,” an interpr. that he swiftly disavowed (ZDMG
55 [1901]: 301 [=KlSch. 760]) as “nicht zu denken” -- without admitting he had in
fact thought it previously. Nonetheless, I think this is a more appealing interpr. than
the current standard. I take it as built to a negated á-pāka- ‘not naïve, not callow’ to
pā́ka- ‘naïve, callow, simple’ -- like ámūra- ‘not stupid’: mūrá- ‘stupid’. ámūra- is
found three times in the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala (IV.4.12, 6.2, 11.5), always of
Agni. The semantically similar ádṛpita- ‘undistracted’ in the next pāda (3a) supports
this interpr. There are two other occurrences of svápāka- (VI.11.4, 12.2), both
analyzed by the Pp as sú ápāka- (both adduced by Old, SBE), both modifying Agni.
In neither case does a “having a lovely backside” impose (or even suggest) itself, and
I propose to include them under this stem.
17

### IV.3.3  
Ge takes the voc. vedhaḥ as the poet’s self-address, which is certainly
possible; he is commanding himself to recite (śaṃsa). This does not solve the
question of the person of the verb īḷé in d. Although this form is universally rendered
(incl. in the publ. tr) as a 3rd sg. (and analyzed, because of its accent, as the only
perfect form to this root, against root pres. ī́ḷe, ī́ṭṭe; see Kü 122), it could of course
also be a 1st sg. pf., with sótā an appositive to the underlying 1st ps. subj. (“I the
presser”). Since the surrounding vss. (2 and 4) have explicit 1st persons (though pl.), I
would be inclined to emend the publ. tr. to “whom I, the presser, invoke …”
Pāda d plays on the standard Rigvedic notion that the soma-pressing stones
are very noisy and that their noise is like that of the priestly recitation and singing
happening at the same time. The question here is which of the three terms in the
phrase grā́veva sótā madhuṣút belongs to the simile and which to the frame. On the
basis of X.64.15 grā́vevā yátra madhuṣúd ucyáte bṛhát, I take grā́vā … madhuṣút
“the honey-pressing (pressing) stone” as a discontinuous simile, with the frame
represented by sótā in between. Ge, Re, WG, Kü (122), and Scar (615) take the
simile to be grā́veva sótā and the frame madhuṣút; Old (SBE) confines the simile to
grā́vā with the frame sótā madhuṣút. Either of these configurations avoids a
discontinuous simile, but such similes are not rare and the phraseology of X.64.15
supports my analysis. Little rests on it, however.

### IV.3.4  
My “at least” for cid follows Ge (“wenigstens”). This somewhat testy note
seems to introduce the next part of the hymn, with its anxious or annoyed questions
to Agni about his relationship to the sacrificers and how he will represent it to the
other gods.
The śámī- and the ṛtá- here presumably refer to the complementary physical
and verbal aspects of the sacrifice. On ṛtá- as “Kultlied” in this and similar passages,
see Lü (esp. 442–43).
IV.3.5–8: The list of gods to whom Agni will tattle on us follows a certain pattern.
Vs. 5 contains the standard great trio of Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, as
well as a minor Āditya, Bhaga ‘Fortune’, who is, however, important for our welfare.
Although we might have expected the Sun here, because he serves as the Ādityas’
eye, observing our offenses, we have instead Heaven and Earth, which frame the
cosmos. In vs. 6 the nearer gods of the midspace, particularly Vāta ‘wind’ and the
Aśvins, are featured. Rudra appears in both 6 and 7; I don’t quite understand why,
but recall first that Agni was identified as Rudra in vs. 1 and may be also in 10d (see
also 14b). Moreover, in 6 the punishing aspect of Rudra is emphasized (‘mansmiting’, nṛhán-), while in 7 he is paired and/or contrasted with the benevolent Pūṣan
under the ambiguous epithet súmakha-, which means both ‘good combatant’ and
‘very generous’, so his effects on human life are emphasized and he counts as a
nearer god, who in fact is the giver of the oblation (havirdā́-). In the 2nd half of 7
Viṣṇu and his three strides return us to the contemplation of the whole cosmos, and
vs. 8 functions ring-compositionally with vs. 5: we have the Sun we expected (and
18
didn’t get) in 5, with Aditi standing in for the Ādityas in 5, and heaven (though
probably the place, not the deity) is the final goal.

### IV.3.5  
The last pāda would be more accurately rendered “What to Aryaman, what to
Fortune?”

### IV.3.6  
Note that all four pādas rhyme: agne# (a), śubhaṃyé# (b), kṣé# (c), nṛghné
(d); also 7ab pūṣṇé# … havirdé#, an unusual effect in RVic verse.
The so-called “double stem” vṛdhasāná- is morphologically anomalous, but
belongs to a fairly large group of stems with apparent middle part. in -asāná-. This is
not the place to treat the origin of these stems at length, but, with Insler (KZ 82
[1968]), I think the starting point is sahasāná- (5x, 4x of Agni) ‘displaying might’,
which he takes as a metathesized form of a pf. mid. part. *sasahāná-, beside
sāsahāná- (1x) and the younger type sehāná- (3x). This metathesis was reinforced by
the very common s-stem sáhas-, and several other -asāná-stems have s-stems
alongside (śavasāná-: śávas-, rabhasāná-: rábhas-, jrayasāná-: jráyas-) and fall into
the same general semantic field of strength, power, or violent action (though not one
of the best attested, mandasāná- ‘becoming exhilarated’ nor, e.g., dhiyasāná- [2x]).
There is unfortunately no neut. s-stem *vṛ́dhas-, though there is a single attestation of
an infinitival dat. vṛdháse with suffixal accent. See also disc. of vṛdhasnú- ad IV.2.3.
Pāda c is problematic, both metrically (it lacks a syllable) and grammatically:
this is the only place in the RV where nā́satya- appears in the sg., not the du., and the
identity of pāda-final kṣé is disputed. The metrical problem and the kṣé problem can
be easily solved together if we adopt the suggestion of Hoffmann registered in
Schindler (Root nouns, s.v. kṣā́-) that kṣé is a haplologized form of datival inf. *yakṣé
‘to appear’ in the environment (nā́sati
)yāya [ya]kṣé. (Note that yakṣám ‘apparition’
appears in 13a.) This interpr. is also reflected in WG’s rendering, and one way or
other it goes back to Ludwig; see Old (SBE, Noten). The publ. tr. should have an
asterisk before “to appear.”
As for sg. nā́satyāya, although this analysis is emphatically rejected by both
Old (Noten) and Debrunner (AiG II.2.136), I have adopted Henry’s old suggestion
that the form is a vṛddhi adj. of appurtanance whose vṛddhi is invisible because the
base already has initial-syllable vṛddhi. We would of course expect the accent to shift
to the final syllable (AiG II.2.133ff.), hence *nāsatyá-, but the dominance of the
initially accented noun could have altered the accent, possibly redactionally. I supply
‘chariot’ in this dat. expression, since the Aśvins’ chariot is esp. prominent and
párijman- modifies their chariot elsewhere (I.20.3, X.41.1). Cf. esp. I.20.3 tákṣan
nā́satyābhyām párijmanaṃ sukháṃ rátham “They fashioned the earth-circling wellnaved chariot for the Nāsatyas.”

### IV.3.7  
On the benevolent Rudra see comm. ad vss. 5–8. It is not clear why or how
Rudra is the giver of the oblation. Old (see also WG’s n.) suggests that it is in his
capacity as paśupati-: he provides the beast for sacrifice. This is possible: though he
19
is not so called in the RV (where the word is not found), this epithet is applied to him
in AV (e.g., XI.2.28) and VS (e.g., XXVI.28).
In c rétaḥ ‘semen’ is somewhat surprising, esp. if it is to be construed as the
object of brávaḥ -- so much so that Gr (tr., not Wö.) suggested emendation to répaḥ
‘stain’, an emendation accepted by Old (SBE, Noten) and Lü (622) and maintained
tentatively by Scar (214). Re keeps the transmitted form but interprets it as a way of
referring to negative speech: “Quelle semence (de blâme dirais-tu) …?” But in a
culture so fixated on fertility, semen is basically always a positive concept. Important
is the fact noted by Ge (n. 7c) that Viṣṇu is elsewhere the protector of semen (cf., e.g.,
VII.36.9 víṣṇuṃ niṣiktapā́m “Viṣṇu, protector of the poured-out [semen]”). In his n.
(and contra his tr.) Re suggests an alternative interpr. of rétaḥ here as a truncated
*retodhe (cf. retodhā́- 5x) or *retode (Re does not accent either proposed form). This
seems the correct solution, with the -de extracted from havirdé, which ended the
preceding pāda.
In d Re suggests that śárave bṛhatyaí is the “état pré-compositionnel” of a
bahuvrīhi *bṛhatśarave (no accent provided and no application of sandhi), whose
referent is Rudra. Although the arrow is surely Rudra’s as all standard interpr.
recognize, there is no reason to substitute the god for his symbolic accoutrement. Just
as Agni can speak to the chariot of the Aśvins (6c, by my interpr.), he can also speak
to Rudra’s arrow.
Ge (n. 7d) points out the contrast between Viṣṇu as creator (c) and Rudra as
destroyer (d).

### IV.3.8  
Although it is tempting to take ṛtā́ya as an adj. modifying śárdhāya (so, e.g.,
Ge “der rechtwandelnden Schar,” sim. WG, Old SBE), the stem ṛtá- is
overwhelmingly a neut. noun. It is possible, with Re, to take it as an appositive with
the Marut troop: “Ordre (incarné)” or, with Lü (623), as a separate entity to whom
Agni’s speech is directed, but I think it more likely that it is a dative of purpose, like
(ya)kṣé in 6d, havirdé in 7b: “for truth,” that is, for the Maruts to attain or ascertain
the truth.
The masc. (/neut.) turā́ya cannot modify fem. áditaye (pace Old SBE). Ge
supplies “heaven”; WG suggest the sun. With Re I opt tentatively for Indra, who is
frequently modified by this adj. and who is otherwise absent from this fairly
comprehensive list of important gods (see Ge n. 8c). Brereton (Ādityas, 205–6)
instead thinks turā́ya represents an Āditya, probably Varuṇa, and takes áditaye not as
the name of the goddess but as a common noun ‘innocence’, with the dative phrase
meaning “for the mighty one (=Varuṇa) to (ascertain our) innocence.” This assertion
of innocence at the end of a series of questions about potential blame would set the
stage for the request that Agni make our sacrifice succeed (pāda d). This suggestion
is appealing, but I am not convinced that áditi- ever means ‘innocence’, and further
in this sequence the purpose datives are only pāda-final, which áditaye is not.
Pāda d poses some syntactic challenges. The first is that sā́dhā, by all
accounts a 2nd sg. act. impv. to √sādh, has no expressed obj., though act. forms of
this root are fundamentally tr. (but sometimes, esp. in the participle, used in absolute
20
sense “assuring success”; cf. nearby IV.1.9). I supply dhíyam ‘thought’ vel sim. as
the object, since forms of dhī́- or other words for thought/prayer are regularly
construed with √sādh. The other problem is what to construe gen./abl. diváḥ with. (It
cannot be acc. pl. because of the accent.) The standard solution has been to take it
with cikitvā́n (e.g., Ge “der du den Himmel kennst”), but as Re points out, cikitvā́n is
never otherwise construed with a gen. His solution is to supply an obj. for sā́dhā on
which diváḥ is dependent: “Mène droit au but (les affaires) du ciel.” My interpr.
requires a slight emendation, from sā́dhā diváḥ to *sā́dhā́diváḥ -- that is, sā́dha ā́
diváḥ, with ā́+ ABL in the meaning “all the way to.” Cf. I.92.17 yaú … ślókam ā́
diváḥ … cakráthuḥ “you two who made your signal-call (reach) all the way to
heaven”; sim. III.61.4. See comm. ad locc. An asterisk should be inserted before “all
the way.”
IV.3.9–12: Each of these vss. begins with the resonant and charged instr. ṛténa ‘by
truth’, the usual introduction to a truth formulation. Each of the vss. does seem to
express a mystical truth about the ritual or its mythic background. There is no
obvious connection to the group of vss. that precede (the question vss. of 4cd–8), but
if I am correct that we should supply ‘thought’ or ‘thoughts’ in 8cd, where we ask
Agni to send them all the way to heaven, it may not be fanciful to think that vss. 9–12
are these very thoughts.

### IV.3.9  
This vs. expresses the beloved paradox about cows and milk, that the cow is
“raw” but her milk “cooked” (that is, ready to consume), and further that a black cow
can still give white milk. These paradoxes describe in the first instance the
production of the ritual offering, the milk that will produce the ghee to be poured into
the ritual fire. But it may also (esp. the 2nd hemistich) characterize the transition from
the night (black cow) to dawn (the gleaming milk) at the dawn sacrifice; see Janert
(Dhāsi, 29ff.).
The standard interpr. (save for WG) take ṛténa as the agent with the ppl.
níyatam (e.g., Re “L’Ordre a été fixé par l’Ordre (même)”). Because the flg. 3 vss.
also begin with ṛténa, interpreting the first one outside of the pattern established by
the rest seems misguided, esp. given the usual function of initial ṛténa (see comm.
above on vss. 9–12).
I take the ṛtám that I reverently invoke (īḍe) to represent the paradoxes just
discussed -- the mystical truth of the cow’s nature -- and I interpr. ā́góḥ as an
ablative phrase, referring to the source of this truth. Most take góḥ as a gen., but this
makes ā́hard to construe. (The phrase ā́góḥ occurs 3x elsewhere, always pāda final,
twice in this maṇḍala [IV.22.4, 23.6] and once in X [X.100.12]; nowhere is it clear.)
At least acdg. to Old (SBE) and Ge, the ṛtám is actually a reference to the milk. I am
skeptical.
On dhāsí- see comm. ad I.62.3, 140.1.
The hapax jā́marya- is opaque; see EWA s.v. My tr. follows Janert’s analysis
(Dhāsi, 33ff.), that it is a secondary derivative to jām-ara- “die die Nachkommen
Nährende.” Ge’s suggestion (n. 9d) that it is related to YAves. zǝmar ‘on/in the earth’
21
(in zǝmar-gūz-), hence ‘earthly’ (versus heavenly milk = rain), fits the passage less
well.

### IV.3.10  
This 2nd vs. in the truth-formulation sequence both continues the mystical
description of the dawn sacrifice and presents another paradox. With regard to the
sacrifice, the milk produced in vs. 9 becomes the butter oblation poured on the
sacrificial fire, as Ge discusses. Ge’s explanation of the phrase páyasā pṛṣṭhyèna lit.
“the milk belonging to the back” is ingenious and (to me) convincing: it is the milk
on the top (the image is of a four-legged animal), i.e., the cream, which is made into
butter. With the offering of the butter, the fire flames up -- allowing it to go about
“conferring vigor” (vayodhā́-) in c.
Pāda c also inaugurates the paradox that is most clearly expressed in d. Agni
is characterized as áspandamāna- in c. As Ge points out (n. 10c), √spand ‘kick,
lunge, jerk’ is only used in Vedic of cows when they are being milked, so Agni is
both bull (vṛṣabhá- [a], vṛ́ṣan- [d]) and cow. This paradoxical double identity is
sharpened in d, where Agni is identified not only as a bull but as Pṛśni, the cow who
is the mother of the Maruts, and he is the subj. of the quintessential “cow” verb √duh
‘milk’ and acts on the quintessential cow body part ū́dhar- ‘udder’. The substance
s/he produces from this udder is śukrám, a word that can refer not only to ‘gleaming’
milk, but is also used to refer to semen. A similar gender-bending milking scenario
involving Pṛśni and Rudra, the Maruts’ father, is found in II.34.2; see that passage
and the comm. thereon. Here Agni may be being identified with Rudra; see the AgniRudra equation in vs. 1 and also the focus on Rudra in the “question” vss. (6d, 7b,
7d). There are a number of passages in the Agni hymns of IV that should be brought
into the conversation, though unfortunately what they have to say is obscure: see the
“gleaming udder” (śúcy ū́dhaḥ) in IV.1.19 and a neut. entity (quite possibly her
udder) belonging to Pṛśni in IV.5.7, 10.
What -- if anything -- this refers to naturalistically is unclear. The tendency
among interpr. has been to take it as a reference to rain (see Ge n. 10d) or to some
other celestial phenomenon (Lü 390), but I find Bloomfield’s suggestion (RR 213)
more appropriate to the passage, that the fire, blazing up, “shoots out his flames from
his bright udder; he, a bull, is thereby -- mirabile dictu -- also a pṛ̥çni, the heavenly,
yielding cow, par excellence.” Bl also suggests that śukrá- here mean ‘semen’, with a
zeugma of duduhe: “As a bull he hath spurted semen, as a Pṛ̥çni cow he hath milked
his udder.”

### IV.3.11  
The third truth-formulation vs. sets up the Vala myth as the model for the
coming of dawn: just as the Aṅgirases breached the Vala cave and let loose the cows,
so the human sacrificers break Dawn out of her confinement by kindling the ritual
fire. This is the third step in the depiction of the morning ritual. As noted elsewhere
(see esp. the publ. intro to Maṇḍala IV and to IV.1), the Vala myth and the Aṅgirases
play an outsize role in the Agni cycle of IV.
Despite the injunctives of pāda a (vy àsan) and c (pári ṣadan), I am tempted,
with Gr, to read anavanta in b, to produce 11 syllables. (Consider the augmented
22
impf. in d, abhavat.) Old (Noten) considers this restoration possible but not
necessary. Hoffmann (Injunk., 209) gives a typical treatment of the vs. in his
interpretational system, assuming an injunc. navanta in b.

### IV.3.12  
The ritual application of this final ṛténa vs. is less clear than for the first
three. It may simply refer to the waters used at the first soma pressing. Or the ritual
aspect may be muted, and the point is to make room for the Vṛtra myth next to the
Vala myth in vs. 11. However, the opt. dadhanyuḥ seems to reflect a movement from
what has happened (the injunctives and preterite indicative of the last few vss.) to
what should now happen, which suggests that there should be a ritual application.
The athem. mid. part. -stubhāná- is isolated, beside the act. them. 1st cl. pres.
stóbhati, and it is therefore impossible to determine its exact value -- including
whether it is passive (so, e.g., Old [SBE], Ge, Re) or not. Gotō (1st cl., 332 and n.
808) argues against such a value, on the basis of the intrans. sense of the root, and I
have followed him in the non-passive assessment. My tr. “beat a tattoo” reflects my
sense that √stubh is associated esp. with rhythm. As for sárga-, lit. ‘surge, gush’, it
can refer to the instant when the surge is released, hence here the start of a race.

### IV.3.13  
This vs. is very difficult. As I see it, the point of the vs. is to demand that
Agni not track down and punish the speaker for the transgressions of others, esp.
others who are close to the speaker and could be mistaken for him. In the first
hemistich this notion is expressed by GEN yakṣá- “the specter/apparition of X,”
where yakṣá- could perhaps best be rendered as Doppelgänger.
The first problem one encounters is kásya and the puzzle of how an
interrogative would interact with the prohibitive mā́. The standard solution is to treat
kásya as an indefinite, without the usual particle (cid, caná) to mark this value -- e.g.,
Re “… de qui (que ce soit).” But when the negative ná is used, the indefinite ‘no one,
nothing’ always has the particle. I propose instead to read *akásya ‘of (a) nobody’.
With an accent like that of akútra ‘nowhere’, this interpr. does not require emending
the Saṃhitā text (which would read mā́kásya), only the Pp., and the same stem is
found three times elsewhere in the same context, at least by my interpr.: V.70.4 mā́
kásya (in a passage very similar to this one), mā́kásya in VII.94.8, and I.120.8 mā́
kásmai, parallel to mā́kútrā where the Pp. analyzes the first as mā́kásmai but the 2nd
as mā́akútra. The apparent presence of mā́-akútra in this last passage reinforces my
interpr. of mā́kásya / kásmai as also containing a privative a-. It might be argued that
nákis, nákīm (the former of which is very common) and mā́kis, mā́kīm lack the
indefinitizing particle, but all these forms show univerbation and loss of the accent
on the 2nd element.
The form huráḥ has been variously analyzed. Old (etc) takes it as an adv., and
Ge (etc.) as the gen. of a root noun. (For detailed disc. see Scar [123], who
vacillates.) I follow the latter view, but see it not as an abstract but as a personal gen.
referring to one of the transgressors. (This seems to be the WG interpr., too.)
23
In d Old suggests emending dákṣam to yakṣám (matching the same form in
pāda a and found elsewhere with bhujema), but it is hard to see how this error could
have arisen. I think rather that dákṣa- is used here ironically or sarcastically.
On mā́with the apparent opt. bhujema, see Hoffmann (Injunk., 95-97), who
explains this grammatical anomaly (found several times) as a misinterpr. of
expressions with the dat. inf. bhujé.

### IV.3.14  
Once again in this hymn Agni seems to be indirectly identified with Rudra,
here by the use of the adj. súmakha-, used explicitly of Rudra in 7b. The ambiguity
of this word works well here also.

### IV.3.15  
Vs. 3 also contains forms of both mánman- and śastí-.
On sám √jṛ see Gotō (1st cl., 154–55), who considers the two instances of this
lexeme (also in the next hymn, IV.4.8) an individual use of this poet, in the meaning
‘be welcome’ [willkommen sein]. In both cases it has a verbal product of the poet as
subj. (śastí- here, gír- IV.4.8). My ‘bring harmony’ is meant to capture the ‘sing’
feature of the root √jṛ. Perhaps ‘be harmonious’ would have been better. For further
disc. see ad IV.4.8 below.

### IV.3.16  
On this vs., see publ. intro.
IV.4 Agni the Demon-Smasher

### IV.4.1  
The repetition of the same word, prásitim, in a and c without any obvious
difference in usage or sense (Re says they are “légèrement” distinct) seems
uncharacteristically clumsy for a Vedic poet, which in turn makes it tempting to
identify something that does distinguish them. Although he does not tr. them
differently (nor does anyone else), Ge suggests in his n. 1a that prásiti- represents the
coalescence of two words, one derived from √sā, si ‘bind’ (‘Fanggarn’, a hunting
net) and the other ‘Laut, Ansturm’, related to prásita- (IV.27.4, X.77.5) ‘shot forth’.
The latter provides the usual meaning of prásiti- ‘onslaught’ vel sim., and the word is
now usually considered to belong to PIE *seh1(i)̯ ‘loslassen’ (cf. LIV2 1.*seh1(i)̯ n. 2;
EWA s.v.) and to be related to sā́yaka- ‘missile’. For disc. of some of the
occurrences of prásiti- see Hoffmann (Aufs. 417–18 [=MSS 10, 1957]); curiously
Hoffmann only notes the second occurrence of the word in this vs., not the first. Ge’s
suggestion that the word has two sources opens the possibility of accounting for the
poet’s seemingly awkward repetition here, if in fact he’s using two different words
prásiti- (or, to him, possibly two different sense of one word; for this cf. sumatí in 6a,
8a below). That the prásiti- in pāda a is ‘broad’ (pṛthvī-), while the ánu ‘along’ in c
suggests that it is long and thin there might be a clue. I tentatively suggest that the
first occurrence refers to a deployed hunting net -- broad so as to trap as many
animals as possible (or to make it difficult for any animal to avoid it) and comparable
to an advancing sheet or wall of flame. The second one would then have the usual
24
sense of ‘onslaught, forward dash’. Unfortunately altering the tr. to allows for these
two separate meanings would lose the identity of the forms in this suggested pun.
Pace Ge, íbha- means ‘entourage, retinue’ not ‘elephant’ in Vedic, a meaning
reinforced by the Middle Indic derivatives. See EWA s.v.
On drūṇāṇá- as belonging to √drū ‘cut down, mow’ see Hoffmann (Aufs.
414–21) and EWA s.v. DRAVI
.
Pāda c seems to go more naturally with b than with d, as most take it.

### IV.4.2  
Since √spṛś does not otherwise occur with ánu in the RV or, per MonierWilliams, in all of Skt., I supply an object with this preposition -- either the flames of
pāda a or, perhaps preferably, the prásitim construed with ánu in 1c.
Most interpr. take pataṃgā́n as an unmarked simile, e.g. Ge “(gleich) Vögeln.”
My interpr. requires supplying an unparalleled noun but avoids the need for a simile
particle.
IV.4.2–4: Note the preverb chaining: 2d ví sṛja, 3a práti … ví sṛja, 4b práti.

### IV.4.3  
Ge. renders d “keiner soll es wagen, dich irrezuführen,” but vyáthiḥ ‘veering
course’ is simply a description of the usual behavior of fire, amply described in vss.
1–2.

### IV.4.4  
As Ge suggests in his n. 4a, ā́tanuṣva could reflect the common idiom ā́√tan
‘draw/stretch (the bow [dhánus-, dhánvan-])’. Given that Agni is identified as a
‘shooter’ (ástā) in 1c and that bows are the presumed object of a different form of
√tan in the next vs. (5c, see there), this seems quite possible, though I think the
primary reading is simply the reflexive ‘stretch yourself out’; cf. 1a for Agni’s
making himself broad.

### IV.4.5  
The standard tr. supply ‘powers’ with daívyāni, and this certainly could make
sense. However, no word meaning ‘power’ occurs with pl. daívya- (I must admit that
sáhas- occurs several times with the sg.) nor as obj. of āvíṣ √kṛ ‘make manifest’.
Since we expect something visual as the obj. of such a verb and since the hymn so far
has concerned the shape-shifting of Agni, I tentatively supply ‘forms’ -- though
‘powers’ is not excluded contextually.
The adj. sthirá- ‘taut, firm’, esp. when obj. of áva √tan, presupposes ‘bows’
as its head noun; cf. the bahuvrīhi sthirá-dhanvan- (VII.46.1) and phrases like
VIII.20.12 sthirā́dhánvāni.
The more usual interpr. of cmpds with final root noun is OBJ + TRANS. VERB,
and this seems to be the sense of many of the fairly numerous cmpds in -jū- (e.g.,
vasū-jū́- ‘speeding goods’), though Scar (166–77) hesitates in several cases.
However, in yātu-jū́- the final member must be read passively with agentive 1st
member: ‘incited by sorcerers’, as VII.21.5, adduced by both Ge and Scar (173),
definitively shows: ná yātáva indra jūjuvur naḥ “Sorcerers do not incite us, Indra.”
25
On the number disharmony in the obj. phrase in d, jāmím ájāmim … śátrūn,
see comm. ad VI.44.17.

### IV.4.6  
The 2nd hemistich has been variously interpr. Most recently WG take the neut.
pls. víśvāni … sudínāni … dyumnā́ni as subjs. of the sg. verb dyaut, in the wellknown, inherited, but relatively rare constr. of neut. pl. + sg. verb (“Zu ihm strahlen
alle …”). Re takes all of the half-verse through aryáḥ as nominal sentences: “que
tous (les jours) soient de beaux jours pour lui …,” and the rest of d as an abrupt
command. Ge has Agni shining the various good things through the doors to the
fortunate asmai. My interpr. is closest to Old (Noten, not SBE) and Ge’s alternative
in his n. 6cd. I take ví dúraḥ as referring to the usual opening of the doors, an
expression that usually contains a form of the verb √vṛ ‘(un)cover’ (e.g., IX.45.1 ví
… dúro vṛdhi). Here the more dramatic verb dyaut has been substituted, blending
the lexeme ví … dyaut ‘flashed forth (like lightning)’ with the straightforward ví √vṛ
‘open’ -- hence my “flashed open the doors.” I am not sure why all the standard tr.
(except for WG) render the injunctive dyaut as a modal (e.g., Ge “… sollst du …
scheinen”).
I supply ‘days’ with sudínāni on the basis of passages like VII.11.2 áhāny
asmai sudínā bhavanti.
rāyáḥ can be either acc. pl. (so Old, Ge, Re) or gen. sg. dependent on víśvāni
… sudínāni (so Th [Fremdl. 61] “All die Sonnentage des Reichtums,” WG). In the
publ. tr. I took it as acc. pl. but, to my mind, nothing rides on it either way.

### IV.4.7  
It is not clear whether nítya- in this context has already developed its later
technical sense of regular, obligatory ritual offering, as opposed to those performed
irregularly for special purposes. Or whether it simply means, as Re takes the phrase
nítyena havíṣā, “une offrande personnelle.”
I have pushed the last phrase sā́sad iṣṭíḥ to “this desire will be” -- that is, “will
come true” -- rather than simply “this will be his desire” (so Ge [WG]), since I
otherwise find it difficult to interpr. the subjunctive.

### IV.4.8  
The word sumatí-, found in 6a, is repeated here. There it clearly referred to
the benevolence or good will of Agni, which the successful priest/poet comes to
know. Here I think it has double meaning. On the one hand, it still refers to Agni’s
good will, which the poet praises, but it also refers to the good thought, i.e., the poem,
that the poet has produced for Agni. This double reading is enabled not only by the
usual double meaning of sumatí- and the grammatical ambiguity of the enclitic te
(gen. in the first interpr., dat. in the 2nd), but also by the double meaning of √ṛc
‘chant, recite’, which can take as object either the topic/goal of the praise (e.g.,
V.29.1 árcanti tvā marútaḥ … “The Maruts chant to/praise you”) or the verbal
contents of the recitation (V.30.6 tubhyéd eté marútaḥ … árcanti arkám “Just for/to
you do these Maruts chant the chant”).
ghóṣi (also VI.5.6) is a controversial form. The grammars/lexica generally
take it as a 3rd sg. passive aor. to √ghuṣ ‘hear’; it would take a putative sumatíḥ as
26
subj. and mean “(the good thought) was/is/will be heard” (Old SBE “it resounded
here,” sim. WG). The other instance (in VI.5.6) is taken as a neut. adj. ‘laut ertönend’
by Gr, also Old (Noten, contra SBE). Most tr., however, render it as a 2nd sg. act.
impv. “hear!” Though a passive aor. would also be possible in VI.5.6 (ghóṣi mánma
“the thought is heard”) and though the pass. aor. interpr. is morphologically
impeccable, I think the 2nd sg. act. impv. is the correct interpr., though the
morphology is a little troubled. It appears to be a -si imperative, though not built as
usual (at least in my view) to an s-aor. subjunctive, but rather to, or alongside, the 1st
class thematic pres. ghóṣati; this analysis also requires that a putative *ghoṣ-ṣi has
simplified the double sibilant. One of the arguments in favor of a 2nd sg. impv. in
VI.6.5 is the relative density of -si impvs. in that context, with two (śróṣi, párṣi) in
the preceding hymn (VI.4.7, 8) in that tightly knit Agni cycle. The interpr. of the
form as a -si impv. is accepted and argued for by Gotō (1st cl., 131–32 and n. 160,
with lit.); it is curious that in WG[otō] this interpr. has been abandoned without
comment. The form is disc., in typically indecisive fashion, by Baum (Impv., 46 and
27 [where he seems to accept the -si impv. analysis]).
The Vāvātā or ‘Favorite’ wife in later śrauta ritual is one of the wives of the
king who has a series of set functions in the various royal rituals (see, e.g., my
Sacrificed Wife passim). The presence of this figure, or of her prototype, may suggest
that the lexeme sám √jṛ, found also in the preceding hymn (IV.3.15), may have
deeper resonance than simply ‘be welcome, bring harmony’, perhaps something like
‘be in tune with (s.o.)’, referring to perfect harmonious agreement between two
people, esp. two people in love. In both IV.3.15 and our passage the feminine song
(gír-) / chant (śastí-) would put herself in tune with the masc. god, as a Favorite wife
would to her kingly husband. Note that in IV.3.15 the chant is modified by devávātā
‘favored by the gods’, with the same -vātā as here (save for accent). In fact, as Ge
points out (for different purposes) our te vāvā́tā is phonologically very close to

### IV.3.15  
devávātā. It might also be that jara(tām) would be reminiscent of jārá-
‘lover’, to add to the erotic mood.
As Re’s tr. makes clear (“Nous souhaitons t’orner, (dans l’espoir d’obtenir) de
bons chevaux, de bons chars”), the two adj. sváśvāḥ … suráthāḥ are most likely
proleptic: we want to tend the ritual fire in order to get possession of good horses and
chariots. This contrasts with the use of sváśva- in 10a.

### IV.4.9  
sumánas- here recalls the two occurrences of sumatí- in 6a and 8a (see disc.
there); this word two may have dual value: both ‘benevolent, well-disposed’ and
‘having a good mind’, that is, one capable of producing good thoughts in the form of
hymns.
The dyumnā́ni of the arí- “the brilliant things of the stranger” that Agni
opened up for us in 6d we seem to have thoroughly taken possession of here. The gen.
jánānām here corresponds to aryáḥ in 6d.

### IV.4.10  
Unlike 8c, where I took sváśva- surátha- as proleptic with the priestly
subject “we,” here the man who is sváśva- suhiraṇyá- appears to be already rich,
27
with a chariot full of goods -- and therefore most likely the patron of the sacrifice,
who (we hope) will redistribute this wealth to us performers via the sacrifice. This
may be the purport of sákhā ‘partner’ here. Ge suggests (n. 10ab) that the figure in
question is a ruler returning from battle with booty.

### IV.4.11  
This vs. concerning the poet’s poetic gifts and his lineage, spoken in the 1st
ps. sg., seems out of place in this hymn and anticipates the enigmatic hymn IV.5 that
follows immediately, which focuses on the mysterious sources of poetic power. Of
course, given the mechanical arrangement of the RVic hymn collections, we cannot
assume that the hymns had anything to do with each other originally.
Old (SBE), Re think that the poet’s lineage (bandhútā) is with Agni: Old
“through my kinship (with thee).” But the next pāda, where the line of descent is
traced from his father Gotama, makes that unlikely.
The next question is what to do with maháḥ. Old (SBE) takes it as acc. pl.
object of rujāmi; Ge (/WG) as gen. sg. with vácobhiḥ, referring to the poet’s great
(father). With Re I prefer to take maháḥ as adverbial. Although this leaves rujāmi
without an object, an object is easily supplied: the root √ruj is typed for the breaking
of the Vala cave, particularly in this group of hymns so dominated by that myth. Cf.

### IV.2.15  
... áṅgiraso bhavema, ádriṃ rujema ... “Might we become Aṅgirases; might
we break the rock.” On grounds of sense I don’t think maháḥ is gen. with vácobhiḥ
because I think the poet is asserting the power of his own poetic gift: he acquired this
gift from his father (pāda b), but he is not using his father’s words but his own -- or
so I take his proud boast. By casting himself as the subject of the Vala-breaking verb,
he is also implicitly asserting his identification with the Aṅgirases, who broke into
Vala with their words. Like the speaker(s) of IV.2.15 he seems to be saying “might I
become an Aṅgiras.”

### IV.4.13  
Since the yé of the rel. clause in ab has no obvious referent in the main
clause of cd, it is tempting to connect ab with the preceding verse (12), and start a
new sentence with 13cd -- esp. because 13a yé pāyávaḥ matches 12c té pāyavaḥ so
exactly. But vs. 13 is a repeated vs. (= I.147.3), and so must be interpreted as selfcontained. It is also likely, because of the reference to Māmateya, i.e., Dīrghatamas,
that I.147, a Dīrghatamas hymn, is its source, and the vs. has been inserted here
secondarily because of the match between the two pāyávaḥ phrases (so Bloomfield,
RR ad I.147.3). On the relationship between the relative and main clauses in this vs.
see comm. ad I.147.3.
IV.5 Agni Vaiśvānara

### IV.5.1  
Note that the first word of the hymn is vaiśvānará-.
Old (SBE), Ge, and WG all take bṛhád bhā́ḥ as the obj. of dāśema with the dat.
agnáye phrase the indirect obj. (e.g., Old “How may we … offer mighty light to …
Agni”). I am dubious about this for two reasons, one practical and one grammatical.
First, why would we need to confer light on Agni -- does he not already have it? I
28
suppose “lofty light” might refer to the sun and our ability to make the sun rise by
kindling the ritual fire, but the phrase refers to Agni’s own light elsewhere (e.g.,
VIII.23.5, X.3.1). Or conferring such light upon him might simply mean kindling
him. More telling is the grammatical argument: although there are a few other √dāś
passages with acc. of something conferred (though normally a ritual offering of some
sort; cf. I.71.6 [námaḥ], I.93.3 [havíṣkṛtim]), the overwhelming number of passages
have simply a dative of the honoree sometimes with instrumental of what is
conferred. Alternatively and considerably less often, the verb can take an acc. of the
honoree; cf. the very similar V.41.16 kathā́dāśema námasā sudā́nūn … marútaḥ
“How might we serve the Maruts of good drops with reverence?” I therefore think
√dāś is participating in two syntactic frames here, 1st with dat. agnáye, then with acc.
bṛhád bhā́ḥ, both as the object of honor and service. Re in his n. suggests that bṛhád
bhā́ḥ is a “pré-bahuvrīhi,” but in his tr. treats it as an appositive “Haut éclat” going
with the 2nd hemistich and modifying the underlying subj. Agni there.
The usual obj. of √stambh is dyā́m ‘heaven’, which is the obj. expected (and
supplied) in the frame. The obj. in the simile, ródhas- ‘bulwark’, may have been
chosen because it is phonologically reminiscent of ródasī ‘two world-halves’,
another way to refer to the cosmic masses. This word serves as obj. to √stambh a
number of times with the preverb ví (‘prop apart’), e.g. VI.8.3 (another Vaiśvānara
hymn) with Agni as subj.: vy àstabhnād ródasī.

### IV.5.3  
In the publ. tr. I take dvibárhāḥ as the masc. nom. sg. it appears to be,
modifying the subj. However, this particular form several times has to be taken as
neut. (I.114.2, VII.8.6, 24.2; see comm. ad VII.24.2), and its position here may make
it more likely a modifier of neut. sā́ma, as Old (SBE), Ge, and Re take it. Hence,
possibly “a great doubly lofty melody …”
I tr. padám twice, as ‘word’ and ‘track’, to bring out the pervasive pun in this
hymn.

### IV.5.5  
As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. characterizes rival poets as capable of
producing a “deep word” (padám … gabhīrám) despite their bad characters. Sāy’s
interpr. of this phrase as a deep place, namely hell, fld. by Old in SBE (but decisively
rejected by him in Noten) and in part by Doniger, has little to recommend it, esp.
because padá- is the signature word of this hymn and has very specific values in the
hymn. It would be a very slender basis on which to found Vedic views of the afterlife.
The form of the verb ajanatā causes interpretational difficulties. It appears to
be the 2nd pl. act. impf. to the 1st cl. pres. stem jánati ‘begets’, and so I take it, as do
WG (see also Gotō, 1st class, 145 n. 203) and, as a plausible alternative, Old (Noten).
See also Narten (Sig. Aor., 117–18 n. 317). But most interpr. want the verb to be 3rd
ps., and if possible, 3rd plural. Since the ending -ata (/-atā) can only be 3rd pl. to an
athematic stem, an otherwise unattested root pres. was invented by Gr.; Ge takes it as
an 3rd pl. aor.; Re tr. as 3rd pl. but does not comment. As Old points out, lengthening
of -ta to -tā is far more common in the 2nd pl. act. than in 3rd ps. middle forms --
another argument in favor of the 2nd pl. Since unsignaled switch between persons is
29
common in RVic discourse, there seems no contextual reason to reject the obvious
morphological analysis of ajanatā.
It is striking that the two damning similes compare the badly behaved poets to
two types of contemptible females.

### IV.5.6  
This vs. is difficult both to construe and to render into English, and different
interpretations of how to construe it lead to very different views of the meaning of
the hymn as a whole. In my view, the poet claims that because of his upright
behavior, in contrast to that of the likewise skilled but wicked poets in vs. 5, Agni
takes some of the burden of the poetic labor upon himself. Other interpr. believe that
the poet is complaining that Agni is imposing a further burden on him, the poet,
despite his good behavior.
I take the first two words of the vs., idám me, as a separate clause, with the
referent of idám the same as that in the last pāda of the preceding vs., idám padám …
gabhīrám “this profound word.” With idám me the poet lays claim to the poetic skill
that seems also to characterize the wicked poets.
My view that kíyate starts a new clause is supported by the fact that all other
exx. of kíyant- are pāda-initial. In attempting to render the rest of the vs. into
parsable English I have scuttled the interrogative feature of the dat. kíyate ‘for how
great/small a one?’ An interrogative rendering would be something like “For what
such small one (like me) … have you placed …?”
With the dat. negated part. áminate I supply as obj. dhā́ma (or dhā́mā[ni])
(with most tr.), in a phrase contrasting with 4c prá yé minánti váruṇasya dhā́ma
“those who confound the ordinances of Varuṇa,” which described his rivals and the
targets of Agni’s flame.
Given the position of the simile part. ná, the simile should consist only of
bhārám ‘burden’, with gurúm ‘heavy’ the quality held in common. But since mánma
is neut., gurúm can only modify m. bhārám. This seems to me a minor problem.
The problems of interpr. are esp. acute in the 2nd hemistich and involve esp.
the assessment of the referent and meaning of the accusatives in the d pāda. Some tr.
(I confess I don’t entirely understand Ge’s) take them as an appositive to mánma
‘thought’ in b, referring to the burden that Agni is laying on the poet, with the
possibility floated (see Old [SBE], WG n.) that it refers to the later Pṛṣṭha Stotra. But
in this type of context the ‘back’ (pṛṣṭhá-) is ordinarily Agni’s (also in cmpds like
ghṛtá-pṛṣṭha- ‘ghee-backed’) and the adj. yahvá- modifying it is almost entirely
limited to Agni. I therefore think that the pṛṣṭhám phrase refers to Agni’s back (so
Ge n. 6d) and that it is a second acc. with dadhātha ‘you have placed’: √dhā ‘place
sthg (ACC.) on sthg (ACC.)’ (so, possibly, Ge n. 6d). This is, admittedly and
unfortunately, not a standard construction with √dhā, but, then, the usual case
expression with √dhā for the location of what has been placed is the locative, while
most tr. take the dative phrase in ab to be that location. I do, again, have to admit that
√dhā + DAT. ‘establish sthg (ACC) for s.o. (DAT.)’ is common, and this is doubtless
what the other tr. are thinking of. However, the strong likelihood that pāda d refers to
30
Agni’s back and Agni’s back can’t be placed on the poet emboldens me to hold to my
interpr. I take the dat. phrase as a dative of benefit.

### IV.5.7  
The first half of the vs. is fairly straightforward. The poet expresses his hope
that his dhītí- ‘conception, thought’ will reach tám (most likely Agni, though
‘sacrifice’ is also possible). I take the etym. phrase samanā́samānám as I do in
similar phrases in IV.51.8–9 (Dawn), esp. 9ab … samanā́samanī́ḥ … uṣásaś caranti
“The Dawns proceed, the same ones in the same way,” referring to the regular
repetition of sunrise. Here I think the phrase refers to the repetition of the sacrifice
and the ever-renewed Agni; similar is VI.4.1 addressed to Agni evā́no adyá samanā́
samānā́n … yakṣi devā́n “even so for us today sacrifice in the same way to the same
gods.”
The second hemistich is close to impenetrable; Old (Noten) remarks “Die
Dunkelheiten dieses Verses … sind ein Noli me tangere.” As I indicated in the publ.
intro., I think the impossible hapax jábāru that ends the vs. is not meant to be
understood but is “a sort of abracadabra, a mystical expression, and the half verse in
which it appears encapsulates the profound and transformative secret of the sacrifice.”
The meaning “solar disc” first suggested by Sāy. and followed, for want of anything
better, by most since (though not by Old or WG), is, in my opinion, worse than
useless, in that such a tr. obscures the enigmatic intent. Note first that the word
rhymes with cā́ru in the preceding pāda and echoes the important word bhārám in
6b; it also has unusual phonology -- with internal plain b and the impression of
slightly skewed reduplication: jábaru like jabhā́ra. (Note that this latter pf. shows up
several times nearby: IV.7.4 ā́jabhruḥ, jabhárat IV.2.6, 12.2; in fact a surprising
percentage of the RVic forms of this pf. are found in IV: jabhartha 19.9, jabhāra
18.4, 13; 27.2, 4.) It also appears to contain the mysterious suffix -āru- mostly found
in nonce formations, on which see comm. ad III.30.8. And perhaps most important
it’s encoded into a repeated phonetic pattern involving rup: ... cā́ru pṛ́śner / ágre
rupá ā́rupitaṃ jábāru // pra ...
With Gr (s.v. cárman-) I interpr. sasásya cárman “on the hide of the grain” as
a ref. to the barhis, establishing the ritual ground as the locus of the mystery. See
further ad IV.7.7.
As often the mention of Pṛśni brings obscurity in its train. Here one question
is what noun to supply in the phrase cā́ru pṛ́śneḥ, which recurs in 10b gúhyaṃ cā́ru
pṛ́śneḥ. There are two good candidates, ‘name’ and ‘udder’, as Ge also points out.
The adj. gúhya- in the latter passages suggests ‘name’, since it regularly modifies
nā́man-; cf. also vs. 3c padáṃ ná gór ápagūḍham “the word hidden like the track of
the cow,” with a form of √guh ‘hide’ and a verbal referent, as well as III.5.6 (see
below) cā́ru nā́ma. But nearby IV.3.10 connects Pṛśni with an udder, and IV.7.7 with
similar phraseology also has an udder. I do not think an informed choice can be made,
and I’m also not sure it matters -- though I weakly favor ‘name’. See comm. ad vs.
10 below.
31
With most others I take ā́rupita- as a back formation to the -p-causative of
√ruh ‘ascend’ found 1st in the Brāh. See also Schindler (Wurzelnom., s.v. rúp-),
EWA s.vv. RODH2
, ROP.
The root noun rúp- is likewise obscure (see, e.g., Schindler, s.v.). I tr. ‘mount’,
deriving it from the same secondary causative formation as gave rise to -rupita-.
However, this is the merest guess (though coinciding with Bl [see RR ad III.5.5, with
ref. to JAOS 27]), and the existence of a parallel phrase ripó ágram in III.5.5 with
different vocalism (rip- vs. rup-) adds to the uncertainty. The sequence III.5.5–6
resembles our passage in other ways, esp. in III.5.6c sasásya cárma, as well as the
cā́ru nā́ma mentioned above. Most important is the fact that III.5.5a is identical to
pāda d of our next vs., save for ripáḥ vs. rupáḥ. The root noun rúp- is also found in
X.13.3, in an obscure context in an omphalos vs., where it is found, as here, with a
form of the root √ruh (though without the secondary -p-), aroham.

### IV.5.8  
Opinion is divided as to whether pravā́cyam … me means “to be proclaimed
to me” or “… by me,” and the dat. enclitic makes either interpr. possible (dative
agents being found with gerundives). I take it as the former: the vs. (or at least bc)
seems to concern the esoteric education of the poet. The unidentified “they,” subjects
of vadanti (b) and (ápa …) vrán (c), convey these secret teachings. I doubt that we
are supposed to know who “they” are, and Re’s impersonal “on” (“On parle …”)
may capture the intent better than a literal tr.
The hapax niṇík ‘privately, secretly’ is apparently derived from niṇyá- ‘secret,
private’, though the details are disputed. See EWA s.v. niṇyá-.
Both Ge and Re in different ways make heavy weather of vā́r (ein Tor and
une ouverture respectively), but there seems no reason not to take it as ‘water’ (as
elsewhere), as Old rather scornfully observes (“Warum nicht vā́r ‘Wasser’? ‘Wasser
der Kuh’ ist die Milch”). The reference is of course to the Vala myth: they uncover
secret teachings as they do the light (here light = water = milk) of the cows enclosed
in the Vala cave.
As noted ad vs. 7, pāda d is identical to III.5.5a. Exactly what is meant here is
not clear (what a surprise!), but if, as I suggest, “the tip of the mount” (agré rupáḥ) in
7c refers to the ritual ground, perhaps the ritual earthly fire or the top of that fire, it
may be that “the track of the bird” (padáṃ véḥ) is the track of the sun, the heavenly
fire. See publ. intro. to III.5. If it is a reference to the sun, it would provide a good
transition to the next vs.

### IV.5.9  
This vs. brings us to the familiar ritual situation: dawn and the rising of the
sun at the moment of the dawn sacrifice. After the obscurities of recent vss. it comes
as a relief.
Flg. Sāy, all the standard tr. (save for Old SBE) take viveda as 1st ps. This is
certainly possible, but there is nothing in the context that imposes it. Old supplies “he”
without identification; I think Dawn is the possible discoverer.
32

### IV.5.10  
With Old (Noten, explicitly contra SBE) I take the whole vs. as a single
sentence, with the final word jihvā́an instr. parallel to āsā́ending pāda a, both
referring to Agni’s flame. The other standard tr. take cd as a separate clause, with
jihvā́the nom. subj.
The vs. continues the focus on the kindling of the ritual fire at the dawn
sacrifice. The parents in pāda a are the kindling sticks, at least in my opinion (also
explicitly Re). For the phrase gúhyaṃ cā́ru pṛ́śneḥ cf. cā́ru pṛ́śneḥ in 7c and disc.
there. In both cases the phrase seems to encapsulate the mystery of the ritual. The
verb ámanuta ‘pondered’ or ‘brought to mind’ somewhat favors supplying ‘name’ as
the referent of the phrase. Cf. in this Agni cycle IV.1.16a té manvata prathamáṃ
nā́ma dhenóḥ “They brought to mind the first name of the milk-cow,” also X.68.7
bṛ́haspátir ámata hí tyád āsāṃ, nā́ma svarī́ṇāṃ sádane gúhā yát “For Br̥haspati
brought to mind this very name of these who were resounding (with)in the seat --
(the name) which was hidden.” The two locations identified in c, “the furthest track
of the mother cow” (mātúṣ padé paramé … góḥ) and “nearby” (ánti) suggest that the
mysterious hidden substance is both on the ritual ground and in heaven or the
equivalent. (See 11cd and 12cd.)

### IV.5.11  
I tr. injunc. aor. voce as an immediate past, because I think the poet is
referring to his own poetic production in this very hymn. (The middle voice
strengthens the sense of self-reference.) However, the verb could of course express a
neutral present, as the standard tr. take it (e.g., Ge “Ich spreche”), or even a
future/modal (“I shall proclaim”). I take the referent of idám at the end of b to be ṛtá-,
which begins the vs.: the poet has hope for Agni’s largesse in just the case that his
speech is/contains truth. He phrases this as a conditional (“if”), but, with the
confidence he has gained in the course of the hymn, one assumes he is certain that
his speech is the truth that was revealed to him in the preceding vss.
My suggestion that the locations in 10c are heaven and the ritual ground is
supported by the straightforward assertion here that Agni has power over wealth both
on earth and in heaven.
IV.5.11-12: The accented demonst. asyá in 11c and in the repeated phrase no asyá
(12a, c) causes minor interpretational difficulty because on the basis of its accent it
should be adjectival. In 11c it anticipates víśvam in the izafe-like rel. cl. yád dha
víśvam, as well as dráviṇam in its expansion in d. In 12a the two neut. interrogatives
in a row (kím … kád) invite a differential tr., hence my rendering of the first as a
question marker rather than a neut. pronominal. But the case disharmony of the
phrase asyá dráviṇam is curious; it is generally interpr. as an attempt at a partitive
expression, which I think is correct -- though I’m not entirely happy with Ge’s notion
that dráviṇam has been “attracted” out of the genitive by kím. If kim is taken as a neut.
prn., the phrase could be tr. “what [=how much] wealth of this (wealth) is ours.” For
no asyá in 12c, see next comm.
33

### IV.5.12  
It is difficult to render the construction in 12cd literally without losing its
sense, and the publ. tr. has rearranged the structure of the subordinate cl. in favor of
parsability. In my view, all of cd is a relative cl. with neut. yád as the subordinator. It
forms an acc. phrase paramáṃ yád … padám “which highest track/footstep” (see
padé paramé in 10c). This acc. is limited by the gen. phrase ádhvanaḥ … no asyá “of
this road of ours.” The acc. phrase is construed as an acc. of (extent of) space with
áganma: “on/along which track we have gone.” So the frame of bcd would read
literally “… you have announced to us in secret what highest track of this road of
ours we have gone on.” (“In secret” [guhā́] could instead be construed within the rel.
clause “the track we have gone on in secret,” without damaging the interpr.)
The rel. clause also contains a simile, réku padáṃ ná nidānā́ḥ “like the
spurned/scorned on an empty track,” with nom./acc. matching the subj. (“we”) and
acc. goal (“track”) of the frame. Because simile and frame share the acc. padám it
appears only once, displaced to the simile from where we might expect to find it in
the frame (and in fact to the wrong part of the simile with ná in the wrong place; we
should expect *réku ná padám).
The simile raises another question: why is our progress subject to this
negative comparison? The standard response to this is that Agni is supposed to tell us
whether we’re on the wrong road or not, since the end of it is hidden from us. I think
the point is more subtle: the wealth and treasure that we want (and have obtained)
from Agni are not material, but rather the secret teachings and poetic enigmas we
have learned in the course of the hymn. But to the vulgar and uninitiated, it looks as
if we are going down a blind alley, heading to a dry hole with no material goods to
show for it. As vs. 14 shows, those who scorn us for the path we have chosen will
themselves be scorned for lacking the true poetic gift.

### IV.5.13  
The theme of the journey in vs. 12 morphs slightly into the image of a race
or similar contest.

### IV.5.14  
With Old and Re I supply vácasā (from pāda a) with ā́satā, rather than
taking the latter as ‘non-being’ vel sim., because that stem is regularly associated
with speech.

### IV.6.3  
The subject must change between pādas a and b, since the subj. of a is fem.
and b contains a masc. nom. sg. (urāṇáḥ). I supply Agni as the subj. of b, as he
clearly is of the repeated pāda III.19.2c. So also Old (SBE); others are less explicit.
The standard tr. take urāṇáḥ as transitive, with devátātim as obj. (e.g., Ge “die
Götterschar sich erwählend”) (also in the identical pāda III.19.2c). But in all clear
cases urāṇá- is passive (as opposed to trans. vṛṇāná-), and it seems esp. unlikely that
the occurrence here would be transitive when the next vs. (4d) contains the same
form in the same metrical position (verse-final) in clear passive usage (cf. also the
next hymn IV.7.8c). Moreover it is not entirely clear to me what “choosing” the
divine assembly would mean, whereas Agni’s being chosen as a priest is a standard
trope. The occurrences of devátāti- in vss. 1b and 9d show that the divine assemblage
34
was present at the ritual and that Agni was acting on their behalf. Taking urāṇáḥ as
the passive it ordinarily is leaves the acc. devátātim ungoverned grammatically, but
in the publ. tr. I construe it loosely with pradakṣiṇít. It is possible that it could instead
be loosely construed with urāṇáḥ “being chosen as priest for the divine assemblage”).
On akrá- see comm. ad I.189.7.
It may seem odd that the wooden post “anoints” the sacrificial animal tied to it,
and in fact WG dissociate pādas c and d and make Agni the subject of d. But this
striking turn of phrase can be explained both as a metaphor and by the principle of
ritual transfer. Metaphorically “anoint” can simply mean “make ritually fit for
sacrifice,” and this may be in play here: tying the animal to the post is a regular step
in the animal sacrifice. But more interesting is the ritual transfer. In the one hymn in
the RV devoted to the post (III.8), the post itself is anointed by the priests (III.8.1a
añjánti tvā́m … vánaspate), and later in that hymn the mechanism for that anointing
is made clear: the offering ladles have been stretched over the posts (III.8.7b
yatásrucaḥ). Thus the posts dripping with ghee presumably transfer the ghee to the
attached animals, anointing them in their turn. Note that in our vs. the first pāda
concerns the outstretched ghee-filled ladle (yatā́… ghṛtā́cī), and we can assume that
the same ritual sequence obtains here: ladle anoints post, which anoints animals.

### IV.6.4  
The standard tr. take the two loc. phrases in pāda a as real locationals, but I
consider it unlikely that the Adhvaryu (who is Agni himself) would stand on the
barhis, which would unhelpfully go up in smoke. Rather these should be loc.
absolutes, as Old (SBE) takes them. In this particular case the loc. absolutes seem to
be used, in conjunction with the aor. indic. ūrdhváḥ … asthāt, to indicate two layers
of prior action before the present indicatives indicating the current ongoing ritual
action, namely the circumambulation associated with the animal sacrifice (see publ.
intro.), here expressed by eti in pári … eti in cd. The two loc. absolutes express the
first layer of action: the barhis must be strewn and the fire kindled. Once the fire has
been kindled, there comes the second layer of action, resulting directly from the first:
the fire stands upright -- that is, catches and flames up. Only then can the firebrand
be taken out and the circumambulation (pári … eti) begun. Thus, the aor. does
express its usual sense of immediate past action, but English “has stood upright” does
not capture this sense here. It might be better “Once the ritual grass had been strewn
and the fire kindled, the Adhvaryu stood upright ... (Now) Agni circles ...” I thank IH
for causing me to think this through more thoroughly.

### IV.6.5  
The stem mitá-dru- (5x) makes formal difficulties. If its 2nd member is a root
noun belonging to √dru ‘run’, it should of course have the shape *-drut-; root-noun
cmpds also typically have accent on the root noun. Because of the former problem,
Scar (243–44) interprets -drú- in raghu-drú- as a -u-stem deriv. of √drā ‘run’. The
context here, however, suggests at least a folk-etymological connection with √dru
‘run’, since pāda c opens with a finite form of that root: drávanty asya vājíno ná
śókāḥ “His flames run like prize-winners,” which seems like a parallel expression to
pāda a mitádrur eti “mitádru he goes.” (Note that in two of the five mitádru- passages
35
the adj. modifies vājínaḥ [VII.38.7, X.64.6].) Several factors may contribute to the
anomalous shape of the compound. First, the rhyming mitá-jñu- ‘having fixed/firm
knees’, where -jñu- is not a root noun but the reduced form of jā́nu- ‘knee’. Second,
there is of course a noun parallel in formation to jā́nu-/jñú-, namely dáru-/drú-
‘wood’. The reduced form is found as 2nd member in at least one cmpd., su-drú-
‘(having) good wood’. It is possible that the existence of this homonymous form
might have overridden the rule that added -t- to root nouns ending in short resonants.
It is even possible that mitá-dru- actually contains the ‘wood’ word -- or at least that
such a pun could be actualized: the cmpd could mean ‘having wood fixed (in it)’
referring to the fire. At least the three singular occurrences of the stem all refer to
Agni (at least in my view), though the two plurals do not. Assuming that at least one
reading of the cmpd contains a (pseudo-)root noun to √dru, the question then
remains what the first member mitá- belongs to. The default assumption is √mi ‘fix’
as in mitájñu-, but my tr. reflects a deriv. from √mā ‘measure’.

### IV.6.6  
A rare example of a non-nominative concessive use of the pres. part. of √as
‘be’.

### IV.6.7  
The first pāda contains three words not otherwise found in the RV: sā́tur
jánitor ávāri. Only the first is troublesome: though only occurring here, ávāri is
clearly the passive aor. to √vṛ ‘obstruct’ (see váranta in 6c), and the abl. inf. jánitoḥ
is structurally transparent and is also found post-RV. The hapax sā́tuḥ is a different
matter, however. Neither its root affiliation nor its grammatical identity is clear. Gr
takes it as a -tu-stem to √sani ‘win, gain’, with the meaning ‘der empfangende
Mutterleib’, but the semantic extension envisioned is quite fantastic, and we should
in any event expect a full-grade *sánitu- (note immed. following jánitu- to the
rhyming seṭ root). Ge tr. “Natur” (with ?) and suggests, rather wildly, that it’s
derived from a root √sā = as, an idea that must underlie Re’s “l'être,” though he
cannily does not comment. Old (SBE) tr. “mother,” but does not venture an
etymology. Mayrhofer (KEWA s.v. sā́tuḥ) summarizes the speculation but does not
adjudicate. WG have proposed a different solution, that it’s a -tu-stem to √sā ‘bind’,
and tr. “Von dessen Erzeugung das Anfesseln nicht abgehalten worden ist,” noting
that Agni must be controlled after he is born. Although the morphology works better
than the other suggestions, the meaning proposed seems rather contorted.
I have a more radical proposal -- that the phonological complex should be
divided into sā́+ ā́/átur. The former is the feminine pronoun, picking up fem. tanū́-
found in the loc. tanvī̀in the preceding pāda (6d). Although the pronoun would not
be in its standard init. position, it’s worth noting that the position of fem. sā́is more
variable than that of sá and also that both the neg. ná and the rel. prn. yásya might be
expected to be fronted. As for the proposed second part, there are several
possibilities. In my opinion the most likely is that it is the gen. sg. of a -tar-stem built
to √ad ‘eat’, *ád-tar- > *át-tar-, showing the same reduction of the internal cluster
as in (átri-/) atrín- ‘devouring’ (at least by the etym. I favor). (The reduction would
most probably take place in weak forms with the suffixal shape -tr- [e.g., instr. *ád-
36
tr-ā > *át-tr-ā >*átrā] and spread to the gen./abl.) For textual support cf. X.79.4
jā́yamāno mātárā gárbho atti “while being born, the embryo eats his two mothers
[=kindling sticks],” a description of Agni’s birth, as here. Less likely, but not
completely impossible, is an analysis as the gen. sg. of the Indo-Iranian *ā́tar- ‘fire’
(Aves. ātar-) treated as a -tar-stem. (By Stanley Insler’s very attractive, and
unfortunately unpublished, etymology, the same word is also preserved in
mātaríśvan-, whose initial m is owing to missegmentation.)
I am not entirely sure what pāda b contributes to the meaning -- perhaps the
point is that the kindling sticks have kept seeking to produce fire and therefore his
birth, depicted in pāda a, has taken place without a hitch. Note that this is the only
occurrence in the RV of the full dual dvandva mātárā-pitárā.

### IV.6.8  
The part. saṃvásānāḥ is generally ascribed to √vas ‘dwell’, and the standard
tr. ‘dwelling together’ makes good sense as a descriptor of fingers. However, forms
unambiguously belonging to this root are active, and there is no root pres. or aor.
Gotō (1st Class, 295 n. 698) therefore assigns the participle to √vas ‘wear’, which of
course has a well-attested medial root pres., and tr. ‘gleichgekleidet’, an interpr.
maintained in WG. I find the morphological arg. persuasive, but the meaning
somewhat elusive: what do fingers wear when making fire? (I do not think we should
assume gloves.) I take it as a pun. In support of ‘dwell’, consider saṃvásana- ‘joint
dwelling’ (IX.86.17).
Pāda c contains another hapax, atharyàḥ. This is generally taken as the gen. sg.
of a fem. atharī́-, often interpr. as a female animal, whose tooth is the object of
comparison with Agni’s flame. See, e.g., Old’s extensive disc. ad VII.1.1 (Noten II, p.
2), where he tentatively opts for a mare. Hoffmann suggests rather (registered in
EWA I.805) that it belongs with atharvī́- ‘following the way’ (athar-vī́) (I.112.10),
with the loss of v on metrical grounds, while WG take it simply as a fem. -ī-stem to
áthar-, which they take as a root noun cmpd *h2at-h2ar-íh2, and tr. ‘Wegzieherin’.
The publ. tr. ‘enveloped in flame’ starts from Hoffmann’s preform with -vī́-, but
deviates in two regards. First it takes athar- with atharyú- with the meaning ‘flame,
flaming’, and second it analyses the 2nd member as the root noun to √vyā ‘envelop’
(cf. hiraṇya-vī́- ‘enveloped in gold’, Scar 502). The phrase atharyò ná dántam would
then be semantically parallel to the bahuvrīhi śúci-dant- (2x, of Agni) ‘having
blazing teeth’. I am not at all happy with my analysis, however -- primarily because I
am dubious about the existence of an athar- ‘flame’ and because the loss of v
suggested by Hoffmann seems difficult to motivate. I would therefore tentatively
withdraw the publ. tr., though I have nothing better to substitute. I wonder if the
word is not implicated in the same interpretational difficulty as sā́tuḥ discussed
above (7a). I doubt that a female animal is at issue.

### IV.6.9  
These variously colored horses of Agni’s are, of course, his flames. The verb
in d, ah(u)vanta ‘called’, can refer to the crackling of the flames: actual horses don’t
ordinarily ‘call’ anyone. However, I think we’re also dealing with a pun, with ā́… 
37
ah(u)vanta a phonological scrambling of *ā́… avahanta ‘conveyed’. Cf. III.19.4 sá ā́
vaha devátātim …, VII.1.18 .... vakṣi devátātim ácha, with the same obj.

### IV.6.10  
This vs. contains yet another hapax, duvasanā́so in a, but in this case the
form seems to have been generated to form a pair with its phonological near match
tuviṣvaṇáso in b (with its last two syllables also matching preceding śyenā́so, which
it modifies). It is generally connected (see Re ad loc., EWA s.v. dūrá-) with dūrá-
‘distant’, dávīyas-/daviṣṭha ‘further, furthest’, but the exact morphology is unclear.
On semantic grounds it seems unlikely to be related to dúvas- ‘friendship’. For a
similar deformation of this lexical complex, see duvanyasát in IV.40.2, which also
owes some of its phonological shape to its formulaic partner.

### IV.6.11  
Ge and Re interpret pāda b as having three finite verbs: śáṃsāti, yájate, and
ví … dhāḥ, subjunctive, pres. indicative, and injunctive respectively. The first and
third go well together (esp. if the injunctive is imperatival, as dhāḥ so often is), but
the indicative does not sit well between them. By contrast Gr interprets yájate as the
dat. sg. of the act. pres. part., rather than as a middle 3rd sg. With Old (SBE) and WG,
I follow Gr in the morphological analysis, but both Old and WG construe the part.
with vy ū̀dhāḥ. I think it belongs rather with śáṃsati, both because of the position of
the ū and because of a nearby parallel passage also in an Agni hymn, IV.16.2 śáṃsāti
ukthám … cikitúṣe … “He will recite his solemn speech to the one who attends to it,”
with a dat. participle in this formula. The referent of yájate is Agni; note that he is
called the superior sacrificer (yájīyān) in 1b, so yájate forms a ring with that first
mention.
It is not clear what obj. to supply with ví … dhāḥ ‘apportion’. It generally
takes goods or the like elsewhere, hence my ‘treasures’, though I am tempted by Re’s
“tu répartis (les rôles)” -- that is, Agni distributing ritual roles and ritual speech to the
various participants.
“Laud of Āyu” (śáṃsam āyóḥ; also V.3.4) must refer to Agni, however odd
the expression seems to be -- rather like referring to someone as “the toast of the
town.” Of course, one of Agni’s standing epithets is the cmpd. nárā-śáṃsa-, of
which śáṃsa- āyóḥ is simply an analytic variant. For further disc. see comm. ad
VI.24.2 and II.34.6.
## IV.7 Agni
Intro.: The publ. intro. states that Agni’s role as messenger is first mentioned
in vs. 3; this should be corrected to vs. 4.

### IV.7.1  
Apnavāna appears with the Bhṛgus also in VIII.102.4, but nothing more is
known of him (cf. Mayr., Personenname s.v.). Scar (366–67), though without disc.,
renders it not as a sg. PN, but as a nom. pl. adj. modifying the Bhṛgus (“die reichen
(?) Bhṛgus”), presumably to a stem *ápnavan-, roughly parallel to ápnasvant-.
However, the usage in VIII.102.4 makes it clear that at least in that passage it is a PN.
38
In c virurucúḥ gives a bad cadence, and by meaning it could easily belong to
the redupl. aor. arūruca-. The same pāda-final sequence (save for accent) … bhṛ́gavo
ví rurucuḥ is also found at X.122.5. It is therefore tempting (see Old [Noten], Arnold
[Ved. Metre 128] for the temptation) to lengthen the reduplicating vowel. However,
the undeniable 3rd pl. pf. ending (aor. should be *rūrucan) and the existence of other
transitive exx. of rurucuḥ in other metrical positions (see Kü 431) temper the
temptation. Still, I’d be inclined to read *virūrucuḥ and assume that the stem has
been secondarily incorporated into the pf. For further disc. see comm. ad IV.16.4.

### IV.7.2  
The point of the abrupt question opening this vs. must be that mortals have
established Agni in his ritual role (vs. 1, 2cd), but Agni is not reliably fulfilling this
role by manifesting himself at the proper times.

### IV.7.3  
This vs. continues the syntactic frame of vs. 2, with the nom. pl. subj.
(“mortals” of 2d) modified by the pres. part. páśyantaḥ and Agni in the acc. sg.
vícetasam in pāda a is a pun, playing on the standard ambiguity of the root
√cit, which means both ‘perceive’ and ‘appear’. Referring to Agni’s mental qualities,
adjacent to ṛtā́vānam ‘truthful’, it means ‘discriminating’, but the simile in b, “like
heaven with its stars,” actualizes the ‘appear’ sense.
The “laughter” of Agni is the merry crackling of the fire.

### IV.7.4  
This vs. also appears to continue the syntax of vs. 3, with another acc. phrase
referring to Agni (pāda a), though given the 3rd pl. verb in c (ā́jabhruḥ) that could
govern the acc., the vs. can be syntactically self-contained.
IV.7.4cd–5: Together these vss. reprise the first vs. (and the beginning of the 2nd).
Agni’s association with the Bhṛgus of 1c is tightened by the adj. of appurtenance
bhṛ́gavan- in 4d, and viśé-viśe returns from 1d. In 5a we find ānuṣák as in 2a. The
verb ní ṣedire ‘have set down’ (5b), though etym. unrelated, is the transitive
equivalent in ritual discourse of dhāyi (1a) ‘has been installed’, and its object Agni is
identified as hótāram … yájiṣṭham, the words used of him as subject of dhāyi in vs. 1
(1b hótā yájiṣṭhaḥ). The root √dhā, insistent in 1a dhāyi dhātṛ́bhiḥ, is not absent
here: see dhā́mabhiḥ in 5d. Meanwhile the signature root of this section of the hymn
is √cit, which appears once in each of the first 5 vss., except for 4: 1d citrám, 2b
cétanam, 3a vícetasam, 5b cikitvā́ṃsam.
IV.7.6–7: Though vs. 6 belongs metrically and syntactically with what precedes -- it
is in Anuṣṭubh like vss. 2–5 and the accusative descriptive phrases hang off vs. 5 -- it
belongs thematically with vs. 7, as noted in the publ. intro. Both vss. treat the
mystery of the ritual fire, and being at the center of the hymn, they form a sort of
omphalos.

### IV.7.6  
This vs. is structured as a series of paradoxes, one per pāda. The least clear is
in pāda a, since there is only one qualifier, the loc. śáśvatīṣu mātṛ́ṣu “in ever new
39
mothers,” which must be construed with vītám ‘enveloped’ in b. The paradox there is
that ordinarily one has only one mother and that mother is not self-renewing. The
physical reference must be to the pieces of wood (his mothers) in which fire inheres
and from which he flashes out one by one. This physical image is developed in b: the
fire is within wood -- therefore apparently in a fixed place -- but is unfixed, in that it
is in constant motion in and over the sticks of wood. In c the fire inherent in the
wood, therefore hidden, is also bright when it catches. Note another instance of the
root √cit, citrám (matching the same word in 1d). And finally in d, when the fire
catches it’s easy to see and therefore to find, but its movements are unpredictable.

### IV.7.7  
This vs., particularly the first pāda, has been subjected to a variety of
interpretations, which I will not pursue in detail here. The vs. is reminiscent of,
though far less difficult than, IV.5.7, and in both cases I think it concerns the ritual
and the layout of the ritual ground. The loc. phrase sasásya … víyutā “at the
separation of the grain” I take as a reference to the spreading of the barhis, the ritual
grass; it seems to correspond to the loc. phrase in IV.5.7c sasásya cárman “on the
hide of the grain.” See also V.21.4, where Agni is urged to sit “on the womb of grain”
(sasásya yónim). “At the same udder” (sásminn ū́dhan) is also found in nearby
IV.10.8, also with apparent reference to the sacrifice or the ritual ground.
IV.7.7–8: On 3rd sg. veḥ (√vī) in 7d, see comm. ad II.5.3. Here the form serves as a
pivot, veḥ in 8a having the more morphologically orthodox 2nd ps. reference. The
near identity of the two adjacent phrases, 7d #vér adhvarā́ya and 8a #vér adhvarásya
(dūtyā̀ni), requires us to consider them together. The first is clearly 3rd sg. (with nom.
agníḥ in the preceding pāda, nom. ṛtā́vā in the same pāda). The 2nd ps. ref. of the
second only emerges in pāda 8c, with 2nd sg. verb īyase. The poet seems to want
first to enforce the 3rd ps. reference of the verb (even in 8ab the nom. pf. participles
vidvā́n and cikitvā́n appear to continue the 3rd ps.) and then require us to construct a
paradigm: 2nd sg. vés [sandhi vér], 3rd sg. vés [sandhi vér], like 2nd sg. (ā́)var, 3rd sg.
(ā́)var, which I invoked ad II.5.3 to explain the anomalous 3rd sg. vés. We can see this
sequence as a variant on poetic repair.
The near repetition of the VP in 8a also clarifies the construction of the verb
in 7d, with gapped object. I take dat. adhvarā́ya (7d) and gen. adhvarásya (8a) as
filling essentially the same functional role.

### IV.7.8  
The VP √vid āródhanaṃ diváḥ (a variant of our vidúṣṭaro divá āródhanāni)
occurs in the next hymn, IV.8.2, 4, assuring that the acc. here is governed by the
comparative to the pf. part. vidúṣṭara-. With most (though not Gr, WG) I take
āródhana- as belonging with √ruh ‘climb’ (/√rudh ‘grow’), not √rudh ‘obstruct’. On
the difficulties in sorting out these roots, see EWA s.v. RODH2
.

### IV.7.9  
My interpr. of this vs. differs from the standard ones in several ways. First, in
b most tr. take vápuṣām íd ékam as a nominal sentence: “(this is) one of the wonders.”
In contrast, I take b as describing the moment of the birth of the ritual fire: a single
40
physical flame rising from the wood, though it is well known that Agni has many
forms (vápūṃṣi e.g., III.1.8, 18.5, 55.9). Thus, ékam modifies arcíḥ, and the pāda is a
single clause.
Pādas bc then sketch a double paradox: the beam of the just-born Agni is
single, though he has many forms and though a number of mothers conceive him as
an embryo (dádhate ha gárbham). Pāda c also contains another paradox: his mothers
conceive him though they are unimpregnated (ápravītā[ḥ]). My interpr. depends on
reading pl. ápravītāḥ contra the Pp, which has singular -ā -- followed by Gr. and by
all the standard tr., which also then must take dádhate as a thematic 3rd sg. (or
perhaps a short-vowel subjunctive). With Old (Noten), I take dádhate as the expected
indic. 3rd plural mid. to the redupl. pres. to √dhā and ápravītā as representing
ápravītāḥ in sandhi. The same form, in the pl., is found in the very similar passage
III.55.5 antárvatīḥ suvate ápravītā(ḥ), which also describes Agni’s “virgin birth”:
“Having (him) within, (though) unimpregnated they give birth to (him).” Agni’s
multiple mothers also figure earlier in our own hymn, 6a.
The publ. tr. takes pāda d as a subordinate clause, still under the control of
yád beginning pāda c, primarily because of the accent on bhávasi. However, it is
quite possible that d is a separate main clause (“immediately at birth, you become a
messenger”) with the verbal accent owing to the immediately following íd. Many of
the exx. given by Gr (no. 5, s.v. íd) of accented verbs followed by íd are pāda-initial
and therefore non-probative (since they would be accented anyway), but there is a
sturdy residue of non-initial apparent main clause verbs with accent.

### IV.7.10  
An undeniable ex. of a predicated perfect part., dádṛśānam.
On the supposed separate root √di ‘destroy’, see comm. ad III.34.1.

### IV.7.11  
Rather than supplying a verb to govern ánnā (e.g., Ge “die Speisen
(verzehrend)”), I allow tṛṣúṇā ‘thirsting (for)’ to govern the acc.
In b the standard tr. supply ‘wind’: “he makes the thirsty (wind) his
messenger.” I resist this because it is Agni who is always the messenger (e.g., in this
hymn 4a, 8a, 8c, 9d), and so I think it more likely that in this case Agni is making
some part of himself (flame) into that messenger. A small problem is the masc.
gender of tṛṣúm: the words for ‘flame, blaze’ in this hymn are neut. (arcís- 9b, śocís5c, 10b). However, a word like m. śóka- is always available, or we could attribute the
masc. of tṛṣúm to attraction to dūtám or even take it as the modifier of dūtám (“he
makes [his flame] into a thirsty messenger”).
## IV.8 Agni
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn shares much phraseology with the
immediately preceding IV.7.

### IV.8.1  
The cmpd viśvá-vedas- is always at least potentially ambiguous. In general
most other tr. interpr. it as ‘all-knowing’ (lit. ‘having all knowledge’); certainly in
this passage that is the dominant rendering. However, as an independent noun, védasonly means ‘possession, property’, and I think that in most (maybe all) occurrences
41
viśvá-vedas- has that value -- though the ‘knowledge’ interpr. may be a secondary
one. In this case Agni’s having all property to distribute to us may well be of more
practical importance to us than his omniscience. The larger context cuts both ways:
the next three vss. all have verbal forms of √vid ‘know’ (2a véda, 3a veda, 4c vidvā́n),
which might favor the “all knowledge” interpr., but the obj. of ‘knows’ in the next vs.
is the depository of goods (vásu-dhiti-), which might favor the “possessions” interpr.;
note also his giving of goods in 3c (dā́ti … vásu).
The anomalous 1st sg. ṛñjase (also V.13.6, VI.15.1, 4, X.76.1; possibly
VIII.4.17) belongs with other -se 1st sg. forms like stuṣe ‘I (will) praise’. As the
context here shows, despite its likely meaning ‘aim/stretch out straight’, rñjase
patterns with those other verbs semantically, in expressing an act of praise or
reverence -- however they came into being. There is of course abundant literature on
the subject; see recently Jasanoff 2016.

### IV.8.2  
It is quite possible that vásudhiti- here is a bahuvrīhi ‘having the deposit(ing)
of goods’ vel sim., as it can be elsewhere. It could then refer to the earth (later, of
course, called vasudhā) in contrast to heaven, which is found in the next pāda; the
two pādas share the verb véda.

### IV.8.3  
With Lub. I take dā́ti as a contracted root-aor. subjunctive. Unfortunately the
root syllable never requires a disyllabic reading.

### IV.8.5  
In the publ. tr. I tr. the first rel. cl. (in ab) as descriptive, while the 2nd one (in
c) is predicative. In part the decision depends on what the temporal value of dadāśúḥ
in the first clause is -- presential or preterital. Kü (242–45) allows both and in fact tr.
other examples of this pf. ambiguously, with awkward parentheses, e.g., II.27.12
“Wer … auf(ge)wartet (hat).” (He does not tr. this passage.) The publ. tr. takes
dadāśúḥ as preterital, expressing the past actions that should allow us to thrive now.
However, it is possible that the actions of the verbs in the two rel. cl. (dadāśúḥ …
indhaté) are sequential and both presential and should both be taken as predicated:
hence “May we be those who do pious service to Agni … and, thriving, kindle him.”
Most tr. take puṣyántaḥ as transitive: “cause him to thrive,” but puṣyáti only
takes Inhaltsakk. or accusatives of respect. Moreover, the point of the té syāma yé …
clauses is surely that our pious actions should lead us to thrive.

### IV.8.8  
With Old (Noten) I take the gen. pl. carṣanīnā́m and mā́nuṣānām as
dependent on vípraḥ, rather than making them dependent on a supplied object as
most tr. do. Either way, some object needs to be supplied with áti … vidhyati; I’ve
added ‘obstacles’ as a place-holder. The only other occurrence of áti √vyadh in the
RV has “the backs of the mountains” as obj. (VIII.96.2, the Emuṣa myth), which
certainly doesn’t fit here. However, in that passage the backs of the mountains were
pierced by an archer, and archery is surely at issue here as well: kṣiprá- ‘quick,
snapping’ is construed twice with dhánvan- ‘bow’ (II.24.8 kṣipréṇa dhánvanā,
IX.90.3 kṣiprá-dhanvan-), once with íṣu- ‘arrow’ (VII.46.1 kṣipréṣu-).
42
## IV.9 Agni

### IV.9.1  
For obvious real-world reasons Agni [=fire] would not sit on the ritual grass,
because it would go up in flames (cf. comm. ad IV.6.4). But Agni regularly brings
the other gods to sit on this grass, and so the mention of his coming here and of the
“god-seeking” (devayú-) people may have made the action seem appropriate.

### IV.9.2  
On prāvī́- see comm. ad I.34.4.

### IV.9.5  
On pāda a see comm. ad VI.2.10, which contains the identical pāda.

### IV.9.8  
The diction in this vs. is somewhat difficult to apply to the chariot that is its
subject. What does it mean for a chariot to be “difficult to deceive/trick” (dūḷábha-,
reprised from 2a)? Perhaps it always follows the right route? And the lexeme pári
√(n)aś, which barely exists (an infinitive in I.54.1), in conjunction with viśvátaḥ
should mean “reach around/encircle on all sides,” again an odd action to ascribe to a
chariot. Given the paint-by-numbers style of the hymn, I attribute these lapses to an
inattentive or unskilled poet. Note the careless combustion in vs. 1.
## IV.10 Agni
On the unusual meter of this hymn and its interaction with the syntactic and
semantic organization, see publ. intro.

### IV.10.1  
With most interpr., I supply ‘sacrifice’ with tám in pāda a, as the object of
the verb ṛdhyā́ma in d.
The accent on ṛdhyā́ma is anomalous within Oldenberg’s persuasive
characterization of the meter of this hymn, since by this analysis ṛdhyā́ma is the main
verb and interior to its Triṣṭubh pāda. I assume it acquired this accent redactionally
after the meter was misanalyzed, with a pāda break inserted just before the verb. So
also WG.

### IV.10.3  
Because it begins the second 5-syllable pāda, bhávā is correctly accented.
svàr ṇá jyótiḥ could be take as a quasi-compound in the Re mode, or it is
possible that svàr indirectly continues an old gen. sg. See comm. ad II.35.6. Or svàr
and jyótiḥ can be taken not as a single expression but syntactically separate, as Old
(SBE) and WG do in different ways. I weakly favor the gen. interpr.

### IV.10.5  
Again, the accentuation of voc. ágne supports the division into 5-syllable
pādas.
The etym. figure rukmó ná rocate is difficult to render in tr.
43

### IV.10.6  
The referent of tát in d is unclear. It cannot be ‘body’, since tanū́- is
feminine. I’ve supplied ‘flame’, but any bright neuter entity would do. Most tr.
simply leave the referent blank.

### IV.10.7  
Contra HvN, mártāt should be read as the first word of pāda d.

### IV.10.8  
The second pāda should read sántu bhrātrā́gne, with coalescence of the avowels. This also entails reading, out of sandhi, unaccented agne, contra Pp and HvN.
The impv. sántu is accented because it’s initial in the pāda.
The expression śivā́naḥ sakhyā́sántu ... devéṣu yuṣmé is very similar to
VI.18.5 tán naḥ pratnáṃ sakhyám astu yuṣmé, which I take as existential. On the
basis of that passage and of VII.22.9 (=X.23.7) asmé te santu sakhyā́śivā́ni, I think
this passage should be harmonized with the others and interpreted as existential: “Let
there be a propitious partnership for us among [or, with] you, the gods.” For further
disc., incl. of the loc. pronoun, cf. comm. ad VI.18.5.
## IV.11 Agni

### IV.11.1  
The second hemistich is full of phonological and etymological figures: drś̥ é
dadrś̥ e ... drś̥ é (the last as dṛśá in sandhi) and (beg. in pāda b) ā́rocate ... rúśad ...
árūkṣitam ... ā́rūpé.
As Ge points out, Agni’s ‘not coarse’ (árūkṣita-) food must be ghee.

### IV.11.2  
This vs. contains a faint phonological figure: #ví ṣ(āhi) … #víś(vebhir).
With most interpr. I take khám ‘opening, aperture’ with pāda a. However, I do
not think it is equivalent to or compared with manīṣā́m ‘inspiration, inspired thought’
(as, e.g., Ge “Schliesse … den … Gedanken (wie) einen Kanal auf”), but rather it is
the opening through which (ví) the thought is supposed to be directed. As we all
know, sending a stream of liquid (to which the manīṣā́- is implicitly compared)
through a small opening increases its force, and I think that is the image meant.
Both hemistichs express a fine economical formulation of the tight, closed
loop of reciprocity envisioned in the RV. Agni and the rest of the gods desire praise
from men, but they must provide to men the inspiration and the thought that takes
shape as praise. So in ab Agni is asked to release the manīṣā́to us even as he is being
praised (stávānaḥ), and in cd we ask him to grant us ample thought (bhū́ri mánma),
which is exactly what he and the other gods crave (vāvánaḥ).

### IV.11.3  
The sense of the preceding vs., that Agni provides the very thoughts with
which we create his praises, is continued in 3ab. In cd and vs. 4 the material rewards
that come to the poet who produces these praises are detailed.
The phrase dráviṇaṃ vīrápeśā(ḥ) also appears, also pāda-final, at X.80.4, and
therefore the apparent nom. sg. masc. vīrápeśāḥ must modify the neut. sg. dráviṇam.
This is a case like dvibárhas- (see comm. ad VII.24.2), where an s-stem ending in -
āḥ at the end of the pāda must be interpr. as a neut. See AiG III.288.
44

### IV.11.5  
The juxtaposition of complementary opposites -- devayánto devám and
mártā amṛta -- is deft though not particularly noteworthy.
Likewise note the pair dámūnasaṃ gṛhápatim, both referring to Agni’s role in
domestic arrangements, derivatives of the older and newer words for ‘house’.

### IV.11.6  
I supply a form of the root √yu ‘keep away’ with the accusatives in ab,
extracted from the root-noun cmpd in 5c dveṣoyút- ‘keeping away hatred’.
I am not entirely sure what to do with cid in d. Perhaps the idea is that though
you are a god, you are also our companion right here.
## IV.12 Agni

### IV.12.1  
The form prasákṣat is implicitly taken as a finite form by Scar (602–3) and
WG, presumably as an s-aor. subj. In Scar’s tr. it is parallel to the impv. abhy àstu
(“so sei es, an Herrlichkeit(en) überlegen sein [und] vorherrschen”), but the verbal
accent makes trouble for this main clause interpr. (It could, I suppose, bear a
“contrastive” accent.) WG make it a subordinate cl. without overt marking (“indem
er vorwärts siegt”), which would account for the accent. Nonetheless it seems best to
take the form as a participle. Gr. identifies it as a neut.; if this is so, it would have to
be an example of the neut. used adverbially. This seems the analysis presupposed by
Old’s (SBE) tr. ‘victoriously’. However, the simplest solution is given in AiG
II.2.162 (fld. by Narten, Sig.Aor., 265): it is a masc. nom. sg. with the weak
participial suffix appropriate to verbal stems that have weak 3rd pl. endings.
The last word of the verse, the perf. part. cikitvā́n, is characteristically used
elsewhere of Agni, in absolute value. Indeed, the same pāda ending jātavedaś
cikitvā́n qualifies Agni in nearby IV.3.8 and IV.5.12 (see also cikitvā́n of Agni in
IV.8.4). However, in our vs. grammatically this nom. sg. must modify the worshiper,
not Agni (pace Re, who manages to attach it to the preceding voc.: “ô Jātavedas,
(dieu) qui comprends”). I think rather that the application of this standard epithet of
Agni to Agni’s devotee shows the same closed loop discussed with regard to the
immediately preceding hymn (see comm. ad IV.11.2), where the worshiper shares
qualities of the god, which he receives from the god. There may also be a slight pun:
‘observant’ means one thing for Agni -- he watches over everything -- but another
for the mortal who attends on him: ‘observant’ in English can refer to someone who
‘observes’, that is, ‘faithfully carries out’, the prescribed rites.
In the publ. tr. I construe táva krátvā with the preceding pāda: may the man
succeed “in accordance with your purpose,” but I now wonder if it is not another
indication of the closed loop of reciprocity: the mortal worshiper is observant like
Agni because it is Agni’s will or purpose that he should be. Of course it can be
applicable to both pādas.
IV.12.1–2: On the parallel pres. and pf. subjunctives in these vss. see comm. ad

### IV.2.6  
and my 2016 treatment of the pf. subj. referred to there.
45

### IV.12.2  
The overlapping identities of Agni and his worshiper are indirectly signaled
in this vs. Although the sá of c must be correlative with yáḥ in a and refer to the
human, some of the phraseology used of him in cd matches that used of Agni
elsewhere. The common med. part. idhāná- is almost always intrans./pass. modifying
Agni (‘[being] kindled’), but here it must be transitive with the worshiper as subject.
(There are a few other undoubted transitive occurrences: I.143.7, VII.9.6.) The
combination of this participle and a form of púṣya- as here, with Agni as subj., is
found in V.26.6 samidhānáḥ sahasrajid ágne dhármāṇi puṣyasi. Similarly sacate in d
seems to match sácase at the end of the last hymn (IV.11.6), but Agni was the subject
of that verb. The point here is that, though the second hemistich must in fact refer to
the mortal worshiper, some of the phraseology invites a superimposition of Agni.

### IV.12.3  
Assuming (as I do) that Thieme and Hoffmann are correct in their
assessment of √vidh ‘honor, serve’ as a secondary root derived from ví √dhā
‘apportion’ (for reff. see EWA s.v. VIDH), the second half-vs. encapsulates an
etymological pun: #dádhāti … vidhaté …, #ví ... This casts considerable doubt on
Bloomfield’s (RR, ad loc.) characteristically acerbic judgment “The preposition ví
which limps, with sharp tmesis, behind its verb dádhāti …. impresses me as
secondary.” Furthermore, the positioning of ví directly before ānuṣák ‘in due order’
is found elsewhere (cf. I.72.7, VI.5.3). In such phrases the ví presumably emphasizes
that goods are apportioned to each deserving recipient separately and in order.

### IV.12.4  
Though, as indicated in the publ. intro., the 2nd half of this hymn (vss. 4–6)
has a very different tone from the first, nonetheless the two halves are bound together.
Note, first, that voc. yaviṣṭha in 4a matches nom. yáviṣṭhaḥ in the same metrical
position in 3c. Moreover, the worshiper who was identified as cikitvā́n ‘observant’ in
1d is contrasted with humans who have caused offense to Agni by their ácitti- ‘lack
of observance, heedlessness’ in 4b.
Although puruṣatrā́has the locational suffix -trá / -trā́, it seems less a
locational ‘among men’ than an abstract ‘manhood, human nature’. Cf. similar
expressions with the abstract suffix -tā-: VII.57.4 = X.15.6 yád va ā́gaḥ puruṣátā
kárāma.
The use of áditeḥ in pāda c is clarified by the more expansive expression in d.
On the one hand, áditi- is, of course, the name of the goddess and mother of the
Ādityas, and the mention of her here ushers in the 2nd half of the hymn, which, as was
indicated in the publ. intro., has a distinctly Ādityan tone. On the other, á-diti- means
literally ‘unbinding’ (< √dā ‘bind’), and the lexeme ví … √śrath ‘let loose’ in the VP
vy énāṃsi śíśrathaḥ ‘let loose our transgressions’ is synonymous with ‘unbind’.

### IV.12.5  
Some verb must be supplied with the ablative phrases in ab. I have pulled
√muc ‘release’ from its occurrences in vs. 6.
Ge takes ūrvá- in b as a proper noun referring to the Vala myth, but the word
generally just means an ‘enclosure’, here an imprisoning one.
46

### IV.12.6  
As noted in the publ. intro., the plural addressees in this vs. are almost
surely the Ādityas; the vs. is repeated in X.126.8, where the referents are clearly the
Ādityas.
The comparison “just as you released the buffalo-cow bound by the foot” is
probably a reference to a well-known myth or legend, but unfortunately it is not
known to us. It is reminiscent of X.28.10, a hymn full of untraceable references to
animal stories, niruddháś cin mahiṣás tarṣyā́vān “The buffalo also got trapped, when
it was thirsty,” but the animal in question there is a mahiṣá- not a gaurá- and is masc.
not fem. Other RVic occurrences of gaurī́- are not helpful.

### IV.13–14  
As is generally recognized, these two hymns form a pair, and though
nominally dedicated to Agni, they are really dawn hymns, with mention of the
various divinities appropriate to the dawn sacrifice: Agni, Uṣas, Aśvins, Savitar,
Sūrya. The patterning between the hymns gives us one of our rare opportunities to
observe how Rigvedic variation-on-a-theme worked in practice, similar to the first
few pairs of Vālakhilya hymns.. See the brief remarks in Bloomfield, RR, p. 13. For
a more detailed account of the parallelisms see publ. intro. to IV.14 and comments on
individual vss. in 14 below. The hymns are most alike at the beginning and end with
the middle a fairly free zone. This pattern is similar to what is found in the paired
Vālakhilya hymns. See comm. thereon and esp. on VIII.50.
IV.13: Agni or various deities

### IV.13.2  
In c the other Ādityas, or at least Aryaman, should be supplied, since the
verb (yanti) is plural and there are only two expressed subjects (váruṇaḥ … mitráḥ).

### IV.13.3  
I take the Ādityas as the subj. of ákṛṇvan, since the Sun is their spy (see
pāda d). It could also be, more generally, the gods, as Old (SBE), Ge, and Re take it.
In any case it is certainly not the other pl. entity mentioned in cd, the seven golden
mares.

### IV.13.4  
This vs. contains images drawn from the techniques of everyday life:
tanning (cd) and sewing (ab). The lexeme ví √hṛ in pāda a with its object tántu-
‘thread, web’ has been differently interpreted, nor surprisingly since we don’t have
good evidence for such technical vocabularies. I interpr. it as ‘take apart, unravel’, in
part because of vipṛ́ce ‘pull apart’ in the previous vs. (Sim. Thieme, Unters., 17.)
Others, using different values for ví, interpr. the idiom as ‘spread out’ (Old, SBE) or
‘alternate (threads [=the dark threads of night and the bright ones of day])’ (Ge, WG).

### IV.13.5  
The question “how does the sun not fall?” is implicitly answered by pāda d:
he’s really a fixed pillar, not an unmoored orb in the sky. But this ignores the
presupposition to the question in c: “with what power does he journey?” -- since a
47
pillar doesn’t journey. So, despite the apparent reassurance of d, the issues remain
unresolved.
IV.14 Agni or various divinities

### IV.14.1  
The opening of the verse, práty agnír uṣásaḥ, matches that of 13.1 práty
agnír uṣásām, though the difference in case of the dawn words signals that the verses
will veer in slightly different directions. Both also share the verb akhyat, but in 13.1
it ends the first pāda, while in 14.1 it opens the 2nd pāda (accented ákhyat).
The 2nd half vss. of the two hymns deviate more, though both concern the
Aśvins and contain the verb yātam (accented yātám in 13.1c). Sūrya (13.2d) is absent
from 14.1.

### IV.14.2  
The first pādas of these two vss. are identical, save for the near synonyms
bhānúm (13.2) and ketúm (14.2), which take 2nd position. The rest of the verses go
their own ways, though Sūrya appears in the final pādas of both.

### IV.14.3  
Though both 13.3 and 14.3 contain horse imagery and the verb √vah
‘convey’, they are otherwise quite distinct, with Dawn the topic of 14.3.

### IV.14.4  
The splv. váhiṣṭha- in the pl. is found in both 13.4 and 14.4; the verb of
motion is yāsi in 13.4 and vahantu in 14.4.
The referent of the 2nd du. must be the Aśvins (so also Old [SBE], WG, pace
Re, who supplies Agni and Dawn). Though they are unnamed, the near identity of
pāda b with IV.45.2b in an Aśvin hymn makes this identification most likely, esp.
since soma and honey are the drinks of choice of the Aśvins.

### IV.14.5  
Identical to 13.5.
## IV.15 Agni

### IV.15.1  
The usual concessive force of the nom. of the pres. part. to √as ‘be’ is
absent here, as far as I can see. Ge suggests that it is marking the phrase as a simile
(Re’s tr. suggests that he agrees). Since the vs. seems to concern the paryagnikaraṇa,
the leading of the sacrificial animal around the fire, the sán may signal that Agni is
acting in the guise of a horse, “being a horse.”

### IV.15.4  
Ge’s tr. “vor Sṛñjaya Daivavāta” assumes that puráḥ can act as a preposition
with a locative. Since there is no other evidence for this, and since the puráḥ is better
taken as a reference to Agni’s location on the ritual ground, as regularly seen in the
epithet puróhita- ‘placed in front’, I take the loc. of the PN as an unmarked loc. abs.
(“SD [being there]”) or with Re and WG as a simple locational, which is far easier to
convey with French chez or German bei than in English.
48

### IV.15.5  
The standard tr. take this vs. to mean “a mortal hero should have mastery
over such a fire” vel sim., but given the previous mention of Sṛñjaya Daivavāta, I
think the point is that not every mortal deserves a fire like this -- only a vīrá- like SD.

### IV.15.6  
Agni here is compared with soma, though without mention of that word.
The comparison is esp. obvious in the verb marmrjyánte ‘they keep grooming’, since
√mṛj is a signature word for soma, and in the descriptive phrase in b. As Old (SBE)
points out, soma is often called aruṣá- ‘red’ (though it must be admitted that Agni is
too), and ‘child of heaven’ (diváḥ śíśu-) is also a somyan epithet (IX.33.5, 38.5,
though cf. VI.49.2 where it modifies Agni). As discussed in the publ. intro., this
covert reference to soma ushers in the Dānastuti for Prince Sāhadevya, whose
nickname is Somaka (9c).

### IV.15.7  
I interpr the apparent injunc. bódhat as a modal, rather than in the preterital
value favored by most tr. -- and in fact follow Hoffmann (Injunk., 232) in taking it as
a root-aor. subjunctive, not a pres. injunc. The poet is playfully reminding his patron
that he’s owed a gift, and he couches this as a bit of a joke, using the ‘awaken’ value
of √budh: “wake me up with a nice surprise and I’ll come and sing.”

### IV.15.8  
This next vs. indicates that the reminder had its effect. The grammatical
identity of ā́dade is ambiguous: it could be pres. indic. or pf. indic. In fact in my
interpr. of this two-verse sequence 7–8 it doesn’t really matter: 8c could be tr. “I take
as soon as they are offered” without disturbing the rhetorical sequence. However, I
follow most (incl. Kü, 241) in taking it as a preterital pf. rather than as a pres. with
Hoffmann (Injunk, 232; so also WG).

### IV.15.10  
In one way this vs. is simply a more active variant of vs. 9. In 9 it is
implied that Sāhadevya will be long-lived because of the Aśvins (somehow or other);
in 10 they are ordered to make him so. But there’s a grammatical twist at the end: the
impv. kṛṇotana is plural not dual, and so the Aśvins may have helper(s). The shift to
the pl. is probably yet another example of the tendency to open out to the larger
divine world in final vss., by including unspecified others -- so here “you (two and
other gods).” But it’s worth pointing out that no du. impv. of √kṛ would fit this
metrical slot. (On the other hand, no RVic poet with even middling skills would have
been unable to throw in a particle or the like to make the meter work.)
## IV.16 Indra

### IV.16.1  
As often, satyá- ‘real’ seems here to have the sense ‘really present’,
expressing the standard hope of every Vedic ritual, that the gods, esp. Indra, should
be physically present at the sacrifice, providing a technical epiphany.
49

### IV.16.2  
Rather than interpr. vedhā́ḥ as part of the simile (e.g., WG “wie die mündige
Uśanā”), I take it as referring to Agni, the officiating Hotar-priest, as often. See
further support for this identification in the next vs.

### IV.16.3  
I take the first hemistich as a continuation of 2cd. Phraseology suggests this
connection: the simile uśáneva in 2c is matched by the simile beginning 3a kavír ná;
together they add up to the full name of the mythic figure Uśanā Kāvya. (kaví- stands
in for his patronymic elsewhere: cf. nearby IV.26.1 aháṃ kavír uśánā.) The
participial phrase vidáthāni sā́dhan “bringing the rites to realization” has Agni as its
subj. elsewhere (e.g., III.1.18 and the other passages adduced by Ge n. 3a). Agni is
also often called a kaví-, and I take this word here as referring both to Uśanā Kāvya
to whom Agni is compared and to Agni himself.
The subj. of pāda b must be different from that in a; I follow Ge (/WG) in
taking it as the pressing stone. The idiom ví √pā ‘extract/separate by drinking’ favors
this identification; see comm. ad VII.22.4, which passage also contains a form of
√arc as here as well as an overt occurrence of the ‘stone’ (ádri-).
Unlike Ge (/WG) I do not take pāda c as the main clause with b, nor do I think
they have the same subject. Rather with Schmidt (B+I, 48–49) I tentatively take
Indra as subj. in c (though not, with Schmidt, a and b as well). The Vala myth is
quietly introduced in this second half-vs., with Indra’s creation of the poets and then
their singing into existence the ritual patterns. With Ge (etc.) it is likely that the
seven bards are the Aṅgirases.
There may be a very backgrounded pun in cd: c opens with divá(h) ‘of
heaven’, to be construed with saptá kārū́n “seven bards” at the end of the pāda, while
d opens with áhnā ‘by day’. Despite the different accent and different case form, it
might be possible to take divá (in sandhi) as a variant of dívā ‘by day’, anticipating
the instr. ahnā́in the same position in the next pāda. But I am very uncertain about
this.
Note the responsion of verse-final act. transitive gṛṇántaḥ to vs.-final med.
passive gṛṇāṇáḥ in 1d.

### IV.16.4  
The Vala myth takes full hold in this vs.
Instr. arkaíḥ is a pun, referring not only to the chants of the singers but also to
the rays of the sun itself.
The 3rd pl. rurucur has trans./caus. sense here and generally in its other
occurrences (see Kü 431), though not VIII.3.20. In several of those passages it’s in
the cadence and would be better read *rūrucur (IV.7.1, X.122.5), and here and in the
other case (VI.62.2, but not the trans./caus. opt. rurucyā́ḥ VI.35.4) a heavy initial syl.
is possible (though not metrically good in VI.62.2). The 3rd sg. act. pf. ruroca (1x:
IV.5.15) and act. pf. part. (1x: I.149.3) are intransitive by contrast, as are the medial
forms. The anomalous trans. rurucuḥ forms also have the ending characteristic of the
perfect 3rd pl. act., not the -an expected for a redupl. aor. (e.g., (á)jījanan).
Nonetheless I am inclined to believe that these forms originally belonged to a proper
redupl. aor. paradigm (á)rūruca-, found in árūrucat (3x), with the heavy redupl.
50
proper to a redupl. aor., and that the 3rd pl. forms first adopted the -ur ending of the
pf. and then, quite possibly redactionally, shortened the reduplicating vowel. It
should be noted, however, that Old (ZDMG 60: 163) rejects this, an idea originating
with Gaedicke.
Because rurucuḥ is unaccented, the first part of pāda b must be the main cl.,
with the following yád introducing a nominal cl. -- pace Ge, who simply declares it
an unaccented subordinate cl. verb (n. 4b).
Note the periphrastic caus. vicákṣe … cakāra, on which see Zehnder
(Periphras. Kausativ, passim, esp. 51). He suggests that it is parallel to the perfect
rurucuḥ in b. If agreement in tense stem is really at issue, this would be another arg.
against my assumption that rurucuḥ is an old redupl. aor.
The opening of 4c andhā́támāṃsi is reminiscent of that of 1c tásmā íd ándhaḥ,
though they have nothing in common lexically or thematically and they do not seem
to demarcate a section. The repetition of ṛjīṣī́in the next vs. (end of pāda a),
matching the end of 1a, suggests, however, that some demarcation is happening.

### IV.16.5  
On ṛjīṣī́see immed. preceding comment.
ámitam must be adverbial, as is recognized by all standard treatments.
I do not see a semantic diff. between the abstracts mahitvá- and mahimán-;
what distinguishes them is their metrical shape. The nom. sg. mahimā́is obviously
excluded from the cadence, but well suited for the break after a 5-syl. opening; instr.
sg. mahitvā́- works nicely in a Triṣṭubh cadence. Curiously enough English does not
seem to have two different abstract formations to ‘great’ (*greatitude, *greatery,
*greathood, etc.) despite the usual flexibility of our language, and so I have tr. both
Skt. words with ‘greatness’.

### IV.16.6  
See Ge’s long note (6b) on the mixture of Vṛtra and Vala themes in this vs.
Ge (/WG) supplies ‘deeds’ with náryāṇi (“Mannestaten”) without indicating
what Sanskrit word he is thinking of. It should surely be ápāṃsi ‘labors’, which
regularly shows up with some form of nṛ́- or a derivative thereof (on nári ápāṃsi see
comm. ad VIII.96.19). Assuming this is the correct underlying noun, we can identify
a buried pun: apáḥ (apó in sandhi) ‘waters’ opens the 2nd pāda; it is phonologically
reminiscent of ápaḥ ‘labor’.

### IV.16.7  
Ge tr. párāhan as a 3rd sg., continuing the 3rd persons of vs. 6, but the rest of
vs. 7 has 2nd ps. reference. The verb ahan, ambiguous between 2nd and 3rd sg., serves
as a modulation form, as often (cf. I.32.3d, 4a, for ex.).
IV.16.7–8: As noted in the publ. intro., these two vss. tease apart the Vala and Vṛtra
myths that have been intertwined in the previous vss., with the Vṛtra myth allotted to
vs. 7 and the Vala myth to vs. 8. But even with the clear mention of Vṛtra in 7a and
Saramā in 8b, there is some ambiguity, centered on the apó beginning 8a. See comm.
on vs. 8.
51

### IV.16.8  
As was just mentioned, verse-initial apó causes some problem. This form
matches the two occurrences of apó opening 6b and 7a and grammatically should be,
with them, the acc. pl. of áp- ‘water(s)’. But the problem is that ‘waters’ do not
figure in the Vala myth: it is cows/dawns that are freed from the rock. For this reason
Old suggests reading *ápo = ápa + u, with ápa a preverb with dárdar, and this
conjecture is followed by Ge. However, ápa is only marginally attested with √dṛ
(only RV VI.17.5 and nowhere else in Skt., at least acdg. to MWms). I therefore
accept the transmitted apó and assume 1) syntactically, that √dṛ takes a double obj.
here (“tear open the rock ACC (for) the waters ACC”), and 2) thematically, that
because of the interpenetration of the Vala and Vṛtra myths just mentioned the
cows/dawns in the Vala myth get assimilated to the waters of the Vṛtra myth. My
‘tore open’ actually assumes that Old’s ápa-u is secondarily present, with my ‘open’
representing *ápa. It is worth noting that forms of the root √dṛ are fairly rare without
preverb. Schmidt (B+I 162), Hoffmann (Injunk. 270), and WG also all accept the
‘waters’ reading. Note that the waters here would correspond to the acc. with √dṛ in
pāda c: vā́jam ‘prize’. That is, the prize in c is what gets torn out of the rock (waters),
while the rock in pāda a is what gets torn apart to get to the prize.
Acdg. to Schaeffer (136), the intens. to √dṛ has become lexicalized and no
longer has any discernible frequentative value. However, most forms of this intens.
take plural objects, so it could be object-distributive. In our case the pl. apáḥ ‘waters’
might fit this model, though the pl. tantum ‘waters’ really functions as a mass noun,
not a set of countable hunks of water. See also ví dardaḥ in 13d below.
I take adverbial neut. pūrvyám in b as meaning ‘previously, before’, and in
conjunction with the injunc. āvír bhuvat, as a somewhat awkward attempt to express
anteriority: Saramā appeared to you previously (b), ordering you to √dṛ (ā́darṣi, c),
and then you did so (dárdar, a). Schmidt (B+I 162) avoids the anteriority reading by
tr. ‘zuerst’, and Hoffmann (Injunk. 270) and WG render it “als erstes,” an interpr.
that would seem to me to require an adj. modifying nom. sg. fem. sarámā, not an
adverbial neut.
Ge takes the 2nd hemistich as the words of Saramā, an interpr. I accept both
because of the si-impv. ā́darṣi in c and because of the pseudo-anterior construction
in b just discussed.
Verse-final gṛṇānáḥ has an exact match at the end of vs. 1, and this bit of ring
composition signals that this section of the hymn is finished. In the next section we
move on to the Kutsa / Uśanā Kāvya story.

### IV.16.9  
Although, as noted ad vs. 3, the word kaví- often signals a mention of Uśanā
Kāvya -- and this personage figures in the myth being recounted here -- in the publ.
tr. I was tentatively inclined to follow Ge in taking kavím as a reference to Kutsa,
since Kutsa could plausibly be qualified as nā́dhamāna- ‘in need’ in this myth and
Uśanā Kāvya is unlikely to be. However, since the myth in question involves a trip to
UK’s place to seek advice (see next vs., 10a), the phrase áchā kavím … gāḥ “you
came to the kaví” in pāda a probably refers to UK, and the nā́dhamānam, found only
at the end of b, may conceal a different goal, namely Kutsa. Hence I would emend
52
the publ. tr. to “you came to the poet (=UK) (and) to the one in need (=Kutsa) at the
winning of the sun.” In 11d kavíḥ also most likely refers to UK.
The phrase nṛmano … abhíṣṭau is reminiscent of 4d nṛ́tamo abhíṣtau.
The apparent thematic verbal stem iṣaṇa- is almost confined to this group of
Indra hymns (in addition to this vs., IV.17.14, 22.10, 23.9, as well as a single outlier
I.134.5, for which see comm. ad loc.). Narten’s interpr. of this stem as an aorist
generated to the pres. iṣaṇyáti seems reasonable, though it does not account for the
limited distribution of our stem: no forms of iṣaṇyá- are even found in the IVth
Maṇḍala. (Narten, MSS 1982, cited after Kl. Schr., 266-67; cf. Gotō, 1st class, n.
243.)
In its other two occurrences (I.129.7, VI.26.8) dyumnáhūti- ‘invocation to
heavenly brilliance’ is a call that we sacrificers make to attract the god(s). I do not
understand what it is expressing here. It does not seem to have anything to do with
dyumnaíḥ in 19c below.

### IV.16.10  
Pāda b bhuvát te kútsaḥ sakhyé níkāmaḥ echoes 6b … sákhibhir níkāmaiḥ.
In 6 Indra performs manly deeds “with his eager companions” (either the Maruts of
the Vṛtra myth or the Aṅgirases of the Vala myth); here Kutsa must be transformed
into such a sidekick by his association with Indra: “In companionship with you,
Kutsa will become eager.”
On the enigmatic theme of the woman trying to tell Indra and Kutsa apart, see
the publ. intro. As argued there, it is likely that the Jaiminīya Brāh. version (JB
III.199-202), with sexual mischief between Kutsa and Indra’s wife, facilitated by the
identical appearance of Indra and Kutsa, is only a secondary attempt to make sense
of this tantalizing snippet and no such story underlies our passage. Certainly the
woman (nā́rī) in our passage seems entirely upright and eager to distinguish between
the two males.

### IV.16.11  
Although we don’t ordinarily think of Indra as ‘seeking help’ (avasyú-) but
giving it, in this myth Indra goes to the house of Uśanā Kāvya to receive the mace
from him. I therefore think that the ‘help’ Indra is seeking is concretized as the mace.
See below on pāda d.
Note that ī́śānaḥ in b echoes iṣaṇo in 9c.
In d the two words áhan pā́ryāya have provoked a certain amount of
discussion (see Old, Ge n. 11d, Kuiper, IIJ 5: 169ff., who is followed by Hoffmann,
Injunk. 189 n. 151, and WG) because of its similarity to the expression diví pā́rye “on
the decisive day” (VI.17.14, etc.). The dat. pā́ryāya here is therefore taken by some
as a temporal expression with a word for ‘day’ or the like to be supplied (e.g., Old
pā́ryāya *áhne). However, the dative expression nearby in IV.25.1 mahé ‘vase
pā́ryāya “for great, decisive help” (though see alternative tr. of Ge [/WG]) seems the
more compelling comparandum, esp. since Indra has come to UK’s seeking help
(avasyúḥ 1a). By following áhan with the stem pā́rya-, the poet may be tricking us
into expecting a temporal expression (cf. VI.26.1 pā́rye áhan; also III.32.14), but the
case mismatch should alert the audience that our expection has been thwarted. As
53
indicated in the comm. ad pāda a, I think the “decisive help” that UK gives Indra is
the mace he fashioned; it’s important to note that in another telling of this myth in
I.121.12 the mace itself is called pā́rya-: I.121.12cd yáṃ te kāvyá uśánā … dā́t, …
pā́ryaṃ tatakṣa vájram “UK fashioned the decisive mace which he gave to you.” For
UK giving Indra the mace, see also V.34.2.

### IV.16.12  
Note the phonological play in śúṣṇam aśúṣam “insatiable Śuṣṇa.”
With Old (flg. Ge, Ved. St.; see also Hoffmann (Injunk. 189) I interpret the
hapax kutsyá- ‘Kutsian’ in light of the phrase vadháṃ kútsam (I.175.4) “Kutsa (as)
deadly weapon.”
The “future imperative” vṛhatāt in d follows nicely on the normal impv. prá
mṛṇa in c.

### IV.16.13  
Here the intensive of √dṛ, ví dardaḥ, takes a plural obj. púraḥ ‘fortresses’.
See disc. above ad 8a.
The simile and frame in d are curiously intermingled, with the object in the
frame, púraḥ ‘fortresses’, dropped into the middle of the simile átkaṃ ná … jarimā́
“like old age a cloak.” I also don’t quite understand the content of the simile. It’s
presumably the age of the garment, not of its wearer, that causes the garment to fall
apart. WG seem to take jarimā́not with the simile but the frame: “Wie einen
Reisemantel spaltet das Alter die Palisaden auseinander.” This would solve the
intermingling problem identified above, but it otherwise doesn’t fit the mythic
context. Surely it would be ignominious for Indra if, instead of Indra’s heroically
tearing apart these mighty fortresses, they just fell apart from decrepitude and
deferred maintenance. The WG n. on the passage calls the simile a Sprichwort and it
is not clear to me what function they see jarimā́as playing.

### IV.16.14  
As noted in the publ. intro., pāda b seems to resolve the problem of
distinguishing between Indra and Kutsa that arose in 10cd. The same lexeme ví √cit
‘distinguish’ found in 10d recurs here.
The athematic middle participle uṣāṇá- ‘wearing’ here is a hapax stem and is,
of course, morphologically anomalous: the full-grade medial root pres. váste is
matched by a very well-attested full-grade athem. med. part. vásāna-. We do not
expect a zero-grade formation to this root pres. However, our hapax calls to mind the
unnamed hero of this portion of the hymn Uśanā (Kāvya), and the nonce creation of
participle uṣāná- here (as an echo of uśánā) seems to me a text-book example of
morphological aberrancies arising out of contextual pressures -- all the more striking
because the word uśánā does not occur in this section of the hymn (but cf. 2c), so the
participial echo is echoing something beneath the surface. WG’s characterization of
this form as “eine individuelle Fehlbildung des Dichters” itself fails to see the poetic
purpose and clever creativity of this form. It is true, however, that it should probably
also be evaluated in the context of several other such anomalous participles in this
group of Indra hymns, uśámāna- (IV.19.4), uṣámāna- (IV.22.2), and uśāná-
(IV.23.1).
54

### IV.16.15  
The simile in b, svàrmīḷhe ná “as if at (a contest) with the sun as its prize,”
provides a transition from the sun-winning myth of Indra and Kutsa, which occupied
the previous few vss., and this more general final section of the hymn.
The desires (kā́māḥ) that are the grammatical subject of this vs. -- namely our
desires for Indra’s largesse -- take part in actions that might appear to be more
appropriate to other subjects. On the one hand, they “take pleasure in the pressing”
(sávane cakānā́ḥ); we would rather expect the god Indra to do so. On the other, they
“perform ritual labor with hymns” (śaśamānā́sa ukthaíḥ), a priestly activity. The
desires thus mediate between the two poles of ritual participation.
Pace Oldenberg, ókaḥ in d is most likely not an acc. goal to be construed with
agman in a (though this might be a possible secondary reading), but a nominative --
on the basis of a web of formulaic associations with raṇvá- ‘delightful’. Cf. I.66.3
óko ná raṇváḥ “(Agni) delightful like a home”; also I.69.4-5 raṇvó duroṇé “a joy in
the house,” X.64.11 [=I.144.7] raṇváḥ … iva kṣáyaḥ “delightful … like a dwelling,”
X.33.6 kṣétraṃ ná raṇvám “delightful like a dwelling place.” The problem in our
passage is that raṇvā́(the only possible underlying form given its sandhi context)
cannot technically modify neut. ókaḥ, despite the formulaics just discussed. The
solution, as Ge saw (n. 15d), is that nom. sg. fem. raṇvā́also participates in the
second simile in this pāda, sudṛ́ṣīva puṣṭíḥ “like prosperity beautiful to see” -- with
which raṇvá- also has formulaic associations. Cf. I.65.5 puṣṭír ná raṇvā́“like
thriving that brings delight” (immediately followed by kṣitíḥ ‘dwelling place’) and
II.4.4 raṇvā́… iva puṣṭíḥ ‘id.’. Of course, both similes provide comparisons to the
desires that are the ultimate subject, with raṇvā́as the pivotal tert. comp. in both --
though it does not match kā́māḥ in gender or number.

### IV.16.16  
I take cid with the dat. mā́vate jaritré since I do not see how to construe it
sensibly with gádhyam. I cannot explain its displacement to pāda end, however.
On the gádhyaṃ vā́jam see 11c.

### IV.16.17  
Pāda b is difficult. Ge (/WG) construe the two locatives in b, kásmiñ cid
and muhuké, together, which would of course be the default interpr. However, this
leads Ge to render muhuká- as ‘Schlachtgeschrei’, a tr. for which there is no support:
its closest etymological relative, adverbial múhur, only means ‘suddenly, in an
instant’. (WG’s “in irgendeinem plötzlichen Vorfall” at least imposes less content
and sticks closer semantically to múhur and company.) In the publ. tr. I separate the
two locatives, taking muhuké as a simple temporal and construing the indefinite
kásmiñ cid with the gen. pl. jánānām. This interpr. was in part prompted by the need
to have something for antár to govern: antár does not take the genitive, so a direct
connection with jánānām (“among the peoples”) is out, but it regularly takes the
locative. Hence my “among some one of the peoples”: since jána- can refer to a
group of persons who make up a people, it doesn't have to be a single individual,
hence my “some one” rather than “someone.” (Cf. also V.74.2 kásmin … jáne.)
However, I recognize that this interpr. is both artificial and awkward, and (somewhat
55
in the spirit of WG) I have cast about for an interpr. of muhuké, which should
literally mean ‘instantaneous’, that both reflects its etymology and yet allows it to
refer to a conflict and be plausibly construed with jánānām. The Engl. word
‘skirmish’ (“an episode of irregular or unpremeditated conflict”) comes close. I
would thus revise my tr. of ab to “If a sharp missile will fly within some sudden
skirmish of the peoples, o champion, ...”

### IV.16.18  
The morphological ambiguity of bhúvaḥ (injunctive or subjunctive) allows
for several possible interpretations of the first half-vs. Ge takes bhúvaḥ as
imperatival “sei,” though this is unlikely given the morphology. Hoffmann (Injunk.
262) takes it as a “generell oder resulativ konstatierend” injunctive and tr. “du bist”
(so also WG). By contrast, I think these two fronted bhúvaḥ are subjunctives and
questions. There is of course no way to tell. However, the purpose clause with
subjunctive in 20cd .. yáthā … ásan naḥ ... avitā “so that he will be our helper,”
matching our pāda a bhúvo ‘vitā́, suggests that bhúvaḥ is indeed a subjunctive and
that further we are not at this point certain that Indra will become what we want him
to -- hence a question rather that a statement is more appropriate. As for how bhúvas,
-at came to be aor. injunctives homonymous with the morphologically more
transparent root aor. subjunctives, I find KH’s scenario (56) plausible, that they were
secondarily generated to 1st sg. bhuvam (e.g., X.48.1; 49.1, 4; 86.5), which is the
properly built injunctive to the root aor. (though cf. TS II.5.1.1 bhūvam). However, I
do not follow KH in taking the motivation for this formation the avoidance of
monosyllabic forms, since injunc. bhū́s, bhū́t are quite common. (A more likely
explan. in the Hoffmannian mode would be that, since bhū́s, bhū́t can do double duty
as imperative substitutes, bhuvas, -at make the injunctive value clearer.) I’d rather
suggest a different reason why injunctive bhúvas, -at took hold and could exist
simultaneously with the subjunctives of the same shape, while putative injunctives
káras, -at, secondarily built in the same way as bhúvas, -at to 1st sg. karam, are
essentially only subjunctives. Because of the lack of ablaut of √bhū, the zero-grade
of the root syllable of the subjunctive bhúvas, -at doesn’t accord with standard
subjunctive formations and must have seemed at best equivocal, whereas káras, -at is
a perfect specimen of a subjunctive and does not invite other morphological
interpretations.

### IV.16.19  
The standard tr. supply a verb in ab: Ge “rufe ich,” WG “bitten … wir.”
This seems unnecessary: the instr. phrases in ab can be parallel to dyumnaíḥ in the
simile in c, all controlled by the participial phrase abhí sántaḥ “(we) dominating” in c.
One of the factors that might support supplying a verb in ab is the otherwise
apparently orphaned acc. encl. tvā at the end of pāda a, but even as Ge advances this
reason for supplying a verb (n. 19a), he also suggests that tvā could be dependent on
immediately preceding tvāyúbhiḥ, an explanation that the close sandhi of the two
words (tvāyúbhiṣ ṭvā) might favor.
In b víśve, in the phrase víśva ājaú, must be a loc., although we might expect
the pronominal form víśvasmin. It is, however, worth noting that víśvasmin is found
56
only twice in the RV, in the same phrase (víśvasmin bháre) in adjacent hymns in the
Xth Maṇḍala (X.49.1, X.50.4). A nominal-type loc. víśve here would also be
facilitated by the plural version víśveṣu ... ājíṣu in I.130.8 with simple truncation of
the -ṣu.
Although Ge construes dyumnaíḥ not in the simile but as an attribute of the
subject (“we”), the almost identical X.115.7 dyā́vo ná dyumnaír abhí sánti mā́nuṣān
may (but need not) support keeping it with the simile; Ge separates the two in his tr.
of that passage as well.
IV.16.20–21: These two vss. provide a double ending to this hymn. The first (20)
begins, as summary vss. often do, with evá ‘just in this way’. It announces selfreferentially, with the root aor. akarma “we have just made,” that the hymn being
completed is the bráhman- we have created for Indra. And, as noted above ad vs. 18,
the purpose clauses with subjunctive provide reassurance for the worried questions in
18ab. Vs. 21 is repeated as the final verse of the seven hymns IV.17, 19–24, so it
serves as a refrain vs. for (some of) the Vāmadeva Indra hymns. It also announces,
with a root aor. (though aor. passive), that the formulation has just been made (ákāri
… bráhma). Despite the apparent duplication, we should not necessarily assume that
this refrain was tacked onto an already complete hymn, because gṛṇānáḥ at the end
of 21a may form a ring with the same word at the end of vs. 1.

### IV.16.20  
The standard tr. (Ge [/WG]) take viyóṣat as intransitive, a view argued for
by Narten (Sig. aor. 214), with a neut. pl. subj. (sakhyā́) of a sg. verb. For my
argument for a trans. interpr. of this s-aorist, see comm. ad II.32.2. As at II.32.2 I
take sakhyā́here as an instr. sg. of separation, though an acc. pl. obj. (“he will not
keep our partnerships far away”) is also possible.
Note that tanūpā́ḥ picks up 7d tanvò bodhi gopā́ḥ.

### IV.16.21  
The standard tr. (Ge [/WG]) as also Kü (300) interpr. pīpeḥ as hortative.
This is certainly possible (and is reflected in the publ. tr.), but context would also
allow “you (have) made swell” or “you make swell” just as easily.
## IV.17 Indra
IV.17.1–4: Hoffmann (Injunk. 178–180) treats these four vss. They express the
cosmic disruptions attendant on Indra’s birth and the further disruptions caused by
his smashing of Vṛtra. On the ring composition that demarcates this section, see
comm. on vs. 4 below.

### IV.17.1  
The pair “earth / heaven” occupy the final slots of the first two pādas: …
kṣā́(ḥ)# … dyaúḥ#, with a shared 3rd singular verb ánu … manyata. Note that there
also exists a dual dvandva containing these stems: dyā́vā-kṣā́mā.
57
The 2nd hemistich contains two pf. participles expressing action anterior to the
main verb (sṛjáḥ): jaghanvā́n ‘having smashed’ and jagrasānā́n ‘having been
swallowed’.

### IV.17.2  
As in vs. 1, the pair heaven and earth are expressed by two singulars (dyaúḥ,
bhū́miḥ), even though, again, there is a dual dvandva available: dyā́vā-bhū́mī.
BR suggest reading dyaúr éjad for Pp. dyaúḥ / réjat. Although rejected by Old,
this reading (which does not require changing the Saṃhitā text) is accepted by Ge,
Hoffmann (Injunk. 179, 181), and Gotō (1st class, 271–72), as well as by me. The
stem réja- is almost entirely medial (see rejata in pāda a), while éja- is act. It is easy
to see how the misparsing could have arisen, due to the presence of immediately
preceding rejata.
With Ge, I take tviṣáḥ as a gen. dependent on bhiyásā in b, thus parallel to
manyóḥ. It would also be possible to take tviṣáḥ as an abl. of cause (so Hoffmann 179,
WG).
Note the phonetic figure táva tviṣáḥ. Note also that the reflex. adj. svásya
must reference táva and therefore have 2nd ps. value (as well as not referring to the
grammatical subj., as is sometimes claimed for reflexives).
IV.17.2–3: saráyanta ā́paḥ (sarayánte out of sandhi) in 2d is reprised by sárann ā́paḥ
in 3d. The two verbs seem semantically identical; the intransitive -áya-formation
takes the post-(late-)caesura position also favored by metrically identical janáyanta.
Its medial ending is an example of -anta replacement of the usual type (cf. Jamison
1979: IIJ 21), though somewhat complicated by the fact that the form out of sandhi is
actually primary -ante.

### IV.17.3  
Almost the full panoply of power terms is on display in the first hemistich:
śávas-, sáhas- (in the pseudo-part., on which see comm. ad IV.3.6), and ójas-.
The “bull” of the waters is of course Vṛtra.

### IV.17.4  
This vs. shows a clever twist on ring composition. Like vss. 1 and 2 it
contains occurrences of both heaven and earth (here dyaúḥ a, bhū́ma d), and in fact
pāda a ends exactly as 1b does: manyata dyaúḥ. But the two phrases mean very
different things: in vs. 1 manyata is construed with ánu in the lexeme meaning
‘concede’, whereas here there is no preverb and the verb means ‘be considered as’.
Moreover, although in the 1st two vss. heaven and earth functioned as a pair, though
expressed as two singulars, here they have nothing to do with each other, and indeed
earth is found only in a negative simile (sádaso ná bhū́ma, which in Engl. has to be
awkwardly rendered by “any more than …”).
On the tangled paternity here, see publ. intro.

### IV.17.5  
The break from the themes of the first 4 vss. is signalled by pres. tense
forms (cyāváyati, madanti), after the relentless march of injunctives (and one pf.) in
1–4. (Technically speaking saráyanta in 2d is a present out of sandhi [-ante], but it
58
patterns like other -anta forms of this shape. See disc. ad 2d.) But vs. 5 is also
verbally linked to what went before: bhū́ma ending the first pāda matches the same
word ending the last pāda of vs. 4, and ánu … madanti in c phonologically recalls
ánu … manyata in 1b.
The vs. is thematically structured by one / many. Indra alone (ékaḥ) is
invoked by many (puruhūtáḥ), as (single) king of the separate peoples (kṛṣṭīnā́m),
whom all (víśve) celebrate.
The satyám beginning the 2nd hemistich may signal Indra’s real presence on
the ritual ground, as I argue it does in IV.16.1. The rest of the half vs. clearly takes
place at the sacrifice. So the tr. might be emended to “All celebrate him (who is)
really here …”
The construction of the last pāda is unclear, esp. the morphological identity
and referents of devásya gṛṇató maghónaḥ. Old takes rātím as the obj. of grṇ̥ atáḥ
(“singing the gift”) and sees grṇ̥ atáḥ and maghónaḥ as parallel acc. pl. (“the singers
and patrons”). But this phrase is supposed to be coreferential with nominative víśve
in c: “Alle: die (Priester), welche des Gottes Gabe besingen, und die freigebigen
Herren.” This syntactic slippage seems unacceptable to me (and uncharacteristic of
Old). Ge takes grṇ̥ atáḥ as a gen. sg. dep. on gen. sg. maghónaḥ, which is in
apposition to devásya: “the gift of the god, who is the generous patron of the singer.”
This makes good sense, but I have not been able to find other passages with a
genitive dependent on maghávan-. WG take all three as gen. sg. with the same
referent, namely Indra, all dependent on rātím. But since this is not a Vala passage,
Indra should not be singing, but receiving the singing of others. My tr. starts from
passages like VII.12.2 asmā́n gṛṇatá utá no maghónaḥ (cf. also X.22.15), where
gṛnatáḥ and maghónaḥ are overtly conjoined (by utá) and refer to humans: “us (who
are) singing and our patrons.” In that passage the forms are acc. pl.; in ours here I
take them as gen. sg. in datival usage (as often).

### IV.17.6  
In pāda a the word víśve was omitted in the publ. tr., which should be
emended to “Entirely his were all the soma-drinks.”
The three initial satrā́(a, b, c) are echoed by dátre beginning d. Although
there is some dissension on the root etym. of dátra- (cf., e.g., Old, who cites Neisser
derivation from dáyate ‘apportion’ -- an analysis apparently followed by both Ge and
WG, judging from their tr. ‘Anteil’), the correct analysis was already sketched by Gr
s.v.: it is a -tra- deriv. built to the weak stem of the redupl. pres. to √dā ‘give’ (dad-),
hence *dáttra, with simplification of the geminate before r, as often. See AiG
II.2.703 and the important (if lapidary) correction in the Nachtr. to AiG I: Nachtr. p.
3, to I.5 ll. 30–31.
IV.17.6–7: I take the idiom found in 6d and 7b, LOC. ACC. adhithāḥ, as meaning ‘put
s.o. in the path/way of s.th. The middle voice of adhithāḥ signals that the entity in the
loc. belongs to the subject, namely Indra -- in the first case his generosity (just
celebrated in 5d), in the second his power of attack. Although Ge recognizes the
59
similarity of these constructions, with identical subjects and objects (see his n. 6d),
he renders them quite differently. For áme √dhā in 7b, see also I.63.1, 67.3.

### IV.17.8  
The first half of this vs., describing Indra, is couched in the accusative, on
which the rel. cl. of cd depends. Since both the preceding and following vss. refer to
Indra in the nominative, this vs. is syntactically untethered. It seems best to supply an
anodyne verb like “I call upon,” even though this cannot be generated from the
immediate context.
Note that the satrā of vs. 6 has returned, though in a cmpd.
IV.17.9–10: This sequence of vss. is marked by initial ayám ‘this one here’ (9a, 9c,
10a, 10b; cf. also asyá 9d). This near-deictic pronoun may indicate that Indra is
currently present at the sacrifice. These vss. are also marked by present tense verbs
describing Indra’s characteristic and habitual activities -- in contrast to vs. 11, which
opens with an imperfect (sám … ajayat).

### IV.17.10  
The sense of ádha here is somewhat unclear and its position anomalous, as
it is generally, though not invariably, clause-initial. Klein (DGRM II.97) notes its
medial position but considers it to have the usual sense he assigns to ádha, namely
‘therefore’. This passage is reminiscent of VII.34.2 śṛṇvánty ā́po ádha kṣárantīḥ,
where ádha likewise appears mid-clause and before a pres. participle (as well as after
a form of √śru, though act., not pass. as here). My sense is that ádha in both passages
introduces a participial addition that clarifies or modifies the sense of the main verb,
hence a sort of mini-clause.
In pāda b the lexeme prá kṛṇute with its middle voice in my opinion encodes a
complex thought: in battle Indra brings the (enemies’) cows forward in such a way as
to make them his own, that is, to capture them. Med. kṛṇuté recurs in the next pāda,
where its object is Indra’s own battle-fury (manyúm).

### IV.17.11  
The stem aśvi
yá- with suffixal accent is ordinarily a PN; the adj. ‘equine’ is
regularly áśv i
ya-. However, as noted by AiG II.2.816 the accent of -ya- derivatives is
variable, often within the same stem. The initial-accented áśvya- in the plural
generally modifies maghā́(ni) or rā́dhāṃsi. Here I am inclined to supply maghā́ni
‘bounties’ suggested by adjacent maghávā; cf. … maghā́ni maghávā in 8d and the
repeated forms of maghávan- in this portion of the hymn (7d, 8d, 9b, 13b, 13d).
The referent of pūrvī́ḥ isn’t clear. Ge (/WG) supplies ‘fortresses’, which in
turn requires supplying a transitive verb: Ge “der viele (Burgen erobert hat)”; WG
“der ja viele (Palisaden besiegte).” I would prefer not to supply so much material.
Moreover, in this group of hymns pūrvī́ḥ is used in temporal expressions: IV.16.19
kṣapáḥ … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “through many nights and autumns,” IV.18.4 sahásram
mā́saḥ … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “for a thousand months and many autumns,” IV.19.8
pūrvī́r uṣásaḥ śarádaś ca “through many dawns and autumns.” I therefore take it that
way here, as a temporal expression in a nominal rel. cl. with maghávā as the
predicate.
60

### IV.17.12  
The exact sense of ádhy eti is not entirely clear. It generally means ‘study’
from the literal meaning ‘go over’ (matching the English idiom exactly), but shows
various semantic developments: ‘give thought to, take cognizance of, be mindful of,
trouble oneself with’, etc. In all cases, the lexeme ádhi √i has a mental sense (though
III.54.9 has a secondary literal reading): I.71.10, 80.15; III.54.9; V.44.13; VII.56.15;
VIII.83.7, 91.3; IX.67.31, 32; X.33.7, 32.3, 100.4. Here I think we should read the
expression in the light of vs. 4, with its apparent uncertainty about Indra’s parentage
-- esp. given 4a janitā́and 4c yáḥ … jajā́na, matched here by janitúr yó jajā́na.
I take the rel. cl. of cd with the following vs. The two share the verb íyarti,
and 12cd can serve as the cause of 13a: when Indra raises a tempest, he destroys the
man’s peace.
I take muhukaíḥ as a temporal adverbial instr., expressing how suddenly Indra
can erupt -- even though I have revised my view on muhuké in the preceding hymn
(IV.16.17 -- see comm. there). I do not think “raises his tempest with/by sudden
skirmishes” is what is meant here.

### IV.17.13  
samóham is derived by Gr (/MonWms) from sám √ūh ‘push together’. But
√ūh does not have a full-grade oh in Vedic and is plausibly related to √vah (see
EWA s.v., with lit.). Better to analyze as sa-móham and derive it from √muh ‘be
confused’. The same analysis should probably be applied to the differently accented
samohé in I.8.6.

### IV.17.14  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. and its pendant, the single pāda of vs.
15, are quite unclear, though at least 14ab concerns the Etaśa myth. There are also
some formal issues.
The med. part. sasṛmāṇá- must belong to the pf. stem, despite its -mānásuffix appropriate to a thematic stem. This is the only such form, beside
conventionally formed pf. part. sasrāṇá- (2x). Narten (1969: 81–82 = KlSch 128)
explains the aberrancy as a quirk of the poet, who in this and adjacent hymns shows a
penchant for -māna- participles. Another question is what is its value. Most pf.
participles have anterior sense, but the publ. tr. renders it as “as he ran” -- in other
words as an action simultaneous with the main verb. And I might be inclined to make
this simultaneity more overt by tr. “as he was running.” Kü’s interpretation (552) as
what he calls “resultativ” and I would call anterior is more in line with the perfect
form: “wenn er seinen Lauf gemacht hat.” But contextually that would be puzzling:
what is the point of bringing the horse to a halt if it’s already finished running. And
on p. 602 he provides a diff. tr., closer to mine: “der sich im Lauf befindet.” WG
seem to take it almost as an inchoative -- “der sich in Lauf gesetzt hat” -- but cite
alternative translations in their n. I would suggest that the aberrant shape and the
aberrant sense are connected and that the poet created a nonce present-like pf. part. to
convey the simultaneous and progressive value he was seeking to express, since
regular pf. participles often express anteriority. (This, howver, does not explain why
61
the poet didn’t just use a pres. part. built to the redupl. pres. sísarti, here *sísratam;
this act. part. is attested once.)
The second hemistich is quite obscure. Old suggests reading kṛṣṇé against the
Pp. kṛṣṇáḥ, and this has met general acceptance. The apparently parallel loc.
ásikhyām ‘on the dark (FEM.)’ in 15a supports this reading, and it goes naturally with
the locatives in 14d.
Who is the referent? Ge gives no hint of what he might think, but Kü and WG
both think the subj. is Indra, who is acting on/against Etaśa. Judging from Kü’s tr.
(“er ‘träufelt’ ihn [den Vajra] wütend auf das schwarze (Pferd)”; 602), he thinks the
verb ‘sprinkle’ (jigharti) is a euphemism for violent action; its unexpressed obj. is
Indra’s vájra, which Indra ‘sprinkles’ onto the black (horse, namely Etaśa), while
WG understand Etaśa himself as the object. For both, the part. juhurāṇáḥ belongs
with √hṝ ‘be angry’ (flg. Insler 1968; see EWA s.v. HARI
), which can capture Indra’s
mood in this encounter. (Note that the poet was not tempted here to give the redupl.
part. a thematic suffix, pace Narten.) By contrast, I accept the traditional association
of the part. with √hvṛ ‘go crookedly’. I take the referent here to be Agni. Although
the Kü / WG view that it is Indra would be the default interpr. in this Indra hymn, the
phraseology of pāda d is almost identical to a pāda in an Agni hymn in this maṇḍala:
IV.1.11ab sá jāyata prathamáḥ pastyā̀su, mahó budhné rájaso asyá yónau “He was
born first in the dwelling places, at the base of this great realm, (as) his womb....”
And ‘moving crookedly’ qualifies Agni very well. The simile comparing the subject
here to a Hotar in vs. 15 also supports Agni as referent -- though I suppose it could
be argued that since Agni is often identified as a Hotar he need not be compared to
one. The part. juhurāṇáḥ ‘going crookedly’ is also appropriate to Agni, describing
the unpredictable movements of fire and the flickering movement of its flames.
But what is it that Agni (if he is indeed the subj.) is doing? This may be
illuminated (however faintly) by two other verbal forms to ā́√ghṛ in the RV (the adj.
ā́ghṛṇi- ‘glowing, ardent (?)’ belongs to the etymologically separate root √ghṛ ‘be
warm, hot’ found in gharmá- ‘heat’, etc. See comm. ad VI.53.3). In X.6.4 Agni
sprinkles the gods (ā́jigharti devā́n) as Hotar; in V.48.3 Agni (by my interpr.)
sprinkles a vájra. Although in both passages most interpr. attempt to make the verb
mean something other than ‘sprinkle’ (see comm. ad locc.), in fact a naturalistic
explanation is not hard to construct using the literal meaning of the verb: Agni
“sprinkles” the objects in question with sparks, a literal “baptism by fire.” That Agni
is elsewhere the object of √ghṛ, being sprinkled with ghee (see II.10.4), makes this
the kind of paradoxical reversal that RVic poets so much like. Here notice that Agni
performs this action “like a Hotar performing sacrifice” (vs. 15 yájamāno ná hótā),
as in X.6.4. The image is both of a properly sacrificing priest performing the ritual
action of sprinkling (the fire with ghee) and of the ritual fire sending out a stream of
sparks, like sprinkled drops, which would be quite visible on the dark background
insistently mentioned in this vs. What the object is that he is sprinkling remains
obscure to me – but in addition to the possibilities I suggest in the publ. tr. and those
of others mentioned above, it might be Indra’s vájra, as suggested by Kü (see above),
though with a different sense of the verb than Kü suggests. Recall that in V.48.3
62
Agni sprinkles Indra’s vájra-with sparks as a sort of ritual sanctification before Indra
employs it.

### IV.17.15  
I supply ‘hide’ with ásiknyām on the basis of tvácam ásiknīm in IX.73.5 (so
also Ge), though WG supply ‘night’ instead.

### IV.17.16  
Ge supplies a verb (“we call”) in ab; WG take ā́cyāvayāmaḥ in d as the
verb of both hemistichs, not just the 2nd. My interpr. is similar to WG’s, but with a
further twist. I take vājáyantaḥ in b as a pun. The sense ‘seeking prizes’ is supported
by parallel gavyántaḥ … aśvāyántaḥ … / janīyántaḥ “seeking cows, seeking horses,
seeking wives,” even though the denom. ‘seeking prizes’ is ordinarily accented on
the denom. suffix as vājayá-. By contrast vājáya- is usually transitive in the meaning
‘incite, rouse’, and it can be so here, with índram as object.

### IV.17.17  
Ge (/WG) take the pf. part. dádṛśānaḥ as a mere attributive adj. with āpíḥ
(“visible friend”), while I give it a more verbal sense. If my reflexive ‘showing
yourself’ seems too strong, I would still prefer a participial ‘being seen as / becoming
visible’ to a straight adjective. Once again, we are hoping for Indra’s epiphany on the
ritual ground.
In d in the publ. tr. I take kártā independently and construe ulókam as obj. of
the part. uśaté (“longing for wide space”) against Ge (/WG). I now see that this is
wrong, as the parallel expressions with kártā … ulókam show (VI.23.3, VII.20.2).
Both of those passages also have a dat. of benefit, vīrā́ya and sudā́se respectively, but
neither of those datives is capable of governing an acc. I would therefore emend my
tr. to “maker of wide space for the man who longs (for it), conferring vitality.” As
this emended tr. shows, I still think ulókam can be secondarily taken as the obj. of
uśaté. This same part. uśaté can also serve as dat. of benefit with vayodhā́ḥ. Note the
dat. stuvaté with váyo dhāḥ in the next vs. (18b).

### IV.17.18  
Though I am in agreement with Ge (/WG) that cakṛmā́‘we have acted’
refers to ritual action, I see no reason to supply an obj. (e.g., Ge “das Opfer”).

### IV.17.19  
Ge’s rendering of ab is not grammatically possible: he takes the
subordinate clause as beginning with yád and continuing till the end of b (“weil er ja
allein die vielen Feinde erschlägt”), but hanti is unaccented and must therefore
belong to the main clause -- despite his rather casual dismissal of the problem (n.
19b). My tr. takes yád dha vṛtrā́as a self-contained subord. clause, with a verb
(‘smashes’) to be supplied. Perhaps better is WG’s interpr. of the same sequence as a
nominal clause with vṛtrā́as nominative subj.: “wenn es ja Widerstände gibt.” I
might emend my tr. to “Indra is praised as the bounteous one; when there are
obstacles, he alone smashes (them, though they are) many and unopposable.”
## IV.18 Indra
For general discussion of my interpr. of this hymn, see publ. intro.
63

### IV.18.1  
With Ge and others, I assign this vs. to Indra’s mother, not to the poet or a
narrator.
Note the precative janiṣīṣṭa, on which see Narten (Sig.Aor., 118). Though this
is the only prec. form to this stem in the RV, others are found in other Vedic texts.
The periphrastic caus. páttave kaḥ (on which see Zehnder, Periphr.Kaus. 23
and passim) is generally taken as a euphemism for ‘cause to die’, but the root √pad
‘fall’ is regularly used of miscarriage (cf. my Hyenas [1991], 202-4), which fits this
context well. Of course a miscarriage in ancient India could well also have meant
death for the mother.
The root aor. injunc. kaḥ is perfectly ambig. between 2nd and 3rd sg. The latter
fits the previous pāda, where the fetus Indra is spoken of in the 3rd ps., but 2nd sg.
would anticipate the upcoming dialogic context, with Indra speaking of himself in the
1st ps. in vs. 2. Since English forces us to make a choice, I have chosen 2nd sg., contra
Ge and most other tr.

### IV.18.2  
Most tr. render durgáhā merely as ‘bad passage’ vel sim. (Ge “eine übler
Durchgang”), but the word is associated with words meaning ‘deep’ (of water, inter
alia, whether it should be derived from √gabh or √gah [on which see EWA s.v.
gáhana, GĀH]). And given that Indra is rejecting vaginal birth, that is, a downward
trajectory, in favor of coming out sideways, a more precise tr. seems desirable: a
“plunge” down through the birth canal and out is what he seems to want to avoid.
Note the otherwise identical 1st sg. subjunctives nír ayā and nír gamāni, built
to root pres. (√i) and root aor. (√gam) respectively. Surely some nuance of
tense/aspect is being conveyed here; I wish I knew what. (An English rendering with
a pres. progressive versus a straight eventive, “I will not be coming out from there; I
will come out crosswise …,” might capture something of the sense, with the
progressive expressing deliberative possibilities and the eventive the ultimate
choice.)

### IV.18.3  
It is generally agreed that pāda b contains another snatch of Indra’s speech.
The question is how to interpr. the double ná ná that opens the pāda. The first ná can
be taken as an independent assertion -- “No!” -- followed by an amplification of that
assertion, nā́nu gāni “I will not follow.” In that case the positive statement ánu nū́
gamāni “I will now follow” represents a contradiction of the first and is an indication
of the new-born Indra’s wavering mind. Such seems the interpr. of WG, for example.
However, as Old points out, a double negative can instead express an emphatic
positive. Such is the interpr. of Ge, and I follow it here, in part because I think the
point is that Indra was decisive from the moment of conception.
Like 2ab, this pāda contains two parallel 1st sg. subjunctives, ánu gāni and
ánu .. gamāni, though in this case they are both built to root aorists, but to two
different roots. Again, I don’t know what differential semantic nuance is being
expressed (if any). Here the poet may simply be striving for euphony: note the
pleasing phonological patterning in ná nā́nu gāni ánu nū́gamāni.
64

### IV.18.4  
As Old discusses, the sequence sá ṛ́dhak must contain underlying sā́, not,
with Pp., sáḥ.

### IV.18.5  
The standard tr. all construe svayám with what follows, átkaṃ váśāna(ḥ) --
e.g., Ge “selbst sein Gewand umlegen” -- on the basis of svayám átkaiḥ in II.35.14
(which I render differently). But surely what is most remarkable here is that a newborn stood up by himself; the self-swaddling would also be surprising but would
simply follow from the first feat.
IV.18.6–9: For my interpr. of the speakers in these vss. and the role of the waters in
the myth, see publ. intro. Most tr. take the vss. as all spoken by Indra’s mother (Ge
[/WG], Doniger), whereas I distribute them to a variety of voices: 6 Indra, 7 Indra’s
mother, 8 waters, 9 Indra’s mother. As I see it, in 6 Indra prompts his mother to ask
the waters questions; in 7 she rather sarcastically and belittlingly asks questions
about them, whom she seems to accuse of trying to lay claim to her son. They
respond directly to him in 8, reminding him of his mother’s dereliction of maternal
duty and suggesting that they are better at mothering him than she is. So that she
rather defiantly points out in 9 that subsequent negative things that happened to him
were not her fault.

### IV.18.6  
As suggested in the publ. intro., the (real) waters in the amniotic sac that
“break” right before birth and the (mythological) waters confined by Vṛtra and
released by Indra are conflated here. Indra may be speaking from within the womb
about the waters there battering the womb itself for release, though the waters in the
Vṛtra myth would not be far from the audience’s mind. If Indra the fetus is immersed
in these amniotic fluids, their sloshing sounds would surround him -- and it would be
appropriate to ask his mother what they are saying.
The simile in b, ṛtā́varīr iva saṃkróśamāṇāḥ “like truthful women together
shouting their witness” may have a quasi-legal resonance. The root √kruś is later
used for raising a hue and cry on witnessing a crime (vel sim.), such as a Rākṣasa
abduction (see my Sacr.Wife 233). Configuring the waters as truthful and articulate
witnesses in this pāda leads directly to the suggestion in the next pāda that they
should be asked what they are saying.
IV.18.6–7: The responsive phrases kím … bhananti (6c) and kím … bhananta (7a)
provide a textbook case of -anta replacement. See my 1979 IIJ 21 article, pace
Gotō’s (1st Kl., 222) characterization of bhananta as “reziprok.”

### IV.18.7  
As just noted, I think that this vs. expresses Indra’s mother’s suspicions
about the waters’ alienation of Indra’s filial affection for her. In pāda a she interprets
the waters’ speech, about which Indra asked her in vs. 6, as invitations to him (to join
them and abandon her, presumably). In b the charged word avadyá- ‘disgrace’ recurs
from 5a, where the mother considered Indra to be “like a disgrace / somehow a
65
disgrace” and concealed him. Here she suggests that the waters are, in contrast, eager
to assume his disgrace. In context this seems almost like an accusation that the
waters are so perverse that in their pursuit of him they are willing to assume any evil
that attaches to him. In fact, this is probably an allusion to the well-known concept
that waters cleanse transgressors of their transgressions (cf., e.g., I.23.22–24). Indra
would automatically acquire blood guilt from his killing of Vṛtra (on Indra’s
kilbiṣāṇi ‘sins’ and resulting impurity, see my Hyenas, 62–68, also vss. 12–13 below).
(The interpr. of his ‘disgrace’ here as arising from his killing of Vṛtra goes back to
Sāy. See Ge’s n. 7b.)
In any case, in the 2nd hemistich Indra’s mother goes on to assert the primacy
of her relationship with Indra and thus her indirect role in his glorious deed, the
slaying of Vṛtra. The fronted máma ‘mine’ makes this claim esp. strong.

### IV.18.8  
The waters throw this emphatically fronted máma back at her, with four
fronted occurrences of mámat, which is, as Ge clearly argues, a nonce ablative sg. of
the 1st sg. pronoun, a blend of gen. máma and abl. mát. To interpret it as an adv. (Gr
“bald-bald’ and see lit. cited by Old) is to ignore the rhetorical responsion in this
section of the hymn. In my interpr. of the verse each pāda is spoken by a different
though undifferentiatable representative of the waters. The first two pādas counter
Indra’s mother’s boast in 7cd about her son’s great deed with reminders that she, not
any of them [=waters], is responsible for transgressing against this same son. Both
pādas begin mámac caná “not because of me.” In the second hemistich they take
credit for the good treatment Indra received and the way he thrived under it, each
beginning mámac cid “certainly because of me.” Putting the vs. in the mouth of
Indra’s mother, as most interpr. do, creates grave difficulties. Not only do the claims
in ab become incoherent, but it also requires that the young woman (yuvatíḥ) in pāda
a not be identical with Indra’s mother (despite 4a, 5a). A way out of that difficulty is
possible: pāda a could be in the 1st ps (“I, a young woman, cast you aside” -- the pf.
form parā́sa is compatible with a 1st sg.), but we then confront the problem that she
both accepts responsibility for what seems a misdeed and disclaims any reason for or
benefit from the action.
mamṛḍyuḥ is the only pf. form attested to √mṛḍ in all of Skt. (save for the
grammarians). Because of its isolation, it is difficult to interpr. the optative. Kü (374)
suggests it expresses the Potentialis der Vergangenheit. I might suggest rather that
has the value of past habitual (like Engl. “would [regularly] X”), though this is not a
normal use of the pf. opt in Vedic (on which see my “Where Are All the Optatives,”
2009). But I also think the transmitted form may be signaling something else entirely.
The indic. 3rd pl. pf. would be *mamṛḍuḥ. Its root syllable should scan long (like
*mṝḍá- and *mṝḍáya-, transmitted as mṛḍ) because of compensatory lengthening
from *mṛẓḍ). I wonder if the underlying form *mamṝḍur was remade as an optative
in order to ensure the necessary heavy syllable in the cadence. If it is a real optative,
however, note that it is spoken by a woman and its subjects are females,
demonstrating the association between the pf. opt. and women’s speech that I
discussed in the 2009 article.
66
In d the marvel of Indra’s standing up (right after birth) is repeated from 5c.
In 5 this was emphatically not his mother’s doing: she had hidden him away. A
watery foster mother seems to be claiming credit, one of those who showed mercy
and kindness to the child in the preceding pāda.

### IV.18.9  
If I am correct that Indra’s mother reclaims speech in this vs., she now
indicates that a risky moment in the Vṛtra battle wasn’t her fault. The opening
mámac caná “not because of me” returns from 8ab, and, so it seems to me, this
indicates that she implicitly agrees to the accuracy of the accusations in 8ab -- that
she did throw the baby aside and let evil birth swallow him.
In the VP ápa hánū jaghā́na the jaws are universally taken to be Indra’s (e.g.,
WG “hat … deine beide Kinnbachen abgeschlagen.” But I know of no account of the
Indra-Vṛtra battle when Indra’s jaws are attacked, and in fact several times it is
Vṛtra’s jaws: X.152.3 ví vrtrásya hán ̥ ū ruja “break apart the jaws of Vr̥tra”; I.52.6
vṛtrásya yád … nijaghántha hánvor indra tanyatúm “when you, Indra, struck your
thunder down upon the jaws of Vr̥tra.” I therefore think that the hánū here have to be
Vṛtra’s, but with a twist: this is not a proclamation of Indra’s triumphant blow, but
rather a dicey moment when Vṛtra was counter-attacking. Vṛtra has ‘pierced down’
Indra (nivividhvā́n) and is presumably coming in for the kill. What kind of kill? The
clue, in my view, is the preverb ápa ‘aside, away’. I suggest that Vṛtra is smashing
his own jaws aside, that is, moving his jaws apart to be able to swallow large prey.
Acdg. to various websites (e.g., http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-snakemyths.html), snakes’ jaws are not fused together but merely held together by stretchy
ligaments, an arrangement that allows them to open their jaws very wide. Just as
“Evil Birth” swallowed the baby Indra in 8b, here the arch-snake threatens to do the
same. But in the second half-vs. Indra reasserts his mastery and crushes his enemy.

### IV.18.10  
We return to the primal scene of Indra’s birth again, with a reiteration of
his mother’s abandonment of the new-born babe (here expressed as the “unlicked
calf” árīḷhaṃ vátsam, pāda c), forcing him out on his own -- though the description
of Indra as a strapping bull in ab makes him seem considerably less vulnerable.
The second hemistich lacks a main verb to govern the dat. pseudo-infinitive
caráthāya. Most tr. supply ‘let’ vel sim. I suggest that sasūva in pāda a ‘gave birth’
(√sū ‘give birth’) may carry over into cd, as a stand-in for the (non-existent, or at
least unattested) pf. to the homonymous root √sū ‘impel’.

### IV.18.11  
The plot gets a bit murky here. His mother, having sent him off alone in vs.
10, now follows him, with the fear that the gods are abandoning him. This seems to
happen much later, just before the Vṛtra battle and long after the birth and her own
abandonment of the baby. But, despite her fears about the other gods, Indra finds a
companion on his own -- Viṣṇu, who is not usually a party to the Vṛtra battle.
IV.18.12–13: See the publ. intro. for uncertainties about the interpr. of these vss. In
some sense they seem to enlarge on the theme of “Indra’s disgrace”
67
(índrasyāvadyám) in 7b -- the blood guilt Indra incurs from even sanctioned killing,
made far worse by the intra-family slaughter depicted in vs. 12. Which leads to
Indra’s extreme loss of status, isolation, and shunning by the other gods in the final
vs.

### IV.18.12  
In light of d, which describes Indra’s killing his father, the question in a,
“who made your mother a widow,” can only be answered “you did!”
The final word of the vs. pādagṛ́hya ‘having grasped him by the foot’ is
puzzling. It might seem to exclude Vṛtra as the victim (and as Indra’s father) since,
as a snake, he has no feet -- though it might be a way of indicating picking up a snake
by its tail. The only other occurrence of this cmpd gerund is in the desperately
difficult hymn X.27, vs. 4, where the context is similar and the referent does seem to
be Vṛtra.

### IV.18.13  
Indra gets the last word in this hymn and, having described his situation in
the direst of terms, ends with a note of hope and coming triumph: the falcon’s arrival
with the soma, to be treated (in even more enigmatic terms) in two nearby hymns,
IV.26–27. Since in our hymn the new-born Indra drank soma in Tvaṣṭar’s house (3c)
and presumably had a good dose of it before the Vṛtra battle, the falcon’s stolen
soma cannot be the primal soma, though it sometimes mythologically seems to
parallel the primal stealing of fire in the Prometheus myth.
A dog-cooker (śvapaca-) in later texts is a person living outside of societal
norms (cf., e.g., MDŚ III.92), grouped with those who have fallen from caste and so
forth.
Notice that Indra here finds no one to be merciful to him (ná … vivide
marḍitā́ram), in contrast to the merciful waters when he was a baby (8c).
Most take the dishonored wife to be Indra’s own, but no wife has intruded on
the family drama we’ve been observing. I assume rather that this is another reference
to his mother, who, now that she is a widow, receives slighting treatment.
IV.19. Indra

### IV.19.1  
As far as I can tell, this is the only ex. of nír √vr̥in the RV. In conjunction
with ékam it must mean something like ‘single out’, ‘pick out from a group’.

### IV.19.2  
The verb ávāsṛjanta lacks an overt object. This may be because it is middle,
in contrast to the generally transitive active to this stem; so most tr., incl. the publ. tr.
(“let go”). However, the -anta may be an -anta replacement of the usual type (see my
1979 IIJ article), and the verb form should be taken as a transitive equivalent to the
active, with unexpressed obj. Indra. (This is how Kulikov [-ya-pres., p. 289] takes it,
flg. a suggestion of Lubotsky’s -- though -anta replacement is not mentioned: “The
gods abandoned [Indra], like the feeble ones.”) I am of two minds. The situation
depicted is presumably the gods finking out on Indra when the Vṛtra battle looms;
this might suggest that we should supply Indra as object: English “let Indra down”
68
would be an almost exact match. But the simile jívrayo ná “like old/feeble (men)”
does not fit this scenario as well; it implies that their powers simply failed them.
They “let go” -- the stuffing just went out of them, as it were.
The usual problem with bhúvaḥ -- injunctive (so apparently Ge, also the publ.
tr.) or subjunctive (so apparently WG). I assume that this verb refers to what
happened after the event of pāda a: with the gods out of contention, Indra comes into
his own as the universal monarch (samrā́j-) and takes his true and proper place
(satyáyoni-). The use of -yoni- here is reminiscent of the passage in a nearby Indra
hymn, IV.16.10, where Indra is urged to sit down on his own yóni- (své yónau) so
that he can be recognized.

### IV.19.3  
The phrase abudhyám ábudhyamānaṃ suṣupāṇám “not to be awakened,
unawakening, gone to sleep” must be proleptic, expressing the state the serpent will
be in after Indra has done his work on him: ‘put to sleep’ and similar idioms are
standard euphemisms for death in Vedic, as in many languages (e.g., modern
English). See my “‘Sleep’ in Vedic and Indo-European,” Zeitschrift für vergl.
Sprachforschung (KZ) 96 (1982/83) 6-16. I do not think, pace most tr., that this
depicts a drowsy Vṛtra whom Indra woke up to fight. For further disc. see I.103.7
and comm. thereon.
The hapax aparván at the end of d is picked up by párvatānām at the end of
4d. (They are, of course, synchronically unrelated.)

### IV.19.4  
As noted above ad IV.16.14 this group of Indra hymns contains a set of
anomalously built medial participles to the roots √vaś ‘desire’ and √vas ‘wear’. Here
medial thematic uśámāna- is doubly unexpected: this root builds a root pres., with a
weak grade uś, but it is only active (with an extremely well-attested act. part. uśánt-),
save for three occurrences of athem. uśāná-. And there is no other trace of a 6th class
thematic present to account for the -māna-suffix. Neither of these anomalies seems
to me particularly serious or hard to account for. As for the middle voice, verbs of
desiring seem to fall naturally into the semantic realm of the middle voice, so that a
transfer of the participle would not be surprising. Moreover, if we take the redupl.
part. vāvaśāná- as belonging to a pf. of this root (contra Kü, who assigns all these
forms to √vāś ‘bellow’), there is a parallel formation with the same voice and same
meaning. As for the thematic suffix, Narten (MSS 16: 82 = KlSch 128) suggests that
this poet has a penchant for -māna-; if this explanation seems insufficient (and it
does to me -- what about uśāná- in IV.23.1 as well as numerous well-behaved athem.
middle participles in his oeuvre) -- one might point to the ambiguous 3rd pl. act.
uśánti (3x), which is presumably the 3rd pl. of the root pres., but could belong also to
a 6th class present. (However, I note that the three 3rd pl. forms are found only in I
and X.)
I take ójaḥ as an acc. of respect with the part.
Ge sees pāda d as reflecting the Winged Mountains story, but this doesn’t
seem evident to me.

### IV.19.5  
Pāda a presents some interpretational difficulties that I think can be resolved
by considering it an example of disharmony in a simile (see my 1982 IIJ article). I
take the verb abhí prá dadruḥ as belonging to √dṝ ‘split, burst’ (see below for
another possibility). In the simile jánayo ná gárbham it has transitive value, with the
object expressing the contents that has been burst out (not the container), hence “as
women (burst out) their embryo.” In the frame I take the mountains that ended the
previous pāda (4d) as the subject and the verb as intransitive: “they burst.” (This is
also Ge’s and WG’s interpr., as well as Kü’s [230].) Old suggests as another
alternative that the verb can be transitive, with mountains as subject and rivers as
object, but I would prefer to supply as little as possible. Old suggests yet another
possibility, that the verb actually belongs to the root √drā ‘run’. Although this does
not make sense for the simile (as Old notes), it could work for the frame -- though in
that case ‘rivers’ might be a better subject. In that case we would have a pun
separating the simile and frame (“[the rivers] ran [√drā], as women burst out [√dṝ]
their embryo”), rather than a mismatch of usages of a single lexical item. I prefer the
single-root solution.
The 2nd pāda also has a somewhat skewed expression. In this context we
would expect the entities that “went/drove forth all at once” to be the released waters,
who are certainly the topic of the 2nd hemistich. But instead it is ‘stones’ (ádrayaḥ).
Now this is probably, on the one hand, a particularly vivid image of the mountains
suddenly bursting and sending forth an explosion of stones, a rockslide. But on the
other hand, pāda-final ádrayaḥ produces a Jagatī cadence in a hymn that is otherwise
entirely Triṣṭubh. Old suggests (without great enthusiasm, as far as I can see) an
emendation to abl. *ádreḥ ‘from the stone’, which would fix both the meter and the
image. I wonder if ádrayaḥ is a poetic trick: we expect the subject *ā́paḥ ‘waters’ --
which would provide both the standard Vṛtra-myth denouement and a good Triṣṭubh
cadence -- and instead get a twist of both sense and meter.

### IV.19.7  
This vs. celebrates the fructifying liquid that Indra released by destroying
Vṛtra and depicts its effects on humans (specifically females)(ab), the landscape (c),
and livestock (d). The first hemistich is a cleverly constructed echo chamber, because
the females being made to swell (that is, get pregnant) there probably stand for the
waters, but are also compared to waters. In other words the waters are being
compared to waters, by way of the intermediate ‘unwed girls’ (agrúvaḥ). This is also
something of a dig at Vṛtra, who hadn’t managed to make them pregnant though he is
sometimes called their husband (cf., e.g., dāsá-patnī- ‘having a Dāsa as husband’ in
I.32.11, etc.). Indra’s role as their real husband is embodied in the final word of the
vs. dáṃsupatnīḥ (however we interpret the rest of it; see below).
In the simile nabhanvò ná vákvā(ḥ), vákva- belongs to the root √vañc ‘surge,
undulate, billow’. The stem nabhanú- is found only here and in V.59.7 and is
transparently a derivative of the root √nabh ‘burst, explode’. Old suggests the verbal
meaning ‘sich spalten’ with nominal ‘Spalt’(‘split, cleft’). However, in both passages
I think the nominal form refers not to the aftermath of the verbal action but rather to
70
the process -- the spurts sent forth by the explosion (rather like the stones in 5b). The
image is visually arresting (at least to me).
The sense of dhvasrá- in b also requires some discussion. The root √dhvaṃs
is variously glossed (e.g., EWA s.v. ‘zerstieben, zerstäuben, zerbröcklen’), but in my
view the ‘spray, scatter’ sense is far less prominent than ‘occlude’ (with smoke, dust,
or other concealing substance), a sense also found in derivatives like dhvasmán-
‘miasma, (clouds of) smoke’. Thus to my mind the adj. dvasrá- means in the first
instance ‘occluded, dusty’; I have pushed this slightly to ‘parched’, from something
like ‘dry as dust’. Ge’s “die dahinschwindenden” (dwindling away) conveys
something of the same sense of weakness and lack of fertility, but I don’t know how
he arrived at it.
ṛtajñā́ḥ is identified as a nom. sg. m. modifying Indra by Gr, so also Scar
(177). It can just as easily be an acc. pl. fem. modifying the young women / waters,
as Ge, WG, and the publ. tr. take it. Given that the waters in the adjacent hymn,
IV.18.6, are called ṛtā́varīḥ, the latter analysis seems preferable -- although it might
be even better to read it with both referents.
The publ. tr. analyzes dáṃsupatnī- as having a first member dáṃsu-, an
adjective ‘wondrous’ related to dáṃsas- ‘wondrous power’ (so Gr). However, the
prevailing interpr. is that it is either a cmpd dáṃ-supatnī- or a two-word sequence
dáṃ *supátnīḥ, with, in either case, a form of dám- ‘house’ (cf. dáṃpati-, pátir dán).
The complex is then to be rendered ‘having a good husband in the house’ vel sim.
Alternatively Ge (n. 7d) suggests that it might be a metathesis of *su-daṃpatnīḥ
(given without accent), which seems quite unlikely. Although I think the form plays
off dámpati-, I am still inclined towards the ‘wondrous’ interpr., because of the deeds
that have just been ascribed to Indra.

### IV.19.8  
The question in this vs. is what to do with gūrtā́(ḥ). The standard tr. take it
as modifying the temporal expression pūrvī́r uṣásaḥ śarádaś ca -- hence, e.g., Ge’s
“[v]iele gelobte Morgen und Herbste.” This is grammatically fine and perhaps also
supported by the fact that the adj. is in the same pāda as the temporal expression.
Still, I am somewhat unsatisfied by this interpr. On the one hand, as Klein points out
(DGRV I.74), this small group of Vāmadeva Indra hymns contains three similar
temporal expressions (IV.16.19, 18.4, and here), and the only adjectives are
quantitative ones, so ‘welcomed, besung, praised’ would be an intrusion in the
formulaic language. Moreover, svágūrta- ‘self-greeted, i.e., gurgling’ is used twice
of rivers (I.140.13 síndhavaḥ, X.95.7 nadyàḥ), and something like that would fit
semantically here. The problem of course is that síndhu- is masc., and so gūrtā́ḥ
cannot modify acc. pl. síndhūn as the publ. tr. implies. It is possible that the
expression síndhavaś ca svágūrtāḥ in I.140.13 was transposed to our passage without
adjusting the gender. More likely is that the acc. pl. of another, feminne word for
rivers, streams, or waters should be supplied: nadyàḥ- as in X.95.7, sīrā́ḥ as in pāda c
of this vs., or apáḥ, the default watery referent in the Vṛtra myth. The tr. should be
emended to better reflect this: “… he set loose the welcomed [/gurgling]
*(waters/streams and) the rivers.” Strikingly svágūrta-, which occurs only 4x total in
71
the RV, appears two vss. later (10c) in the same metrical position with the same
sandhi form. It there modifies ápāṃsi ‘labors’. Is it too fanciful to suggest that that
phrase, svágūrtā, ápāṃsi, is meant to invoke *(svá)gūrtā, *apáḥ here? For further
disc. see also Old ad loc.

### IV.19.9  
As indicated in the publ. intro., the contents of this vs. and the reason for its
inclusion in this hymn are both deeply obscure, though the occurrence of the rare
stem agrū́- ‘unwed girl’ in 7a may have prompted the inclusion of the bizarre
anecdote in 9ab. As Ge's reff. for ab show, the shunned son of a maiden, the blind
man, and the lame man are mentioned together in II.13.12, 15.7, I.112.8; also
IV.30.16, 19. So, however ill-assorted, this is a set. The unfortunate son of an agrū́is
also mentioned in nearby IV.30.16, though there he is only shunned, not eaten by
ants.
On ukhachíd- see Scar (131).
Unfortunately I have nothing further to say about the sense of this vs. I have
toyed with the possibility that there’s a ritual reference here, to the taking out of the
offering fire from the householder’s fire and its removal to the east. But, though
there might be rough correspondence -- very rough -- between the first and third
parts, the middle part with the blind man and the snake doesn't work at all, as far as I
can see.

### IV.19.10  
Contra the standard tr. and interpr., I take āha as 1st sg. This is the
summary vs. of the hymn (with vs. 11 simply the Vāmadeva Indra refrain), and in
such vss. the poet often speaks in his own person or that of the group, referring to the
hymn that has just been recited. This vs. entirely fits that pattern. I also interpr. the
enclitic te not only as a genitive with the deeds, but also as a dative with the part.
vidúṣe, identifying Indra as the knowing audience. (And who better than Indra to
know his own deeds?)
āvidvā́n is one of the few forms of √vid ‘know’ cmpded with the preverb ā́in
the RV. It does not seem to have a clear nuance.
On svágūrta- see comm. ad VI.68.4.
## IV.20 Indra
The midsection of this hymn (vss. 5–8) has a surprising concentration of -tarstem nominals, both root- and suffix-accented.

### IV.20.1  
Note the patterned phonological repetition dūrā́d … āsā́d … yāsad, with the
1st two morphologically parallel (ablative sg.) and the last not (subjunctive, 3rd sg.).
To make the tr. clearer, “our” should be inserted before “help.” Otherwise it
sounds as if Indra needs to find help for himself.

### IV.20.2  
Again, “our” should be inserted before “help.”
72

### IV.20.3  
As Ge suggests, the imagery in the first hemistich seems to come from
chariot racing. Pāda b is identical to V.31.11d (save for the ps. of the verb), a verse
concerned with the chariot contest between Indra and the Sun. Putting smthg in front
must simply refer to placing it in the lead, but in a ritual context like this one, there is
interference between that sense and the ritual action of placing the offering fire to the
east, also expressed by purás √dhā and regularly represented by the epithet of Agni
puróhita-. But since Indra is never the agent of that ritual action and since it is the
fire, not the sacrifice, that is put in front ritually, the chariot race interpr. must be
primary here. In saying this, I find myself in disagreement with Bloomfield, who
says “The repeated pāda fits well in 4.20.3, is dubious in 5.31.11,” without
commenting on either the fit or the dubiousness.
The Engl. phrase “gain our intention” is somewhat awk. What saniṣyasi
krátuṃ naḥ means, I think, is that Indra’s action of putting the sacrifice in front will
cause him to win the race, which is what we want to happen. But objects of the root
√san are usually concrete (vā́jam, etc., as in vā́jasātau in 2d; cf. also sanáye
dhãnānām “to gain the stakes” in the next pāda) and also things that the grammatical
subject desires to win, so my suggested indirect benefit is somewhat anomalous. So it
is possible that “our krátu” that Indra will win is something he wants -- perhaps our
intention or resolve to sacrifice to him, not to other gods.

### IV.20.4  
The verb pā́(ḥ) opening the 2nd half-vs. should also be read with (or supplied
with) pāda b. Ge supplies “sei” for the first hemistich and construes the gen. phrase
in b with upāké. This is possible but, given the parallelism of the two genitive
phrases referring to soma in b and c, less likely.
Ge and WG take pṛṣṭhyà- lit. ‘related to the back’ as an adjective of (superior)
quality in a spatial metaphor -- the sense of “top” in Cole Porter’s “You’re the top”
or the adj. “tip-top.” Cf. WG’s “am erstklassigen Soma-Spross.” I think rather that
the adj. is meant literally to refer to the soma plant’s well-known growing place, the
back of the mountains (that is, the high slopes). Cf., e.g., V.36.2 rúhat sómo ná
párvatasya prṣṭ̥ hé “as the soma-plant grows on the back of the mountain.”

### IV.20.5  
In my opinion, the first half-vs. consists of two separate similes, the second
of which, sṛ́ṇyo ná jétā, needs to be fleshed out. In the first one Indra with his
abundant seers is like a tree with ripe fruit (vṛkṣó ná pakváḥ). In the second Indra the
winner/conquerer is like a man who harvests the fruit with a sickle -- or more likely
who harvests grain, the crop having subtly changed, with the pakvá- ‘ripened’ held
constant. Cf. X.101.3 nédīya ít srṇ̥ yàḥ pakvám éyāt “the ripe (grain) should come
even closer to our sickles.” For ripe grain see I.66.3 yávo ná pakvó jétā jánānām
“Ripe like grain, a conquerer of peoples,” which also contains jétar-, though in my
view in an independent syntagm.
The simile in the 2nd half-vs. is striking because it casts Indra as a maiden
(yóṣām), pursued by the poet as a dashing and virile young man (márya-, a word
sometimes applied to Indra) -- a notable gender reversal.
73
This vs. contains one of the few finite forms of the secondary root √rapś
‘teem, abound’, and 2c has an occurrence of the better-attested related possessive adj.
virapśín-. In the currently favored etym. the “root” √rapś was extracted ultimately
from the nominal virapśá- ‘abundance’ (the basis for virapśín-), itself constructed
from a dvandva of vīrá- ‘men’ and paśú- ‘beasts’ (see EWA s.v. virapśá-). It’s
important to note, however, that this etym. is soundly rejected by Kü (417–18),
though I still favor it. The two forms of the thematic pres. rapśa- (IV.45.1, X.113.2)
are both immediately preceded by the preverb ví, which (by most lights) has been
secondarily extracted from the cmpd. Our perfect form here, rarapśé, is also
construed with ví, but with yáḥ intervening, and the other pf. form (VI.18.12) lacks ví
but appears with prá in distant tmesis.

### IV.20.6  
The publ. tr. reflects the emendation of vájraṃ to *vrajáṃ, in concert with
Gr, Ge, Schmidt (B+I, 137), Lub, and, after some resistance, Old. The resulting
phrase ā́dartā *vrajám has a close parallel in VI.66.8 vrajáṃ dártā, as Ge points out.
Ge takes *vrajám as part of the simile and supplies Vala as the object in the frame:
“… erbricht wie einen festen Pferch (den Vala)…” But the position of the simile
marker ná speaks against this. I instead take *vrajám as a reference to Vala, with the
simile portraying the attack of a wild beast (bhīmáḥ) on a real pen (thus effectively
reading *vrajám twice and separating bhīmáḥ from Indra). For bhīmá- as a wild beast
see mṛgó ná bhīmáḥ (I.154.2, 190.3), siṃhó ná bhīmáḥ (IV.16.4 [nearby], IX.97.28),
etc. In their tr. WG keep the transmitted text and tr. “Der Furchtbare ist der die Keule
Stiebende (in den) … prallen (Pferch) …,” thus silently incorporating a *vrajám in
the final parenthesis (“Pferch”). I am also not certain what the VP “die Keule stieben”
would mean nor how (ā́) √dṛ can mean ‘stieben’. They acknowledge the generally
accepted emendation in their notes. Although I do not see an easy way to avoid this
emendation, I do not know how the corruption could have arisen, esp. given vrajám
apavartā́si in 8b. Still, vájra- is considerably more common than vrajá- and would
always be lurking in an Indra context.

### IV.20.7  
The rel. prn. yásya of the first hemistich serves as a modulation pivot from
the 3rd ps. of vs. 6 to the direct 2nd ps. address to Indra of 7cd.
On udvāvṛṣāṇáḥ see comm. ad VIII.61.7, where I reject the Neisser / Gotō /
Kü positing of a 2nd root √varṣ ‘sich ermannen’, etc. and assign it to √varṣ ‘rain’,
with the specialized meaning ‘boil up and over’, as an expression of irrepressible
energy. This image would work nicely here with the pen “overflowing with goods”
(vásunā nyṛ̀ṣtam) in the preceding vs. (6d).

### IV.20.8  
For brief and unilluminating comments on śikṣānará- see comm. ad I.53.2.
Here I prefer to read the loc samithéṣu with it rather than with what follows.
The root noun cmpd. prahā́- is discussed with care and insight by Scar (698–
700). The cmpd. is found in X.42.9 in a clear gambling context. Of the various
proposals Scar makes, I find most satisfying the one in which prahā́- is the
stakes/pool/kitty ‘left out in front’. The possessive adj. here would then mean ‘having
74
the jackpot’ and would fit with the gambling imagery in 3d śvaghnī́va … sanáye
dhánānām “like (a gambler) with the best throw to gain the stakes.” (Scar, however,
takes our particular passage in a different and, to me, unconvincing direction, p.
700.) The standard interpr. is ‘take the lead’ (e.g., Ge “den Vorsprung gewinnend”)
in a race, but I’m not sure how this meaning would develop from ‘leave’ and ‘forth’.

### IV.20.9  
Pāda a is a definitional one, with the precise type of ability (śácī-) possessed
by Indra giving him the designation ‘most able’ (śáciṣṭha).
Ge interprets múhu kā́cid as haplology for *muhukā́kā́cid (so also EWA s.v.
múhur, WG, and, somewhat differently, Old flg. Ludwig). Cf. nearby IV.16.17
kásmiñ cid … muhuké (also muhukaíḥ IV.17.12). I have come, somewhat reluctantly,
to the conclusion that this is correct. However, as noted in disc. ad IV.16.17, I do not
accept Ge’s rendering of muhuká- as ‘Schlachtgeschrei’, which produces for this
passage “… jedwedes Schlachtgeschrei hervorruft.” WG’s “… welches plötzlichen
Vorfälle auch immer erledigt” is, however, more plausible. In IV.16.17 I suggest a
sense ‘skirmish’, which works contextually there, but is here, I think, too specific. In
fact, the published tr., “does everything instantly,” can stand, for a literal Engl. “does
every instantaneous thing.”
The lexeme ví √ci means literally ‘pull apart’; an exactly parallel usage to this
one appears in VI.67.8 yuváṃ dāśúṣe ví cayiṣṭam áṃhaḥ (also cited by Ge), and the
notion of pulling apart / opening up a narrow place (áṃhaḥ) is very apposite. It
should also be noted, however, that the same lexeme is used in gambling contexts,
indeed in the very X.42.9 just cited for prahā́vant- in 8c. In gambling it means ‘pile
apart, pull out (a good hand)’. Although I don’t think that that idiomatic sense is
reflected here, I do think that the gambling overtones would resonate with the other
gambling vocabulary in this hymn.

### IV.20.10  
I do not understand the function of the initial prá in b. Gr indicates that it
belongs with dā́tave, and Keydana (Infinitive, p. 255) explicitly says that it must
belong with dā́tave and is therefore in tmesis. Though this is not impossible, I am
somewhat reluctant to accept this explanation in part because prá is relatively rare
with √dā. I wonder if it signals the lexeme prá √as ‘be present, be prominent’, with
the copula gapped. Fortunately, the interpr. chosen has almost no effect on the sense
of the pāda.
## IV.21 Indra

### IV.21.1  
As indicated in the publ. tr., this vs. bears some resemblance to the first vs.
of the preceding hymn: our first pāda ā́yātu índró ‘vasa úpa naḥ more or less
lexically matches IV.20.1ab ā́na índro … ávase yāsat. See also vs. 3 below.
The second hemistich is syntactically problematic; see Old’s extensive n. The
problem is that both nom. sg. vāvṛdhānáḥ and the gen. sg. rel. prn. yásya appear to
refer to Indra. Ge interprets yásya as a reflexive rel. (see n. 1c): “der erstarkt seine
vielen Kräfte,” but not only am I not aware of other reflexive uses of the relative, but
75
this tr. requires that the med. participle vāvṛdhāná- be transitive, which it is usually
not (though, to be fair, a reflexive transitive would probably require middle voice).
Although the publ. tr. is syntactically trickier (by cutting the pāda into two syntactic
pieces), it avoids both problems by taking the participle as a separate clause (“when
he has grown strong”) and the antecedent to yásya in a rel. clause that begins with
táviṣīḥ. In this interpr. táviṣīḥ … pūrvī́ḥ is nom., not acc. The relative also has
domain over the clause in d, with yásya limiting kṣatrám, which is taken as a nom.,
not acc. as in most tr. Ge’s “wie der Himmel seine überlegene Herrschaft entfalten
möge” also violates the standard construction of similes, by making the simile
clausal, with the verb púṣyāt in the simile seeming to correspond to the participle
vāvṛdhānáḥ in the frame. (WG’s tr. of d avoids this problem; their rendering is quite
similar to the publ. tr.)

### IV.21.2  
The nṛ́̄n in pāda b is problematic. It appears to be an acc. pl., and in fact is
an acc. in the same phrase tuvirā́dhaso nṛ́̄n in V.58.2 (referring to the Maruts). But
here the undoubted gen. sg. tuvidyumnásya immediately preceding (and
morphologically parallel to tuvirā́dhasaḥ) invites a gen. sg. reading also of
ambiguous tuvirā́dhasaḥ. This in turn presents us with several choices: 1) to take nṛ́̄n
as a real gen. sg., 2) to assume that the last two words were borrowed from V.58.2
(or based on the formula found therein) and not adjusted morphologically, so that nṛ́̄n
is functionally a gen. sg. but formally an acc. pl., or 3) to detach nṛ́̄n syntactically
from what precedes it. Old opts for option 2 (see disc. in ZDMG 55 [1901]: 745–47
= KlSch. 286–88). He assumes that since tuvirā́dhasaḥ can represent either acc. pl. or
gen. sg., when the formula in V.58.2 was imported here, nṛ́̄n could come along for
the ride, functioning as a gen. sg. though adopted from an acc. pl. environment. The
third tack is taken by Ge, who takes ṇṛ́̄n as a complement of gen. sg. tuvirā́dhasaḥ
(“des … gegen die Männer Freigebigen”), and by WG, somewhat differently. The
latter take nṛ́̄n as a second obj. of stavatha (besides vṛ́ṣṇyāni), with the two genitives
preceding it hanging off it and modifying Indra: “… seine stierhaften (Kräfte) sollt
ihr hier preisen, (und) die Männer des …” (A fourth option, a variant of 3, would be
possible: to take tuvirā́dhaso nṛ́̄n as the 2nd acc. obj., with only tuvidyumnásya a gen.)
Presumably the “men” WG have in mind are the Maruts, who do appear with Indra
in the very next vs. (marútvān 3c) and as just noted are the referents of the undoubted
acc. phrase in V.58.2. As for option 1, without endorsing this solution I would point
out that a variant of this might be possible. The expected gen. sg. to the root noun
*nṛ́-, based on comparison with Aves. nǝrǝš, should be monosyllabic *núr (like pitúr)
(see AiG III.212), *nuḥ in pausa. Clearly this brief and opaque form didn’t stand
much of a chance of preservation as such; but I wonder if, esp. in formulaic phrases
like tuvirā́dhaso *núḥ, it wasn’t substituted for by the acc. pl. nṛ́̄n, the only other
(surviving) monosyllabic form in the paradigm, whose affiliation to nṛ́- was much
clearer.
In d the verb abhy ásti ‘overwhelms’ picks up the nominal abhíbhūti-
‘overwhelming(ness)’ in 1d, with the substitution of √as for √bhū.
76

### IV.21.3  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. also recalls the opening vs. of the
preceding hymn. There the verb ā́… yāsat ‘he will drive here’ is construed with two
ablatives of place-from-which (near and far), plus ávase ‘for help’ + naḥ. Here ā́yātu,
also with ávase naḥ, is construed with no fewer than six ablatives of the same type,
elaborating on the near/far contrast to provide a universe of choices.
On púrīṣa- see comm. ad I.163.1.
Ge (/WG) take svàrṇara- as a PN, but this interpr. does not fit the pattern of
the vs., and moreover svàrṇara- as PN seems to be confined to Maṇḍala VIII. See
Mayrhofer (PN, s.v.), who also sees the name only in VIII.

### IV.21.4  
Ge takes gómatīṣu as referring to a particular river basin and WG to “cowrich (rivers)” -- the latter apparently flg. Gr’s “rinderreicher Ort.” But the mention of
Indra’s companion Vāyu here points to a ritual, not battlefield, victory, specifically
the morning pressing when Indra and Vāyu receive the first oblations. There are two
nouns that are regularly modified by gómati- in the fem. pl.: ‘dawns’ (uṣā́saḥ) and
‘refreshments’ (íṣaḥ). Either of them would work in this context. The publ. tr.
supplies the latter, functioning as a loc. absol.: “when (refreshments) consisting of
cows [that is, milk and butter] are at stake.” íṣ- does not have an attested loc. pl., and
if it did, it would not be pretty or easily recognized: *ikṣú? iṭṣú? It would therefore
not be surprising if such a form were gapped, with the final of the adj. (-īṣu)
gesturing towards it phonologically. However, it is also possible that “at the cow-rich
dawns” is meant, given that the ritual in question happens at that time. uṣás- also
lacks an attested loc. pl., though we should probably expect *uṣátsu (see my 1991
“Ox, Cart,” 90–91). Again, gapping this awkward form would not be surprising.

### IV.21.5  
I take ṛñjasāná- to be built to the anomalous 1st sg. middle ṛñjase (for which
see comm. ad IV.8.1), pace Jasanoff 2016 (etc.), based in part on the shared constr.
ṛñjas- GOD (acc.) HYMN (instr.) exemplified, e.g., by IV.8.1 yájiṣṭham ṛñjase girā́“I
aim towards the best sacrificer with a song” (cf. VI.15.1) and our ṛñjasānáḥ …
uktháiḥ … índram “aiming straight at Indra with hymns.” (In fact I would now favor
slightly changing the text of the publ. tr. to “aiming straight with his hymns” rather
than translating ukthaíḥ with the following pāda as in the publ. tr.) The creation and
maintenance of the stem ṛñjasāná- is supported by the other -asāná- secondary
participles, on which see comm. ad IV.3.6.
IV.21.6–8: As discussed in the publ. intro., the next few vss. are very challenging;
they have received multiple interpretations, which can’t be discussed in detail here.
The vss. form a unity based on their shared vocab. (e.g., góhe 6b, 7c, 8c; auśijásya 6b,
7c), their shared syntactic formulae (yád *ī 6a, yád īm 7a, 7c, and yád ī 8d), and their
shared metrical irregularity.

### IV.21.6  
As indicated in the intro., I think vs. 6 simultaneously depicts the gods’
approach to the ritual ground and the Aṅgirases’ journey to the Vala cave. The rock
77
(ádri-) to which they hasten is the pressing stone in the case of the gods and the Vala
cave in the case of the Aṅgirases.
In pāda a I interpret yádi as yád *ī, parallel to yád īm in 7a and 7c and yád(#)ī
in 8d. For this phenomenon, see my 2002 "RVic sīm and īm.” With Ge I take ádrim
as the goal of saraṇyā́n rather than construing it with sádantaḥ, allowing the latter
participle to be construed with the loc. góhe (a stem found only here, in the three vss.
6–8).
For dhiṣā́see comm. ad I.173.8 as well as I.3.2. The denom. dhiṣaṇyá- is
found only here; I take it as ‘seeking a holy place’, derived from dhiṣáṇā ‘holy place’,
on which see comm. ad I.3.2.
Note the phonetic echoes in dhiṣā́ya(di) dhiṣaṇyán(taḥ) (sar)aṇyā́n.
As indicated in the publ. intro. I take auśijá-, the vṛddhi deriv. of uśíj- ‘priest,
fire priest’, as referring to the collectivity of these priests (see also V.41.5). It seems
to be parallel to / contrastive with the vṛddhi deriv. in the next pāda, pāstyá-, found
only here, ‘belonging to the dwelling place’. In my interpr. the duróṣāḥ hótā is Agni,
and pāstyá- refers to the collectivity that he belongs to or represents, that of the
household.
On the problematic duróṣāḥ (here apparently an -s-stem, as opposed to the
thematic stem found in the two other occurrences), see comm. ad VIII.1.13.

### IV.21.7  
Another very opaque vs. The only thing we have to hold onto is structure:
the X-ā yád īm of pādas a and c recalls X-ā́yád *ī of 6a, and notice X yád dhi(yé) in
pāda d. The whole vs. is a subordinate clause (or series of them), continued by 8ab,
with the main clause in 8c -- and a final yád(#)ī clause rounding out the sequence in
8d.
As indicated in the publ. tr., I think vs. 7 depicts the bursting into flames of
the ritual fire, whose difficult kindling was (possibly) treated in 6cd. This bursting
into flames is expressed by śúṣmaḥ ‘explosive force’ in 7b. The gen. bhārvarásya
vṛ́ṣṇaḥ ‘devouring bull’ refers to Agni, in this interpr.; the only two forms to the
(pseudo-)root √bharv ‘devour’ have Agni as their subj. (I.143.5, VI.6.2). In the publ.
tr. I also tentatively took Agni as the referent of īm, but I now think that the īm in
pāda a refers to the praiser in b, while the īm in c refers to the Aṅgirases. (Remember
that number is neutralized in īm.) The point is that the śúṣma- of the kindled fire
accompanies each of these in order to allow the desired outcomes expressed in pāda
b and d to occur -- the singer to receive his reward and the Aṅgirases to cause the
cows to come out of the Vala cave. (I am tempted to tr. a version of “may the force
be with you.”) So I would modify the tr. to “When … the force … accompanies him
[=singer], for the singer to take his reward; when it accompanies them [=Aṅgirases]
to the secret place [=Vala cave], … for (the cows) to go forth …” In d I take the three
datives (prá) dhiyé (prá) áyase mádāya not as triply parallel, but make the first and
last further complements to áyase ‘to go forth’. The two prá’s would in some sense
structure these two parallel goal expressions: “to go <forth to insight>, <forth to
exhilaration>.”
78
Needless to say, it is impossible to be certain about this interpr., but at least it
hangs together.

### IV.21.8  
Note the play in the pāda-initial sequences: ví yád (a), vidád (c), yádī v(…)
(d).
As noted in the publ. intro., this last vs. of this obscure three-vs. group is the
clearest indication of a Vala-myth subtext in the triad and thus serves as a species of
poetic repair. As just noted ad vs. 7, the syntactic construction continues from vs. 7
and therefore indicates that the verses should be interpreted within the same
conceptual framework. The vs. contains clear Vala vocabulary (esp. vidát) but leaves
both subject and objects unexpressed, therefore allowing the double reading that I
also suggested for vss. 6 and 7, namely that of the Vala myth and of the current ritual.
Although the reference is clearer in this vs., the grammar is another matter.
The major problem lies in the two parallel verbs vṛṇvé and jinvé. Both appear to be
1st sg. middle presents to the stems 5th cl. vṛṇóti, vṛṇuté* and 1st cl. jínvati, -te
respectively (so Gr, e.g.). However, Whitney and Macdonell group jinvé instead with
the marginally attested 5th cl. pres. (RV 1x jinóṣi ‘bring to life’ V.84.1), which would
account better for the accent -- and a 5th cl. pres. must of course ultimately underlie
thematized jínvati (see Gotō, 1st Kl., 76). But 1st singulars do not fit the context at all,
nor really do presents. Old tr. them both as 3rd sg. preterites (“er … enthüllte …
belebte …”) with, frustratingly, no comment. In this interpr. he seems to be
following (or at least be in agreement with) Sāy., and the publ. tr. reflects the same
analysis, though with a historical present interpr. because of the apparent primary
ending -é. Ge and WG take them as reflexive (Ge) / passive (WG), with neut. pl.
subjects várāṃsi … jávāṃsi (e.g., Ge “Wenn sich die Breiten des Berges auftun,”
etc.). Like Old, Ge keeps silent about the grammar, but WG identify the two verbs as
3rd sg. statives construed with the neut. pl. as subject. I am torn. On the one hand, it is
difficult to wring a standard 3rd sg. of the type I want from the forms in the text. On
the other, I am very dubious about the existence of the “stative” -- and even if this
had been a separate grammatical category in the prehistory of Vedic, I doubt that it
would have surfaced in just these two nonce forms in a single passage. Moreover,
there is nothing semantically or functionally “stative” about either of these verbs,
“open up” / “quicken,” either in isolation or in this passage; note that even in the
passive the WG tr. are overtly eventive: “… aufgeschlossen werden … belebt werden”
(my italics). I also think that the mythic model found in the passage is against a
reflexive or passive interpr. In the other standard depictions of the Vala myth, the
opening of the mountain and the flowing out of cows/waters/dawns, are not events
that happens spontaneously; the god Indra (/Bṛhaspati) or the Aṅgirases cause these
actions. The 3rd sg. vidát ‘he found’ of 8c, a signature verb in the Vala myth, shows
the typical pattern of expression in this myth. I therefore, uncomfortably, stand by
the 3rd sg. transitive interpr. of these verbs, without being able to account for their
form. They do belong to a little morphological pattern in 5th class presents, where 3rd
sg. -é is not uncommon: cf. śṛṇvé, sunvé, hinvé. But unfortunately all three of the just
cited forms are passive, and, in my reading, vṛṇvé and jinvé are not.
79
The neut. pl. várāṃsi in pāda a I take as a pun. The stem váras- definitely
means ‘wide space’ and is of course related to urú. However, as the object of √vṛ
‘enclose’ (+ ví = ‘unenclose, open’) and coming so soon after saṃváraṇeṣu (6d) ‘in
the enclosures’, it is not difficult to imagine that it could temporarily acquire a
secondary association with √vṛ -- hence my double tr. “opens out the … enclosures
into wide spaces.”
I supply ‘cows’ as the first obj. of vidát on the basis of the use of this verb
with obj. gā́ḥ in the Vala myth elsewhere (e.g., I.62.3=X.68.1, II.19.3; note also the
bovine vocab. gaurásya gavayáya in the rest of the pāda), but in keeping with my
double reading of this whole passage also supply ‘goods’ as the desired discovery in
the ritual context.
The sudhyáḥ ‘those of good insight’ are probably, with WG, the Aṅgirases in
the Vala myth, but I would add that this word would also identify the poets/priests at
the ritual, in the double reading of this triad of verses that I favor.

### IV.21.9  
It is with considerable relief that we return to Indra.
In c I tr. kā́te níṣattiḥ -- lit. “What is this sitting down of yours?” -- more
idiomatically, to convey the exasperation of the singer.
The sequence kím u nó …, kíṃ nód-ud u …is playful and, probably for that
reason, somewhat difficult to parse. The nó in the first part of the phrase appears in
the Pp. as no iti. Although normally a final -o of this type, generally found on the end
of function words, represents -ā/a plus the particle u (see Klein, Part. u, 168–78),
Klein specifically lists this passage (168 n. 3) as a case where the presence of u is
unlikely because “the syntactic environments within which u is found do not appear.”
It is easy to see why he came to that judgment, esp. because there’s an u almost
immediately preceding it and the 2nd u would come very late in the syntactic complex.
However, it is difficult to see what else to make of it, and the almost mirror image in
the next pāda, where there’s a coalescence of ná + úd into nód and an even later u
following the complex of kím NEG PREV, suggests that the poet is having a bit of fun
with u. Given the colloquial tone of this hemistich, we may also be seeing a looser
deployment of particles and “little” words characteristic of ordinary speech. (And
who can resist the lilt of nód-ud u?) The multiplication of u’s is completed by a form
of the notorious -tavā́u infinitive at the end of d.

### IV.21.10  
This last vs. before the refrain shows some ring-composition with the
beginning of the hymn: samrā́ṭ (a) and krátvā (c) respond to krátuḥ ... samrā́ṭ in 2c.
In pāda a satyáḥ ‘real, really here’ may signal Indra’s epiphany at the sacrifice.
## IV.22 Indra
Hoffmann treats and translates the first four vss. of this hymn (Injunk. 186–
88) as an ex. of “die erwähnende Beschreibung eines präteritalen Tatbestandes”
associated with the general description of a god. He notes the unclear boundaries
between past and present in such contexts.
80

### IV.22.1  
This vs. propounds a novel version of divine-human interaction: it suggests
that what a god wants from us -- the verbal and material offerings we make to him at
the sacrifice -- he actually arranges to have available there. There seems no other
way to read the ā́√kṛ ‘make (to be) here, bring here’ in b (… karat … ā́). This model
almost reduces the human role to being middlemen in a loop connecting the god with
himself, in contrast to the usual reciprocal model in which each side (divine / human)
makes its own contribution.
In d éti appears to be used as an auxiliary with the participle bíbhrat (so also
Hoffmann, with ref. to Delbrück, AiS 390), though Ge seems to take it as a full
lexical verb (“… tragend auszieht”). Engl. “goes on X-ing” captures both the literal
sense and the auxiliary function of the verb here.

### IV.22.2  
The hapax vṛ́ṣandhi- has been variously explained. Old rejects the reading
as “sinnlos” and suggests an emendation to *tríṣandhi-, remarking that the vajra is so
described in AV XI.10.3, 27. The influence of preceding vṛ́ṣā would account for the
change. Hoffmann (MSS 8 [1956]: 15 = Aufs. II.395–96) instead suggests it is a
haplology of vṛ́ṣa-saṃdhi- ‘mit starker Verbindung’, which in his view describes the
binding of the head of the vajra, which he thinks was a hammer-like weapon, to the
shaft. One of the unexamined assumptions of both Old’s and Hoffmann’s
interpretations is that the weapon referred to here is the vajra and that this is identical
to the stone (áśman-) in 1d. As I argue ad I.152.2 (see comm. thereon), there is no
reason to assume here that the stone = vajra or that the unnamed weapon in 2a is
identical to both. A form of vájra- is found in 3c, but it need not be the same as the
weapon(s) referred to in 1d and 2a -- and in fact there is some reason to believe it is
not, as the weapon here is being ‘hurled’ (ásyan), and to my knowledge the vajra is
never thrown while stones regularly are (e.g., I.172.2). In my opinion the weapon in
2a is the stone of 1d and the qualifier vṛ́ṣandhi- is a formation like iṣu-dhí-
‘repository of arrows, quiver’, uda-dhí- ‘repository of water, spring, basin’, utsa-dhí-
‘fountainhead’ — hence ‘repository of bullish(ness)’. The difference in accent can be
attributed to the influence of immediately preceding vṛ́ṣā. The combining form
vṛ́ṣan-, rather than more common vṛ́ṣa-, is also found in vṛ́ṣaṇvant- and vṛ́ṣaṇ-vasu-.
The anomalous med. them. participle uṣámāna- ‘clothing oneself’, as if to an
otherwise unattested 6th cl. pres. to √vas ‘wear’, belongs with the other unexpected
med. participles (both them. and athem.) to √vaś ‘be eager’ and √vas ‘wear’ found in
this Indra cycle. See disc. ad IV.16.14 and IV.19.4 and cf. uśāná- in the next hymn
(IV.23.1).
The second hemistich is best interpreted in the context of V.52.9, a Marut
hymn, where the Maruts páruṣṇyām, ū́rṇā vasata “clothe themselves in the wool
[=foam] in the Paruṣṇī (River).” Note that in that passage páruṣṇyām and ū́rṇā are in
different cases and numbers (fem. loc. sg. and fem. acc. pl. respectively) unlike here,
where both are fem. acc. sg. Their grammatical difference in V.52.9, which imposes
a semantic separation, makes it less likely here that páruṣṇīm is simply an adj.
modifying ū́rṇām, as Hoffmann (/WG) take it: “in shaggy wool” (KH: “in zottige (?)
Wolle”; WG “in struppige Wolle”). Since páruṣṇī- is simply the fem. to paruṣá-,
81
which is otherwise a color term (‘gray’), the introduction of ‘shaggy’ would also be
puzzling. I therefore essentially follow Ge’s interpr. He takes páruṣṇīm … ū́rṇām as
an unmarked simile: “in the Paruṣṇī (River) (like) wool”; I take it rather as a
metaphor: “in the Paruṣṇī ‘wool’ [=foam].” The color gray enters this image in two
ways. On the one hand, it’s quite possible that the Paruṣṇī River was so called
because it appeared gray; on the other, river foam in general is gray-ish (and tufty,
like wool), as google images of river foam show (unfortunately mostly of polluted
rivers).
The unexpressed connection with the Maruts via the passage just cited is also
expressed in pāda d through sakhyā́ya ‘for partnership’, where the partners must be
the Maruts.
The word párvan- usually refers to a joint or segment; with Ge, I take it in
this image to refer to tufts or articulated hunks of foam, like tufts of wool. With Ge I
also think there’s a secondary word association between páruṣṇī- and párvan- (/
páru(ṣ)-).

### IV.22.3  
In the publ. tr. I take the whole vs. as a single sentence, with ab a relative
clause to the main cl. in cd. Ge (Hoffmann/WG) take b as the main clause to the rel.
cl. in a and take cd separately. This is entirely possible; there is no grammatical
marking to determine the structure, since b lacks a finite verb. Since b is a repeated
pāda (VI.32.4b), it might indeed be better to take it as an independent unit and follow
the Ge interpr.
The distraction of #dyā́m ... bhū́ma# in d is paralleled by 4b #dyaúr ... kṣā́ḥ#.

### IV.22.4  
As just noted, polarized #dyaúr ... kṣā́ḥ# in b match the same (conceptual)
pair in the same positions in 3d. Here in 4b the disjunction is emphasized by the fact
that the two nominatives are subjects of a singular verb (rejata). The connection of
the 3d and 4b is signaled by the fact that the same root provides the verb in both 3d
and 4b: trans.-cause. rejayat and intrans. rejata respectively (both injunctives), and
heaven and earth switch grammatical identity and function from object to subject.
Pāda a sits somewhat uncomfortably between these two complementary pādas.
The river banks and beds seem rather paltry natural features next to heaven and earth,
which flank them. But they may serve a grammatical purpose: both NPs (víśvā
ródhāṃsi [neut. pl.] and pravátaḥ … pūrvī́ḥ [fem. pl.]) are neutral as to case (nom. vs.
acc.) and can thus serve as a pivot, available as both acc. objects for rejayat in 3d and
nom. subjects for rejata in 4b. (Of course, although the neuter pl. could be the subject
of a sg. verb, technically speaking a feminine pl. should not, but this does not seem a
problem to me, as the neut. pl. leads the conjoined NP and would set the syntactic
tone -- and they are pretty distant from the verb anyway.)
Pāda c produces problems on several fronts. Who are the mother and father
(mātárā)? (Old flatly announces he has no intention of trying to find out.) Why is the
verb (bhárati) accented? Why are there two instances of ā́? What is the cow (góḥ)
doing grammatically and/or conceptually? The only word that is not problematic
(though see below) is śuṣmī́, which must refer to Indra, as in 1b. I do not have
82
entirely satisfactory answers to the puzzles. Probably the default referent for mātárā
would be Heaven and Earth, and they have figured prominently just previously. But
there is the problem that Heaven and Earth are not particularly mobile, so how is it
that Indra “brings them here”?
As for the accent on bhárati, Ge suggests that pāda c is dependent on either ab
or c, without overt subordination. Old (ZDMG 60 [1906]: 725–26 = KlSch 200-201)
places it in the class of “priorischer Nebensatz” (to the main cl. in pāda d), but c
doesn’t seem to provide sufficient grounding for d to justify the verbal accent.
Hoffmann (Injunk. 187 n. 147) cites Old’s own citation of himself (given above), but
also what is the more likely explanation, given by Old in the same art. (708–12, esp.
711 = KlSch. 186): that it is implicitly antithetical, participating in two interlocked
constructions, what Old (711 = 186) designates pavpα (that is, PREV [x-word] VERB
PREV [corresponding x-́word]) -- with, in our passage, ā́as the PREV, mā́tárā … góḥ
as x and x,́ and bhárati as accented VERB. In his exx. nothing intervenes between
VERB and the repeated PREV, unlike śuṣmī́here, but I consider this a minor variant in
the model. Perhaps more problematic is that mātárā and góḥ do not correspond
grammatically, but again I would prefer to work with a more flexible model (and see
below). In this model the accent on the verb and the doubled ā́fit under the same
explanatory rubric, a desirable situation, all things being equal. (Such an explanation
is blocked for Ge, who thinks the two ā́’s have different functions, the first preverb,
the second preposition.)
But what about the cow? One might note that there’s a similarly pāda-final
góḥ in 8d as well as another quite baffling one in the next hymn, IV.23.6. I also
wonder if this pile-up of pāda-final góḥ is not a sly reference to the impenetrable
pāda-final góhe in the previous hymn (IV.21.6b, 7c, 8c), which caused so many
interpretational difficulties there (though they are not etymologically related, at least
by our current understanding of góhe). But this doesn’t help us at all with the
meaning or the function of góḥ here. The first thing to consider is what case it is --
gen. or abl. Ge opts for the latter: Indra brings the two mothers from the cow (“von
dem Rinde”), though in n. 4c he also entertains the possibility of an ellipsis of a
nominative with a dependent genitive góḥ, “(son) of the cow,” namely the bull Indra.
As far as I can tell, WG also take it as an abl., but construed with ā́in the sense of
“all the way to” (a marginal, but certainly attested, construction in the RV). There is
nothing impossible about either of these interpr., but I do not see what they would
mean in context, and neither Ge nor WG give much help in that regard. For me the
most appealing attempt to wring sense from this is Hoffmann’s (Injunk. 187). As in
Ge’s alternative, Hoffmann takes góḥ as a gen. in an elliptical expression, but with
the gapped item a second object to bhárati: “Herbei bringt der Kraftschnaubende
(seine) Eltern, herbei (das) der Kuh.” This makes good sense of the structure of the
pāda (fitting better with Old’s pavpα scheme, since α would now be grammatically
parallel to a). So what is the “das” in Hoffmann’s tr.? He suggests ‘milk’ or similar,
though not with a great deal of conviction. The publ. tr. supplies ‘milk’ as a possible
metaphor for ‘rain’, and given the roaring winds of pāda d, I think rain is quite likely
the gapped object, since ‘cow’ can be used of rain-bearing clouds. It also now occurs
83
to me that it might instead be the Maruts (“[those] of the cow”), since they are the
sons of the cow Pṛśni, as noted, e.g., in V.52.16, the same hymn that has the Paruṣṇī
River foam passage cited above (vs. 2). The Maruts would also fit with the violent
roaring of the wind in d.
IV.22.5–6: These vss. summarizing Indra’s great deeds begin identically: tā́tū́te [ta
in sandhi before vowel in 6]. The vss. appear at the exact center of the hymn and thus
may count as an omphalos. Although both pādas have Indra’s deeds as subject,
neither has a word for ‘deed’.

### IV.22.6  
The b pāda contains one of the RV’s beloved gender-bending paradoxes,
with the cows coming out “from the udder of a bull” (vṛ́ṣṇa ū́dhnaḥ). Ge (/WG)
interprets this as rainwater coming from the sky (Parjanya or Heaven). I think it
more likely that it concerns the Vala myth. Indra’s other signature deed, the slaying
of Vṛtra, was treated in the immediately preceding, paired verse (5d), and so we
might expect mention of his other most prominent feat. In that case the “bull” would
be the Vala cave. On the other hand, this might continue the treatment of the Vṛtra
myth in 5d (as Ge also suggests, n. 6b), in which case the “bull” would be Vṛtra
himself or the mountain in which the waters were confined. The more thorough
treatment of the waters in the Vṛtra myth in the following vs. 7 might support this
latter view.
IV.22.6–7: Another responsion: 6c ádhā ha / 7a átrā́ha. Later in the pāda 7a tā́u
recalls the openings of 5a and 6a tā́tū́.

### IV.22.7  
Most tr. take stavanta as passive, and this seems the correct interpr. The
sisters are likely the rivers or waters released after the killing of Vṛtra. The question
is why they would be praised as well as Indra. Ge’s suggestion (n. 7ab) is that it is
essentially a spill-over effect (not that he uses that term), that Indra’s praiseworthy
deed that brought the waters release also brought them praise by association.
I don’t understand the double ánu (pādas c and d), though my surmise is that
the first one simply anticipates the second, which is in a semi-fixed expression
dīrghā́m ánu prásitim (cf. X.40.10). Gr takes it as part of a preverb complex with
√muc: ánu prá √muc ‘nacheinander loslassen’, and its position might support that
assumption. But surely one of points in the Vṛtra myth is that the rivers burst out
dramatically all at once. Ge, by contrast, compares the identical sequence yát sīm ánu
in I.37.9, I.141.9, but those two passages seem unconnected with ours, with the ánu
construed with preceding sīm “following them.” (One can also compare IV.38.3 yáṃ
sīm ánu, but this has yet a different sense.)

### IV.22.8  
asmadryàk opening 8c ushers in the suite of pāda-initial emphatic forms of
the 1st pl. pronoun that lasts and intensifies through the real end of the hymn, vs. 10
(vs. 11 being the Vāmadeva Indra refrain): 8c: asmadryàk, 9a asmé, 9c asmábhyam,
10a asmā́kam, 10b asmábhyam, 10c asmábhyam, 10d asmā́kam.
84
Kü (310) interpr. pipīḷé as presential, but there is in fact no way to tell: this is
not only the only perfect form to this root attested anywhere but the only verb form
to it in the RV (pīḍayati is added in the AV). I think it works better as an immediate
past, although there is in practice little difference between my “has been squeezed”
and Kü’s “ausgepresst ist.”
Ge, flg. Sāy., takes mádyaḥ with āṃśúḥ and explains the position of ná as
“wie oft in Pādaausgang vor dem Vergleich.” But there seems no reason to ignore
the usual structure of the simile, since mádyaḥ easily modifies síndhuḥ.
The syntax of bc is somewhat unusual, in that the subject / verb construction
is split over the hemistich boundary (b … śaktíḥ# c … yamyāḥ#), while the object tvā
is in Wackernagel’s position in pāda b. Moreover, at least in the publ. tr. the genitive
that limits the subj. śaktíḥ is only found in the next pāda: śuśucānásya. Ge (/WG)
take the gen. śaśamānásya in b as dependent on śaktíḥ, with śámī an instr. adjunct to
that participle: “the skill of the one laboring with labor” -- in contrast to the publ. tr.,
where śaśamānásya is dependent on śámī. I now think that the Ge interpr. may be
preferable and would emend the publ. tr. to “Might the skill of the one laboring with
labor (and) of the bright-blazing one pull …” The question is whether the two
genitives are coreferential, with bright-blazing Agni identified as the one laboring
with labor, or whether a (human) priest and Agni are both referred to. I do not think
this can be determined, esp. since subjects of √śam elsewhere include both Agni and
mortals.
The simile in d and the frame in bc have slightly different senses. In the simile
the swift horse is pulling on the reins: it is so eager to reach its goal that it strains
against the reins rather than being guided by them. In the frame the śaktíḥ of the
priest/god is strong enough to pull Indra to us. The difference in the relation of the
accusative to the verb results from exploiting different senses of the root √yam.
Despite Old’s expressed disbelief, I think Gr and Ludwig are correct in taking
góḥ ‘of the cow’ to refer to reins made of leather. On pāda-final góh see also disc. ad
vs. 4c.

### IV.22.9  
Ge tr. nṛmṇā́ni as ‘Mannestaten’, which works well as an object of √kṛ
(though parallel sáhāṃsi ‘powers’ does not). But nṛmṇá- ordinarily refers not to
deeds but to the abstract powers associated with manliness that allow such deeds to
be performed. Hence my ‘activate’ for kṛṇuhi.
## IV.23 Indra
Thieme tr. and comments on this hymn in Gedichte (pp. 30–33).

### IV.23.1  
Ge (/WG) take pāda b as a complete clause, supplying a main verb (‘kommt’
Ge, ‘geht’ WG). They then take the 2nd hemistich as a syntactically independent
declarative sentence. Given the density of questions in the first 6 vss. of this hymn, I
think a declarative sentence would be intrusive and therefore take bcd as part of the
question begun with kásya in pāda a, with vavakṣé in d as the main verb for the
whole.
85
On soma as an udder, see III.48.3 cited by both Old and Ge.
Note the close proximity of juṣāṇáḥ (b) and juṣámāṇaḥ (c). The latter is the
only occurrence of this participle stem, while juṣāṇá- is of course quite common. I
don't see any semantic nuance that would justify using two different stems here. I
wonder if juṣámāṇa- is a nonce to create a Behagel effect with the three nearrhyming and semantically similar stems: juṣāṇó … uśānó juṣámāṇo. It should also be
evaluated in the context of the other anomalous and phonologically similar middle
participles in this Indra cycle, including uṣāná- (IV.16.14), uśámāna- (IV.19.4),
uṣámāna- (IV.22.2), and our own middle term uṣānáḥ. (For disc. see esp. comm. ad
IV.16.14.) Though uṣāná- is attested twice elsewhere, it is still problematic: though
there is a root pres. to √vaś ‘be eager’ with a zero-grade uś, the stem is otherwise
only act. and the act. part. uśánt- is extremely well attested (see., e.g., the next hymns,
IV.24.6b, 25.1b).
Ge is adamant that the two verse-final datives śucaté dhánāya are not to be
construed together. By contrast I think they belong together in principle. Of 6
occurrences of dhánāya (always pāda-final), 2 are preceded by mahaté (I.104.7,
IX.97.4), which modifies it. I am just somewhat uncertain what it refers. Although
√śuc is generally an Agni root, and cf. śuśucāná- in the immediately preceding hymn,
probably of Agni (IV.22.8), I think that referent is unlikely here. dhána- refers to the
stakes in play or a prize or spoils, in this case presumably something Indra wants
enough to exert himself for it. The verse has made abundantly clear what Indra wants
most -- soma (sómam b, ándhaḥ c) -- and I think it likely that soma is the referent
here as well. A deriv. of √śuc, the adj. śúci-, is regularly used of a type of soma
(clear, as opposed to mixed), and the participle here may be expressing the same
thing. I would therefore slightly emend the tr. to “for the gleaming stakes [=soma].”

### IV.23.2  
In b Ge (/WG) and Thieme (Gedichte 31) take the instr. sumatíbhiḥ as the
object of sám ānaṃśa (e.g., Ge “Wer wurde seiner Gnaden teilhaft?”), but this seems
an unlikely use of the instr., even with the presence of the preverb sám -- esp.
because the verb in b is essentially identical to the verb in a, āpa, which takes the acc.
Although Gr allows both acc. and instr. with sám √naś in the sense ‘erlangen’, a
careful perusal of the entry shows that this is the only instance with a supposed instr.;
the others have the acc. I therefore supply the same obj. found in pāda a
(sadhamā́dam) and take sumatíbhiḥ in normal instr. usage.
The second hemistich contains two occurrences of kád; the second is taken by
all as simply a question marker, but Ge interprets the first one as a full neut. with
citrám, “welches Wunder?” This is possible, but it seems rhetorically better to take it
as parallel in function to the other kád (so Th and WG as well as me). I supply
‘course’ on the basis of II.34.10 citráṃ tád vo maruto yā́ma cekite “This bright
course of yours, Maruts, appears ever more brightly,” also adduced by Ge. The
notion of a journey is reinforced by the 2nd part of the hemistich. However, a tr. like
WG “Ist sein Glanzzeichen bemerkt?” is certainly possible.
86

### IV.23.3  
Gr, Ge, et al. take hūyámānam to refer to the call or summons to Indra (e.g.,
Ge “Wie hört Indra den Ruf?”). Kulikov (-ya-presents, 307–8) rejects this interpr.,
noting that this is the only instance of such a construction: normally the subject of the
passive is the deity being invoked. Although he reluctantly admits that it might
correspond to the rare transitive type in which what is spoken is the object of the
verb (1.17.9), he prefers to derive this form from √hu ‘pour’ and translates “How
does Indra hear the (libation) being offered?” -- that is, the sound of the pouring. A
different reconsideration is found in WG, who interpr. hūyámāna- in the standard
way, as having the deity invoked as its subject -- but they think Indra is listening to
the summons to a different deity than Indra. Although I recognize that the standard
interpr. may have glided too swiftly over the problems with hūyámāna-, the two
revisionist versions both seem overelaborate and implausible to me. Since it is
undeniable that forms of √hū do sometimes take what is spoken as obj. (see the
above-cited I.17.9, as well as juxtaposed occurrences of hávya- in VI.21.1 with
comm. there), I think we must allow this rare usage in the passive as well, a point
made very economically by Old. My tr. follows that of Thieme (p. 31) “Wie hört
Indra den [Ruf], der gerufen wird?”
In b ávasām is taken by all modern comm. and tr. as the gen. pl. of ávas- ‘help’
that it appears to be. Although this gen. pl. is not otherwise attested (the only pl.
cases are nom./acc. and instr.), ávasām is what the gen. pl. of this stem would be.
Moreover, it can easily be the complement of veda, which takes both acc. and gen.
Nonetheless I favor Gr’s interpr., that it is the acc. sg. of a root noun cmpd from áva
√sā ‘unhitch’. There is a major obvious stumbling block: the accent. Root noun
cmpds are invariably accented on the final, so we expect *avasā́m. However, the
other putative ex. of this cmpd at III.53.20 has been mangled in transmission (see
disc. by Scar s.v. and comm. ad loc.), and I think it likely that the dominance of the
‘help’ stem, which is remarkably well attested, led to a redactional change in accent.
One of the reasons I favor this solution has to do with the asya. In the ‘help’ interpr.,
the asya would refer to the mortal who will receive this help (see Ge n. 3b), but this
hymn contains a lot of asya’s, and they all otherwise refer to Indra: 2a, 2b, 2c, 3c, 5c,
6c, plus enam 3d and asmin 5d. I very much doubt the poet would break this
sequence with a pronoun referring to someone else. The only exception is asyā́(ḥ) 5a,
which is both accented and feminine, and is playing a trick by its patterning with the
asya in 5c.
For úpamāti- from úpa √mā ‘mete out’, see comm. ad VIII.40.9.

### IV.23.4  
I take dī́dhyānaḥ as parallel to śaśamānáḥ, referring to the verbal/mental
work at the sacrifice as opposed to the physical -- hence my tr. ‘produced insights’.
Other tr. seem to me to attenuate the semantics.
IV.23.5–6: The root √juṣ encountered in two different forms in 1bc recurs here in the
perfect, subjunctive (4d) and indicative (5b).
87

### IV.23.5  
As noted above, fem. asyā́(ḥ) patterns with the ubiquitous asya in this vs.:
5a kathā́kád asyā́/ 5c kathā́kád asya.

### IV.23.6  
ā́d is very rarely not in 1st position. Here the interrog. kím may have
displaced it. See kím ā́d at IV.30.7, as Ge also notes, as well as … kuvíd ā́d I.33.1.
Ge (/WG) take the referent of te to be Indra (Ge: “Wann dürfen wir wohl von
deiner Brüderschaft öffentlich sprechen?”). I very much doubt that. As I noted in the
publ. intro., Indra is always referred to in the 3rd ps. in this hymn, except in the final
extra-hymnic Vāmadeva refrain (vs. 11), and the thwarting of the poet’s longing for
intimacy by the distancing that the insistent 3rd ps. pattern imposes is in many ways
the point of the hymn. I think it unlikely that the poet would introduce the intimate
2nd ps. reference through a single monosyllabic enclitic and then revert, in the next
pāda, to the 3rd ps. asya. This leaves me with the problem of identifying an
alternative referent for te. My assumption is that it is the poet speaking to himself,
while the “we” represents the collectivity of the ritual officiants. Alternatively, it is
possible that te does refer to Indra and that this pāda represents a wistful wishful
thinking about an intimacy not otherwise achieved -- with its 1st ps. / 2nd ps. structure
(the only place where a 1st ps. shows up in the hymn, save for the refrain -- though
see comm. on pāda d) and the particularly intimate relationship ‘brotherhood’
(bhrātrám) that is aimed at
The second hemistich is problematic, primarily because of the form iṣa (Pp.
iṣe) in d. (Ge characterizes it as “das zu den schwierigen Formen des ṚV. gehört”), a
problem compounded by the fact that its first syllable should, ideally, be heavy in
this Triṣṭubh cadence. Before tackling it, we should consider the structure of the two
pādas. With Old and WG, but not Ge, I take c and d separately, with c a nominal
clause equating sárgāḥ ‘surges’ with vápuḥ ‘marvel’. In my view the surges consist
of soma: sárga- is regularly used of soma in Maṇḍala IX. Again with Old and WG,
but not Ge, I take sudṛ́śaḥ as nom. pl. with sárgāḥ, not gen. sg. -- with śriyé
construed with this adj.; cf. V.44.2 śriyé sudṛ́śīḥ. As for d, Old interprets iṣe as a 1st
sg. “setze ich … in Bewegung,” with svàr ṇá citrátamam, standing for the surges in c,
as its object. WG likewise take iṣe as a 1st sg. (aor. injunctive), but with the meaning
‘ich suche’, with the same obj. as Old. By contrast I take it as a 3rd sg. (so also Ge, it
seems) and in fact would emend it (slightly) to *īṣe (an asterisk should be inserted in
the publ. tr.), belonging to the perfect to the root given as √eṣ ‘suchen’ (etc.) by Kü
(126–28). As was just noted, a heavy initial syllable would better fit the cadence; my
one concern is that I do not understand why the short i was introduced. Though he
does not include our form in his conspectus, Kü does list two other 3rd sg. med.
occurrences of this shape (īṣé X.89.3 and, with unclear root syllable, upeṣé I.129.8).
He considers the pf. as resultative, and it is possible that my ‘seeks’ should be
changed to ‘has sought’. However, neither of his other examples (I.129.8, X.89.3)
needs to be preterial, and so ‘seeks’ may as well stay. The same emendation and
semantic interpr. also work for iṣe in VI.22.5 and X.20.7; see disc. ad locc. What
Indra is seeking here is, in my view, the milk to be mixed with the soma. It is
characterized as “very bright like the sun,” and its source as ‘of/from the cow’ (góḥ
88
or ā́góḥ) (ā́may go with either *īṣe or góḥ). The slight disadvantage to my interpr. is
that the two occurrences of ā́góḥ here and in the preceding hymn (IV.22.3) are
construed differently, but given the convoluted structure in IV.22.3, that is probably
unavoidable.
IV.23.7-10: The contrast between the ‘lie’ (pāda-initial drúh- 7a) and ṛtá- (10 pādainitial and 2 pāda-medial exx. in vss. 8–10) certainly underlines and cements the
sense ‘truth’ for this word. Note also that ṛṇā́‘debts’, which opens the 2nd hemistich
of vs 7, phonologically anticipates the ṛtá’s to come.

### IV.23.7  
The tr. of tétikte, ‘sharpens’, may not seem to express its intensive semantics,
but plain ‘sharpen’ itself incorporates the iterative, repetitive motions of blade across
stone that sharpening involves.
Ge notes the similarity of ṛṇā́cid to the root noun cmpd ṛṇa-cít- ‘collector of
debts’ found in the strikingly similar phrase II.23.17 sá r̥ṇacíd rṇ̥ ayā́(ḥ). But there
are no grounds to emend the phrase to a compound, though a deliberate echo seems
possible. In fact changing the text here would have the disadvantage of eliminating
the obvious object to babādhé.

### IV.23.8  
Ge (/WG) take the deaf ears to be those of Āyu -- with Āyu referring to the
Ārya in general, WG suggest. Āyu always poses difficulties, but in this case I think
gen. āyóḥ should be construed with ślókaḥ: the “signal call of Āyu,” referring to
Agni and the sound of blazing fire. Elsewhere Agni is referred to as the “laud of Āyu”
(śáṃsa- āyóḥ, IV.6.11, V.3.4), and this seems a similar expression referring to an
audible product. The nom. participles budhānáḥ śucámānaḥ ‘awakening, blazing’ of
course fit Agni very well. And it is not surprising, given his ritual role, that the sound
of Agni should be considered to be identical to that of truth. As for the position of
āyóḥ, at some distance from ślókaḥ, note that it rhymes with ā́góḥ in 6d, likewise
stationed at the end of the verse.

### IV.23.9  
The tr. of dīrghám as extent of space, rather than Ge’s extent of time (“lange
Zeit”), follows Thieme (p. 32): the nourishments as oblations go from earth to
heaven, as rain from heaven to earth.
On irregular full-grade 3rd pl. viveśuḥ see Kü (499-500).
## IV.24 Indra

### IV.24.3  
Most depictions of battle in the RV do not frame the risks of entering into
battle quite so starkly. Here both ririkvā́ṃsas tanvàḥ “having given up their bodies”
in b and tyāgám … ágman “have come to the abandonment (of their bodies,
presumably)” in c seem to refer to a sort of resignation in the face of death and a loss
of the sense of self. (Note that this is the only occurrence of tyā́ga- in the RV.) It is
esp. telling that they give up their own bodies to gain offspring and a long line of
89
descendants. For the similarity between this passage and the Tānūnaptra ritual, see
Proferes (58).
IV.24.4–5: The pile-up of pāda-initial ā́d íd ‘just then, just after that’, beginning with
4d and marking every pāda in 5, conveys the quick succession of events, but switches
abruptly from battlefield to sacrifice. The néme constructions of 4d and 5a make it
clear, however, that despite the change in venue the same antagonists are in play.
Note also the similarity of the predicates of the two néme constructions: indrayante
… indriyáṃ yajante. This is the only occurrence of the denom. indraya- in the RV
and it may have been created to serve as a foil for the second VP.

### IV.24.4  
The ‘winning of the flood’ (árṇasātau) presumably refers, as Ge, etc., point
out, to the battle to control water resources, esp. dwelling places near water.
Most tr. give a more neutral rendering of ávavṛtranta, but my “have rolled
together” is meant to convey the deeply entwined, rough-and-tumble quality of
pitched battle (and, perhaps, the actual rolling of chariots onto the battlefield).

### IV.24.5  
The bridge between 4d and 5a has already been noted, as well as the change
of scene. However, I think the competition visible in vss. 3–4, as well as in vss. 6–7,
continues here by other, sacrificial, means. To get Indra on their side in battle, the
men must perform not only a correct sacrifice, but a better sacrifice. One puzzling
feature of this vs. is the presence of pf. optatives in pādas b and c. As I have
discussed elsewhere (2008 “Women’s Language in the RV” [Ged. Elizarenkova],
2009 “Where Are All the Optatives” [East and West]), the pf. opt. has a curious
distribution and, to some extent, a particular sociolinguistic profile, and it is not clear
what riricyāt (b) and ví papṛcyāt (c) are doing sandwiched between a pres. (yajante,
a) and a presential perfect (jujoṣa, d), esp. because the four pādas are otherwise
unified by the opening ā́d íd. What sets bc off from a,d is the fact that the subjects in
b and c are ritual offerings, paktíḥ ‘cooked food’ and sómaḥ respectively, as opposed
to the personal subjects (at least in my interpr.) of a and d. What optative function do
these verbs express (and do they express the same one): necessity (‘should’),
potentiality, more certain (‘would’) or less certain (‘might’), possibility (‘could’), or
desire (also ‘would’)?
My surmise is that the vs. depicts the beginning and end points of the
successful sacrifice that one of the groups of competitors mounts. Pāda a contains a
general description of the sacrifice and implies its start. In d the unnamed subject, in
my opinion Indra, shows that the sacrifice has been successful by enjoying the
offered soma (the bull, vṛṣabhám). The pādas in between describe the qualities of the
better sacrifice that our side performs, in contrast to our opponents, and I interpr. the
optatives as expressing near-certain possibility. I therefore take riricyāt in b as
meaning ‘would leave behind, succeed’ not in a temporal sense (the cooked food is
the next course after the offering cake) but in an evaluative one: cooked food is just
better than a puroḷāś-. (This seems generally agreed by interpr.; see esp. Ge’s n. 5b.)
(Note however that the puroḷāś- was probably not eliminated but supplemented,
90
since the successful sacrificer not only cooks cooked food for Indra in 7b but also
roasts grains.)
Even more important is the mere presence of soma in c. The pāda implies that
the other side consists of non-pressers (ásuṣvīn), who therefore cannot offer soma to
Indra. Soma is our trump card and leaves our competitors out in the cold, as it were.
(Notice that the non-pressers contrast with the súṣvi- in 2d. For súṣvi-/ásuṣvi- as well
as paktí, see also the next hymn IV.25.6–7.)
My tr. of d differs in an important way from Ge (/WG). They take yájadhyai
as an infinitive complement to jujoṣa with vṛṣabhám as object, though with two
different interpretations. Ge’s “dann beliebt man einen Stier zu opfern” (so also
Keydana, Inf., p. 289, with disc.) assumes that the vṛṣabhá- is a sacrificed animal.
WG correctly point out that √yaj does not take an acc. of the offering but of the god
who receives the offering and therefore take vṛṣabhá- as referring to Indra. The subj.
in either case must be an unidentified priest or the like. In my view, by contrast,
Indra is the unnamed subj., who receives pleasure from the ‘bull’ soma -- note that
vṛṣabhá- is an epithet of soma, as well as of Indra and other gods. The yájadhyai is a
purpose inf. without object, as it generally is (cf., nearby IV.21.5 íyarti vā́caṃ
janáyan yájadhyai “(who) raises his speech, giving birth to it in order to carry out the
sacrifice”).
As Old notes, there are 3 forms of √ric in this hymn, all pf.: pf. part.
ririkvāṃsaḥ (3b), pf. opt. riricyāt here, and a plupf. (probably) arirecīt (9c). They are
all somewhat marked in form and have different contextual meanings. Old remarks
“der Dichter liebte dies Verb.” Certainly he seems to be making a point with it.
IV.24.6–7: The battle/sacrifice trajectory of vss. 4–5 is wrapped up in vss. 6–7,
where it is made clear (esp. in 6d) that if you want Indra’s help on the battlefield, you
had better perform a good sacrifice, not stinting on the soma.

### IV.24.6  
The “wide space” theme returns from 2d. The laconic expression of the
recipient of wide space in 2d (the dat. súṣvaye ‘for the presser’) is expanded into a
dat. pronoun with rel. clause attached: asmai … yá itthéndrāya sómam uśaté sunóti.
Since the first part of this hymn ends with vs. 7, vss. 2 and 6 are symmetrical and this
echo forms a small internal ring. But there are no other signs of ring composition.
The tradition (as well as modern ed. and tr.) is split on whether to read
ávivenam (HvN, Müller ed., Sāy., Lub, and AiG I.1.333) or ávivenan (Auf. ed., Pp,
Gr, Ol, and Ge); see Old’s disc.
Quite apart from the actual form is its referent. Old, who accepts the ávivenan
reading, takes c with d and identifies Indra as the referent of ávivenan. Although this
fits better with the similar expression in the next hymn (IV.25.3) where gods are (or
may be) the subject, here I think Ge is correct that c belongs grammatically with the
rel. cl. in ab, and the referent of ávivenan is the soma-presser subject of that rel. cl.
This nominative is resumed by the appropriate correlative prn. tám in the acc. in d.
91

### IV.24.7  
The śúṣma- that Indra confers on the sacrificer is the ‘explosive force’ that
will help him (both Indra and the mortal aided by him) prevail in battle.
IV.24.8–10: For my interpr. of these vss., see publ. intro.

### IV.24.8  
Both Ge and Old suggest that ṛ́ghāvā should be read as neut. *ṛ́ghāvad on
the basis of similar (but not identical) X.27.3 yadā́vā́khyat samáraṇam ṛ́ghāvad. This
seems unnec., since nom. sg. ṛ́ghāvā makes fine sense, and, as anyone who has
tangled with it knows, X.27 is a very strange hymn. The only factor in favor of the
emendation is the fact that ṛ́ghāvā is the only representative of the -van-stem
ṛ́ghāvan-; otherwise we find the -vant-stem ṛ́ghāvant- (3x). But -van- and -vantstems coexist elsewhere -- cf. maghávan(t)- -- and eliminating the -van-stem here
doesn’t seem sufficient reason to make the emendation. (Note that WG do not follow
Ge and Old, and Ge allows for the possibility of the nom. in his n. 8a.)
Ge suggests that the subjects of a and b might be Indra’s wife. Scar (616 and n.
882) has her as the subj. of b but not a. After surveying the various possibilities in his
n. he says, with remarkable understatement, “Das Dramolett lässt Raum für
verschiedene Interpretationen.” I think it likely that Indra is the subj. of the first two
pādas both because the word pátnī is only introduced in the 3rd pāda and because one
wonders whether a woman would be in a position to survey the battlefield.
In d “whetted sharp by the soma pressers” (níśitaṃ somasúbhiḥ) continues the
theme of the previous vss., that getting Indra on one’s side in battle requires plying
him with soma at the sacrifice.

### IV.24.9  
As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. introduces the vocabulary of commerce,
which is otherwise little represented in our texts (though see AVŚ III.15, called by
Whitney “For success in trade”) and therefore difficult to get a handle on. My interpr.
differs on some important points from the standard (Old, Ge, WG, Kü [425]). In pāda
a most interpr. take kánīyaḥ ‘lesser’ as referring to the price and bhū́yasā ‘greater’ as
what is being bought. But price is always in the instr.: see in the next vs. 10ab
daśábhiḥ … dhenúbhiḥ. Therefore, grammar requires us to conclude that, rather than
complaining that the potential purchaser offered too little for that very valuable asset,
Indra himself, Indra is protesting that the purchaser went for an inferior product
(another god?) with too high an offer. In pādas b and c he further points out that the
purchaser failed to take advantage of the chance to buy Indra (who therefore went
away ‘unsold’ ávikrītaḥ) and to leave behind (/replace) the poor bargain he made in
the first place.
As also indicated in the publ. intro., I take pāda d as an old saying
encapsulating the wisdom of not wasting your money on a substandard item. The
problem in this pāda is vāṇám, which ordinarily means ‘voice, music’ (see EWA s.v.).
However, Ge tr. ‘Handel’ and suggests (n. 9d) that it is derived from vaṇíj-
‘merchant’, which seems very plausible. That it is otherwise unknown in this
meaning would not be surprising, given the specialized lexical level it inhabits.
92

### IV.24.10  
The big question about this vs. is the identity of the speaker. The standard
view is that it is the poet Vāmadeva, who is putting Indra on sale temporarily, with
the requirement that he be returned after his obstacle-smashing is done. I find this
unlikely. How did Indra come to be possessed by Vāmadeva (imám … máméndram
“this Indra of mine”)? Who is he hawking Indra to? Why has the scene changed from
the domestic one of Indra and his wife to, presumably, the ritual ground? My own
suggestion, albeit somewhat tentative, is that the speaker is Indra’s wife. Who would
have a better right to call him “this Indra of mine”? Moreover, there seems no good
reason to introduce his wife as an emphatic actor in vs. 8 and then drop her out of the
story. Since the three vss. seem unified in tone and theme, common sense suggests
that they should take place in the same location with the same actors.
The standard tr. take c with d, e.g., Ge: “Wenn er die Feinde erschlagen hat,
so soll er ihn mir zurückgeben.” The problem with this is that it assumes an anterior,
specifically future anterior, value “(will) have smashed” for the intensive subjunctive
jáṅghanat. For this reason I attach it to ab. However, it may make more sense to
allow the future anterior and make the yadā́clause the prior condition for the return
in pāda d. In this case the tr. would be “Who buys this Indra of mine with ten cows?
When he [=Indra] will have smashed the obstacles, then will he [=buyer] return him
[=Indra] to me?”
## IV.25 Indra

### IV.25.1  
On the phraseology of c, see comm. ad IV.16.11. Though Ge (/WG) supply
‘day’ with pā́ryāya there seems no reason not to take it with the two immediately
preceding datives.
Pāda d contains two functionally parallel expressions in two formally
different guises: the loc. absol. sámiddhe agnaú “when his fire has been kindled” and
the nom. bahuvrīhi sutásomaḥ “possessing pressed soma / he whose soma has been
pressed.” A parallel bahuvrīhi to the first expression is also attested: iddhā́gni- (2x).

### IV.25.2  
The last part of d, kaváye ká ūtī́, is somewhat unclear. Ge, flg. Sāy.,
identifies the kaví- as Indra, but this seems unlikely. If káḥ refers to the mortal
worshiper (as seems likely, given the referents of the preceding káḥ’s), he would not
ordinarily be supplying help to Indra, and though Indra is sometimes called a kaví-,
that is comparatively rare (though see the next hymn, IV.26.1) and not found in such
a context. Other passages with ūtī́and an overt or covert form of the copula (vel
sim.) generally have the god as subject. Cf. nearby IV.23.2 … kád ūtī́, vr̥dhé bhuvac
chaśamānasya ... “Will he be here with help for the strengthening of the one who has
labored” (sim. IV.29.1, 4; 31.1), but as was just noted, changing the referent of káḥ in
the middle of this insistent sequence (9 occurrences of káḥ in 3 vss.) is undesirable.
My ‘joins together’ is an awkward attempt to avoid that.

### IV.25.3  
On ávivenam / ávivenan see comm. ad IV.24.6. Assuming the -am form is
correct here, it would be an absolutive in -am. In IV.24.6 the same expression
93
mánasā́vivenan/m qualified the mortal worshiper (acdg. to most -- see disc. there).
Here it seems to qualify the gods. However, it is just possible that as an adverbial
absolutive it could refer to the mortal worshiper, represented by kásya: “the pressed
soma plant of which (mortal), never losing track in his mind, do …” The fact that
until this sentence the mortal had appeared in the nom. káḥ could contribute to the
somewhat mixed construction.

### IV.26–27  
These are the famous hymns devoted to the stealing of soma from heaven.
Unfortunately they are very obscure in many details, esp. IV.27. The myth and these
hymns are treated in detail by U. Schneider, Der Somaraub des Manu (1971).
IV.26 Indra (1–3), Praise of the falcon (4–7) [=Soma-theft]
As indicated in the publ. intro., I believe the whole hymn is spoken by Indra,
against the Anukramaṇī but with Ge (/WG).

### IV.26.1  
In this vs. Indra identifies himself with the three most resonant RVic words
for poet: ṛ́ṣi-, vípra-, kaví-. I am not sure why. The named beings in the 2nd hemistich,
Kutsa and Uśanā, belong in the same mythic complex, along with Indra; see in this
Indra cycle IV.16.10-12. Kakṣīvant is one of the most accomplished RVic poets
(I.116–26), and his collection immediately follows that attributed to Kutsa (I.101–15).
But again I don't know why he claims identity with Kakṣīvant, esp. because only one
hymn of Kakṣīvant’s is even possibly dedicated to Indra (the maddening I.121).
However, note the borrowing of phraseology from Kakṣīvant in IV.27.4 (see comm.
ad loc.). His desire to claim both Manu (first man) and the sun (most prominent
heavenly body) is more understandable.
In c I take ny ṛ̀ñje not as a 1st sg. present but as the homophonous 1st sg.
injunctive to the 6th cl. pres. ṛñjá- and therefore as preterital.

### IV.26.3  
Atithigva is often associated with Kutsa, sometimes with both as enemies of
Indra (I.53.10, VI.18.13, VIII.53.2), sometimes, as here, as his clients.
IV.26.4–7: The 3rd sg. act. impf./injunc. of √bhṛ is the “hero” of this, the
mythological portion, of the hymn: bhárat (4d, 5a), bharat (6c), abharat (7a).

### IV.26.4  
The first hemistich sounds like a formal eulogistic opening, though I don’t
know of any parallels elsewhere (quite possibly for want of looking).
94

### IV.26.5  
My interpr. depends on reading (as sometimes elsewhere) yádi (‘if’) as yád
*ī (‘when it’), despite the short i before a single consonant. It is possible that yád *ī
was changed redactionally, to match yádi in IV.27.3. A heavy syllable in fourth place
in an opening of four is standard (see Arnold 182, 188), and in particular the
sequence of four shorts in #(bhárad) yádi | vír á(to) seems quite unusual, while a long
vowel before the caesura and preceding a break of two shorts is metrically more
favorable -- though given the many metrical departures in this hymn (see, e.g., the
next vs.), this is not a strong argument.

### IV.26.6  
Three of the four cadences in this verse are bad (b, c, d).
ṛjīpín- (2x) must be closely related to better-attested ṛjipyá- (6x), which also
has Iranian cognates, e.g., Aves. ərəzifiia-. Werba bei EWA, s.v., suggests that it is a
contamination with ṛjīṣín-, which seems a promising suggestion.
Goto (1st Kl, 171–72, flg. Wackernagel) argues that the thematic middle
dádate is synchronicially distinct from √dā 'give' and means 'keep safe'. My ‘hanging
onto’ represents a compromise between such a rendering and ‘take’, the standard
sense of medial (ā́) √dā (see 7a ādā́ya).

### IV.26.7  
The obj. mūrā́(ḥ) is fem. and presumably matches the gender of the parallel
object árātīḥ ‘hostilities’ in the preceding pāda.
IV.27 (323) Falcon (1-4), Falcon or Indra (5) [=Soma theft]
Note the periodic punctuation by ádha (1d, 3a, 4d, 5a) -- and some play with
that word: ádhi 4b, adhva... 5c, ándhah 5b, maybe adīyam 1d; also the preponderance
of a-init. preverbs, ánu 1a, ápa 2a, abhí 2b, áva 3a, 3c.
The perfect jabhāra is found in vss. 2 and 4 (cf. the pres. stem forms to √bhṛ
in the preceding hymn, vss. 4–7). It thus frames the central vs. 3, which could then be
an omphalos. That vs. is certainly confused enough to qualify and captures the
crucial moment of the grabbing of soma. But since vs. 3 consists of a series of
subordinate clauses whose main clause is found in vs. 4, it cannot be syntactically
isolated into a free-standing omphalos.

### IV.27.1  
The major problem with this vs. is pāda d, with a nom. śyenáḥ and the 1st sg.
nír adīyam. At first glance this seems to require that the speaker be the falcon, not
Soma. The problem, and various previous suggested solutions, are discussed at
length by Old. He rejects an emendation to 3rd ps. *adīyat (rightly in my view) and
suggests instead that we must indeed take the speaker to be the falcon. In this he is
followed by Ge (/WG). However, this makes problems with pāda c (“a hundred
metal fortifications guarded me”), where the 1st ps. speaker should surely be Soma,
whose release from captivity in heaven is the subject of the hymn, not the falcon,
who flies freely around. Moreover, it seems unlikely that we would care about the
long-standing knowledge that the falcon has (ab), whereas again Soma’s knowledge
is relevant. A somewhat ad hoc, but still satisfying (to me anyway) solution was
95
suggested by Thieme (Gedichte, 41), who takes ádha śyenáḥ as an abrupt nominal
clause -- “Then the falcon!” -- expressing the surprise advent of the bird in Soma’s
place of captivity. The 1st sg. verb can then have Soma, the speaker, as its subject.

### IV.27.2  
There is general agreement that Soma speaks this and the following vss.
I read ápa twice in pāda a -- first with jabhāra ‘he carried away’, but also
with jóṣam ‘against (my) will’ (despite Old’s rejection of the latter). This phrase
would be constructed on the model of ánu jóṣam ‘following my will’. That it was not
against Soma’s will is explained by the next pāda, where he boasts that he is stronger
and braver than the falcon, implying that without Soma’s agreement the falcon could
not have borne him away. The standard tr. take jóṣam positively -- so that in
conjunction with the neg. ná the whole is negative: “he did not willingly carry me
away.” In this reading it is the falcon’s will or pleasure that is at issue (e.g., WG
“Nicht hat der mich ja zu (seinem) Gefallen fortgebracht”). I don’t understand what
this would convey: that the falcon was forced on this mission by someone else? that
once the falcon saw Soma, he didn’t want to take him? Thieme (Ged.) by contrast
takes it as the guard’s will (“mit Zustimmung [des Wächters]”), but we would surely
need more signaling than the bare noun jóṣam to indicate that the jóṣa- belongs to a
character we haven’t met yet (presumably Kṛśānu of 3d). Moreover, it suggests, only
to reject, a scenario involving a corrupt prison guard that seems to me out of place.
Pāda c is almost identical to 26.7, with the addition of the adv. īrmā́‘still,
quiet’ (on which see comm. ad VIII.22.4). It qualifies the left-behind árātīḥ
‘hostilities’; cf. V.62.2 īrmā́tasthúṣīh ‘standing still’, with the adv. limiting a fem. pl.
participle. See Narten’s sim. tr. (Kl Sch. 69).
Since púraṃdhi- is fem., and the nom. sg. śū́śuvānaḥ in d is masc., Puraṃdhi
cannot be the subject there -- rather the falcon, as the standard interpr. agree.

### IV.27.3  
This is a difficult vs. to construe and to interpret. What we have to go on is
the syntactic skeleton the poet has provided us: a triple yád construction, with yád in
Wackernagel’s position in the first three pādas, and in the fourth a nominative NP
that serves as the subject of the clause introduced in c. The main cl. is then provided
by 4ab (so, generally, Old, Ge, WG, Schneider).
Within this structure pādas a and cd are relatively straightforward internally;
it is b that causes further problems, esp. in the sequence … yád yádi vā́ta(ḥ). First,
note the mirror-image phonology of the opening: ví yád yádi v(…). Ge takes yádi vā
simply as a strengthened ‘or’, and similarly Schneider (16 n. 35) states that yádi vā is
simply equivalent to vā. The tr. of Ge and WG reflect this stripped-down interpr. of
the sequence yád yádi vā, reducing that complex just to “oder als …” I find this
exceedingly unlikely. The sequence is simply too tricky and too unprecedented to be
a long-winded way of saying ‘or’, and anyway RVic poets do not resort to pleonastic
expressions to fill out their pādas: 11 syllables is too tight a space as it is. I think we
must give yádi vā its lexical weight “or if” and assume that the poet is introducing a
bit of doubt about some details of the story. This doubt coincides with the switch
from 3rd singular reference to the falcon to unidentified 3rd plural: “they carried”
96
(ūhúḥ), and these are likely to be connected. The two almost identical statements
about Puraṃdhi (26.7c and 27.2c) simply state that she “left behind” hostilities.
Neither says she was carried away, much less by whom -- so how Puraṃdhi departed
remains unclear, and pāda b seems to be reminding us of that.
The similarity of vā́ta(ḥ) (Pp. vā átaḥ) to the word for ‘wind’, just met in
vā́tān (2d), has been generally remarked on. Ge (n. 3b) tentatively suggests a
haplology: vā́to vā́tā(ḥ), that is, vā átaḥ vā́tāḥ ‘or the winds from there (carried off
Puraṃdhi).” I see the temptation, but I think vā́ta(ḥ) is only a word play and does not
conceal a form of ‘wind’. Among other things, the winds in 2d were not carrying
anything away; they were overtaken by the falcon, who was.

### IV.27.4  
The adj. ṛjipyá- = Aves. ərəzifiia- (and other Iranian forms). I favor the old
notion that it contains a Caland form of ‘straight’ (ṛjú-, etc.) + *pt-ya-, with a zero-gr.
of √pat ‘fly’. See EWA s.v., though Mayrhofer considers the etym. “unsicher.” (The
lack of -iya- readings, indicating that the root-final laryngeal was lost without leaving
a trace, might be problematic, but -iya- and -ya- adjectives tend to become confused.)
Scar. (318) suggests rather a derivation from √pā3 ‘go’, but the existence of such a
root is in question.
If we accept the transmitted índrāvataḥ, it would most likely be an acc. pl. and
refers to the companions of Indra who will ritually prepare the soma for him to drink.
This interpr. is reflected in the publ. tr. However, the form has been much discussed
and much emended (see Old’s detailed disc. and Ge’s n. 4a [“eine alte Crux”]). I
understand the urge to emend -- which for me stems less from any problems
construing the transmitted form within the frame of the passage than with the illformed simile, ná bhujyúm, that ends the pāda. This clearly refers to the Aśvins’
rescue of the hapless Bhujyu, whom they pull out of the sea and bring home (e.g.,
I.116.5 yád aśvinā ūháthur bhujyúm ástam). As the simile is constructed in our vs.,
the simile particle ná precedes the only word in the simile, though ordinarily ná
follows the first word of the simile. This is in fact less of a problem than I used to
think: Ge (n. 4a) attributes this position to what he considers a common transposition
of X ná to ná X at the end of a verse line, and he seems to be correct that the similemarking ná is blocked from pāda-final position. See comm. ad VIII.76.1, X.21.1,
111..
If we were to read du. *índravantā (note the short second vowel, found in this
stem when the penultimate syllable is heavy), the adj. could identify the Aśvins (they
are so called in I.116.21, the hymn just cited with Bhujyu), and we would have a
fully formed simile: “as the two companions of Indra [=Aśvins] (did) Bhujyu.” Note
that I.116 is a Kakṣīvant hymn, and the poet of these Soma-stealing hymns (IV.26–
27) lays claim to the Kakṣīvant mantle in the very first vs. of this sequence (IV.26.1
aháṃ kakṣī́vām̐ṛ́ṣir asmi vípraḥ). The Bhujyu saga figures prominently in the
Kakṣīvant cycle (I.116.3–5, 117.14, 119.4). As Old discusses, this emendation has
been suggested previously, both as is and via *índra(/ā)vantā+u. Besides sense and
the structure of the simile, another strong factor favoring the emendation is meter:
the transmitted text produces a highly irregular break ( – – ⏑), but reading
97
*índravantā would yield a standard break – ⏑ –. I therefore am now inclined to alter
the publ. tr. to “… brought him from the lofty back (of heaven), just as *the two
companions of Indra (the Aśvins) (brought) Bhujyu” – although I remain somewhat
uncertain because I don’t know how the corruption would have happened. I do not
think it was by way of the addition of u to the dual ending -vantā, since this would be
an odd position for u. Perhaps it was clumsily altered to match bṛható in the next
pāda; Sāy. at least analyses the form as an abl. modifying bṛhatáḥ … snóḥ. It is also
possible that it was modeled after parāvátaḥ in the corresponding vs. in IV.26,
namely 6, which also treats the bringing of the soma from heaven to earth, begins
ṛjīpī́śyenáḥ matching our ṛjipyáḥ … śyenaḥ, and contains a form of √bhṛ (bharat,
like our jabhāra).
The expression patatrí … parṇám “winged feather” strikes me as odd -- it is
generally birds that are winged, not their feathers. I therefore propose to read
*patatrí(y)asya ‘of the winged one’ rather than patatrí asya. (This actually requires
no change to the Saṃhitā text.) Grammatically this is not difficult: -(i)ya- adjectives
are made regularly to -a-stems, including -trya- to -tra-, like mitríya/mítrya- to mitrá-,
which also has mitrín- beside it. There's a pátatra- 'wing', beside patatrín-, so there's
no reason why not to have a patatríya-. Gen. patatríyasya then modifies véḥ. It is
worth noting that a number of occurrences of patatrín- modify ví-.

### IV.27.5  
The first occurrence of mádāya- was omitted in the publ. tr., which should
read “… Indra will aim it for drinking to exhilaration.”
As noted in the publ. intro., práti √dhā is an idiom meaning ‘aim (an arrow)’,
and the word play is surely meant here, given the immediately preceding vss. about
Kṛśānu and his arrowshot.
IV.28 Indra, or Indra and Soma

### IV.28.1  
The construction in b -- apáḥ … sasrútas kaḥ, lit. “made the waters flowing,”
with an acc. pl. adjectival root-noun cmpd. modifying ‘waters’ -- is a little odd. In
this type of periphrastic causative context with √kṛ, we expect a complement
infinitive. In fact compare the completely parallel VII.21.3 tvám indra srávitavā́apás
kaḥ, with an infinitive built to the same root √sru. There is no obvious reason for the
different constructions. Perhaps it anticipates the akṛṇoḥ NOUN-ACC ADJ-ACC
constructions in 4cd, where there exist no alternative infinitive possibilities. (The
publ. tr. “made the waters flow” rather than “… flowing” is meant to avoid an interpr.
that Indra thawed or otherwise liquified something solid. It should, however, be
“flow together,” to represent the sa-.)

### IV.28.2  
Ge plausibly suggests that the “great deceit” is Śuṣṇa. See his cited parallels.

### IV.28.3  
My “house of no exit” is a somewhat loose way of rendering durgé duroṇé
“house of difficult going.” I think Ge is correct in interpreting this as the grave.
Note b #purā́ c #purū́.
98

### IV.28.4  
On the construction with akṛṇoḥ see disc. ad vs. 1.
There is a slight syntactic clash between ablative víśvasmāt, appropriate to a
comparative (“lower than all”), and the superlative adhamā́n, which should have a
genitive (“lowest of all”).
The dual verbs of cd (ábādhethām ámṛṇatam … ávindethām) must have Indra
and Soma as subjects, as the larger context (vss. 1-2) and the explicit Vāyav Indraś
ca construction in 5b show. But the immediate context (vs. 3) falsely suggests Indra
and Agni on the basis of 3a.

### IV.28.5  
Note #índraś ca here and #índraś ca(krám) in 2b. Also, presumably we get a
reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction here (índraś ca soma rather than standard soma
índraś ca), so that Indra can be pāda-initial, as in 1b, 2b.
There is clear (and fairly unusual) enjambement over the hemistich boundary:
… ūrvám áśvyaṃ góḥ / ádardṛtam, with the obj. of the verb in c found in b. There is
disagreement about the disposition of the rest of the 2nd hemistich. The publ. tr. takes
ápihitāny áśnā as obj. of riricáthuḥ, with tatṛdānā́a dual pf. part. with acc. pl. kṣā́ḥ
as its obj. As indicated in the publ. intr. I identify those things “covered over by the
stone” to be the waters and cows that Indra released (in the Vṛtra and Vala myths
respectively). This fits with the use of ápihita- in 1d. Ge also takes ápihitāni as obj.
of riricáthuḥ, but the last three words, kṣā́ś cit tatṛdānā́as a simile (marked by cid,
which he considers a possible simile marker, and I don’t). For him tatṛdānā́is
passive and kṣā́ḥ is nom. sg. WG take ápihitāni as a second obj. of ā́dardṛtam. The
obj. of riricáthuḥ is, for them, kṣā́ḥ (acc. pl.), which also serves as obj. of tatṛdānā́,
which they consider dual and transitive, as I do. Their interpr. of cd follows that of
Kü (216, 424), and it is certainly grammatically possible. However, I do not
understand what it would mean to release the dwelling places (Kü) or the parts of the
earth (WG) (e.g., WG “Ihr habt die Erdteile freigelassen”), whereas the release of the
pent-up waters after drilling through the earth fits the Indra mythology perfectly.
The cadence of b is bad and would be improved by reading *tātṛdānā́, as
Arnold suggested and Old seems tentatively to accept.
## IV.29 Indra

### IV.29.1  
I take mandasānáḥ in a prospective or purpose sense, like the caus.
mandayádhyai in 3b, because Indra is surely not getting exhilarated while on his
journey.

### IV.29.2  
The phrase ábhīrur mányamānaḥ is troublesome. The other three
occurrences of ábhīru- all mean ‘fearless’, but “thinking himself fearless” is an odd
thing to say about Indra. For one thing, he’s such a mighty warrior that there seems
no need to assert fearlessness about a creature for whom fear would be unthinkable
(though recall his flight at the end of I.32, where he’s compared to a “frightened
falcon” [śyenó ná bhītáḥ I.32.14]). For another, X mányate (/-yamāna-) expressions
99
almost always identify the content of the thought as being the wrong idea about
oneself or someone else. But surely it’s not that Indra thinks he’s fearless but is
actually terrified. For this reason I take this bahuvrīhi to mean ‘not having -- that is,
not producing -- fear’ (in others). This is a sense that Gr allows (‘nicht
furchterregend’), though for a different passage. The point here would be that Indra
is coming to the sacrifice to have a jolly soma drink-up with the pressers, thinking
he’s just a regular guy, not a terror-inspiring deity. Note that he “produces
fearlessness” (kárat … ábhayam) for us in the next vs.

### IV.29.3  
I take vājayádhyai not to the denom. vājayá- ‘seek prizes’, but the primary -
áya- formation vājáya- ‘rouse’. It shows accent shift in the -dhyai infinitive, just as
mandayádhyai does.
If we maintain the transmitted text, I do not know what to do with prá in b,
apparently interrupting the expression júṣtām ánu … díśam (though this interruption
is mitigated by its immediately flg. the caesura). √mand does appear with prá,
though not terribly often, so it might go with the infinitive. Or one can supply a verb
of motion: “(he goes / send him) forth to make him reach exhilaration.” Ge cites
similar pū́rvam ánu prá díśam in I.95.3 and also suggests that an impv. parallel to
śrāváya should be supplied. However, the most likely solution is that endorsed by
Old: to read pradíśam, a reading already found in Gr.

### IV.29.5  
Ge (/WG) construe the part. bhejānā́saḥ one way or another with syāma
(Ge: “… möchten wir … deines himmlischen Reichtums teilhaftig werden”). This is
certainly possible. However since this leaves te in b somewhat orphaned and since
“may we be yours” is a frequent sentiment (e.g., II.11.13), I have separated the
participle from syāma, respecting the hemistich boundary.
## IV.30 Indra

### IV.30.2  
Ge takes víśvā with kṛṣṭáyaḥ, but in this sandhi situation it would have to
represent a corruption of víśvāś. See Old for disc. of this form. I take it as a neut. acc.
pl.

### IV.30.3  
The neg. scope problem potentially posed by víśve … ná -- “all did not” vs.
“not all did” -- can be easily solved. See my 1997 “Vedic anyá- 'another, the other':
syntactic disambiguation,” where I establish that the independent negative ná coocurs
with víśva- only with the corporate entity víśve devā́ḥ, enforcing a meaning “all did
not.”
Reading *yūyudhuḥ would provide a better cadence. Old tentatively endorses
this.
The sense of pāda c is not entirely clear, but there are several factors that
allow us to close in on the meaning. First, it seems to provide the reason why the
gods did not fight Indra. Further, ā́tiraḥ recurs in vs. 7, and it seems unlikely that the
two identical verbs would have substantially different meanings. Finally, as far as I
100
can tell, all occurrences of náktam are temporal (‘by night’); when poets want to
refer to night as an entity or entities they use rā́trī-, aktú-, or kṣáp-. (On uṣā́sā
náktam in VIII.27.2, see comm. ad loc.) Therefore tr. like Ge (/WG) that take áhā
náktam as parallel objects (e.g., Ge “als du Tage und Nacht abgrenztest”) cannot be
correct. As indicated in the publ. intro., I think that this pāda concerns Indra’s
destabilization of time when he steals the Sun’s wheel -- a myth that will be
glancingly related in the next tṛca. What exactly is going on I don’t know -- it sounds
as if Indra fast-forwards or skips over days during the night, perhaps because the Sun
can’t make his normal daily circuit and therefore daytime is significantly abbreviated
and no longer lasts as long as night?
IV.30.4–6: All three vss. of this tṛca begin with yátra. I take them all as subordinated
to vs. 3. Ge [/WG] and Klein (DGRV I.432) take the main clause for all three vss. to
be 6c, but Indra’s help for Etaśa does not seem sufficiently significant to carry the
whole tṛca. Ge (/WG) take all three yátra as ‘where’, not ‘when’, but what location
they are thinking of I don’t know.
I do not know what to do with the utá’s in yátrotá in 4 and 6, but assume they
are there to indicate the additive nature of the sequence of subordinate clauses. Sim.
Klein (DGRV I.431–32). It would be better if the first one were in vs. 5, not vs. 4.

### IV.30.4  
√muṣ takes a double acc.

### IV.30.5  
It seems curious that in vs. 3 it is emphatically stated that the All Gods did
not fight Indra, and yet here he is fighting them -- in what I consider the same
circumstances, namely the theft of the Sun’s wheel. This problem clears up if we
render both yuyudhuḥ in 3b and áyudhyaḥ in 5b as ‘attack’. The gods were reluctant
to attack him after he showed his power over time and the Sun, but he did not hang
back in attacking them though he was alone.

### IV.30.6  
The Pp reads prá āvaḥ, which would make it a main clause verb and pāda c
the resolution of the subordinated yátra clauses. This reading is followed by Ge
(/WG) and Klein. My reasons for rejecting this interpr. were given above, and with
Old I interpr. the ambig. prā́vaḥ as pra-ā́vaḥ, a subordinated verb.
I do not understand what is going on in ab. Who is the mortal who benefits
from Indra’s deed -- perhaps Kutsa? And what action does áriṇā(ḥ) … sū́ryam
describe. The root √rī means ‘flow’ (etc.), and the nasal pres. means ‘let flow’, but in
certain contexts, often hostile, it can have the developed meaning ‘dissolve’ or ‘let
overflow’. I’ve tr. ‘let slip’ here, but without certainty. Does it mean ‘let flow’ -- that
is, let the Sun continue on his way after the incident with the wheel? or is the sense
more sinister: the Sun slips away from its usual path? The presence of the Sun’s
horse Etaśa doesn’t help, as Indra gives aid to Etaśa even when he is attacking the
sun.
101
IV.30.7–12: After a tṛca on stealing the Sun’s wheel there follow two more on the
related myth of Indra’s crushing Dawn’s cart. The myth is actually confined to vss.
8–11, with the two outer vss. semi-independent. WG (nn. to vss. 10, 11) suggest a
radical interpr. of this sequence: that Uṣas here is the name of the female leader of a
matriarchal tribe who opposed the territorial expansion of Vāmadeva’s group. This
seems reductive in the extreme, and since the Uṣas vss. immediately follow the
treatment of the stealing of the Sun’s wheel, a cosmic rather than local interpr.
imposes itself. They must also explain why this local matron is called “daughter of
Heaven” (duhitáraṃ diváḥ) twice (8d, 9a): acdg. to them, it is her boast, which the
poet jeers at. The only advantage of this unlikely interpr. is that it accounts for the
localization of her crushed cart at the Vipāś river (acdg. to WG, where she lived), but
this hardly seem sufficient.

### IV.30.7  
In c átra seems to correspond to the three yátra’s in the preceding tṛca. The
point seems to be that even after all the energy Indra expended in his fight with the
sun (and the gods), he still has a lot of manyú- left to apply in the Uṣas incident.
The repetition of ā́tiraḥ here was already noted ad vs. 3. Note the similarity of
the pādas: 3c (yád) áhā … ā́tiraḥ / 7c (átr)ā́ha … ā́tiraḥ; though áhā ‘days’ in 3 and
the particle áha in 7 are unrelated, the echo is surely deliberate.
I supply “lying there” with Dānu, because in two of the four singular passages
containing dā́nu- what the Dānu does is ‘lie’: I.32.9 dā́nuḥ śaye; II.12.11 dā́nuṃ
śáyānam. So, although ‘overcame’ is probably part of the semantics of ā́tiraḥ, the lit.
sense ‘pass over’ fits having the prostrate enemy as the object.
IV.30.8–21: These vss. are tr. by Hoffmann (Injunk., 184–86).

### IV.30.8  
The juxtaposition of vīryám … paúṃsyam “manly and masculine” with
stríyam “woman” brings the gender polarization into sharp relief. There is certainly
no sense that it’s unseemly or unsporting to hit a girl!

### IV.30.9  
The voc. indra was omitted in the publ. tr., so “o Indra” should be inserted
at the end.

### IV.30.12  
vibālī́- is almost universally taken as the name of (another) river, though
the name (and indeed the word) shows up nowhere else. By contrast, in the first ed.
of the dictionary (1872) MonWms. takes it as an adj. vibālya- “passed beyond a state
of youth, in full vigor; swollen (said of a river),” though in the 2nd ed. (1899) it is
simply the fem. river name vibālī́-. WG take it not as a toponym but with the sense
‘mit breiter Öffnung’. An attributive adjective would certainly be preferable to an
unlocatable placename. Although WG give no explan. of their interpr., it rests on
earlier discussions, whose details can be recovered in EWA (s.v.). EWA considers it
the name of a river (produced from the confluence of the Vipās and the Śutudrī), but
derived from a word with the same (or similar) sense as WG ascribe to it: ‘dessen
102
Ufer weit auseinanderstehen’, an early MIA word with -bāra- representing pārá- ‘far
shore’. See the lit. cited there.

### IV.30.16  
This son of the unwed maiden appears to be the same one who was being
eaten by ants in IV.19.9 (in the same Indra cycle); see comm. there. These tantalizing
snippets are all we know about the story.

### IV.30.17  
WG render asnātā́rā as “ohne dass sie untertauchen,” flg. Tichy (Nom.Ag.
107). It seems to me to be pushing the syntax to render a negated agent noun as the
equivalent of negative purpose clause (though in her comment Tichy simply says that
it’s “gleichzeitig,” presumably with the time of the main verb), though it is also the
case that we don’t know much if anything about swimming in ancient India.

### IV.30.19  
The blind man and the lame one also figure in IV.19.9, along with the son
of the unmarried woman; see vs. 16 above. The blind and the lame form a pair
elsewhere in the RV, e.g., I.112.8; II.13.12, 15.7; VIII.79.3.
The infinitival phrase ná … áṣṭave is rendered in the publ. tr. “not to be
equalled,” though it lit. means “not to be reached/attained.” The lit. tr. implies that no
one can actually receive Indra’s favor, but I think the point is rather that favor such
as Indra’s cannot be deployed by anyone else (that is, any other deity) -- hence the
adjustment in the English. On this interpr, see Hoffmann (185). Ge supplies “with
words” (i.e., “not to be obtained [with words]”), presumably meaning that no poet
can describe the extent of Indra’s favor.

### IV.30.23  
Note the rare future subjunctive kariṣyā́(ḥ), otherwise found only in
corrupted form in I.165.9; see comm. there, as well as Old on our passage.

### IV.30.24  
The voc. ādure is a hapax, and there is no agreement about whether it is a
PN or an attributive adj. and whether it is addressed to a deity (possibly Indra) or a
human (possibly a patron). Nor does it seem likely that any definitive answers can be
obtained, given the stark paucity of evidence. I have therefore tr. it as a PN as the
line of least resistance, and I think it quite unlikely that it is addressed to Indra:
would relatively low-level gods be giving things to Indra, and do gods ever receive,
rather than give, vāmá-? I tentatively assume that it is the name of the/a patron.
Although this vs. is not technically a dānastuti, it occupies the position in the hymn
where a dānastuti would be found, with mention of the human patron, and in opening
out to a range of (mostly minor) gods, the mention of a mortal would not be amiss.
On the hapax kárūḷatī see EWA s.v.
## IV.31 Indra
According to Old the hymn is in tṛcas, but Ge asserts that it consists of 3 verse
pairs and 3 tṛcas. Ge concedes that vss. 1–3 occur as a unit in SV, VS, and AV, but
argues that the content and form of the verses speak for a different division: vss. 1-2
are questions, vss. 3-4 both begin with the same word, and vss. 5-6 concern the
103
relation between Indra and Sūrya. After this verse, again on formal and thematic
grounds, he considers the rest tṛcas. Despite these considerations, Old’s view seems
correct. That both 3 and 4 begin with abhí (used in two different senses) is scarcely
remarkable; note the verbal concatenation between tṛcas in the next hymn, IV.32.3–4.
Moreover, vs. 3 fits more comfortably with the preceding vss.: The question “with
what help?” (káyā … ūtī́) posed in vs. 1 is answered in vs. 3 with the assertion that
Indra will be our “helper with help” (avitā́… ūtíbhiḥ), a satisfying finale to a tṛca.
Vss. 5–6 do indeed involve Indra and Sūrya, but vs. 4 provides the lead-in to Indra’s
journey continued in vs. 5.

### IV.31.5  
In b I read ā́hā not ā́hā (a change only in the Pp. not the Saṃhitā text), and
analyze this sequence as ā́+ áhā, the neut. pl. of ‘day’ (found also in IV.30.3 and
33.6; cf. also viśváhā in 12a below). This is one of only two supposed exx. of the
particle ha with long vowel; the other one (V.41.7) also follows ā́and is susceptible
to the same analysis. The ā-final version of ha is ghā, which shows Brugmann's Law
and velar outcome before original *o, acdg. to Mark Hale. Note that ha only once
elsewhere occurs after the preverb ā́(VIII.9.18 ā́hāyám …). (In fact an analysis
ā́hā́yám “this one through the days here …” is also possible in VIII.9.18, though I did
not so analyze it there.) By contrast ghā is found fairly commonly after ā́(I.30.8,
I.48.5, etc.).
“Along the slope of your intentions” (pravátā … krátūnām) means that the
journey to our sacrifice is an easy one because it is in accord with Indra’s intentions.
Why this should be like coming by foot (padéva) is not entirely clear: the journey is
so easy that it can be undertaken on foot? pleasant pedestrian rambles generally
involve taking an easy downward path? Neither of these seems particular applicable
to Indra’s travels.
When sácā occurs with a loc., it generally lacks lexical value and simply
signals a locative absolute -- as in the common expression suté sácā “when (the
soma) is pressed.” I think that is the intention here, in the phrase sū́rye sácā: it is a
temporal expression, “when the sun (rises)”; cf. I.135.3 and comm. ad loc. I have
here included a lexical tr. “in company with” because I think sácā, with lexical value,
needs to be supplied or understood in the next vs., 6c, for which see disc. below.
However, I would now be inclined simply to tr. here “I have taken my share at
sun(rise).”

### IV.31.6  
The purport of this verse is something of a puzzle. I think the point is that
the journey undertaken by Indra in vs. 4 has finally brought him here, with both his
battle-lust and his equipment on full display, in order to drink soma with the ritualists
(including the “I” of the speaker). Cf. nearby IV.29.2, where Indra presents himself
in a non-intimidating way (or so he thinks) and “becomes exhilarated along with the
heroes who have pressed the soma.” Here his arrival is at sunrise, and “I” have a
share in the soma along with Indra at that time. In order to make sense of 6c, we need
to understand/supply ábhakṣi from 5c (as Ge [/WG] do also). Although Klein
(DGRV II.129) thinks the two ádha’s in c have different functions, the pointed
104
parallel structure of that short pāda -- ádha LOC ádha LOC -- makes that conclusion
quite unlikely in its strong form -- though I think it is the case that the formal
parallelism conceals a functional distinction (different from the one suggested by
Klein). The question is how to construe the locatives, and it is here that the sácā in 5c
comes into play. As I noted apropos of that pāda, the sácā there seems just to signal
that the loc. sū́rye is a functional loc. absol. In our pāda c there is no sácā, but I think
it should be understood. On the one hand, it again (silently) marks sū́rye as a loc.
absol.; however, with índre I suggest it has lexical value (as it likely has in the two
occurrences of tvé sácā in the next hymn [IV.32.3c, 4a]), indicating that “I” take my
share in Indra’s company. What I am suggesting is that a non-overt sácā, supplied on
the basis of its occurrence in the previous vs., has two different functions in a single
pāda, a pāda whose structure suggests that its parts should be rigidly parallel. This is
not sufficiently conveyed by the published tr. -- I am not sure that English is up to
conveying it -- which I would now emend to “(I have taken my share) now in
(company with) you, now in (company with) the sun (i.e., at sunrise).”
IV.31.7–8: My interpr. of the structural relationship of these two vss. and of the
internal structure of vs. 8 differs considerably from the standard. Because of the
parallelism of the openings of these vss., both with utá smā, I think that there should
be two parallel clauses. But vs. 7 is a hí clauses with accented verb (āhúḥ), whereas
the only verb in vs. 8 is maṃhase in pāda c. I am also puzzled by the pári in 8a,
which is difficult to construe with the rest. There is no pári √maṃh elsewhere, and
pári is in any case not situated where we would expect a preverb in tmesis. WG tr.
valiantly “du schenkst … ringsum,” which works in a pinch but I find it unsatisfying.
I suggest instead that pāda a contains an abbreviated form of a common formula
containing both pári and sádyaḥ and a verb of motion. Cf. in IV: nearby IV.33.1 pári
dyā́ṃ sadyó apáso babhūvuḥ; IV.45.7 yéna sadyáḥ pári rájāṃsi yātháḥ; IV.51.5
pariprayāthá bhúvanāni sadyáḥ. And elsewhere, e.g., I.115.3 pári dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́yanti
sadyáḥ; I.123.8 ékaikā krátum pári yanti sadyáḥ; I.128.3 évena sadyáḥ páry eti
pā́rthivam; III.58.8 pári dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́yāti sadyáḥ; V.47.4 diváś caranti pári sadyó
ántān; VII.5.7 vāyúr ná pā́thaḥ pári pāsi sadyáḥ; VII.75.4 páñca kṣitī́ḥ pári sadyó
jigāti. Given the remarkable number of such collocations, I find it difficult to believe
that our poet is not evoking this formula. Since much of this hymn concerns Indra’s
journey, it would be contextually appropriate. That vs. 9 asserts that no hindrances
can obstruct Indra supports the journey theme. Then, by my interpr., pādas bc
constitute the main clause for vss. 7–8.

### IV.31.10  
The “hundred forms of help” found at the end of the first tṛca (3c) recurs
here at the beginning of this tṛca, following the two more challenging tṛcas in
between.

### IV.31.11  
The publ. tr. rather carelessly followed Ge’s “zu grossem, glanzvollem
Besitz,” but maháḥ is of course not a dat. like rāyé divítmate. It should either be
rendered as a gen./abl. of máh-, hence “for the heavenly wealth of/from a/the great
105
one” (so, e.g., tentatively Scar 45), or as the adv. maháḥ (see esp. Old, Kl. Schr. 729–
30 [=ZDMG (1901): 270–71] on mahó rāyé), hence “greatly for heavenly wealth.”
As Old points out, this phrase is very similar to V.79.1 mahé … rāyé divítmatī, with a
real dative mahé. The purport of the two expressions is probably the same. I would
now follow Old’s adverbial interpr. Indeed this very phrase is found a number of
times: IV.31.11, V.15.5, 43.1, VIII.23.16, X.61.22, 76.2, and in all cases the maháḥ
should be interpr. as adverbial, though the less punctilious “for great wealth”
probably captures the intended sense just as well.
The tr. of divítmate also needs to be revised. I now tentatively accept the
analysis of divít- and its deriv. divítmant- as div-ít-, a root noun cmpd containing the
root √i ‘go, come’. The word is rendered inconsistently in the publ. tr., as ‘heavenbound’ in I.26.2, ‘heavenly’ here and X.76.6 (though adjacent divít- is tr. ‘heavenbound’), and ‘heaven-bright’ in V.79.1. This inconsistency reflects the weakness of
both standard analyses of this formation, either as an -it-stem with a marginal suffix
or as a cmpd. Neither explan. is particularly compelling. For the former, see, e.g.,
AiG II.2.322, Re EVP 3.78–79 [ad V.79.1]; for the latter, e.g., Thieme (ZDMG
1961.100 = KlSch 176), AiG II.2.935 (Nachtr.), EWA s.v. dyáv- (p. 750), and
extensive disc. by Scar (44–46). The idea goes back at least to Wackernagel (Sb. Berl.
1918; see Re op cit.). In this particular case, since the wealth is presumably coming
from heaven, not going there, a lit. tr. would be “greatly for wealth coming from
heaven,” but “… for heaven-sent wealth” would be more idiomatic. The -mantsuffix seems pleonastic, as AiG II.2.877–78 points out, since the hapax divít- and
divítmant- appear both to be adjectives in the same meaning and are found adjacent
to each other in the same case in the one passage in which divít- is found (X.76.6).
The reason for -mant- rather than -vant- is likewise unclear (see AiG II.2.882, 891).
## IV.32 Indra

### IV.32.2  
The stem citrín- is a hapax, and it is not clear what the fem. pl. referents are.
Ge suggests ‘battles’. On the basis of the fem. pl. phrase in 5, citrā́bhiḥ … ūtíbhiḥ I
tentatively supply ‘means of help’; note that ūtíbhiḥ appeared at the end of the
previous vs., 1c.

### IV.32.3  
Ge takes ójasā as belonging to the enemy and providing the content of their
boast: “der sich mit seiner Stärke grosstut.” But since ójasā is almost always pādafinal no matter what part of the vs. it belongs with and since Indra’s ójas- is usually
what is referred to, I take it as Indra’s.
The comparative śáśīyas- occurs only twice in the RV, once in a very slangy
passages referring to a woman (V.61.6), in a usage that does not illuminate this one.
Context in our passage favors the rendering ‘more numerous’ (so also Gr, Ge), given
its contrast with dabhrébhiś cid “with only a few.” The question is how to get from
the positive śáśvant- ‘each and every, one after another, successive, recurrent,
continual’ to a comparative ‘more numerous’. The English expression “they just
106
keep coming, more and more” might be the clue. WG incorporate the literal sense of
śáśvant- but seem not to render the comparative: “die der Reihe nach erscheinenden.”
See disc. of sácā ad IV.31.5–6.

### IV.32.10  
The rel. prn. beginning pāda b, Saṃhitā yā́, is ambiguous: it can stand for
yā́(neut. pl. and presumably picking up immed. preceding vīryā̀in the main cl.) or
yā́ḥ (so Pp.) (fem. pl. and presumably anticipating púro dā́sīḥ in c). Neither is
syntactically satisfying: if it has vīryā̀as its antecedent, as normal syntactic practice
would expect, it doesn’t make sense in its clause: Indra didn’t “break into” his manly
deeds. If it refers to the fortresses, it works fine with the verb in its clause but has no
direct connection to the main clause. I assume the ambiguity was meant and loose
subordination was the reason. I render it as a general subordinator to avoid both bad
choices.

### IV.32.11  
Pāda b is most likely an embedded relative -- a very rare syntactic
phenomenon in the RV -- because the most likely reading of c is that the singers sing
(a) “at the pressings” (sutéṣu c), not that Indra performed his deeds sutéṣu. However,
it is just possible that sutéṣu could mean “in (the exhilaration of) the pressed soma
drinks” and therefore continue the rel. cl. in b. In any case in this casually assembled
Gāyatrī hymn, a syntactic violation does not seem too critical.

### IV.32.13  
The use of śáśvant- here seems unconnected to the comparative śáśīyaṃsin 3a. Since vs. 13 is found also in VIII.65.7, it may simply have been imported from
elsewhere; the structure of this hymn is very loose and seems to have been cobbled
together from standard tropes and formulae.

### IV.32.15  
The phrase matīnā́m … stómaḥ “the praise-song of our thoughts” refers to
the actual poetic composition that stems from our thoughts. In RVic discourse every
step from ‘mental inspiration’ to ‘thought’ to ‘song/poem’ can be used to refer to the
composed or formulated praise for a deity. Here we see the progression expressed.

### IV.32.16  
On the accent of ghásaḥ see III.52.3.

### IV.32.17  
For vyáti- (RV 3x), despite Mayrhofer’s apparent skepticism (EWA s.v.) I
follow Re’s deriv. (EVP 15: 37) from vi √yam with a presumed development ‘hold
separate/apart’ à ‘pair’, though Re doesn’t deign to indicate what the semantic
channel might be.
khārī́-, a measure of capacity’, is found only here and much later in the sūtras
and Classical Skt, but it appears to be widespread in MIA. See EWA s.v.

### IV.32.20  
mā́dabhrám (“not a little!”) is a prohibitive lacking a verb, though an aor.
injunc. can easily be supplied of course: *dāḥ matching the impv. dehi in the positive
expression preceding it. Or alternatively s-aor. *bhāḥ (i.e., *bhār) to match flg. bhara.
107

### IV.32.22  
This very obscure dānastuti begins by presenting itself as an explicit
formal praśasti (eulogistic praise), an important genre in later times and, in my
opinion, the missing link between Rigvedic praise poetry and Classical kāvya (see
Chap. IV in my Rigveda between Two Worlds), with the annunciatory verb prá …
śaṃsāmi. I think this high-style opening is meant as a deliberate contrast with the
bawdy nature of the gift praised.
As noted in the publ. intro. I consider “the two brown ones” (babhrū́) found in
all three vss. of the dānastuti (22–24) to be the breasts of a woman given to the poet
as a gift from his patron (a not-uncommon gift).
In c the poet playfully warns the patron not to stint on cows on the grounds
that he’s already given him something else. The expression is quite condensed.

### IV.32.23  
This is the most difficult vs. of the sequence and has given rise to multiple
contradictory, not to mention ludicrous, interpr. -- among which my own may be
numbered (although I certainly think it’s better than eyeballs). Note the two -káforms (kanīnaké(va), arbhaké), indicating slangy, low-register speech and quite
possibly associating it with women’s language. (For disc. see my 2008 “Women’s
Language in the RV” and 2009 "Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-kaSuffix: A Marker of Colloquial Register.") If the gift is really a woman, then evoking
women’s language would make sense.
On vidradhá- ‘undressed, without clothes’ see EWA s.v. As for drupadá-
‘post’, AV VI.63.3 ayasmáye drupadé “on a metal post” shows that the post need no
longer be wooden (despite dru-), just as “plastic glasses” does not strike an English
speaker as odd or contradictory. As I said in the publ. intro., I think the post refers to
the woman’s slender body, with two very prominent breasts, an ideal of a woman’s
body also encountered in Classical Skt. lit. The breasts are personified (“little babydolls”) and invested with some autonomy as they move about during sex.
Crosscultural parallels in sexual slang could surely be found.
[IV.33–37 JPB]
## IV.38 Dadhikrā
The middle vss. of this hymn are introduced by repeated utá sma (5, 6, 8, 9),
varied by utá syá in 7. As noted in the publ. intro, this sequence of ‘and’s adds to the
sense of speed.

### IV.38.1  
Although the Anukramaṇī takes Heaven and Earth to be the deity of this vs.,
the unidentified duals must rather refer to Mitra and Varuṇa, as also in vs. 2. This is
clear from IV.39, where Mitra and Varuṇa give Dadhikrā to the Purus (2cd, 5cd).
The publ. tr. doesn’t accurately reflect sánti in pāda a. The tr. should read
“Since there are earlier gifts …”
The form nitośé is much disputed. Gr identifies it as a 3rd sg. to the thematic
pres. tośate (otherwise unaccented), but not only is there a perfectly fine -te 3rd sg.
(tośate 4x) while a t-less 3rd sg. would be anomalous, but given the full-grade we
108
would expect root accent (*nitóśe). Old vacillates but displays a weak preference for
a 3rd sg. unreduplicated perfect, and Ge, who does not comment, appears to follow
him (“… ausgeschüttet hat”). Despite this scholarly pedigree, this solution appears to
me to have little to recommend it: non-reduplicated perfects are quite rare. Gotō (1st
Kl, 167–68) also vacillates: if it’s a verb it’s a non-redupl. pf. Or it might be the loc.
of a noun nitośá-; this appears to be the view represented in WG. There does exist a
them. noun tośá-. Re also tentatively suggests a locative but “à nuance semiinfinitive,” tr. “pour être déversées.” I find Re’s interpr. appealing, though, as often,
somewhat cavalier about grammar. I would like to take the form directly as a dative
root noun in infinitival usage, but we should probably expect *nituśé. It may have
been adjusted to match the grade of tośá-, or the loc. ending -é of the them. noun may
have been reinterpr. as a purpose dative. One might expect the hapax naitośá- to
provide some help, but it is only found in the impenetrable Aśvin hymn X.106.6,
which appears to be written in code. In any event, the point of the hemistich seems to
be that Mitra and Varuṇa provided gifts to Trasadasyu, who then redistributed them
to his subjects the Purus in an appropriately kingly way.

### IV.38.2  
On -niṣṣídh- see comm. ad III.51.5. It is possible here that -niṣṣídh- ‘tributes’
are owed to Dadhikrā rather than provided by him. Cf. Klein (DGRV I.420) “to
whom many tributes are due”; this would fit better with carkṛ́tyam aryáḥ.
For pruṣita-psu- ‘frothing at the mouth’ (< ‘having spraying breath’), see
EWA s.v. psu-.

### IV.38.3  
There is sharp difference of opinion about the sense of medhayú-: is it built
to medhā́- ‘wisdom’ or médha- ‘ritual offering, meal’? The former is the choice of
Ge, Re, Mayr (tentatively, EWA, s.v. medhā́-), while Gr, Scar (188), and I opt for
‘meal’. (WG’s rendering “wie ein Opfertier Verlangender” must also reflect this
médha- stem.) The ‘meal’ interpr. fits well with gṛ́dhyantam ‘greedy’, and it also
makes more sense to me that a horse would want something to eat rather than
wisdom. Moreover, if Dadhikrā represents the sacrificial horse in the Aśvamedha,
there is a (sinister) echo of the name of this sacrifice: the horse is unwittingly seeking
his own sacrifice. It can, of course, also be a pun.

### IV.38.4  
This vs. contains a number of puzzles, though the general purport -- the
success of Dadhikrā in battles and raids -- is clear.
gádhya- elsewhere (3x) modifies vā́ja- ‘prize’, but that precise word can’t be
supplied here, because it is masc. and gádhyā must be neut. pl. Nonetheless, battle
spoils or the like must be meant. Ge’s rendering of gádhya- as “bis an die
Wagendecke reichende (Beute)” must rest on the later (sūtra) gadhā ‘Verdeck des
Lastwagens’ (see EWA s.v.), but given the chronological gap and the fact that EWA
considers the etym. of gadhā unklar, this seems unnecessary. Ge is consistent: the
other occurrences of gádhya- he tr. ‘deckenhohe’.
I take cárati … gáchan as a periphrasis, “keeps going,” though the standard tr.
take the two verbal forms separately. There is no way to tell.
109
The problematic form in this pāda is sánutaraḥ, about which there is no
consensus even on what part of speech it represents. The uncertainty can be seen
acutely in Mayrhofer’s changing approach to it. In KEWA (s.v. sanutáḥ) he
tentatively decides to follow AiG II.2.596, 608, 698 in taking it as a comparative
built to the verb stem sanóti, meaning ‘mehr gewinnend’ (an interpr. that goes back,
one way or the other, to Sāy.). But in EWA (s.v. sanutár) he has changed his mind,
attaching it rather to the adv. sanutár ‘away’, attributing its aberrant form to
reinterpretation by this late poet, and citing Tichy (Nom. agen. 58–59), who suggests
it’s a comparative to the adv. Both Ge and Re derive it from √san ‘win’, though in
different ways: Ge’s tr. (“als bester Gewinner”) seems to reflect the comparative
interpr. favored by Sāy. and AiG (though transposed into the superlative); Re
(“gagnant”) explicitly suggests that it stands for *sánutra-, formed like tárutra-, an
interpr. that Gr also gestures towards. Old favors a connection with the adv. sanutár,
as do WG (flg. Tichy), tr. “immer ferner wandelt.” My tr. reflects an analysis as
comparative agent noun to √san (“as one better at winning”), but I do not feel
strongly about it. In fact, I would probably now emend my tr. to “keeps going further
in (the contests for) cows”: the contrast between his hemming in the booty in a and
himself going further in b would be thematically nice, and if I am correct about the
meaning of d, the expansion of the horse’s wanderings further and further would be
appropriate to what is expressed in d. But I am not certain that this question can be
decided.
My interpr. of āvírṛjīkaḥ rests on Thieme’s (Unt. p. 40, n. 2): 'an dem der
Schaum hervortritt’. This image responds to pruṣitápsum in 2c.
vidáthā nicíkyat recurs in AV V.20.12.
The last pāda is the most baffling of all. The second part of it, páry ā́pa āyóḥ,
is also found at I.178.1 (q.v.). The major question is the identity of ā́paḥ: is it a form
of √āp ‘reach, acquire’, whether verbal or nominal (so Ge, WG); is it a derivative of
ápas- ‘work’ (so Gr, Re; dubious EWA s.v. ápas-); or is it the nom. pl. of áp- ‘water’,
used as an acc. (Old, Thieme, WG possibly [in n.])? I follow Thieme’s interpr.
(Unters. 40–41), which sees “the waters of Āyu” as an expression referring to land
habitable because it is well watered. If this phrase is essentially locational, then one
might expect the preceding tiró aratím to be as well: “across the aratí-.”
Unfortunately, though Thieme’s general interpr. of aratí- I find persuasive, his tr. of
this phrase “schneller als die Räder [seines Wagens]” is problematic, because I do
not see how tiráḥ can mean ‘faster’. It is always otherwise a preposition/adverb. I
therefore think Dadhikrā is being depicted as crossing the aratí and racing around
“the waters of Āyu.” These two locational phrases may refer to the ritual ground, as
Old suggests: the horse runs across the fire on the ritual ground and around the water
vessels used for the sacrifice. Or, my preference, it can refer to the territory of the
Ārya, which the horse traverses and thus, as it were, claims for his owner (much as
the Aśvamedha horse does in his year-long pre-sacificial ramble). What aratí- would
stand for in this scenario isn’t entirely clear to me -- but since aratí- can mean
‘spoked wheel, circlet, circle’, I would tentatively suggest that the horse runs across
a notional circle of land belonging to / claimed by / aspired to by the Ārya and then
110
around the periphery of this circle to enclose it as Ārya possession. I would therefore
now emend my tr. to “across the circle (of Ārya land), around the waters of Āyu.”

### IV.38.5  
The lexeme ánu √kruś is later a semi-technical term for raising the hue-andcry, which would be appropriate in this context.
There is a phonological echo of 4c nicíkyat in 5c nīcā́yamānam, although the
latter is to be analyzed as nīcā́+áyamānam. The latter belongs to the marginal
thematized pres. áyate to √i (see Gotō, 1st Kl., 92–97). There is one other occurrence
of this medial part. in the RV, otherwise a few finite forms, some of which are
ambiguous between subjunctive to the root pres. and indicative to a them. pres.

### IV.38.6  
The referent and construction of āsu require discussion. Ge (/WG) construe
it with prathamáḥ (“first among these”) and supply “cows.” But this doesn’t make
sense if the meaning is “desiring to run first among these,” because that conjures up a
picture of the horse leading a stampede of cattle in a race -- surely not an ancient
Indian sporting event or battle array! If the āsu is to be construed with the rest of its
pāda, it should refer to the ranks of chariots in b (śréṇibhī ráthānām): śréṇi- is fem.
and the image appears to be of Dadhikrā leading a charge of chariots, a far more
likely scenario. However, I think unaccented āsu is simply taking (modified)
Wackernagel’s position in the clause and should be construed with ní veveti in b: the
horse is bearing down on the females. (Note that ní veveti … āsu is found also in
III.55.9.) Even so, I would not supply ‘cows’: although we are (too) accustomed to
having (notional) cows as the goal of a hypermasculine animal in the ever-repeated
formulae in Maṇḍala IX, where Soma the bull seeks cows in the form of milk, in fact
Dadhikrā should be seeking mares, not cows, if this is about his desire to mate.
However, if he is not seeking mates, but merely prizes, cows will do. (And note
cárati góṣu gáchan in 4b, where the cows are explicit.)
The sexual reading I suggest for ab may be supported by pāda c, where I
follow Gr, Re, and WG (in n.) in taking jánya- as a member of a wedding party, not
merely a man ‘belonging to (one’s own) people, Landsmann’. For jánya- in a
wedding context, see AV XI.8.1–2. Here the comparison is presumably between the
garland of the winner of the race and that of a suitor or groomsman at a wedding.
Ge and Re (EVP 15.163) render kiráṇam as ‘rein’ (Ge Zügel, Re rêne), flg.
Sāy. (āsyagataṃ khalīnam), though Re appears to recant in his n. Neither etymology
nor the other occurrences of the word (not so tr. by Ge, e.g.) support this interpr., and
context also favors a version of ‘dust’ (so WG ‘Stäubchen’). Note kirate reṇúm
“scatters dust” in 7d, where the verb kirate echoes kiráṇa-.

### IV.38.7  
On pāda b (=VII.19.2) see comm. on the latter passage. As discussed there,
although the standard tr. (here Ge, Re, WG) take śúśrūṣamāṇaḥ as a form of √śruṣ
‘obey’ and tr. accordingly, it is simply a well-formed desiderative to √śru ‘hear / be
heard/famed’ (so classified by Gr, Wh [Rts], Heenen), with the mid. meaning
‘desiring fame (for oneself), desiring to be(come) famed’.
111
Pāda c contains another unidentified fem. loc. pl., the pres. part. yatī́ṣu. Old,
Ge, and Re take the referent to be the ranks of chariots from 6b, WG cows. I again
prefer mares (though the other two are possible, depending on how it is construed). I
take the túram, the acc. sg. of a root noun (see Schindler s.v., though I do not follow
his interpr. of this passage), as an adverb. It forms a phrasal verb with √i ‘go hastily’
(so approx. Old). In context túraṃ ya(tī́ṣu) is a close match to the immed. following
turáyan. It would be an even better match if the 2nd participle were turaṇyán (two
forms of this verbal stem are found in the Dadhikrā hymn IV.40: turaṇyatáḥ 3a,
turaṇyati 4a, and cf. also turaṇyasát 2b), and I am tempted to think that the poet had
this stem in mind, but opted for phonologically similar turáyant- because his
preferred form would have produced a bad break. Like turaṇyasát in 40.2, our form
would be a deliberate deformation of the expected one to fit metrical circumstances,
though our turáyan makes no morphological difficulties, unlike turaṇyasát.

### IV.38.9  
As Old points out, the contrastive lexemes sám √i and ví √i are juxtaposed
in samithé viyántaḥ.

### IV.38.10  
The first hemistich contains a three-termed simile / frame construction, in
which all three terms are realized in both simile and frame. This is fairly unusual.
Re nicely points out that the product of d would be what is later called the
madhuparka, the concoction offered to an honored guest.
## IV.39 Dadhikrā
As was noted in the publ. intro., the middle hymn of the small Dadhikrā cycle
differs in style and content from the hymns before and after, presenting a formal
praśasti-type encomium.

### IV.39.1  
The hopes expressed for “my” improvement and safety in the 2nd hemistich
are presumably in service of my producing a good praise-hymn.

### IV.39.2  
I take kratu-prā́- as referring to the poet’s own krátu- ‘intention, conception’
-- that is, producing the praise-hymn he has envisioned. So also Re and (partly) WG.
Others consider it the krátu- of others or of all, and Old suggests an emendation to
*kratupráḥ (gen.) because he thinks it more applicable to Dadhikrā than the poet.
This cmpd seems to play off kṛṣṭi-prā́- in the last hymn (IV.38.9b) in structure and
phonology, but since it is found once elsewhere, as is the derivative kratu-prā́van-,
both in the same hymn (X.100.12 and 11 respectively), it was not simply created here
for the occasion on that model. That both words in X.100 refer to a poet/singer as
here undercuts Old’s justification for his emendation.
Maurer (324–25) renders puruvā́ra- as ‘richly tailed’ (vā́ra- ‘tail-hair’ beside
vā́ra- ‘favor, choice thing’), an interpr. also given by Scar (332) as an alternative
(‘mit den buschigen Schwanzhaaren’). I find this appealing (as a pun, not as the
primary reading) -- but ultimately unlikely: unlike the other hymns in this sequence,
112
no other physical attributes or characteristics of Dadhikrā, save his swiftness, are
described in this hymn.
In the 2nd hemistich pūrúbhyaḥ … táturim was mistakenly tr. twice in the publ
tr. Eliminate the last phrase “as one triumphant for the Pūrus.”

### IV.39.3  
The interpretive problem in this vs. is caused by the length of a single
vowel: sá instead of *sā́in d. The most obvious contextual reading of the pāda is that
Aditi should act in concert with Mitra and Varuṇa, but of course Aditi is feminine
and the pronoun is masc. Sāy. makes Dadhikrā the referent and is followed by Ge,
Re, Maurer, and (tentatively, see their n.) WG. (Maurer in fact takes Dadhikrā also as
the subj. of kṛṇotu in c and interprets áditiḥ as a masc. adj. ‘free of bond’.) Old
discusses at some length and comes to a solution (in agreement with Hillebrandt)
somewhat like Maurer’s: that the subject of both c and d is Dadhikrā in the guise of /
identified with Aditi. I find all this unlikely; despite the syntactic problem, I think the
subject of d has to be Aditi, who has a close natural connection with her sons Mitra
and Varuṇa (unlike Dadhikrā). Masc. sá may simply show attraction to the adj.
sajóṣāḥ, which is ambig. between masc. and fem. Or, in my opinion more likely, the
pāda may have been incompletely adapted from one in which the referent of sá was
Aryaman, the standard third member of this trio. No exact parallel is found in the RV,
but cf. passages like I.90.1, I.186.2=VII.60.4 and, with Aditi, VI.51.5 and V.31.5.
Another possibility, that the sá refers to the mortal poet favored by Aditi in c, was
essentially closed off by Old, who persuasively argues that sajóṣa(s)- refers almost
without exception to the relationship of gods with gods or, less frequently, mortals
with mortals -- but not interspecies relationships, as it were.

### IV.39.4  
There are several ways to configure the syntax of this vs. The first question
is whether the genitives in pāda a should be construed with the verb of b. But since
ámanmahi takes an acc. (nā́ma) in b, this seems unlikely (though Maurer does it that
way), and the standard tr. (including mine) supply in pāda a a form of √kṝ ‘pay
tribute’, which has dominated the hymn so far (1ab, 2a, 3a) and consistently takes the
gen. (The aor. ákārīt in the preceding vs. [3a], or rather the 1st pl. equivalent, seems
the obvious form to supply.) The question then arises what the relationship between
pādas a and b is. Ge seems to take pāda a as the main cl. and b as dependent on it
(“… da wir …”), presumably subordinated by the yád ending pāda a. Re seems to
follow this interpr., though with some French curlicues of his own. This type of
structure, with one clause ending right before the final monosyllable of a pāda and
the next beginning with that monosyllable and continuing through the next pāda,
strikes me as an unprecedented, or at least exceedingly rare, clause configuration. If
one of these clauses is subordinated to the other, it should be the other way around,
with pāda-final yád marking what precedes as a subordinate clause and b as the main
clause. (Note that although yád is preceded by a lot of material, it all belongs to a
single NP.) In this account the accent on ámanmahi would be due to its pāda-initial
position. This is the way WG take it. My interpr. differs from both of these in making
both clauses in the first hemistich subordinate to cd, expressing a temporal
113
progression: after we have celebrated (aor.?) and brought to mind (aor.), then we call
upon (pres.).
The relationship between the genitives in a, which are simply strung together
without internal structure (dadhikrā́vṇa iṣá ūrjó maháḥ), is clarified in the next hymn
(IV.40.2d), where it is said that Dadhikrā(van) gave birth to íṣ- and ū́rj-.

### IV.39.5  
Dadhikrā as sū́danam mártyāya “making sweetness for the mortal” provides
a ring with 1c mā́m uṣásaḥ sūdayantu, though there the sweetening was attributed to
the dawns. Since vs. 6 is a summary vs. and in a different meter, the 1/5 ring defines
the outer edges of the poem.
## IV.40 Dadhikrā
See the publ. intro. for a disc. of the style. The poet likes repetitive figures: 2a
bhariṣó gaviṣó (b iṣá[ḥ]); 2ab duvanyasác, (chravasyā́d) … turaṇyasát (3a
turaṇyatáḥ … 4a turaṇyati); 2c dravó dravaráḥ (3a drávatas … 3c dhrájato); 5
śuciṣád … antarikṣasád … vediṣád … duroṇasát / nṛṣád varasád ṛtasád vyomasád;
5d abjā́gojā́ṛtajā́adrijā́; see others noted below. The means he uses to produce
these patterns are not always strictly grammatical and there are a number of hapaxes.
Orthodox Vedic linguists have not always responded to the exuberant linguistic
invention on display and have produced some plodding by-the-book analyses.

### IV.40.1  
As noted in the publ. intro., vs. 1 stands apart from the rest of this hymn and
is a simple variant on 39.1: our pāda a telescopes 39.1ab; our b corresponds to 39.1c;
and cd are an afterthought list in the genitive, attached loosely to the first pāda.

### IV.40.2  
Note pāda-initial sátvā (a) and satyó (c).
The first hapax we encounter is an easy one to account for (almost as though
the poet was breaking us in slowly): bhariṣá- ‘seeking plunder’ is modeled on immed.
flg. gaviṣá-; so Old, flg. AiG II.1.65. I think that iṣáḥ in the next pāda is also felt as
part of this series, although it has a different grammatical analysis and function.
The very puzzling rhyming pāda-final duvanyasát (a) and turaṇyasát (b), also
both hapaxes, have to be considered together, and the latter needs first to be put in
context with likewise pāda-final turaṇyatáḥ (gen. sg. part., 3a) and turaṇyati (3rd sg.
pres., 4a), both of which also have Dadhikrā as subject. Clearly the poet wanted to
position this signature word (see also 38.7c and comm. thereon) in the same place in
all 3 pādas, but since our verse is couched in the nom. sg., the grammatical form of
the part. would be turaṇyán, which would not fit (and a finite form would be out of
place, since the pāda already has a finite verb). He needs another syllable -- a point
also made by Scar (565). How exactly does he get it? Unfortunately I don’t have an
altogether satisfactory answer, but I am tolerably certain that the standard answer
given -- that this is a root-noun cmpd with final member from √sad -- is dead wrong.
It is true that vs. 5 has an impressive array of -sád- compounds, but their first
members are actual places, and, in the phrases in which they’re embedded, sitting
makes sense (e.g., 5b “a Hotar sitting at the vedi”). (For the function of these cmpds
114
in the hymn, see comm. ad vs. 5.) Here the horse is on a dizzying breakneck run --
“sitting” in or among anything is exactly opposite to the spirit of the vs., no matter
how attenuated “sit” might have become in the cmpd. And the supposed first member,
turaṇya-, is simply not a place to sit. So the various tr. offered -- Gr ‘in Raschheit
wohnend’, Ge ‘der unter den Spitzenführern sitzt’, Re ‘qui siège parmi ceux qui
foncent-en-avant’, Scar ‘unter die Vordringenden, Eifrigen, Eilenden setzend’, WG
‘der unter den Durchsetzenden Sitzende’ -- despite the worthiness of their attempts,
simply sound silly and significantly slow the onrush of this wonderful verbal picture.
My own suggestion begins with the class of -asāná- participles or pseudo-participles
like sahasāná- (on which see comm. ad IV.3.6). I suggest that our poet was familiar
with such forms (of which there are quite a few in IV; cf. nearby mandasānā́ḥ
IV.34.10, IV.35.6, etc.) and that he created an active participle on the model of these
apparent middles: mandāná- : mandasāná- :: turaṇyánt- à *turaṇyasánt-. Note that
the accent matches that of the -asāná- forms; note also that act. turaṇyasát fits a
Triṣṭubh cadence, while a med. *turaṇyasāná- would not. (The mandasāná- forms
just cited are pāda-final in Jagatī.) Why -sát? I would argue that it is the neuter in
adverbial usage; an original nom. sg. masc. in -sán may have been readjusted to
match the -sád- cmpds in vs. 5, but I am certain its origin was verbal.
Now what about duvanyasát? First, it is clear that the -anyasát part is
completely dependent on turaṇyasát. As we just saw, the latter belongs to a tight-knit
turaṇyá- set, but there is no *duvanyá-. The form is almost universally taken as a -
sád- cmpd. based on dúvas- ‘friendship’, similar to the denon. duvasyáti ‘offers
friendship, gives friendly reception to’. Scar (566) explicitly presents it as a crossing
of duvasyá- with turaṇyá-, “was bei der Experimentierfreude des Dichters von 4.40
akzeptable scheint.” The whole cmpd is then rendered ‘der unter den Bevorzugten …
sitzt’ (Ge), ‘qui siège parmi les privilégiés’ (Re), ‘unter die, denen Ehrung zuteil
wird, setzend’(?) (Scar), ‘unter den Huldigenden Sitzende’ (WG). Such an interpr.
requires pushing the semantics of dúvas- and its relatives rather further than seems
reasonable, while a more lit. ‘sitting among friends/those who offer friendship’
would be a somewhat comical description of a racehorse. Further it suffers from the
“sit” problem identified also for turaṇyasát: the horse is galloping at top speed, not
sitting in the bleachers with the grandees. I therefore reject the connection with
dúvas- and take my cue from Gr’s (ignored) interpr, ‘in der Ferne weilend’, ‘dessen
Wesen es ist, in die Ferne zu dringen’ -- in other words to associate the first member
with dūrá- ‘far’, with a thematized zero-grade duv-a- beside pre-consonantal dū-rá-
(and pre-vocalic full-grades dávīyas-, daviṣṭha). A similar derivation must account
for duvasanā́saḥ ‘going the distance’, vel sim. (e.g., Re ‘fonçant-au-loin, WG ‘sich
… entfernend’), in IV.6.10 (note, also in Maṇḍala IV), whose connection with dūrá-,
etc., is generally agreed upon, though its morphology is unclear and also owes
something to nearby forms. See comm. ad loc. It should be noted that Re in EVP 13
(1964) in his comm. to IV.6.10 suggests that our duvanyasát contains the ‘far’ word:
‘qui demeure loin (en arrière)’ and is oppositional to turaṇyasát ‘qui (va) rapidement
(en avant)’, but in EVP 15 (1966), which contains his tr. and comm. to IV.40, he has
substituted the tr. given above.
115
Pāda c produces a new set of problems, though happily much less intractable
than those just discussed. Though dravá- is found only here in the RV (but common
later), its derivation and meaning are straightforward. The next word, dravará-, is a
hapax, but transparently generated to the preceding dravá-. It may simply have the
suffix -ara- (so AiG II.2.215) like semantically similar patará- ‘flying’ (RV 3x), but
I wonder, given the missing syllable in this pāda, described by HvN as “a rest at the
5th place” (that is, directly before dravará-), whether dravará- is meant to remind us
of an allegro form of a compative in -tara-, slurred in rapid speech (though the
accent would be wrong). Finally, another hapax, pataṃgará-, owes its -rá- to
preceding dravará-, added to the well-established stem pataṃgá- (the
aforementioned patará- may also have played a part).
IV.40.3–4: These two vss. revisit the utá sma opening that characterized the middle
vss. of IV.38.
There is also a concentration of intensives: 3d táritrataḥ, 4c saṃtā́vīt
u
vat, 4d
āpaniphaṇat -- appropriate to the ever-increasing speed and the intense repetitive
movements of the horse racing to the finish line.

### IV.40.3  
The imagery of this vs. picks up the ‘flying’ (pataṃgaráḥ) of 2c.
In pāda a drávataḥ both looks back to dravó dravaráḥ in 2c (all derived from
the same root and with dravaráḥ metrically identical to and in the same metrical
position as drávataḥ) and forward to dhrájataḥ in 3c (same metrical shape and
position, rhyming forms).
Most tr. give ánu vāti additive semantics, ‘blows after, blows following’, but
elsewhere this lexeme means ‘fan (flames)’ (I.148.4, IV.7.10, VII.3.2, X.142.4). Here
I think it’s used figuratively, of the wind ruffling up mane/feathers. The standard tr.
(including mine) supply ‘wind’ as the subj.
As both Ge and Old point out, the parṇám ‘wing, feather(s)’ in the simile
lacks an overt correspondent in the frame, where we’d expect a body part of the
horse. Old suggests quick feet or (from Ludwig) the mane. I assume the latter, and in
fact I think that parṇám can be read with both simile and frame. In the simile parṇám
is used as a collective for the bird’s feathers, in the frame metaphorically for a
horse’s mane. (A Google search of “feathery mane” produces respectable results,
including a snatch of John Keats, “the eagle’s feathery mane” [“Hymn to Apollo”],
which shows the metaphor going the opposite direction.)
pragardhín- ‘greedy’ is appropriate for both the bird and Dadhikrā, as Ge also
points out: cf. IV.38.3 paḍbhír gṛ́dhyantam.
I follow Schaeffer (Intens. 131) in taking aṅkasám as referring to the curving
racetrack rather than, with some, as a curvy part of a horse. Since áṅkāṃsi in the next
vs. clearly refers to the racetrack, it’s unlikely that a related word would have an
entirely different referent in such close proximity.

### IV.40.4  
kṣipaṇí- is yet another hapax. The standard rendering is ‘lash’ (Ge:
Peitschenhieb, Re: coup-de-fouet), and the publ. tr. simply follows this. WG suggest
116
rather ‘in Beschleunigung’ (acceleration). Acdg. to their n. they take it as an
Inhaltsakk., flg. Gaedicke. This is possible, I suppose: ‘rushes a rush’ à ‘rushes a
flinging’ (‘flinging’ à ‘acceleration’). But since the similarly formed kṣipaṇú-
(IV.58.6) appears to be a physical weapon, a physical object seems likely here.
Moreover, this vs. abruptly confronts us with the harsh constraints imposed on the
horse by his rider -- “bound” in three places and whipped to frenzied running. The
lash is an important part of this picture. Until now Dadhikrā has been presented as an
untrammeled autonomous agent, but now the audience must suddenly reassess who’s
the boss, as it were. For the relationship between √kṣip ‘fling, hurl’ and whips, see
V.83.3 rathī́va káśayā́śvān abhikṣipán “Like a charioteer lashing out at his horses
with a whip.”
The two pādas of the 2nd half-vs. are nicely balanced, each ending with an
intensive participle preceded by a preposition phrase headed by ánu ‘following’ (in
the same metrical position). The two ánu phrases are contrastive, however: in c what
is being followed is mental (krátum), in d simply the physical course (pathā́m
áṅkāṃsi). Given the horse’s portrayal in the first half of the vs., we must now wonder
whose krátu- Dadhikrā is following. For most of this series we would have assumed
he follows his own -- he’s been shown as an irresistible force of nature -- but 4ab
show him under human control, confined in horse tackle and whipped, so we might
instead wonder if it is his rider’s krátu- that he is subject to.

### IV.40.5  
After the increasingly furious speed and frenzied activity in the last vss.,
culminating in the three intensives (two in the preceding hemistich, 4c, d), this vs.
brings it to a shockingly abrupt stop. Eight cmpds ending in ‘sit’ (-sád-), with a sense
exactly opposite to the preceding verbs of motion, decisively halt the movement and
impose a state of rest, even inertia. The horse is gone; I explicitly do not think this
series of phrases are meant to serve as predicates to an unexpressed Dadhikrā, pace
Old and WG. Instead I think these are images of tranquility, of beings in their proper
places, a vision of cosmic balance that has no need for the frenetic agitation we have
just witnessed. The lack of finite verbs and participles -- all verbal notions being
expressed by root-nouns in compound -- models this stasis. The -sád- cmpds give
way in the final pāda to 4 -jā́- ‘X-born’ cmpds. I am not entirely sure of their purpose,
but I think they sketch (however incomplete) the sources of the entities in the cosmos.
And we end with the single word ṛtám ‘truth’, which, perhaps, incorporates it all,
beyond which nothing more is needed and no motion required.
IV.41 Indra and Varuṇa
The patterning of the names of the two gods is mildly interesting. It is fairly
strict for the first half of the hymn but varies considerably in the 2nd. The first 5 vss.
have a discontinuous dual dvandva opening the first pāda, either as voc. índrā …
varuṇā (1a, 4a, 5a) or nom./acc. índrā … váruṇā (nom. 3a, acc. 4a). The next vss.
break the pattern, but the variation starts slowly: vs. 6 (the central vs. of the hymn)
does contain the pāda-initial nom. dual dvandva but postponed until the 2nd hemistich
(6c). But then vs. 7 omits the names altogether. The names reappear in vs. 8, but in
117
the final pāda and not as a dual dvandva but as a pāda-initial discontinuous individual
sg. acc. phrase: 8d índram … váruṇam. The same individual acc. phrase (now
continuous but not pāda initial) is found in 9a. Vs. 10 again omits the names. The
final vs. returns to a discontinuous pāda-initial voc. phrase, but only in the b pāda and
with singulars not dual: índra … varuṇa. Thus the 2nd half of the hymn appears to
treat the gods separately rather than as a unit, but I see no reflection of this separation
in the content of the hymn: the two do not display their individual characteristics
more in the 2nd half.
IV.41.1–2: Note āpa ending 1a matched with āpī́ending 2a. Also the accumulation
of -vant-/-mant- forms in these 2 vss.: havíṣmān 1b, krátumān 1c, námasvān 1d,
práyasvān 2b.

### IV.41.1  
I am unhappy with the preterital value (‘has obtained’) universally assigned
(incl. Kü 115) to āpa in pāda a, because it ill-fits the subj. paspárśat ‘will touch’ in d.
My ‘will obtain’ is a wishful thinking, however, at odds with the grammar. I would
emend to ‘obtains’, with a presential value that Kü (116) allows for some passages.

### IV.41.2  
With Re (EVP 7: 75) I take vā in d not as the disjunctive ‘or’, but the
enclitic dual 2nd ps. prn. (vā(m)) before m-, though Old rejects this view. AiG III.477
also takes vā in this passage as the dual enclitic pronoun, but considers the -m-less
form historically correct.

### IV.41.3  
The orphaned tā́at the end of b is a bit surprising, somewhat reminiscent of
the pāda-filling mechanisms engaged in by the epic bards, but not usually resorted to
or needed by Rigvedic poets. This hymn is, however, not particularly topnotch work;
compare Re’s comment “Banalisation des hymnes joints.”
I am inclined to read yádī as *yád ī, even though the ī would not double an
object (unless it is the unexpressed reflexive ‘themselves’) but would be pleonastic.
The reading would be to avoid yádī ‘if’. The standard tr. indeed all render as ‘when’,
not ‘if’.

### IV.41.4  
Re makes the nice point that vṛkáti- ‘wolfishness’ and dabhī́ti- ‘deception’
are respectively Indraic and Varuṇian offenses.

### IV.41.5  
Note the middle opt. duhīya+t remarked as act., like the impf. áduha+t.

### IV.41.6  
The first hemistich consists of a series of loc. absol., all depending on hité
‘set (as stake)’.

### IV.41.7  
My tr. departs in two ways from the standard. I take prábhūtī as instr. sg. (as
it is in IV.54.3), not acc. du., and gavíṣaḥ as gen. sg. with svāpī (also suggested by
Ge in his n.), not nom. pl. The pári is somewhat perplexing. Re construes it with
118
prábhūtī (“ô vous qui dominez tout autour,” wrongly as a voc.); my “pervasive
preeminence” is a version of this.

### IV.41.8  
Vs.-initial tā́is ambiguous: it can represent either masc. du. tā́supporting
the immed. flg. enclitic vām (as so often; see my “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited
sentence connective?” Historische Sprachforschung 105 [1992]) or fem. pl. tā́ḥ (so
Pp.) modifying dhíyaḥ. Or, my preference, both.
Although, strictly speaking, fem. vājayántīḥ belongs in the frame, modifying
dhíyaḥ, in sense it fits better with the simile, since contests are where prizes are won.
Moreover, see the next vs. (9d) where fem. ‘fleet mares’(raghvī́ḥ) seek fame -- so
female racehorses would be possible in the simile here.
In c śriyé has double sense, belonging both to śrī́‘glory, splendour’ and to
√śrī ‘mix’, as Ge and Re point out. The latter is appropriate to the simile, the former
to the frame.
Acdg. to WG, the gíraḥ go to Indra and the manīṣā́ḥ to Varuṇa. Although, as
was noted above, this is the first place in the hymn where the two names are singular,
not associated as a dual, I think it unlikely that the different vocal products have
different divine goals. Note that in the first half of the vs. the dhíyaḥ are going to
both, and the repeated manīṣā́ḥ in the next vs. go to both as well. That gíraḥ
immediately follows índram in 8d is not significant; In all but one instance (9a) of the
two names, something intervenes.

### IV.41.9  
I read vásvaḥ twice, once as the complement of joṣṭā́raḥ in the simile
(“those who enjoy a good thing”) and once in the frame with bhíkṣamāṇāḥ (“seeking
a share of the goods”). Contra WG, I take śrávasaḥ only in the simile, since this part
of the hymn seems all about our acquiring possessions, not fame.

### IV.41.10  
Pāda c has been variously dealt with -- as parenthetical (Ge), as a separate
clause (Re, WG), as the obj. of the verb in d (Old). All of these take the two gods as
the subj. of the part. cakrāṇā́(flg. the du. reading of the Pp., cakrāṇaú), and all of
them fail to render the medial sense of the part. Since the med. pf. cakré in 2a has
clear medial sense (“made X his own”), the voice of this participle should not be
ignored. I therefore read it as nom. plural (contra Pp. but compatible with Saṃhitā),
modifying the 1st pl. subj. of ab. Again, we want to make the gods our own; this
forms a ring with the same usage in 2a.
[IV.42 JPB]
## IV.43 Aśvins

### IV.43.1  
As disc. in the publ. intro., the two forms of katamá- ‘which of 3+’ and the
pl. amṛ́teṣu make it clear that these questions are applicable to all the gods, not just
the Aśvins.
119

### IV.43.2  
Again, two occurrences of katamá- and one of the pl. devā́nām keep the
widest possible range of choices for the answer to these questions.
On “Sūryā chose the chariot” and sim. expressions as an indication of the
svayaṃvara (self-choice) marriage in the RV, see my “The Rigvedic svayaṃvara?
Formulaic evidence” (Fs. Parpola 2001). Although, as just mentioned, the first halfvs. keeps the options open, the mention of Sūryā and the chariot immediately
narrows down the choice of answer to the Aśvins (to a contemporary audience).

### IV.43.3  
This vs. gives the answer to the questions in 1–2: the Aśvins. As was just
indicated, this answer was adumbrated by 2cd, but indirectly, via a mention of a
chariot that could only belong to the Aśvins. Now we finally have a verse couched in
the dual, but note that the name Aśvin (or Nāsatya) is not found; the dual is enough.
Pāda a gives an implicit answer to 2a -- katamá ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ “Which one (will
be) the first to come?” -- by asserting that they “come right away” (makṣū́…
gáchathaḥ). I don’t quite understand ī́vato dyū́n “during/through days such as these”;
I assume it indicates that even in our time (not merely in the mythological past), they
still rush right here.
In b śaktím is a slightly odd goal. Ge takes it as an infinitive, a use of the acc.
of the -tí-stem I’d rather avoid. I think it means “comes into his ability/power” -- i.e.,
is immediately able to wield it at the necessary, decisive moment.
Pāda d, with the two forms of √śac (śácīnām … śáciṣṭhā) echoing śaktím in b,
seems to allow the possibility that the Aśvins have comparable, but different, abilities
from Indra’s.

### IV.43.4  
On úpamāti- as belonging to √mā not √man, see comm. ad VIII.40.9. Note
that WG (‘Zumessung’) must also derive it from √mā. The Aśvins’ úpamāti- might
be an answer to the question in 3d: which one is their best ability? This stem is also
the obvious one to supply with the instr. fem. káyā, which immediately follows.
I construe cd very differently from the standard tr., which take c and d as
separate clauses (though Ge and Re both supply a form of the verb of d, uruṣyá-, in
c). I take kó vām as an independent nominal cl., with the next cl. beginning with
maháḥ and running to the end (cf. the structure of ab, which also has a clause break
in the middle of pāda a, with the 2nd cl. continuing to the end of b). The reason for
this choice is that it is difficult to render c as a unity if abhī́ke is taken in its usual
sense (hence the attenutations in the other tr.). Moreover, abhī́ke regularly appears
with uruṣyá- and similar ‘make wide space’ expressions: VII.85.1 tā́no yā́mann
uruṣyatām abhī́ke “Let those two give us wide space in close quarters on our journey,”
X.38.4 yó abhī́ke varivovít “who finds wide space in close quarters…,” X.133.1
abhī́ke cid ulokakṛ̥t “a maker of wide space even in close quarters.” Earlier in IV an
ablative phrase like our maháś cit tyájasaḥ is found adjacent to abhī́ke: IV.12.5
maháś cid agna énaso abhī́ke “(Release us) from even a great offense in close
quarters, o Agni.” All of these parallels lead to the conclusion that everything
starting with maháḥ should be read with uruṣyátam in the next pāda, since abhī́ke
patterns with uruṣyá- and the abl. phrase is connected with abhī́ke. However, I
120
realize that the phrase in the publ. tr. “even out of great neglect” seems unconnected
to the rest and makes little sense. I now feel that we need to interpr. uruṣyátam in two
different senses. With abhī́ke it has its physical literal meaning ‘make wide space’,
but with the abl. maháś cit tyájasaḥ it has the extended sense ‘release, free (from)’. I
would therefore emend the tr. to “Make wide space for us in close quarters, free us
even from great neglect/abandonment.” WG take tyájas- as ‘Lebensopfer’, but this
must rest on the later notion of sacrifice as tyāga-. This concept is not really a part of
the RVic ritual universe -- though see the single occurrence of tyāgá- in the RV in
IV.24.3, where it refers to the abandonment of one’s body in battle.

### IV.43.5  
I take pāda b with c rather than a, because I think those two middle pādas
depict (somewhat playfully?) the Aśvins’ chariot on an independent journey, coming
towards them from the sea and, with the journey originating in a wet place, splashing
them. I do not see any other easy way to construe the unusual pāda-final vām in b but
as the goal of the goal-oriented verb abhí vártate (note similarly pāda-final acc. vām
in the next hymn, 44.2). As Ge’s parallels (I.139.3, 180.1) suggest, the likely subject
of pruṣāyan is the chariot’s ‘wheel-rims’ (paváyaḥ).
The verb in d, bhurájanta, is a hapax and much disputed. Probably the current
standard view is that it is an enlargement of √bhṛ (see the standard tr., as well as
EWA s.v. with further lit.). This view is supported by an apparently parallel passage
in V.73.8d pakvā́ḥ pṛ́kṣo bharanta vām “they bring cooked foods to you” (or “cooked
foods are brought to you”), very close to our yát sīṃ vām pṛ́kṣo bhurájanta pakvā́ḥ.
But it is easy to imagine that a poet, adapting Aśvin phraseology to the simpler
dimeter meter and confronting a baffling word like bhurájanta, would substitute a
word that sounded more or less similar and would work in the passage. Re suggests
breezily that bhuraj- is the same type of formation as bhiṣaj- and saraj-, but this
seems to me to undercut the explanation because these two formations are so outré; -
aj- is a pretty salient piece of morphology and wouldn’t, I think, be lightly attached
to a normal root (particularly one that should not be showing *bhur- forms). I
therefore favor the older (Gr, etc., incl. also Wackernagel, AiG I, passim) connection
with √bhṛjj ‘roast’. Although this verbal root is found only once in the RV, it is
widely attested in Middle and New Indo-Aryan (see Turner, √BHRAJJ and, e.g.,
9583–86), and there is an underlying nasal-infix pres. *bhṛnak-ti, which acdg. to
Turner (9586) is presupposed by *bhṛñjati ‘parches’. With some manipulation of
MIA phonology, this might give us our form. The relative absence of √bhṛjj from the
RV and other early Vedic texts is not surprising, since it would belong to kitchen
vocabulary.

### IV.43.6  
More sprinkling and splashing. The instr. rasáyā is probably an instr. of
accompaniment (both the Sindhu and Rasā sprinkle) rather than of means.
With most interpr. I read acc. pl. ghṛṇā́(ḥ) against Pp. instr. ghṛṇā́.
yā́na- is found only here in the RV. On the basis of the strong association
between Sūryā and the chariot, I take it, with Gr, as a vehicle not, with most interpr.,
as abstract ‘journey’.
121

### IV.43.7  
The consensus is that papṛkṣé is a 1st sg., which is certainly appropriate for a
final summary vs. A 3rd sg. is not excluded, however; in that case a subj. would have
to be identified and supplied.
The āmreḍita ihéha and samanā́seem to be implicitly contrastive: wherever
you are, I have nourished you in the same way.
## IV.44 Aśvins

### IV.44.1  
The phrase sáṃgatiṃ góḥ “meeting with the cow” refers to a second period
in the morning, when the cows are milked. See Ge’s n. 1b.

### IV.44.2  
There is much disc. in the lit. about what manner of horses kakuhá- refers to
(see, e.g., WG n. ad loc.). I do not have an opinion, nor do I think it matters
contextually.

### IV.44.3  
The standard tr. take the dative phrase in c, ṛtásya … vanúṣe pūrvyā́ya as
personal (e.g., Ge “für den, der schon früher des rechten Brauches beflissen war”).
But since this phrase is parallel to two purpose-activity datives in b (ūtáye …
sutapéyāya) and is in fact conjoined with them by vā, I think they should be parallel
in function. Old sees the problem and suggests that if we interpr. the passage as I do,
we might need to read *vánuṣe -- though he ultimately opts for the personal dative.

### IV.44.4  
The root noun cmpd. purubhū́- can, of course, be interpreted in many ways,
given its component parts. See disc. in Scar (362). Four of its five occurrences
modify the Aśvins (and the fifth may not belong to this stem; seecomm. ad IX.94.3);
since one of the oft-noted characteristics of the Aśvins is their peripatetic nature, I
interpr. it as ‘appearing in many places’. In our passage it strikes the same note as
ihéha ‘here and there’ in vs. 7 (=43.7). There are two occurrences in VIII.22 (vss. 3,
12), and the Aśvins hymns in VIII often express concern about the many places the
Aśvins could be besides here.

### IV.44.5  
By my rule (see “Vedic anyá- 'another, the other': syntactic disambiguation,”
Fs. Beekes, 1997), because it is in (modified) 2nd position, anyé in c should be
definite (‘the others’), not indefinite as Ge (/WG) take it. This makes perfect sense:
we are well aware of the other sacrificers who are our rivals.
On sám … dadé and the idiom it expresses see comm. ad I.139.1. Although
dadé here is usually ascribed to √dā ‘give’, the idiom sam √dā belong to √dā ‘cut’.
See Kü 242 for the three forms dadé / dade that belong to ‘cut’.
## IV.45 Aśvins

### IV.45.1  
Act. úd iyarti, esp. in contrast with its med. correspondent úd īrate in 2a,
should be transitive. With Ge, the pub. tr. renders it as intransitive (‘arises’). WG
122
take it as transitive and supply ‘sun’ as the object. I am now inclined to think that it is
transitive (the contrastive verb in 2a has convinced me), but am uncertain what
object to supply. The most common object of íyarti is ‘speech’ (vel sim.), but
curiously for a RVic hymn, there is no mention of speech or praise-song in this hymn
(until a cmpd. in the final vs., 7a dhiyaṃdhā́- ‘setting my insight’). Since the subj. of
intrans. úd īrate in 2 is chariots and horses, I think the object here should be the
chariot whose hitching up is described in the rest of the hemistich. I would therefore
emend the tr. to “Now this radiant beam impels (the chariot) upward.” The radiant
beam is presumably the ritual fire, though it might be the beam of dawn, an
identification that finds support in the mention of dawn in 2b. The chariot being
impelled upward may not be the same as the Aśvins’ chariot in the rest of the
hemistich, but the complementary “chariot” of the ritual.
For the mild paradox in c, the three who form a pair, see publ. intro. That this
refers to the two Aśvins paired with Sūryā was already well recognized by Ge (see
his n. 1c).

### IV.45.4  
uhū́- is a hapax, and an onomatopoeic origin seems reasonable (see EWA
s.v., citing AiG II.2.492). With sufficient goodwill, one can configure the bar-headed
goose cries available for hearing on the internet as “uhu.”

### IV.45.6  
ākenipā́saḥ: see Old, EWA s.v. āké.
Very unusually, pāda b is a verbatim repetition of 2d. Except in refrains,
repeated pādas are almost never found in the same hymn. In this particular case the
repeated pādas are symmetrical, that is, found in vss. equidistant from the center, but
there are no other signs of omphalos structure in this hymn, save for the faint ringcomposition between vss. 1 and 7 (see below). Since horses and chariots are the
referents in 2d, I supply horses as the subject here. That the sun then hitches up his
horses in c may support this.
Although the intens. dávidhu- (also dódhu-) generally takes an object, it is
often an internal one (that is, a body part of the subj., e.g., lips, horns), and in this
passage I think it is simply intransitive (though Schaeffer, Intens. 138, supplies lips).
Ge (/WG) supply ‘darkness’ as obj. on the basis of IV.13.4 dávidhvataḥ … támaḥ,
but if, as seems likely, horses are the subject, I have trouble envisioning them
shaking anything with their hooves.

### IV.45.7  
This final vs. in part reprises vs. 1: ráthaḥ begins both b pādas, and párijmā
‘earth-encircling’ of 1b is paraphrased by 7c yéna sadyáḥ pári rájāṃsi yātháḥ “with
which in a day you drive around the dusky realms” -- though -jman- and rájas- are of
course unrelated, there is some phonological similarity. Given this ringcompositional effect between vss. 1 and 7, it is barely possible that we should supply
dhíyam from cmpd dhiyaṃdhā́- in 7b as obj. to úd iyarti in 1a (see disc. there).
IV.46 Vāyu and Indra
123

### IV.46.1  
Since Vāyu has the first drink of soma to himself, it is appropriate that only
he is called on in this vs.

### IV.46.2  
This vs. provides the transition between Vāyu as sole drinker and Vāyu and
Indra as joint drinkers. Because the nominatives in b, niyútvām̐índrasārathiḥ, are
singular, it seems best, with Ge, Re, to supply a sg. impv. ‘come’ (vel sim.) for ab.
The dual verb tṛmpatam in c has of course Vāyu and Indra as its subjects; Indra can
be extracted from the cmpd. índrasārathiḥ in b, and the voc. vā́yo in c is in effect a
truncated Vāyav Indraś ca construction. This construction is nonetheless avoided in
the rest of the hymn: vss. 3–7 all contain the dual dvandva voc. índravāyū. Note that
this stem never appears as the more “correct” *índrā-vāyū́with dual first member. I
have no idea why.

### IV.46.4  
Ge unaccountably tr. the apparent aor. subjunctive sthā́thaḥ as an impv.; Re
suggests that it may have a “nuance injonctive (malgré les désinences primaires).”
Neither of these makeshifts seems necessary. Because of the hí I take this vs. as the
foundation for the next, journey vs. -- first mount, then drive.
IV.47 Vāyu and Indra
As in the preceding hymn, vs. 1 is addressed only to Vāyu, with single voc.,
but the rest of the vss. address them jointly, in three different ways. In 2a we have a
reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction índraś ca vāyo, in 3a the same construction in
normal order, and in 4d the dual dvandva voc. índravāyū found in 46.3-7.

### IV.47.3  
Of the two pāda-final qualifiers, śuṣmínā (a) and śavasas patī (b), the first is
nom., the 2nd voc. It is not clear to me why, since, save for the accent, nom. and voc.
would be identical.

### IV.47.4  
The qualifier of the teams, puruspṛ́haḥ ‘craved by many’, reprises 1d
spārháḥ, used of Vāyu, again a faint sign of ring composition. For the syntax see
comm. ad VI.60.8.
## IV.48 Vāyu

### IV.48.1  
The publ. tr. renders hótrā(ḥ) as ‘invocations’; this is possible, but it may
also (or in addition) refer to ‘ritual offerings’, perhaps better in a Vāyu context.
As noted in the publ. intro., the construction and meaning of the first half of
this vs. are disputed. Ge and Re (in diff. ways) take vihí hótrā as an independent
clause and construe ávītā(ḥ) with pāda b, while Old (ZDMG 54.171–72), WG, and I
take ávītā(ḥ) as qualifier of hótrā(ḥ), forming an etymological figure with vihí. In
pāda b the same verb (‘pursue’), though not imperatival, is to be supplied in the
simile, with subj. and obj. ranged around it. The disagreement among Old, WG, and
me has to do with the identity of subj. and obj. WG take vípaḥ (“die
Geisteserregten”) as subj. and rā́yo aryáḥ (“die Reichtümer des Sippenherrn”) as obj.
124
This seems quite reasonable, save for the fact that in all clear cases víp- is nonanimate ‘inspiration, inspired poems’ vel sim. Old also takes vípaḥ as subj. though in
its usual sense, but construes with aryáḥ and tr. “die Gebete des Besitzlosen.” This
would be, to say the least, an unusual sense of aryáḥ; moreover, rā́yo aryáḥ is a
common phrase (note in passing the phonological parallelism). As I said in the publ.
intro., on the basis of VI.14.3 I believe that “the riches of the stranger” refers to the
Ārya people in general and their poets in particular. In my reading of the simile here,
this collectivity of poets is pursuing inspiration as avidly as Vāyu does invocations /
libations.

### IV.48.2  
The poet’s playfulness continues. The qualifier niyútvan-, ‘possessing a
team’, common in these Vāyu contexts (see in this hymn sequence III.46.2, 47.1,
47.3) opens pāda b; the preceding pāda opens with a near phonological match,
niryuvāṇáḥ -- a participle to the same verb with a preverb that is only minimally
different from ní. (The lexeme nír √yu is found only here.) It should mean ‘disjoin,
disband’. My ‘take out of harness’ is an attempt to convey the play on niyútvan-:
Vāyu ‘unteams’ the áśāstīḥ, while himself coming with his team.

### IV.48.3  
The standard tr. assume that Night and Dawn are directing themselves
towards Vāyu. I think rather that they are simply following each other in the normal
daily succession. Since Vāyu comes at dawn, the transition between the two temporal
halves is simultaneous with his journey.
On the “two black treasure chambers” (kṛṣṇé vásudhītī), see Bloomfield
(RReps ad III.31.17): “The words krṣṇ̥ é and vásudhitī are both dvandva ekaśeṣa
'black (Night) and (Uṣas)' is a way of saying náktoṣā́sā; conversely 'treasure-giving
(Morn) and black (Night)' is uṣā́sānáktā. Cf. Berg. i.250.” In other words, kṛṣṇá- is
applicable to Night, vásudhīti- to Day, but the two are conflated into a single dual
expression.
IV.49 Indra and Bṛhaspati
As disc. in the publ. intro., this hymn seems to be modeled on the Indra/Vāyu
hymns just preceding, esp. since in standard śrauta ritual there is no joint offering of
soma to Indra and Bṛhaspati. Like Indra and Vāyu in IV.46.3–7, Indra and Bṛhaspati
are consistently addressed with a dual dvandva, índrābṛ́haspátī, which is found only
here. (Note the correct dual 1st member índrā, in contrast to índra-vāyū discussed ad
IV.46.2.) This dvandva is found as an unaccented voc. in every vs., save for 5, where
the fully accented form occurs as an acc. In addition, in 3b there is a headless Vāyav
Indraś ca construction, índraś ca, lacking the voc. *bṛ́haspate -- though the preceding
pāda does contain voc. indrābṛhaspatī. See further below.

### IV.49.3  
As noted above, índraś ca in b signals a headless Vāyav Indraś ca
construction, and indeed the “Vāyav” is apter than might appear at first glance. Pāda
b is identical to I.135.7c, which is an Indra and Vāyu hymn. The missing voc. is
found there, in pāda a: vāyo. Clearly our b was adapted from I.135.7, with the non-
125
conforming god lopped off in this expression. I have not attempted to render the voc.
dvandva plus mutilated Vāyav Indraś ca, unlike the standard tr., which supply an
extra verb in a and an extra voc. in b.
## IV.50 Bṛhaspati
On the divisions of the hymn, see publ. intro. Old and H.-P. Schmidt (cf. esp.
B+I 215) consider it to be three separate hymns; I instead see it as a unified
composition with three parts. So also Gonda (Vedic Lit., 191) and, implicitly, Ge.
The hymn has been much tr.; besides the usual trio (Ge, Re [EVP 15.63–65], WG)
also Macdonell (VRS), Maurer, Schmidt (B+I, vss. 1–6 216ff., 7–9 117, 10–11 96).
IV.50.1–6: As indicated in the publ. intro., this section concerns the unitary figure
(Indra-)Bṛhaspati, here insistently identified as Bṛhaspati: there are 7 occurrences of
the name in 6 vss., one in each save for two in vs. 2.

### IV.50.1  
The preverb ví is curiously positioned, neither adjacent to its verb nor to a
metrical boundary. Perhaps its position is iconic, with ‘earth’ (jmáḥ) between its
separated ends (ví … ántān).
As noted in the publ. intro., the VP puráḥ … dadhire “they set in front” marks
the appointment of Bṛhaspati in what will be his later role, Purohita.

### IV.50.2  
The rel. clause of abc (by most interpr. -- c could also go with d) has no
main clause correspondent in this vs. As most interpr. take it, the pl. yé seems rather
to refer to the Ṛṣis in vs. 1 and continue that sentence, forming a transition to the
explicit Vala myth.
The acc. supraketám in pāda a is taken by some (e.g., Old, Macdonell,
Schmidt) as coreferential with the acc. in c, but I consider it too far from the verb and
from the other accusatives to be an anticipatory object. Instead I prefer Ge’s solution,
to construe it loosely with mádantaḥ (cf. IV.33.10 ukthā́mádantaḥ, also cited by Ge):
Ge “jublend unter guten Vorzeichen,” my “exulting at the good sign.” Since Agni is
several times called praketá- as the sign of the day or the ceremony (e.g., VII.11.1
mahā́m asy adhvarásya preketáḥ “you are the great visible sign of the ceremony”), I
wonder if this is a temporal reference: dawn when the ritual fire is kindled.
The acc. phrase in c refers to the Vala cave and is the obj. of abhí … tatasré
in b. The head-noun ūrvá- ‘container, enclosure’ refers to the cave itself, but the
three adj. pṛ́ṣantaṃ sṛprám ádabdham “dappled, glossy, uncheatable” are better
applicable to its contents, the cows. Note the mirror-image phonetic figure beginning
c: pṛ́ṣ(antaṃ) sṛp(rám), which contains partial anagrams of Bṛhaspati.
The “future impv.” rákṣatāt in d is somewhat surprising, in that it does not
follow a previous impv., as is usual. I take it to imply that Bṛhaspati should do his
guarding after the Aṅgirases have breached the cave and released the cows. For
another unexpected future impv. see nearby suvatāt in IV.54.3
126

### IV.50.3  
Ths vs. also contains phonetic echoes of Bṛhaspati: ṛtaspṛ́ś(o) (b) and
(vi)rapś(ám) (d). Another phonetic pattern worthy of note, though it doesn’t directly
reference Bṛhaspati, is the unbroken sequence of short and long a, starting with yā́in
pāda a (right after initial bṛ́haspate) and continuing into pāda b, till right before
ṛtaspṛ́śo, the echo of the name: ā a a ā a ā a, a a ā a.
As Ge’s cited parallels make clear, pāda b concerns the Sattra that the
Aṅgirases performed.

### IV.50.4  
With Macdonell, I take mahó jyótiṣaḥ as a separate abl. phrase, rather than a
gen. qualifying paramé vyòman with the standard interpr. Since we otherwise know
little or nothing about Bṛhaspati’s birth, it is difficult to make an informed choice. I
have gone with the abl. interpr. because the common phrase paramá- vyòman- does
not seem to be qualified by a gen. phrase elsewhere (though this is not decisive) and
because the contrast in this vs. between light and the darkness that Bṛhaspati blows
away would be stronger if he were directly born from light.
As usual, numerology is difficult to interpr. I think Ge is correct that the
seven in saptā́sya- ‘having seven mouths’ must be the Aṅgirases (see the same word
in the next hymn, IV.51.4). What the seven reins (saptáraśmi-) are is more difficult.
Ge suggests the seven reins of the sacrifice; I prefer the seven seers, who are, in my
opinion, the referents of the phrase saptá raśmáyaḥ in the enigmatic I.105.9 (see
comm. ad loc.). This would provide Bṛhaspati with two different connections to
poetic speech, appropriately enough.

### IV.50.6  
As indicated in the publ. intro., this is the final vs. of the 1st section of the
hymn and has the standard marks of a hymn-final summary vs. It is the best evidence
that vss. 1–6 were a separate composition, only secondarily amalgamated with the
following two sections. Nonetheless, I think it simply marks a pause and a transition
to the thematically contrastive next section.
IV.50.7–8: These vss. are structured similarly: a main clause (or clauses) referring to
the happy results for the king who (now a rel. cl.) properly treats a particular figure.
The figure in vs. 6 is Bṛhaspati; filling the same slot in vs. 7 is the brahmán-
‘formulator’. We have thus moved from the divine to the human realm, and the
identity of Bṛhaspati and brahmán- is signaled by their parallel roles in the vs.
structure.

### IV.50.7  
Note the etymological figure in c: súbhṛtam bibhárti.
The sense of pūrvabhā́j- is limited by pū́rva eti in 8d and for that reason is
presumably not a ritual technical term. (Vāyu would be the god who “receives the
first portion” by that measure.)

### IV.50.9  
The shift from divine to human just noted above in vss. 7–8 comes full
circle in this vs. The human Formulator is, it seems, in need of aid from the king
127
(avasyáve … brahmáṇe), but if the king provides this aid he himself receives aid
from the gods (tám avanti devā́ḥ).
IV.50.9–10: This last section consisting of two vss. introduces Indra by name for the
first time in the hymn. The two divine figures are carefully balanced, as the address
to them shows: vs. 10 opens with the name Indra in a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca
construction, índraś ca … bṛhaspate, while two independent vocatives open vs. 11,
this time with Bṛhaspati first: bṛhaspata indra.

### IV.50.11  
Ge, Re, and Schmidt all attach sácā to the preceding pāda (e.g., Ge
“Stärket uns gemeinsam”). Despite the position of sā́, I think sácā belongs in the
pāda in which it is found. So also WG.
## IV.51 Dawn
It is worth noting that the nom. (and voc.) pl. of uṣás- is consistently uṣásaḥ in
this hymn (every vs. but 10), with short suffixal vowel -- the newer form replacing
inherited uṣā́saḥ.
As disc. in the publ. intro., this is an omphalos hymn, with the middle verse 6
posing the central question. This omphalos is surrounded by concentric rings: divó
duhitáro vibhātī́ḥ of 1c is answered by the same phrase (in the voc.) in 10a and 11a,
while vss. 5 and 7 contain an inner ring with ṛtá- (ṛtayúbhiḥ 5a, ṛtájātasatyāḥ 7b) and
sadyáḥ (5b, 7d). There is also much lexical chaining between adjacent vss.

### IV.51.1  
As noted in the publ. intro., the dawns are so insistently in the plural in this
hymn that when a single one is referred to, another word must be used -- in this case
jyótiḥ ‘light’.

### IV.51.2  
Note absolute initial root aor. ásthuḥ contrasting with absolute final asthāt
in 1b.
I have taken gen. támasaḥ as dep. on gen. vrajásya (“of the enclosure of
darkness”) with Ge, but támasaḥ could be dep. instead on dvā́rā, parallel to vrajásya
(so Re, WG).

### IV.51.3  
The multivalent stem citáya- is here used in transitive value (see my disc. in
-áya- book). The 3rd pl. citayanta is simply an -anta replacement of the expected
active of the usual type (see my 1979 IIJ article).

### IV.51.4  
The opening of this vs. kuvít sá resonates with the opening of 6 ḱu
va svid.
With Ge I take the yénā clause of cd to be a third possible course, against the
old and new ones offered as possibilities in ab. Since cd presumably refers to the
Aṅgirases’ involvement in the Vala myth, it is the case that the Dawns’ course in that
instance was an unusual one: they came out of a rock!
128

### IV.51.6  
katamā́‘which one?’ echoes purutámam ‘the latest of many’ in 1a. Note that
again when a singular dawn is referred to, the word uṣás- is not used.
I do not understand what the Ṛbhus are doing here, nor do I know the exact
sense of ví √dhā in the etymological figure vidhā́nā vidadhúḥ. A similar etym. figure
is found in nearby IV.55.2 vidhātā́ro ví … dadhuḥ, where I tr. ‘distribute’, which I’ve
imported here. However, I am now inclined to think that this has to do with the
creative division of an undifferentiated mass (such as the Ṛbhus performed in
I.161.2–3 also cited by Ge) and with the regulation of these divisions, possibly of
divisions of time. Such “division” contrasts sharply with the lack of distinction
among the dawns stated in cd. It is not surprising that a single (unnamed) dawn (pāda
a) would be associated with division and distinction (pāda b), as opposed to the plural
dawns in the rest of the hymn. For other interpr. of pāda b see the various tr. and
comm.

### IV.51.7  
The opening tā́, esp. in its emphatic form tā́ghā tā́(ḥ) is echoed by the
openings of 8 (tā́ā́…) and 9 (tā́(ḥ)).
At the same time sadyáḥ makes an interior ring with 5b around the omphalos
vs. What's striking about this little ring is that, though the sadyáḥ in 5 and 7 match
verbally, the word is in a different temporal setting in the two vss: present in 5 and
remote past in 7, and in 6 those two temporal settings are dissolved or confused (as
also in a different way in 4).
The cmpd. ṛtájātasatya- is unusual not only in having 3 members (quite rare
in the RV) but also for containing both ṛtá- and satyá-. Re suggests that -satyafunctions as a sort of “particule intensive.” Given how charged both words are in the
RV, I think this unlikely, although the rendering in the publ. tr. (“who were really
born of truth”) is close to Re’s intensive particle interpr; cf. his own tr.
(“véritablement nées de l’Ordre”). I think the cmpd requires a more literal and
weighty rendering -- “whose reality was born from truth” (which I would substitute
for what is found in the publ. tr.) -- meaning that the dawns we see and who come
daily to our world and our sacrifice, who are really here, arose from the true cosmic
patterns that govern the universe of time and space.
IV.51.8–9: The unbroken similarity of the dawns who just keep coming, day after
day, is conveyed by the stasis of these two vss., where forms of ‘same’ (8ab samanā́
… sanānátaḥ samanyā́, 9a samanā́samānī́ḥ) and the same verb caranti (8a, 9b) bring
all movement to a halt, even though the dawns are constantly on the move.
## IV.52 Dawn

### IV.52.1  
Although by the time of the composition of this hymn the word play may
have long been buried, for Indo-Europeanists the juxtaposition of *-Hner and *gw
enH
(man and woman) (sūnárī jánī) is very cute.
Note the distraction of the usual “daughter of heaven” phrase into a threetermed alliterative phrase divó adarśi duhitā́.
129
## IV.53 Savitar

### IV.53.2  
With urú we can supply rájaḥ from 3a, where rájāṃsi occurs as the obj. of
the same verb ā́√prā, or antárikṣam, the most common noun found with this neut.
adj. and found in this phrase at the end of the immediately preceding hymn, IV.52.7b
antárikṣam urú.

### IV.53.3  
As Ge’s parallels show, this must be Savitar’s own ślóka.
The dat. svā́ya dhármaṇe would be easier to parse as “for his own support.”
Both Ge and Re are rather cavalier about the dat. here. Ge tr. ‘nach’; Re claims it’s
no different from the instr., further stating “indecision des cases obliques dans ce
type de noms,” which seems like a dangerous interpretive principle to me.
In cd I take sávīmani with the participles of d. In that pāda aktúbhiḥ ‘through
the nights’ strictly speaking goes with niveśáyan ‘causing to settle down’.

### IV.53.6  
The participles niveśáyan prasuván are reprised here as agentives prasavitā́
nivéśanaḥ.
## IV.54 Savitar

### IV.54.3  
This middle vs. (the final vs., 6, opens out to other gods and is essentially
extrahymnic) expresses the particular intercession we want Savitar to make for us
and also admits to possible offenses committed by us that make this intercession
necessary. The vs. also has a few disharmonies, unlike the smooth vss. that make up
most of the rest of the hymn.
The first question is how to interpr. yád. If it is taken as a neut. rel. prn.
(‘what’), this leaves the main cl. of cd without a referent for this rel. If (with the
standard tr.) it is taken as a general subordinating conjunction (‘when, if’), this leaves
the verb cakṛmā́without an obj. Ge just barrels through, tr. the verb as “gesüdigt
haben” without comm.; Re and WG supply parenthetical objects (“une faute,” “ein
Vergehen”). Given ánāgas- in d and IV.12.3 yád … ácittibhiś cakṛmā́kác cid ā́gaḥ,
ā́gaḥ would be the appropriate obj. to supply if this syntactic path is chosen. I am
therefore inclined now to emend the publ. tr. to “If we have committed an offense …”
The other question has to do with the verb suvatāt in d. First, why a future
impv.? There is no prior impv. whose action it follows. (For a similarly unsupported
fut. impv. see nearby rákṣatāt IV.50.2.) Moreover, the VP doesn't make sense: …
naḥ … suvatād ánāgasaḥ should mean (as I tr. it) “impel us to be without offense,”
but how would Savitar’s impulsion render us offenseless? The standard tr. simply
fudge the verb: Ge “so sollst du … bestimmen, dass wir daran schuldlos sind”; Re
“veuille … nous en rendre innocents” (which he then further glossses “veuille nous
susciter = nous faire sortir (de l’état de péché, en sorte d’apparaître) innocents” [one
of Re’s finer parentheses]); WG “… sollst du … uns daran für schuldlos erklären.”
But none of these is a standard (or even non-standard) use of √sū, and since forms of
130
this verb are found in vss. 2, 4–6 with its normal sense (at least in my opinion; see
below), we can’t simply impose a new interpr. for contextual convenience.
I have two remarks on this. First, it is striking that in what is otherwise a
pretty simple hymn, it is in the vs. most significant to the human audience that we
encounter little issues in the words themselves. I think this is a sign that the poet
wants his audience to slow down, to really pay attention, and the way he gets this
accomplished is by tossing little obstacles in our path, requiring us to turn the
phrases around in our heads until we get a satisfactory sense. We could generalize
this observation to RVic poetry as a whole: one of the (many) reasons it is so difficult
is that the poet assumes that an audience that has to do a lot of the work will really
engage with the poetry, will get deeper into its meaning. The second remark has to
do with what we get if we reflect further on why the poet use a form of √sū here. In
this hymn and the last (IV.53), not to mention most other Savitar hymns, Savitar’s
control over all the parts of the cosmos and, especially, of the alternating movement
and rest of living beings (cf. esp. IV.53.3, 6) is powerfully asserted and associated
with the verb (√sū) that supplies his name. Impelling us to be without offense is
simply a specialized version of this: his special power of √sū enables him to push all
the elements (including weak humans) back into cosmic balance.

### IV.54.4  
The standard tr. supply as subj. of pramíye and referent of tád the whole
yáthā cl. of b. But one of the most common objects of (prá) √mī is vratá-, and in the
preceding Savitar hymn his vratá-s were much in evidence: 4a vratā́ni deváḥ
savitā́bhí rakṣate, 4d dhṛtávrataḥ, 5c tríbhir vrataíḥ. I therefore think vratám should
be supplied here; among other things this follows directly on the vs. presenting the
offenses we may have committed against the gods, and it would be appropriate to
reaffirm the importance of not offending Savitar in particular.
I then take the yáthā clause as a purpose clause. We shouldn’t violate
Savitar’s commandment because we want him to (continue to) support the world.
Although we generally expect the subjunctive in such clauses, the future is beginning
to supercede the subjunctive in general and would make fine sense here. (Re states
that this is the only ex. of yáthā with the future.)

### IV.54.5  
The standard tr. here impose a different sense on √sū than in the previous vs.
and one no more aligned with its usual semantics, i.e., ‘assign, direct’, with the
interpr. that Savitar is assigning dwelling places to gods (the high mountains) and to
men (pastyā́vataḥ, interpr. by Ge and Re as watery places, WG just dwellings). Old,
however, resists the easy contextual shift and attempts to find an interpr. compatible
with lexicon and grammar. (Among other things, he points out that unaccented
ebhyaḥ should not introduce a new referent, ‘men’, into the discourse.) He does not
settle on an interpr., however. My own interpr. assumes first that índrajyeṣṭhān refers
to the Maruts, rather than the gods in general. (This stem sometimes modifies one,
sometimes the other.) I also take párvatebhyaḥ not as dat., but abl. The Maruts tend
to haunt the high mountains, but Savitar can dislodge them. He can also impel the
clouds on which they (fancifully) dwell -- this is, in my opinion, the referent of
131
kṣáyān … pastyā́vataḥ, with ebhyaḥ here a dative referring to the previously
mentioned Maruts, thus properly unaccented. The 2nd hemistich announces that the
famously hyperactive Maruts can be controlled by Savitar: they can fly widely, but
they can also be brought to a standstill.
IV.55 All Gods
For the structure of the hymn and its parts, see publ. intro. As indicated there,
the first 7 vss. (in Triṣṭubh) are concentrically structured, with the agenda set by the
questions posed in vs. 1. There are a number of difficulties, and much remains
uncertain. The final three vss. (in Gāyatrī) appear to have originally been a separate
hymn, as has long been recognized, and are quite straightforward.

### IV.55.1  
On the anomalous form trā́sīthām see Old. Whatever its morphological
status otherwise, it is clearly a dual, and therefore, strictly speaking, only
dyā́vābhūmī can be its subj., not the additional voc. adite.
Since pāda b is a repetition (=VII.62.4), Ge interprets it as parenthetical, with
pāda c continuing pāda a (“who is the protector and defender … from the stronger
mortal”) (so also Bloomfield, RReps). This is not impossible, but since the abl.
phrase in c can just as easily be construed with the verb in b, I see no reason why the
repeated pāda can’t have been stitched into the fabric of this vs. (Re and WG both
take c with b, as I do.)
With Ge, I take vaḥ as a dat. of benefit: the wide space is made for the gods
(see also Oberlies, Relig. des RV I.461). Re and WG construe vaḥ with káḥ (“which
among you?”), and WG specifically indicate that the wide space is made for us by
one of the gods. Although the identical phrase kó vaḥ opening pāda a favors this
latter interpr., I follow Ge, in part because I think whoever would be acting thus at
the ceremony would be a human ritual officiant.

### IV.55.2  
My understanding of this difficult and disputed vs. is set forth in the publ. tr.
I will not engage here in detail with the various alternative interpr. offered by others.
I take the vs. in general as a response to the question posed in 1d (as I understand that
question), “who will make wide space at the ceremony for you gods?” The answer is
the unnamed priests acting at the dawn sacrifice. It is the priests who chant the
ordinances in 2a, at the time when the dawns are “dawning widely” (ví … uchā́n)(2b),
with the notion of “wide space” implicit. The priests return in c, distributing the
dakṣiṇās (or perhaps the dawns themselves perform the distribution). Pāda c contains
two forms of ví (vidhātā́ro ví … dadhuḥ), echoing the two in b (ví … uchā́n
viyotā́raḥ). Though the ví forms in c are not directly connected to “wide space,” they
continue that theme verbally. Pāda d has the dawns as subject.
In my interpr. of b, with dawns as subj., one could expect a fem. agent noun
*viyotrī́-, but -tár- forms can serve for fem. as well, esp. as an attributive (so better tr.
“they (the dawns) as discriminators …”). As pointed out in the publ. tr., the dawns
“discriminate” because they separate night and day. Old has a clever, but I think
ultimately incorrect, suggestion that instead of uchā́n we should read *yuchā́n to √yu
132
‘separate’, providing an etymological figure ví … *yuchā́n viyotā́raḥ, exactly parallel
to vidhātā́ro ví … dadhuḥ in the flg. pāda. (Old seems also to consider only to reject
this idea.)
The grammatical identity of rurucanta is unclear. Lub calls it a pf. subjunctive,
and Ge and Thieme (Plusq. 46) interpr. it as hortative. But the zero-grade would be
anomalous for a subjunctive. Kü (430–31) takes it rather as an injunctive, although
he does not see a clear injunctive context (though generell-erwähnende Funktion
seems possible). I also interpr. it as injunctive, in the publ. tr. with preterial sense,
though “shine” would work as well in context.

### IV.55.3  
In pāda a #prá … arkaíḥ# echoes 2a #prá … árcān#.
The 2nd hemistich gives some support to my interpr. of vs. 2b, that the dawns
are marking the limit between night and day. Here Night and Dawn arrange that both
day halves provide protection.
As WG point out, all the divinities here are fem.

### IV.55.4  
I take ví … ceti to √ci ‘pile’; see comm. ad I.90.4. Re assigns it to √cit
‘perceive’ (so also Gr); WG to √ci ‘perceive’ as an Augenblicksbildung to the aor.
stem.
The final word of the vs., várūtham, recalls varūtā́, the final word of the 1st
pāda of the hymn (1a). As indicated in the publ. intro., I consider vss. 3–5 to be a
response to the question posed in the hymn’s first pāda.

### IV.55.5  
The echo of vs. 1 noted at the end of vs. 4 continues here, where devásya
trātúḥ picks up trātā́of 1a (as well as trā́sīthām in 1b). The abl. “(protect) from …”
in 1c sáhīyasaḥ … mártāt recurs in cd jányād áṃhasaḥ … mitríyāt.
The standard tr. begin a new clause at the beginning of d and take mitríyāt
with uruṣyet. This is not impossible; nonetheless I prefer to construe mitró mitríyāt
with c. The strict parallelism/gapping of the 1st part, plus the pāda-medial utá naḥ in
d I find too compelling to ignore, since utá generally begins new clauses. It is true,
however, that uruṣyá- is several times found with áṃhasaḥ. The purport is much the
same either way.
The standard tr. take jánya- as referring to foreign people (this goes back at
least to Gr, meaning 2a). I do not know of any evidence for this interpr., and in fact
all clear passages indicate that it’s someone/-thing belonging to one’s own people
(which would be the default reading of such a deriv., in my view). Here the contrast
is between problems internal to the group and those coming from allies (external but
contractually connected).
Pāda d revives the question of wide space, here with a god making it for
mortals (us), which might give support to the Re / WG interpr. of 1d (see above).
Nonetheless, I think the overall structure of the hymn fits better with my interpr.
133

### IV.55.6  
This vs. is close to impenetrable. For my view of its function in the hymn,
see publ. intro. I am still baffled by the concentration on water in bcd and by the
proper disposition of the parts of cd.
The first question to approach is the root identity and referent of iṣṭá- in b.
The standard view is that it belongs to √iṣ ‘desire’ and the phrase ápyebhir iṣṭaíḥ
refers to “desired watery (gods)” (so, more or less, Ge, Re, WG) as an instr. of
accompaniment referring to another set of recipients of praise. Although there do
seem to be one, at most two, references to watery gods (masc.) -- VI.50.11, maybe
VII.35.11 (though that appears to have fem. referents) -- most of the animate beings
qualified as ápya- are females. I don’t know who the watery gods might be. My
interpr. of the phrase is quite diff.: I take iṣṭá- to √yaj ‘sacrifice’. Although its ppl.
iṣṭá- is rare and rarely applied to the object sacrificed, there are such examples:
compare I.162.15, where it refers to the sacrificed horse, also in the same hymn
svìṣṭa- yajñá- vs. 5. I then take our ápya- iṣṭá- to be equivalent to X.86.12 ápyaṃ
havíḥ “watery oblation.”
Under this interpr. the water sacrifices are what the unnamed priests have
revealed /opened up (ápa vran, using language from the Vala myth), and they are
implicitly compared with two different entities: the contents of the gharma pot and
rivers. In d gharmásvarasaḥ, lit. ‘having the gurgling of the gharma pot’, targets the
sound of the watery sacrifices, while samúdraṃ ná saṃcáraṇe … nadyàḥ “like rivers
in their converging on the sea” refers to their movement to their goal (presumably
the gods -- cf. X.86.12 yásyedáṃ havíḥ priyáṃ devéṣu gáchati). I have major
misgivings about my interpr., however, for several reasons. The parts of the simile
just proposed are quite separated, with the first part opening c and the ‘rivers’ only
appearing in the middle of d, after the bahuvrīhi referring to the gharma pot.
Although some distraction of complex similes is not rare, this seems an extreme
example. Moreover, pāda c is identical to I.56.2, where there are no rivers in the
context (but where the pāda doesn’t make much sense in context either). On the other
hand, rivers converging on the sea is a very common trope in the RV, and so the
distraction would not be too challenging to interpret. I am not particularly convinced
by my own construction of this hemistich, but I find the the various other attempts at
wringing sense out of it (in addition to the standard tr., cf. Lüders [Var. 190–91]) no
more (indeed generally less) persuasive.

### IV.55.7  
As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. in part forms a clear ring with vs. 1
and provides the answer to the question in 1a. Note the recurrence of the gods Aditi,
Mitra, and Varuṇa, as well as of the agent noun trātár- and a finite form of the root
√trā (here trātā́trāyatām).
The 2nd hemistich is somewhat puzzling, however, and has given rise to a
number of competing interpr. (in addition to the standard, see Janert [Dhāsi, pp. 6,
43ff., 52], Thieme [ZDMG 95.109], Scar [387], and Lühr 1997 [cited by Scar]). Ge
and Re both attempt to give sā́nu a loc. sense (Ge by taking it as a truncation of
sā́nuni, a move that Re disallows), but by form it ought to be an object parallel to
dhāsím: the dhāsí of Mitra and Varuṇa (and) the back of Agni. This is the interpr. of
134
Janert, and I follow him in his syntactic evaluation, though I do not necessarily
follow him in seeing the dhāsí- of M+V as the seat of truth nor the back of Agni as
the back of the Sun (as the heavenly Agni). I tentatively suggest that not violating the
back of Agni means not failing to provide appropriate oblations (recall that Agni is
sometimes called ghṛtásnu- ‘ghee-backed’). Judging from X.30.1, the “wellspring of
Mitra and Varuṇa” is in heaven among the gods -- presumably the source of rain. Not
violating it may again mean not failing to make the oblations that will travel to
heaven and replenish that source of water. Perhaps the “watery sacrifices” in vs. 6
are connected.
IV.56 Heaven and Earth

### IV.56.1  
As often, árka- can be a pun, both ‘ray’ and ‘chant’.
As Ge (and others) suggest, the bull in d is probably Agni (/Sun), who every
morning recreates the two worlds in their separation with his light.

### IV.56.2  
This vs. contains several puns, including a repetition of śucáyadbhir árkaiḥ
from 1d. The final word of the 1st hemistich ukṣámāṇe can belong either to √ukṣ
‘sprinkle’ or to √vakṣ ‘grow’, and both are appropriate. And the preceding negated
participle áminatī can take different objects and utilize different senses of the root
√mī. On the one hand, as Re (and others) point out, the other occurrence of áminatī
(I.92.12=124.2) takes daívyāni vratā́ni “heavenly commandments” as object.
However, cf. nearby ámīta-varṇa- ‘of immutable color’ (IV.51.9), which supports
Ge’s “ohne (ihr Aussehen) zu verändern.”

### IV.56.5  
The phrase máhi dyávī is very problematic morphologically. It echoes the
first two words of the hymn: mahī́dyā́vāpṛthivī “great Heaven and Earth,” but in a
very refracted form. I do not have a solution for how it came to take the form it has
(for various suggestions, see Old and the standard tr., as well as lit. cit. therein, e.g.
AiG III.52, 226). I can get a certain distance, quite speculatively, but no further. I
tentatively suggest that we start with an alternative dual dvandva *dyā́vā-mahī́, with
mahī́‘the great (fem.)’ substituting for ‘earth’. I then suggest that something like a
Vāyav Indraś ca construction was created to it, with the 2nd member properly
providing the first term of the construction (see my “Vāyav Indraś ca Revisited”).
The proper voc. sg. of mahī́- would be máhi (which is indeed attested, though
without accent [and not qualifying earth]). In this context it shouldn’t have an accent,
but that’s the least of our problems. Unfortunately that’s as far as I can get. We
should expect, per my suggestion, the 2nd part of the construction to contain *dyaúś
ca, and that’s about as far from dyávī as one can be and still belong to the same stem.
I can spin a line of analogies: dyávī is a rough-and-ready nominative sg., built from a
full-grade form of the stem found in dyā́vā (found in loc. sg. dyávi) and the fem. -ī.
But I can’t imagine why anyone would create such a form, particularly to a stem so
well known to every RVic poet. If it participated in a phonetic or semantic figure,
there might be motivation but I see none.
135

### IV.56.6  
In ab mitháḥ ‘mutually’ and svéna dákṣeṇa ‘by your own skill’ seem
implicitly to contrast.
On ūhyā́the see Old and more recently Kü (489–90) and Hoffmann (Aufs.
III.776).
IV.57 Agricultural Divinities

### IV.57.1  
With Ge, Re, Oberlies (RRV I.189), I supply mitréṇa with hiténeva; WG by
contrast take it to √hi ‘impel’ and assume a winning horse.
## IV.58 Ghee

### IV.58.2  
The final pāda, with Soma (as a buffalo) vomiting (avamīt) ghee, takes one
aback, esp. after the high-style extolling that has preceded it. Ge’s explanation, that
“ghee” is a secret sacred word (“ein sakrales Geheimwort”) and Soma reveals it, may
be correct. But the bluntness of the verb still surprises, and I am inclined to think
something further is going on. There are only two verb forms to √vam in the RV, and
the other one (váman X.108.8) also has speech as its object, but the evil Paṇis as subj.
Note that the Paṇis are found in vs. 4, as hiders of the ghee. Does our passage
express some sort of rivalry between the two ritual substances? Or does it have to do
with the Sautrāmaṇi ritual, meant to cure Indra after vomiting?

### IV.58.3  
Clearly no bull found in nature. The numerology here presumably has to do
with items in the ritual. For a conspectus of later interpr., see WG n.

### IV.58.4  
As was just noted, the Paṇis (niggards) may be indirectly implicated in the
verb avamīt in 2d. Here they appear overtly, as the hiders of ghee -- presumably a
reference to their stealing of the cows, since the gods find the ghee in the cow in pāda
b.
The threefold nature and creation of ghee has been variously interpreted; it
again participates in the numerology of the hymn. I do not have a view on it.
IV.58.5–10: Each of these 6 vss. contains the phrase ghrtásya dh ̥ ā́rāḥ (or equiv.:
ūrmáyo ghrtásya ̥ in 6c).

### IV.58.5  
“My” ability to see the ghee streams indirectly attests to my good character,
since the cheat cannot see them.

### IV.58.6  
Pāda c combines etā́arṣanti from 5a with a variant of the repeated ghr̥tásya
dhā́rāḥ, namely ūrmáyo ghrtásya ̥ .

### IV.58.7  
A difficult verse, primarily because of the two hapaxes, śūghanā́saḥ and
vā́tapramiyaḥ. The former is taken by Ge as ‘whirlpools, eddies’ (Wirbel)(followed

not terribly enthusiastically by Re) on no particular basis, and others have added their
own at best weakly supported tr.: e.g., Thieme ‘cow-killing’ [śū- < *pśu-] KlSch. 52),
most recently WG ‘die schwellenden Massen’ (presumably with root noun 1st
member and later ghana- ‘clump, mass’). The interpr. reflected in the publ. tr. is no
stronger than these others. It begins with ghaná- ‘smiter’ (well represented in the
RV), as Th’s also must. But for 1st member I assume a zero-grade of āśú- ‘swift’ (for
the uncertainties of the initial of the PIE ‘swift’ words, see EWA s.v.) with
lengthening at compound seam. With two such ad hoc assumptions, this interpr. is
simply a place-holder.
As for vā́tapramiyaḥ, there is no question about its component parts, merely
about how they fit together. -pramiyaḥ patterns with the nearby forms IV.54.4
pramíye (‘to be violated’) and IV.55.7 pramíyam (‘to violate’). It also strongly recalls
I.24.6 ná yé vā́tasya praminánti ábhvam “nor those [=the gods] who confound the
wind’s formless mass.” As Old points out, this latter passage fixes the interpr. of our
cmpd.: the first member must be functionally the object of the 2nd. The problem is the
accent; it should be a bahuvrīhi, not a tatpuruṣa. See, however, Scar (388), who
suggests a plausible bahuvrīhi interpr. ‘die Schmälerung des Windes habend’, with
the first member essentially an objective genitive. The point is that the speed and
violence of the streams are stronger than those of the wind, which is thus confounded.
I read kā́ṣṭhā(ḥ) in both simile and frame: in the simile it refers to the wooden
barriers of the race-course that the horse splits in his speeding around the course, in
the frame to sticks floating in the current of the streams and split (against rocks vel
sim.) by the violent speed of that current. (Of course the “frame” here is itself
metaphorical, since these are streams of ghee, not actual watercourses.)

### IV.58.8  
The violence of the movement of the ghee-streams in the preceding vs. is
abruptly replaced by the placid and benign approach of these same streams in this vs.

### IV.58.11  
Re points out the ring composition of 11d mádhumantaṃ ta ūrmím and 1a
ūrmír mádhumān.

## 01
1 [^1] . The (rites) based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall declare the Gṛhya (rites).

## 02
2 [^2] . There are three (kinds of) Pākayajñas, the hutas, (i.e. the sacrifices) offered over the fire; over something that is not the fire, the prahutas; and at the feeding of Brāhmaṇas, those offered in the Brahman.

## 03
3 [^3] . And they quote also Ṛcas, 'He who with a piece of wood or with an oblation, or with knowledge ("veda").'

## 04
4 [^4] . Even he who only puts a piece of wood (on the fire) full of belief, should think, 'Here I offer a sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!'

(The Ṛc quoted above then says), 'He who with an oblation'and, 'He who with knowledge;' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).

Seeing this the Ṛṣi has said, 'To him who does not keep away from himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.' Thereby he means, 'This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.'

(And another Ṛṣi says), 'To thee, O Agni, by this Ṛc we offer an oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.' (Thereby he means), 'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Svādhyāya).'

(And further on the Ṛc quoted above says), 'He who (worships Agni) with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.' 'Verily also by the performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice'thus runs a Brāhmaṇa.



[^1]:  1, 1. The spreading (vitāna or, as it is also called, vihāra or vistāra) of the sacred fires is the taking of two of the three sacrificial fires, the Āhavanīya fire and the Dakṣiṇāgni, out of the Gārhapatya fire (see, for instance, Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 216 seq.). The rites based on, or connected with the vitāna; are the rites forming the subject of the Śrauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three fires.

[^2]:  Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7. The division here is somewhat different from that given by Śāṅkhāyana; what Śāṅkhāyana calls ahuta, is here prahuta ('sacrificed up'); the prahutas of Śāṅkhāyana form here no special category; the prāśitas of Śāṅkhāyana are the brahmaṇi hutās of Āśvalāyana. Thus Āśvalāyana has three categories, while Śāṅkhāyana (and quite in the same way Pāraskara I, 4, 1) gives four. Nārāyaṇa mentions as an example of prahuta sacrifices the baliharaṇa prescribed below, I, 2, 3.

[^3]:  Rig-veda VIII, 19, 5, The mortal who with a piece of wood, or with an oblation, or with knowledge worships Agni, who with adoration (worships him) offering rich sacrifices,' &c.

[^4]:  The words of the Ṛc, 'with an oblation,' are here repeated, the Vedic instrumental āhutī being replaced and explained by the regular form āhutyā.

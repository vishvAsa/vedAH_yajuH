19 [^9] . Or also, if he does not know the Ṛṣis, deities, and metres, the teacher recites this verse, 'That glorious (splendour) of Savitar' (Rig-veda III, 62, 10), pāda by pāda, hemistich by hemistich, (and finally) without a stop, and says, when he has finished, 'This (verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gāyatrī; Viśvāmitra is its Ṛṣi).'


[^9]:  According to Nārāyaṇa by esheti (literally, 'This [is the Ṛc]') it is meant that the teacher, after having recited the Sāvitrī in the three ways mentioned, should say to the student, 'This Ṛc is in the Gāyatrī metre. If recited pāda by pāda, it has three pādas. Thus also this Ṛc, if recited hemistich by hemistich, has two Avasānas (pauses), the first at the end of the hemistich, the second at the end of the third carma (or pāda). Thus also this Ṛc is recited without stopping; at the end of the three caraṇas, or of the twenty-four syllables, the pause (avasāna) should be made. Thus I recite to thee the Sāvitrī; I recite to thee the Gāyatrī; I recite to thee the verse of Viśvāmitra.' 'For,' adds Nārāyaṇa, 'if the Gāyatrī has been recited, the whole complex of the Veda being of that very p. 72 substance, a complete knowledge thereof has been produced.' The commentator then indicates a shorter form for the teacher's words which our Sūtra prescribes by esheti, 'This verse belongs to Savitar; it is a Gāyatrī; its Ṛṣi is Viśvāmitra.'

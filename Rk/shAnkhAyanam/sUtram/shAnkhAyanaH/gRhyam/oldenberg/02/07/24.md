24 [^11] . Or of (each) Anuvāka,


[^11]:  24 seq. This seems to be an abridged method by which students who had not the intention of becoming Vedic scholars, and probably chiefly students of the Kṣatriya and Vaiśya caste, could fulfil their duty of learning the Veda; a student who knew the first and last hymn of a Ṛṣi, or of an Anuvāka, was, as would seem from these Sūtras, by a sort of fiction considered as though he had known the whole portion belonging to that Ṛṣi, or the whole Anuvāka.

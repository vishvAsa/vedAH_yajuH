[^2]:  2, 3. These Sūtras are identical with Pāraskara I, 3, 29. 30. The following Sūtra of Pāraskara stands in the Śāṅkhāyana text as p. 88 Sūtra 10. Probably Pāraskara here represents the text which both Sūtrakāras follow, more exactly, and the enumeration given by Śāṅkhāyana in Sūtras 4-9 of the different categories of Arghyas with the corresponding deities, is an addition to that original stock of rules.

[^1]:  15, 1. This Sūtra presupposes the Śrauta-sūtra IV, 21, 1: 'To six persons the Argha reception is due, viz. to the teacher, to an officiating priest, to the father-in-law, to a king, to a Snātaka, to a friend.' Here the fourth person mentioned is the śvaśura, while in the Gṛhya text the expression vaivāhya is used. It is difficult not to believe that both words are used in the same sense, and accordingly Nārāyaṇa says vivāhyaḥ śvaśuraḥ. Comp.

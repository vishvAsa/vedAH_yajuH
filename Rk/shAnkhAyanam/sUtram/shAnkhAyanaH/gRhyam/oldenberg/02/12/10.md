10 [^5] . Raw flesh, a Caṇḍāla, a woman that has lately been confined, or that has her courses, blood, persons whose hands have been cut off, cemeteries, and all sorts of corpse-like (animals?) which enter (their dens?) with the mouth first (?), keeping them away from the place where he dwells.


[^5]:  With Sūtikā is meant a woman during the first ten days after her confinement, for which period the aśauca lasts.Apahasta is rendered by Nārāyaṇa by chinnahasta; the comment on the Śāmbavya-Gṛhya mentions āyudhāṅkitahastāṃś ca. The translation of the last words of this Sūtra (sarvāṇi ca śavarūpāṇi yāny āsye na [or āsyena?] praviśeyuḥ svasya vāsān nirasan) is absolutely uncertain. Nārāyaṇa says that such animals as lions, serpents, &c. are designated in common use as śavarūpāṇi. (This literally means, 'having the form of a corpse.' Immediately afterwards Nārāyaṇa gives a nearly identical explanation of śavarūpa as different from the one stated first. So perhaps we may conjecture that his first explanation rests on a reading sarparūpāṇi; comp. the reading sarvarūpa of Pāraskara.) Of these the animals entering their dwelling-places with the mouth first (āsyena) are to be understood here as forming, when looked at, an impediment for the study. Nārāyaṇa then says that other authorities understand śava in the sense of a dead human body; then śavarūpāṇi are beings having the form thereof (tadrūpāṇi), such as dogs, jackals, &c. The words yāny āsyena praviśeyuḥ signify that the study is impeded also on the sight of lions, tigers, &c.; for these enter their dwelling-places with their faces first (? anumukhaiḥ kṛtvā). The words svasya vāsān nirasan mean, p. 82 according to Nār., 'when hei.e. the teachergoes out of his dwelling-place.' Rāmacandra says that śavarūpa either means lions, snakes, and other dangerous animals, or nails, horns, and other such things that fall off or are severed from the body. The text of the Śāmbavya MS. is sarvāṇi ca śyāmarūpāṇi yāvānyā (?) praviśeyuḥ, which the commentary explains, sarvāṃś ca bhakṣyavargāṃś ca. I think there can be little doubt that the text of Śāṅkhāyana is correct (except that some doubt will remain as to āsyena or āsye na), the more so as the passage reoccurs, nearly identically, below at VI, 1, 4. 5. As to the translation we can only go so far as to venture the opinion that the Śāṅkhāyana text does not admit the interpretation given by Jayarāma, and accepted by Professor Stenzler (who compares Āpastamba I, 11, 27; Gautama XVI, 41) in Pāraskara II, 11, 3 for sarvarūpa, which consequently should, in our opinion, be rejected also in that passage of Pāraskara. For ascertaining the true meaning of śavarūpa we shall have to wait until new parallel passages have been discovered.

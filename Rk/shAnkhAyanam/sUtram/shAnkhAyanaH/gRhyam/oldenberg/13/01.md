1 [^1] . At the middle (Aṣṭakā) and in the middle of the rainy season,


[^1]:  13, 1. On madhyāvarṣa, comp. Weber, loc. cit., pp. 331, 337. Nārāyaṇa understands not 'in the middle of the rainy season,' but 'in the middle of the year' (see his note, p. 146 of the German edition). I cannot help thinking that the word madhyāvarṣe, given by the MSS. here and in Pāraskara III, 3, 13, and explained by Nārāyaṇa, is a corrupt reading which we should correct into māghyavarṣe ('the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakṣatra Maghās'), or something like that. The MSS. of Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya II, 5, 9 have māghyāvarṣaṃ, māghāvarṣaṃ, mādhyāvarṣaṃ. Viṣṇu (LXXVI, 1, comp. LXXVIII, 52, and Professor Jolly's note, Sacred Books of the East, VII, p. 240) mentions 'the three Aṣṭakās, the three Anvaṣṭakās, a Māgha day which falls on the thirteenth of the dark half of the month Prauṣṭhapada.' Comp. Manu III, 273, varṣāsu ca maghāsu ca; Yājñavalkya I, 260.

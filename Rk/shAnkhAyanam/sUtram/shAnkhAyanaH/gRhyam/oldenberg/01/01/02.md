[^2]:  As to the duty of the Vedic student of putting every day a piece of wood on the sacred fire of his teacher, see below, II, 6, 8, and compare the Gṛhya-saṃgraha-pariśiṣṭa II, 58. According to a Kārikā given by Nārāyaṇa, and the Karmapradīpa (I, 6, 13). the prescription of this Sūtra regarding the time for the kindling of the sacred fire refers exclusively to the case of vāgdāna (betrothal). Comp. also Dr. Bloomfield's note on the Gṛhya-saṃgraha-pariśiṣṭa I, 76 (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXV, 560). In the Kārikā it is stated that if the betrothed girl dies after the fire has been kindled, but before the marriage, the sacrificer is not to forsake his fire, but to marry another girl; if he cannot find a bride, he should make the fire enter into himself according to the rules given by Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya V, 1, and himself become uttarāśramin, i.e. enter one of the two final Āśramas.

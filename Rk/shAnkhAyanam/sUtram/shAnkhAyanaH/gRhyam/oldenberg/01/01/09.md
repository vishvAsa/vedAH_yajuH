9 [^5] . Some say that (the fire should be fetched from one of the above-mentioned places) in the evening and in the morning.


[^5]:  9-11. I now differ from the opinion which I pronounced in my German edition with regard to the relation in which these three Sūtras stand to each other. I think they ought to be understood thus: 9. Some teachers say that the fetching of the fire from its yoni, as taught in Sūtra 8, ought to be done twice; in the evening, so that the fire, after the necessary rites have been performed, goes out, and then again in the morning. 10. But my (the author's) teacher (comp. as to acāryāḥ, Kātyāyana's Śrauta-sūtra I, 3, 7; Professor Garbe's note on Vaitāna-sūtra 1, 3) is of opinion that the fire should be fetched only once, and that with this fire the ceremonies which are taught by the Adhvaryus are to be performed in the evening (see, for instance, Kāty. IV, 7. 8, which passage is paraphrased here by Nārāyaṇa). 11. In the morning (according to the same teacher, not, as I once understood this passage, according to the eke referred to in Sūtra 9), a full oblation is to be offered, &c.

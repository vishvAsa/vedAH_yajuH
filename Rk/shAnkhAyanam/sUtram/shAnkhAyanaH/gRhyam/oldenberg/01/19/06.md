6 [^1] . Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months.


[^1]:  19, 6. The first verse is that quoted already at chap. 16, 8. The text of the verses quoted in this Sūtra is very corrupt; see the notes on p. 36 of the German edition.

'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth.

'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhātar, thus Prajāpati has said.

'Prajāpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man.

'From the auspicious sperms which the men pro duce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow.

'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, put into her; to generation we call thee.

'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb. Him thou shalt bear; (having dwelt) ten months in the womb may he be born, the most excellent of his kin.'

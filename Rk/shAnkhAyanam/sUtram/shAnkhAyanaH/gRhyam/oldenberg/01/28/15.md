15 [^2] . With (the words), 'The razor with which in the beginning Savitar, the knowing one, has shaven the beard of king Varuṇa, and with which Dhātar Bṛhaspati has shaven Indra's head, with that, ye Brāhmaṇas, shave this (head) to-day; blessed with long life, with old age be this man N.N.!' he cuts the tips of the hairs and the Kuśa shoot.


[^2]:  The parallel texts show that instead of Bṛhaspatir we have to read Bṛhaspater, instead of adya, asya. So the correct translation would be, '. . . with what Dhātar has shaven Bṛhaspati's and Indra's head, with that do ye Brāhmaṇas shave this head of this (child).'

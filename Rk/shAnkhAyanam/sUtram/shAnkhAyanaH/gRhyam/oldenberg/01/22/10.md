10 [^2] . Ties (the fruits) to a string of three twisted threads and fastens them to her neck with the words, 'Rich in sap is this tree; like the sappy one be thou fruitful.'


[^2]:  Nārāyaṇa: tisṛbhis tantubhir vṛtte sūtre udumbaraphalāni . . . gale . . . badhnāti. I have translated accordingly. Pāraskara I, 15, 6 uses the same expression trivṛt. Professor Stenzler there translates it, on the authority of Jayarāma, 'dreifache Haarflechte,' and says in his note on that passage that, according to Śāṅkhāyana, he would have to tie the things with a threefold string to the neck of the woman, as if Śāṅkhāyana's statement were different from that of Pāraskara. But both authors have the same word, and only the commentators differ in their explanations thereof.

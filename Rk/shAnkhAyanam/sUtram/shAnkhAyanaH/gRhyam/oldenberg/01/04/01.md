[^1]:  4, 1. The Paddhati of Rāmacandra understands svādhyāyam adhīyīta as a prescription to perform the daily Brahmayajña (comp., for instance, Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya III, 2; Āpastamba I, 11, 22 seq.), which consists in the recitation of portions of the Veda; the hymns and verses stated in Sūtra 2 are, according to the same authority, to be repeated immediately after the recitation of the svādhyāya ('svādhyāyānantaram'). Nārāyaṇa, on the contrary, considers that the svādhyāya prescribed in Sūtra 1 consists of those very hymns and verses which are indicated in the second Sūtra. As to the Brahmayajña, he says that the ca at the end of the second Sūtra may be referred to it ('the word ca means that texts procuring a long life, such as Rig-veda I, 89, should be murmured, or an injunction of the Brahmayajña is intended'). At all events it is very difficult to believe that the recitation of the texts stated in this chapter should be quite independent from the daily Brahmayajña. About the performance of the Brahmayajña in our days comp. the note of Professor Bühler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. 43.

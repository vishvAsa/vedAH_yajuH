4 [^4] . In the oblations of cooked food the acts of taking (the intended oblation), of putting it down (near the fire), and of sprinkling it (with water) are performed with regard to the deities of the (respective) Mantras.


[^4]:  For instance, the taking of the portion of food destined to Agni should be performed with the Mantra: Agnaye tvā jushtaṃ gṛhṇāmi, &c. A number of ceremonies common to the Sthālīpāka ritual and to the ordinary ritual of Ājya oblations, such as the strewing of Kuśa grass round the fire, the ceremonies regarding the Pavitras (strainers), &c., have to be supplied here from the Ājya ritual given below (ch. 7 seq.); this may be looked upon as an argument in favour of our conjecture which will be stated in the preface (vol. ii of the Gṛhya-sūtras), that our text, as probably is the case also with the Pāraskara-sūtra, is based on an original, the opening sentences of which are preserved to us in Śāṅkh. I, 5, 1-5 = Pāraskara I, 4, 1-5, so that the first chapters of Śāṅkhāyana, and among them the exposition of the festivals of the full and new moon, would have been prefixed to the original commencement of the text.

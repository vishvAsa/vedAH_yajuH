1 [^1] . 'Stand here, O post, firm, rich in horses and cows, . . . .; stand safely, dropping ghee; stand here, fixed in the ground, prosperous, long-lasting(?), amid the prosperity of people who satiate themselves. May the malevolent ones not reach thee!

'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the sweet essence (?) of food is called hither to our house.

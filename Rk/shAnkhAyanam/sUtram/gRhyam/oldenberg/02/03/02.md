2 [^2] . 'In Indra's course I move; in the sun's course I move after him'with these words he turns round from left to right,


[^2]:  Literally, 'he turns round, following his right arm.' Nārāyaṇa here has the following note, 'Ācāryo baṭor dakṣiṇaṃ bāhuṃ hastaṃ aindrīm āvṛtam iti mantreṇānvāvartayet. ayam arthaḥ, ācārya imaṃ mantraṃ japtvā taṃ baṭuṃ ca vācayitvā pradakṣiṇāvartaṃ kārayet.' I believe that the commentator here, as he frequently does, instead of interpreting the text of Śāṅkhāyana, fathers p. 65 on him statements belonging to other Sūtras, in this case probably to Āśvalāyana I, 20, 9. As our text has not anvāvartya but anvāvṛtya; and in the Mantra not āvartasva but āvarte, we must conclude that he turned round himself, and, as far as the statements of the text go, did not cause the pupil to do so.

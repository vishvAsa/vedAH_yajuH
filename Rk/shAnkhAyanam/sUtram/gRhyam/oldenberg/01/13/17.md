17 [^4] . She sacrifices those (fried grains).


[^4]:  I believe that the words forming this Sūtra, tāñ juhoti, are taken from the same lost old Gṛhya text which Śāṅkhāyana has followed word for word also in I, 5, 1-5 and elsewhere. This is made probable by the comparison of Pāraskara I, 6, 2. The author of our text, while literally adopting the words of his original, has not quite succeeded in welding them together with his own statements; thus the sacrifice of grains is treated of in this Sūtra and in the first Sūtra of the next chapter, as if there were two different acts, while indeed it is one and the same.

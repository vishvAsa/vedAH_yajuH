8 [^4] . He should light his fire at one of the following places, viz. in the house of a Vaiśya who is rich in cattle, at a frying-pan, or (at the fire of) one who offers many sacrifices.


[^4]:  Or, 'at (the fire of) a person rich in cattle, in the house of a Vaiśya,' &c.? The commentators (see p. 118 of the German p. 14 edition) differ as to whether in purupaśu-viṭkula one or two alternatives are contained, and it is interesting to see that the Sūtra authors themselves differed in this respect; Pāraskara (I, 2, 3), when declaring from what place the fire should be fetched, speaks of the house of a Vaiśya rich in cattle; Āśvalāyana, on the contrary, who in the Gṛhya-sūtra does not expressly treat of the kindling of the domestic fire, in the corresponding passage of the Śrauta-sūtra (II, 2, 1), gives the rule that the dakṣiṇāgni is to be fetched from the house of a Vaiśya or from a rich person.'

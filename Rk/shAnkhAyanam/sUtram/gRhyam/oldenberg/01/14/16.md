16 [^7] . A hundred (cows) with a chariot (he gives to a father) who has only daughters.


[^7]:  Comp. the passages quoted by Professor Stenzler on Pāraskara I, 8, 18. Nārāyaṇa has the following note: 'To a duhitṛmat, i.e. to the father of a girl who has no brother, he shall give a hundred cows and besides a chariot, in order to destroy the guilt brought about by marrying a girl who has no brother.' Possibly we should here emancipate ourselves from the authority of the commentators, and explain duhitṛmat 'he who gives his daughter in marriage,' the bride's father. Comp. Āpastamba II, 11, 18; II, 13, 12; Weber, Indische Studien, V, 343, note 2.

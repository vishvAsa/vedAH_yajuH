5 [^1] . The verse for the Anointing is, 'May the Viśve devās anoint (or, unite),' (ibid. 47.)


[^1]:  12, 5. On the ceremony of 'salving together' (samañjana), comp. Pāraskara I, 4, 14; Gobhila II, 2, &c. Professor Stenzler is certainly wrong in translating Pāraskara's samañjayati by 'heisst sie beide zusammentreten' (according to Jayarāma's explication, sammukhīkaroti). It is clear from Śāṅkhāyana, that a real anointing of bridegroom and bride took place. This was performed, according to Gobhila, by the 'audaka' (this seems to be the same person that is mentioned in Pāraskara I, 8, 3), of whom it is said, pāṇigrāhaṃ (i.e. the bridegroom) mūrdhadeśe ’vasiñcati, tathetarām. Nārāyaṇa, on the contrary, in his note on our passage, says that it is the bridegroom who anoints the eyes of the girl with the verse quoted. But the word sam-añjana, and the obvious meaning of the whole rite, make it rather probable that both were anointed, and that this was done by a third person.

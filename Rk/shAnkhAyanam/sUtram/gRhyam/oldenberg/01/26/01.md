1 [^1] . To Agni, to the Kṛttikās.


[^1]:  26, 1. This chapter is not found in the Śāmbavya-Gṛhya, and Nārāyaṇa expressly designates it as kṣepaka khaṇḍa. It is a sort of appendix to the Sūtras 25, 5. 6; a sacrifice having there been prescribed to three Nakṣatras with their presiding deities, an enumeration of the Nakṣatras and deities is here given. Compare, on similar lists, Weber's second article on the Nakṣatras seq. (Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1861), pp. 289 , 315, 367 seq.

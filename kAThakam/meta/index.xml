      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/rXhmXY9tE7M/m/uMbWTejuBwAJ&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Veda in Kashmir in 2 vols by HOS has CDs containing scan of a manuscript of 45 chapters of the Katha Brahmana. I have not had a chance to read them (and I do not read the Sharad script anyway) but according to the author M Witzel, these 45 chapters pertain to Grhya ceremonies completely. Even the surviving portions of the Katha Brahmana as edited by Suryakanta and others are very rich in Grhya Karma, so this makes sense. It appears that a significant portion of Kathaka Shatadhyayana Brahmana actually dealt with Grhya material. Significantly, the Charayaniya Mantrarshadhyaya states that all the Brahmana portions of the Katha Charayaniya Shakha were ascribed to Sumantu-Kashyapa. These Rishis are most commonly associated with the AV tradition, which as we all know, is particularly detailed in Grhya ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kathaka Yajurveda: The oral traditions became extinct possibly a few decades ago. They were found in central and eastern Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, possibly west Punjab and NWFP. In later times, they got restricted to Kashmir, where all their extant manuscripts have been unearthed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charayaniya Katha Yajurveda: Existed in Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kapisthala Katha Yajurveda: Found in West Punjab around the time of the invasion of Alexander. Also in parts of Gujarat. Only a fragmentary Samhita and Grhyasutra text exist, and followers of this shakha are said to exist at the mouths of Narmada and Tapi rivers in Gujarat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

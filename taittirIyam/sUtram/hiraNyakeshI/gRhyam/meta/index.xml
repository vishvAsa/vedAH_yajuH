      <description>&lt;p&gt;p. 133&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRIHYA-SŪTRA OF HIRANYAKESIN.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;p. 134 p. 135&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTORY NOTE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO THE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRIHYA-SŪTRA OF HIRANYAKESIN.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the excellent remarks of Professor Bühler on the position of Hiraṇyakesin among the Sūtra authors of the Black Yagur-veda (Sacred Books, vol. ii, p. xxiii seq.), I can here content myself with shortly indicating the materials on which my translation of this Gr̥hya-sūtra, which was unpublished when I began to translate it, is based. For the first half of the work I could avail myself, in the first place, of the text, together with the commentary of Mātr̥datta, which the late Dr. Schoenberg of Vienna had prepared for publication, and which was based on a number of MSS collated by him. It is my melancholy duty gratefully to acknowledge here the kindness with which that prematurely deceased young scholar has placed at my disposal the materials he had collected, and the results of his labour which he continued till the last days of his life. For the second half of the Sūtra his death deprived me of this important assistance; here then Professors Kielhorn of Göttingen and Bühler of Vienna have been kind enough to enable me to finish the task of this translation, by lending me two MSS. of the text and two MSS. of Mātr̥datta&amp;rsquo;s commentary which they possess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

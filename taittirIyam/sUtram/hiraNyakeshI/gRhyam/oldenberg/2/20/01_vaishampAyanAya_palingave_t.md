1. [^1]  For Vaiśampāyana, Paliṅgu, Tittira [sic], Ukha, Ātreya, the author of the Pada-text, Kauṇḍinya the author of the commentary, for the authors of the Sūtras, for Satyāṣāḍha (Hiraṇyakeśin), for the handers-down of the text, for the teachers, the Ṛṣis, the hermits dwelling in the woods, the chaste ones, for those who have only one wife.


[^1]:  20, 1. The Kāṇḍānukrama of the Ātreyī-śākhā, which has been printed by Professor Weber in his edition of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, vol. ii, p. 356, shows that the dative Paliṅgave ought to be corrected to Paiṅgaye. The 'vṛttikāra' is there called not Kauṇḍinya, but Kuṇḍina.

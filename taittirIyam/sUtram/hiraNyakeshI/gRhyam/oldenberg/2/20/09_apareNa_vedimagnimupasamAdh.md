9. [^2]  Having put wood on the fire to the west of the surface (on which he had performed the Tarpaṇa), and having performed the rites down to the Vyāhṛti oblations (&c., as above, chap. 18, 3-7).


[^2]:  There is only one difference between the text of this Sutra p. 246 and that of chap. 18, 3-7: instead of hutvā trīn āditoऽnuvākān adhīyate (18, 4) we read here, hutvā prathamenānuvākenādhīyate, which I believe must be translated, 'Having sacrificed with the first Anuvāka, they recite (that Anuvāka).' Mātṛdatta says, hutvā prathamottamānuvākam adhīyate.

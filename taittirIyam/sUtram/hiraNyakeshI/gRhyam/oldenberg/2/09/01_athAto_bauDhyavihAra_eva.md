1. [^1]  Now follows the distribution of Palāśa leaves (at different places).


[^1]:  9, 1. The text has bauḍhyavihāra, on which the commentary observes, bauḍhyāni palāśaparṇāni, teṣāṃ vihāro viharaṇaṃ nānādeśeṣu sthāpanaṃ bauḍhyavihāraḥ, karmanāma vā. The bauḍhyavihāra is, as its description clearly shows, a ceremony for propitiating Rudra and his hosts and for averting evil from the cattle and the fields. The commentary understands it as forming part of the śūlagava described in chap. 8, and with this opinion it would agree very well that no indication of the time at which the bauḍhyavihāra ought to be performed (such as āpūryamāṇapakṣe puṇye nakṣatre) is given. Comp. also Āpastamba VII, 20, 5 seq.

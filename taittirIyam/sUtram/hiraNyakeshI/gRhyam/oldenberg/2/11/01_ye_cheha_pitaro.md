1. [^1]  'The Fathers who are here and who are not here, and whom we know and whom we do not know: Agni, to thee they are known, how many they are, Jātavedas. May they enjoy what thou givest them in our oblation. Svadhā! Adoration!


[^1]:  11, 1. Ṛg-veda X, 15, 53; Atharva-veda XVIII, 4, 64; Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya II, 4, 13, &c. Before the verse, 'Carry the Ājya,' the Udīcyas, as Mātṛdatta states, insert the words, 'He then makes oblations of Ājya (with the Mantra, &c.).' According to this reading the words of the second Sūtra, 'In the same way, &c.,' would refer only to these last oblations.

'Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to the worlds (of the Fathers), Jātavedas, that I restore to you again. Unviolated with all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadhā! Adoration!

'Carry the Ājya, Jātavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting afar. May streams of Ājya flow to them; may their wishes with all their desires be fulfilled! Svadhā! Adoration!'

In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the Mantra, 'to the grandfathers,' 'to the great-grandfathers.'

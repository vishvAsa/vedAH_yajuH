3. [^1]  'This, O Varuṇa' (&c.; see I, chap. 27, Sūtra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!'


[^1]:  1, 3. The corrupt word vivṛttacakrā(ḥ) seems to contain a vocative fem. referring to Gaṅge - avivṛttacakra? The Āpastambīya Mantrapāṭha reads, vivṛttacakra āsīnās tīreṇa yamune tava. Comp. Āśvalāyana I, 14, 7; Pāraskara I, 15, 8.

He then makes the wife who has taken a bath, who wears a clean dress and ornaments, and has spoken with a Brāhmaṇa, sit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, in a round apartment. Standing to the east (of the wife), facing the west he parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, holding (also) a bunch of unripe fruits, with the Vyāhṛtis (and) with the two (verses), 'I invoke Rākā,' (and), 'Thy graces, O Rākā' (Taitt. Saṃh. III, 3, 11, 5). Then he recites over (his wife the formulas), 'Soma alone is our king, thus say the Brāhmaṇa tribes, sitting near thy banks, O Gaṅgā, whose wheel does not roll back (?)!' (and), 'May we find our way with thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water' (above I, 20, 5).

9. [^3]  (The teacher) with his pupils goes in an easterly or northerly direction, and where they find a pleasant water with a pleasant bathing-place, they dive into it and perform three suppressions of the breath with the Agharmarshaṇa hymn (Ṛg-veda X, 190 = Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 13. 14.). Holding purifiers (i.e. Darbha blades) in their hands they bathe with the three (verses), 'Ye waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Saṃh. IV, 1, 5, 1), with the four (verses), 'The gold-coloured, pure, purifying waters' (T.S.V, 6, 1, 1 seq.), and with the Anuvāka, '(Soma) which clears itself, the heavenly being' (Taitt. Br. I, 4, 8): giving the Darbha blades to each other and feigning to try to seize (??) each other.


[^3]:  On the last words of this Sūtra, Mātṛdatta says, ditsanta iveti dātum icchanta ivānyonyaṃ prati. athavā āditsanta iveti pāṭhaḥ. āditsanto muṣṇanta ivānyonyaṃ. - Professor Kielhorn's text MS. has, ātsaṃta ivānyonyaṃ; Professor Bühler's text MS., ditsaṃta ivānyonyaṃ.

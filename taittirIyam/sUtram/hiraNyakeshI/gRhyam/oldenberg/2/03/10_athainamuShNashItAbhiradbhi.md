[^3]:  Comp. Atharva-veda II, 10; Taitt. Brāhm. II, 5, 6.

'From chronic disease, from destruction, from wile, from Varuṇa's fetter I release thee. I make thee guiltless before the Brahman; may both Heaven and Earth be kind towards thee.

'May Agni together with the waters bring thee bliss, Heaven and Earth together with the herbs; may the air together with the wind bring thee bliss; may the four quarters of the heaven bring thee bliss.

'Rightly have the gods released the sun from darkness and from the seizing demon; they have dismissed him from guilt; thus I deliver this boy from chronic disease, from curse that comes from his kin, from wile, from Varuṇa's fetter.'

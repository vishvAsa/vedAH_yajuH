10. [^8]  'May Savitṛ protect thee. Mitra art thou by rights; Agni is thy teacher.


[^8]:  Śāṅkhāyana II, 3, 1; 4, 5. We ought to read apoऽśāna, instead of apoऽsānaḥ as the MSS. have.

'By the impulse of the god Savitṛ become Bṛhaspati's pupil. Eat water. Put on fuel. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time' - thus (the teacher) instructs him.

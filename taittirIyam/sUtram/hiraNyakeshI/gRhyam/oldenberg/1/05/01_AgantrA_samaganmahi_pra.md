1. [^1]  'To him who comes (to us), we have come. Drive ye away death! May we walk with him safely; may he walk here in bliss; (may he) walk in bliss until (he returns) to his house' - this (verse the teacher repeats) while (the boy) walks round the fire so as to keep his right side turned towards it.


[^1]:  5, 1. I read, pra su mṛtyuṃ yvyotana; comp. Mantra-Brāhmaṇa I, 6, 14 (Ṛg-veda I, 136, 1, &c.). As to the last Pāda, comp. Ṛg-veda III, 53, 20.

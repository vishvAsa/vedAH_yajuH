8. [^6]  Then (the teacher) touches with his right hand (the boy's) right shoulder, and with his left (hand) his left (shoulder), and draws (the boy's) right arm towards himself with the Vyāhṛtis, the Sāvitrī verse, and with (the formula), 'By the impulse of the god Savitṛ, with the arms of the two Aśvins, with Pūṣan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.!'


[^6]:  The word which I have translated 'draws . . . towards himself' is the same which is also used in the sense of 'he initiates him' (upanayate). Possibly we should correct the text: dakṣiṇaṃ bāhum anv abhyātmam upanayate, 'he turns him towards himself from left to right (literally, following his right arm).' Comp. Śāṅkhāyana II, 3, 2. - Regarding the Mantra, comp. Śāṅkhāyana II, 2, 12, &c.

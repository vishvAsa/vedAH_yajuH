5. [^1]  With (the remains of) that (Sthālīpāka) he entertains a learned Brāhmaṇa whom he reveres.


[^1]:  5, 6. In the commentary these Sūtras are divided thus: 5. tena brāhmaṇaṃ vidyāvantaṃ pariveveṣṭi; 6. yoऽsyāpacito bhavati tasmā ṛṣabhaṃ dadāti. (5. Therewith he entertains a learned Brāhmaṇa. 6. To one whom he reveres, he presents a bull.) The commentator observes that some authorities make one Sūtra of the two, so that the Brāhmaṇa who receives the food and the one to whom the bull is given, would be the same person.

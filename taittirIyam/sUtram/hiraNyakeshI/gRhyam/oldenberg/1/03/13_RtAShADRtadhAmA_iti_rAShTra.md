13. [^11]  The Rāṣṭrabhṛt (oblations he sacrifices) with (the twelve Mantras), 'The champion of truth, he whose law is truth.' After having quickly repeated (each) section, he sacrifices the first oblation with (the words), 'To him svāhā!' the second (oblation) with (the words), 'To them svāhā!'


[^11]:  Taittirīya. Saṃhitā III, 4, 7. 'To him' (tasmai) is masculine, 'to them' (tābhyaḥ) feminine. The purport of these words will be explained best by a translation of the first section of the Rāṣṭrabhṛt formulas: 'The champion of truth, he whose law is truth, Agni is the Gandharva. His Apsaras are the herbs; "sap" is their name. May he protect this power of holiness and this worldly power. May they protect this power of holiness and this worldly power. To him svāhā! To them svāhā!'

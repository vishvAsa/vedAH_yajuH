7. [^5]  (With the verse), 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice, or what I have done here deficiently, all that may Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, he who knows it, make well sacrificed and well offered for me. To Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, the offerer of well-offered (sacrifices), the offerer of everything, to him who makes us succeed in our offerings and in our wishes, svāhā!' - he offers (the Sviṣṭakṛt oblation) over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire), separated from the other oblations.

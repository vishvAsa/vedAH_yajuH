2. [^1]  Let him initiate a Brāhmaṇa at the age of seven years,


[^1]:  1, 2. The statement commonly given in the Gṛhya-sūtras and Dharma-sūtras is, that the initiation of a Brāhmaṇa shall take place in his eighth year, though there are differences of opinion whether in the eighth year after conception, or after birth (Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 19, 1. 2). Mātṛdatta states that the rule given here in the Gṛhya-sūtra refers to the seventh year after birth. In the Dharma-sūtra (comp. Āpastamba I, 1, 18) it is stated that the initiation of a Brāhmaṇa shall take place in the eighth year after his conception. Comp. the remarks of Professor Bidder, S.B.E., vol. ii, p. xxiii.

2. [^1]  If he wishes that one of his companions, or a pupil, or a servant should faithfully remain with him and not go away, he should bathe in the morning, should put on clean garments, should show patience (with that servant, &c.) during the day, should speak (only) with Brāhmaṇas, and by night he should go to the dwelling-place of that person, should make water into a horn of a living animal, and should three times walk round his dwelling-place, sprinkling (his urine) round it, with (the Mantra), 'From the mountain (I sever?) thee, from thy brother, from thy sister, from all thy relations. paṛṣīdaḥ kleṣyati (i.e. kvaiṣyasi?) śaśvat parikupilena saṃkrāmeṇāvicchidā, ūlena parimīḍho ऽ si parimīḍho ऽ sy ūlena.'


[^1]:  14, 2. Mātṛdatta: 'The description of the Samāvartana is finished. p. 176 Now some ceremonies connected with special wishes of the person who has performed the Samāvartana and has settled in a house, will be described.' In my opinion, it would be more correct to consider Sūtra 18 of the preceding section as the last of the aphorisms that regard the Samāvartana, With Sūtra 2 compare Pāraskara III, 7; Āpastamba VIII, 23, 6. It seems impossible to attempt to translate the hopelessly corrupt last lines of the Mantra.

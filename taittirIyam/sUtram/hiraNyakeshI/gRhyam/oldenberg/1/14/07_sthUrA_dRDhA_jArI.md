7. [^3]  One whose wife has a paramour, should grind big centipedes (?) to powder, and should insert (that powder), while his wife is sleeping, into her secret parts, with the Mantra, 'Indra. . . . from other men than me.'


[^3]:  On sthūrā driḍhā[ḥ] Mātṛdatta says, sthūrā dṛḍhāḥ sthūrāḥ śatapadyaḥ. A part of the Mantra is untranslatable on account of the very corrupt condition of the text. The reading given by most of the MSS. is, Indrāya yāsya śepham alikam anyebhyaḥ purushebhyoऽnyatra mat. The Āpastambīya Mantrapāṭha reads, indrāyāsya phaligam anyebhyaḥ purushebhyonyatra mat. The meaning very probably is that Indra is invoked to keep away from the woman the śepha of all other men except her husband's.

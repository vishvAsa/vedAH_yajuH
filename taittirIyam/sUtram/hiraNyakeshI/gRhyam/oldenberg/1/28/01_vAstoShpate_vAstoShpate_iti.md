1. [^1]  The two verses commencing 'Vāstoṣpati!' (Taitt. Saṃh. III, 4, 10, 1).


[^1]:  28, 1. Comp. Ṛg-veda III, 54, 2; Taitt. Brāhm. III, 7, 14, 4; Ṛg-veda X, 18, 1; Taitt. Brāhm. III, 7, 14, 5.

'Vāstoṣpati! Be our furtherer; make our wealth increase in cows and horses, O Indu (i.e. Soma). Free from decay may we dwell in thy friendship; give us thy favour, as a father to his sons. Svāhā!

'May death go away; may immortality come to us. May Vivasvat's son (Mama) protect us from danger. May wealth, like a leaf (that falls) from a tree, fall down over us. May Śacīpati (i.e. Indra) be with us. Svāhā!

'Go another way, O death, that belongs to thee, separated from the way of the gods. Vāstoṣpati! To thee who hears us, I speak: do no harm to our offspring nor to our heroes. Svāhā!

'To this most excellent place of rest we have gone, by which we shall victoriously gain cows, treasures, and horses. May wealth, like a leaf (that falls) from a tree, fall down over us. May Sacīpati be with us. Svāhā!

'This, O Varuṇa' (&c.; see chap. 27, Sūtra 1, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!'

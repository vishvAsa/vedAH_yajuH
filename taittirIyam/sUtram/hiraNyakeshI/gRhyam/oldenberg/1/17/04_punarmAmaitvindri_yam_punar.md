4. [^2]  'May my faculties return into me; may life return, prosperity return; may the divine power return into me; may my goods return to me.


[^2]:  Comp. Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya III, 6, 8.

'And may these fires that are stationed on the (altars called) Dhiṣṇyās, be in good order here, each in its right place. Svāhā!

'My self has returned, life has returned to me; breath has returned, design has returned to me. (Agni) Vaiśvānara, grown strong with his rays, may he dwell in my mind, the standard of immortality. Svāhā!

'The food which is eaten in the evening, that does not satiate in the morning him whom hunger assails. May all that (which we have seen in our dreams), do no harm to us, for it has not been seen by day. To Day svāhā!' - with these (verses) he sacrifices sesamum seeds mixed with Ājya, if he has seen a bad dream.

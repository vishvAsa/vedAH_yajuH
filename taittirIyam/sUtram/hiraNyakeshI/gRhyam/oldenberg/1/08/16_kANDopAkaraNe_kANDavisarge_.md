16. [^12]  At the beginning and on the completion of the study of a Kāṇḍa (of the Black Yajur-veda he sacrifices) with (the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful one, the friend of Indra, the dear one, I have entreated for the gift of insight. Svāhā!'


[^12]:  Ṛg-veda I, 18, 6. As the Ṛṣis of the single Kāṇḍas are considered, Prajāpati, Soma, Agni, the Viśve devās, Svayambhū. Regarding the Mantras quoted in the last section of this Sūtra, see above, I, 1, 3, 5-7.

In the second place the Ṛṣi of the Kāṇḍa (receives an oblation).

(Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varuṇa;' 'For this I entreat thee;' 'Thou, Agni;' 'Thus thou, Agni;' 'Thou, Agni, art quick;' 'Prajāpati!' and, 'What I have done too much in this sacrifice.' Here some add as subordinate oblations the Jaya, Abhyātāna, and Rāṣṭrabhṛt (oblations) as above.

End of the Second Paṭala.

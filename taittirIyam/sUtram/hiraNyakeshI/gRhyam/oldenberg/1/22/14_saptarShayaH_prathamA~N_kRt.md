14. He worships the seven Ṛṣis (ursa major) with (the verse), 'The seven Ṛṣis who have led to firmness she, Arundhatī, who stands first among the six Kṛttikās (pleiads): - may she, the eighth one, who leads the conjunction of the (moon with the) six Kṛttikās, the first (among conjunctions) shine upon us!' Then he worships the polar star with (the formula), 'Firm dwelling, firm origin. The firm one art thou, standing on the side of firmness. Thou art the pillar of the stars; thus protect me against my adversary.

Adoration be to the Brahman, to the firm, immovable one! Adoration be to the Brahman's son, Prajāpati! Adoration to the Brahman's children, to the thirty-three gods! Adoration to the Brahman's children and grandchildren, to the Aṅgiras!

He who knows thee (the polar star) as the firm, immovable Brahman with its children and with its grandchildren, with such a man children and grandchildren will firmly dwell, servants and pupils, garments and woollen blankets, bronze and gold, wives and kings, food, safety, long life, glory, renown, splendour, strength, holy lustre, and the enjoyment of food. May all these things firmly and immovably dwell with me!'

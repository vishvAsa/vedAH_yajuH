4. [^1]  If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition, or it should be fetched from the house of a Śrotriya.


[^1]:  22, 4 'If the fire on which they had put wood, was a fire produced by attrition, (the new fire) should (also) be kindled by attrition. If it was a common (laukika) fire that they had fetched, (the new fire) should be fetched from a Srotriya's house. Thereby it is shown that the common fire at the Upanayana ceremony, &c., should be fetched only from a Srotriya's house.' Mātṛdatta.

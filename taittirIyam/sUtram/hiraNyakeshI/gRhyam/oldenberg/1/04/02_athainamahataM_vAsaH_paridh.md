2. [^2]  After (the boy) has taken off his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that has not yet been washed, with (the verses),


[^2]:  Pāraskara I, 4, 13. 1 2; Atharva-veda II, 13, 2. 3 (XIX, 24). Instead of paridātavā u, we ought to read, as the Atharva-veda has, paridhātavā u.

'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the skirts on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life. Blessed with life put on this garment.

'Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of age; extend his life. Bṛhaspati has given this garment to king Soma that he may put it on.

'Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour; clothe thyself in the increase of wealth.'

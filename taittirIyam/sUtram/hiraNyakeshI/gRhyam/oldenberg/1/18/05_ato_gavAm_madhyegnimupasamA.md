[^3]:  In the second verse I propose to change abibhrad into p. 186 abibhyad; comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 65, 1: ava tāṃ jahi harasā Jātavedoऽbibhyad ugroऽ rciṣā divam ā roha sūrya. The last words of this verse should be śriyam mā pratipādaya, or something similar.

'Blaze brightly, O Jātavedas, driving destruction away from me. Bring me cattle and maintenance from all quarters of the heaven. Svāhā!

'May Jātavedas do no harm to us, to cows and horses, to men and to all that moves. Come hither, Agni, fearlessly; make me attain to welfare! Svāhā!' - 

And with (the two verses), 'This is the influx of the waters,' and 'Adoration to thee, the rapid one, the shining one' (Taitt. Saṃh. IV, 6, 1, 3).

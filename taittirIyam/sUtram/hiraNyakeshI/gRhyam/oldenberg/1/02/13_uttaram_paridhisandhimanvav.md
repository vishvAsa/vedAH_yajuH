13. [^4]  Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the northerly junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), and fixing his mind on (the formula), 'To Prajāpati, to Manu svāhā!' (without pronouncing that Mantra), he sacrifices a straight, long, uninterrupted (stream of Ājya), directed towards the south-east.


[^4]:  13, 14. The two oblations described in these Sūtras are the so-called Āghāras; see Sūtra 15, and Pāraskara I, 5, 3; Āśvalāyana I, 10, 13. Regarding the northern and the southern junction of the Paridhi woods, see above, Sūtras 3 and 4. According to Mātṛdatta, the words 'long, uninterrupted' (Sūtra 13) are to be supplied also in Sūtra 14.

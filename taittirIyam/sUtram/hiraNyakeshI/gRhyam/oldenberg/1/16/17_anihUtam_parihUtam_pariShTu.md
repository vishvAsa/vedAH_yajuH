17. [^10]  'The voices that are heard after us (?) and around us, the praise that is heard, and the voices of the birds, the deer's running (?) athwart: that we fear (?) from our enemies' - this (verse) he murmurs when setting out on a road.


[^10]:  The Mantra is very corrupt. Perhaps anihūtam should be corrected into anuhūtam, which is the reading of the Āpastambīya Mantrapāṭha. In the last Pāda bhayāmasi is corrupt; the meaning seems to be, 'that we (avert from ourselves and) turn it to our enemies.' Probably Dr. Kirste is right in reading bhajāmasi.

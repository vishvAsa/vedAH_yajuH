16. [^9]  Let him not touch a sacrificial post. By touching it, he would bring upon himself (the guilt of) whatever faults have been committed at that sacrifice. If he touches one (sacrificial post), he should say, 'This is thy wind;' if two (posts), 'These are thy two winds;' if many (posts), 'These are thy winds.'


[^9]:  Gobhila III, 3, 34. Should it be eṣa te vāyur iti?

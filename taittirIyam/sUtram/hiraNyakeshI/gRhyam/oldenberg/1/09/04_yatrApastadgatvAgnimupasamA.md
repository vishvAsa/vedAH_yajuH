4. [^1]  He goes to a place near which water is, puts wood on the fire, performs the rites down to the oblations made with the Vyāhṛtis, and puts a piece of Palāśa wood on (the fire) with (the verse), 'Let us prepare this song like a chariot, for Jātavedas who deserves it, with our prayer. For his foresight in this assembly is a bliss to us. Agni! Dwelling in thy friendship may we not suffer harm. Svāhā!'


[^1]:  9, 4. Comp. I, 1, 3, 4; Ṛg-veda I, 94, 1. 'Where the words are used, "He puts wood on the fire" (agnim upasamādhāya), he should prepare the ground by raising it, &c., should carry the fire to that place, should put wood on it, and then he should sacrifice in the fire. Where those words are not used, he should (only) strew grass round the fire which is (already) established in its proper place, and should thus perform the sacrifice.' Mātṛdatta.

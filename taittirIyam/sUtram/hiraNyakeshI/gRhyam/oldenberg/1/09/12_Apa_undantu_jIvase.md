12. [^6]  (The barber) moistens the hair near the right ear with (the words), 'May the waters moisten thee for life, for old age and splendour' (Taitt. Saṃhitā I, 2, 1, 1).


[^6]:  Pāraskara II, 1, 9. The same expression dakṣiṇaṃ godānam, of which I have treated there in the note, is used in this Sūtra. Comp., besides, Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 28, 9; Āpastamba-Śrauta-sūtra p. 164 X, 5, 8; Śatapatha-Br. III, 1, 2, 6. According to Mātṛdatta, there is some difference of opinion between the different teachers as to whether the Mantras for the moistening of the hair and the following rites are to be repeated by the teacher or by the barber.

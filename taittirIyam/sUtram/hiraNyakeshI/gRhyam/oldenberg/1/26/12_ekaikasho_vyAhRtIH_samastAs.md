10. [^3]  Having made oblations with the single Vyāhṛtis and with (the three Vyāhṛtis together), 


[^3]:  As to the Mantra, 'Thou art quick, &c.,' comp. above, I, 1, 3, 5, and the note on Śāṅkhāyana I, 9, 12. I cannot see why the oblation made with this Mantra is called saptavatī (alluding to the number seven); possibly we ought to read satyavatī (containing the word satyam, 'verily'). Can the words sagrahaṃ hutvā mean, 'having performed the worship of the planets (graha) at his sacrifice'?

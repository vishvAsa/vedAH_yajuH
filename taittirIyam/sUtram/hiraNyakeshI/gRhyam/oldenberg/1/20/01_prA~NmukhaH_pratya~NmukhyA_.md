1. [^1]  Facing the east, while she faces the west, or facing the west, while she faces the east, he should seize her hand. If he desires to generate male children, let him seize her thumb; if he desires (to generate) female children, her other fingers; if he desires (to generate) both (male and female children), let him seize the thumb together with the other fingers, (so as to seize the hand) up to the hairs (on the hair-side of the hand).


[^1]:  20, 1. Śāṅkhāyana I, 13, 2; Āśvalāyana I, 7, 3 seq., &c. The text of the first Mantra ought to be corrected according to Pāraskara I, 7, 2; in the second Mantra we ought to read yathāsaḥ instead of yathāsat; comp. Ṛg-veda X, 85, 36; Pāraskara I, 6, 3. The bridegroom and the bride, of course, are to face each other; thus, if the bridegroom stands on the eastern layer of grass (Sūtra 9 of the preceding section), he is to face the west; if on the western, he is to face the east.

(He should do so with the two Mantras),

'Sarasvatī! Promote this (our undertaking), O gracious one, rich in studs, thou whom we sing first of all that is.

'I seize thy hand that we may be blessed with offspring, that thou mayst live to old age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitṛ, Purandhi, the gods have given thee to me that we may rule our house.'

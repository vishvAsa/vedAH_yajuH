He does not cross beyond across the Āhavanīya. The Adhvaryu recites the verse, "Agni has made a noise like thundering sky, licking the earth and devouring the plants. Being born presently and well kindled, it has shone. With its plants it shines between heaven and earth."[^2-575] The sacrificer turns around along the right shoulder with the four formulas, “O Agni, turning around, turn towards with long life, vigour, gift, intellect, offspring and wealth.-O Angiras Agni, may there be thy hundred rounds, a thousand subrounds. With the abundance of their abundance bring us back what is lost of us, bring us wealth back.—O Agni, return to us with vigour, with food, and long life (for us). Guard us again from all sides.-O Agni, return to us with wealth, swell us with stream feeding all on all sides."[^3-575] Having turned towards the north and having loosened the skin of black antelope, he removes the strands of the sling with the verse, "O Varuṇa, do thou loosen the uppermost bond, the lower one and the middle one. O Āditya, may we be innocent in respect of thy ordinance of non- bondage." He takes it up with two verses, "I have brought thee; do thou be within; stand here firm and immovable. May all people like thee, entrust the kingdom to him. This Agni, growing, has risen up in the presence of the dawns. Coming out, the lustre has risen from darkness. Agni equipped with limbs through the shining light, coming from all sides has filled up all seats."[^4-575]

Having brought it (the Ukhya fire) back in the same manner as it was carried, he keeps it within the altar with four verses including the hamsaverse, “O Agni, knowing all paths, do thou seat thyself in the lap of this mother. Do not burn it with the flame nor by heat. Do thou with bright lustre shine within it.-O Agni (do thou remain) within the cauldron, thy home with lustre. Being hot by its heat, O Jātavedas, do thou be auspicious.--Being auspicious to me, O Agni, be seated as auspicious.

When he is going to give Vrata-milk to the sacrificer, he puts on the fire a fire-stick intended for Annapati with the verse or he murmurs the verse, "Olord of food, do thou give us flowers and substantial food. Save one who gives. Give vigour to our biped and quadruped."[^7-577] He enkindles the fire in the cauldron with the verse, “May the sacrificer go safely with that lustre with which gods went above, with which the Ādityas, Vasus and Rudras, with which the Aṅgirases acquired greatness."[^8-577]

Whenever he has an occasion to hand over the Vrata-milk to him (the sacrificer), he puts on fire the firestick for Annapati with the verse, or may murmur it. In a similar manner he enkindles the fire in the cauldron. In the morning after the sun has risen and speech has been released, the sacrificer prays with Vātsapra hymn consisting of eleven verses, "Agni was first born in heaven; the Jātavedas had his second birth amongst us; the one who knows men had his third birth in waters. The pious man enkindling the eternal one prays him.-O Agni, we know thy three-fold three places we know thy abode which is established variously; we know thy secret name; we know the source from which thou hast come.-O Agni, one enkindled thee, the one who knows men and gazes at men, in the ocean, in waters and in the bosom of heaven. The great (sacrificers) gratified thee who art standing in the third region in the womb of the cosmic order.-Agni has made a noise like thundering sky...[^9-577] ---Among men has been deposited Agni who is eager, purifying, moving, wise and immortal. Continuing to hold brown smoke, he impels it above. He has reached the heaven with bright flame. The exposer of what is all around, the germ of the world has, at its birth, pervaded the heaven and earth. When the five people worshipped Agni, he (Agni) going afar, broke even the solid mountain.-Agni being enkindled before dawn shines, treasure of wealth, supporter of riches, fulfiller of desires, guardian of Soma, son of the shining one, of strength, and the one who reigns the waters. O Agni the youngest, do thou lead the sacrificer to a better and more and more better condition and brilliance attained by gods, who, O god of blissful radiance, offered thee a cake full of ghee.-O Agni, do thou be (with the worshipper) in all his deeds bringing him fame; be with him while each and every song of praise is being recited. May he be dear to Surya, dear to Agni; may he grow up with those who are born and who are to be born.--O Agni, the sacrificers held for thee day by day desirable wealth. Desiring wealth in thy association, they chose a cow-stall full of cattle.-Appearing like a golden sheet, Agni has shone extensively glittering with immortal life for glory. When the prolific heaven created him, Agni became immortal in his strength."[^10-577]

"He lays down (the bricks) transversely." So says the Brāhmaṇa.[^6-621] Having recited the tayādevata formula he recites the sūdadohasa verse (with regard to each).  

He lays down twelve Saṁyat bricks with the formulas, "Do thou unite the Prāṇa with life; unite Apāna with Prāṇa; unite Vyāna with Apāna; unite the eye with Vyāna; unite the ear with the eye; unite the mind with the ear; unite the speech with mind; unite self with speech; unite the earth with self; unite the midregion with the earth; unite the heaven with mid-region; unite the celestial world with the heaven."[^7-621] Three each towards the quarters; none in the middle.  


[^6-621] TsV.2.10.4 Bhavasvārin says akṣṇayo’pa dadhāti iti vacanād atra kramāmnālam upadhānam upadhānakramaś ca. This Brāhmaṇa sentence speaks about the bricks to be laid down in the four quarters. They are to be laid down diagonally i,e. from south-west towards north-east. cf. Sāyaṇa on TS V.2.10 4. Y. Ikari and H.F. Arnold in their translation of BaudhŚS X have wrongly related the Brāhmaṇa injunction to the laying of the bricks only on the top of the naturaly perforated stone (cf. AgriVol II.p.547, Berkeley 1983). The punctuation in Caland's text pertaining to the laying of the Prāṇabhṛt bricks needs to be corrected, ApŚS XVI.32.1, properly punctuated, prescribes the laying down of the bricks towards the quaters diagonally. The sutra should read thus: ayam puro bhuva iti pañcāśatam prāṇabhṛtaḥ / daśadaśa pratidiśam akṣṇayā / daša madhye / antarām upadhāya bākyambahyam. Caland has in his translation of ApŚS (Vol III.p.59, Amsterdam 1926) changed the punctuation a little, but has wrongly taken the word akṣṇayā to be related only to daśa madhye.

[^6-689]: These four verses, not traced to the Taittiriya tradition nor to any other tradition, have first occurred in BaudhŚS IV.3 in connection with Āhavanīya fire carried forth in the Animal - sacrifice. These Adhvara-oblations have again been prescribed in a similar rite in the Varuṇapraghāsaparvan of the Cāturmāsyas. The deities of the offerings are Agni, Vayu, Sūrya and Yajña. These offerings are termed as Atimukti in the Animal-sacrifice prescribed in the BharŠS VII.5.6 where the deities are Agni, Väyu, Āditya and Yajña. The offerings are known as Atimukti also in ApŚS VII.7.2 where the deities are Agni, Vāyu, Āditya and Viṣṇu. The Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā has not recorded these verses, nor does the MānŚS prescribe these offerings. The VārŚSI.6.2.7 representing the junior Maitrāyaṇīya tradition has however prescribed the Atimukti offerings to the deities Agni, Vāyu, Sūrya and Yajña thus agreeing with BaudhŚS IV.3, not with the ĀpŚS.

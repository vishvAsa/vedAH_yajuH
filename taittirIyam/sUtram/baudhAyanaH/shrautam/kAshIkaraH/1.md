The Baudhayana Śrautasûtra together with an English translation is being presented here in four volumes. There will be other volumes also presenting Bhavasvamin's bhāṣya and the word-index of the sutra-text. The Baudhayana Śrautasutra belongs to the Krsna Yajurveda Taittiriya recension. It represents the oral lectures delivered by the teacher Baudhāyana, hence is the oldest śrauta-text. The text is revised here in the light of the variant readings recorded by W. Caland in his first edition (Calcutta 1906), and is presented in a readable form. The mantras forming part of the sutras have been fully rendered into English. The translation is supplied with notes giving reference to the mantras and explanations of the ritual. The work is expected to serve as an advancement of Taittiriya ritualistic studies.

PREFACE 
I am extermely happy to present to the world of scholars the text of the Baudhāyana Śrautasutra together with an English translation and notes. The first critical edition of this Śrautasūtra was prepared by W. Caland and was published in three volumes by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta (1904-13). Its second edition-a reprint-was published at New Delhi in 1982. My translation is of course based on Caland's edition. A faithful translation of any ancient text, particularly a Vedic text, involves a thorough understanding of the text. Consequently I have paid close attention to the rich treasure of variant readings recorded by Caland in his Foot- notes. As a result of my close study of the text in all aspects and the numerous variant readings, I have improved the text at numerous places. Sometimes I have had to resort to emendation of certain readings. In my notes to the translation I have noted all such places where I have chosen a reading different from that of Caland's printed text. The text printed herein is thus, the Baudhāyana Śrautasûtra text in a revised form. I have excluded the Śulbasūtra (Praśna XXX) and the Pravarapraśna for reasons mentioned in the Introduction. 
A new critical edition of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra needs to be undertaken. Caland had utilised a number of manuscripts of the text for his edition. He has, however, left numerous doubtful places, particularly in Praśnas X-XIX. The Mackenzie Collection manuscript No. xxviii (new number 92), a Descriptive Cata- logue of the Oriental MSS collected by Lt. Col. Mackenzieedited by H.H. Wilson Vol. I. p.6 rendered him valuable help in defining the text and also the order of the text. Numerous textual difficulties still exist, and these require to be solved. Many more manuscripts of the Baudhayana Śrautasutra which were not available to Caland have fortunately been discovered and stored in manuscript-libraries. These manuscripts are indeed a great treasure which needs to be exploited. One may perhaps find among them manuscripts representing the tradition of Mackenzie manuscripts or even a better preserved tradition. The study of Śrautasūtras is far advanced since Caland published his edition. Consequently a new critical edition undertaken by an expert brain will be welcome. Since the text presented herein is only a revision of Caland's text, I have not found it necessary to reproduce the variant readings recorded by Caland in his Footnotes. 
The Vedic texts by their very nature were not fully comprehensible by themselves to a student of literature and religion. Hence, the various means like the Bhāṣyas, Tīkās, Paddhatis and Prayogas came to be produced from time to time. The old commentators among them were rather brief because in their view only a few hints were sufficient for the elucidation of the text in hand. The later 
vi 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
commentators, on the other hand, wrote in rather a liberal manner because they thought the reader of their time was in need of detailed explanations. In modern times when modern dialects have become the vehicle of all communication and when visions of understanding have considerably widened, it became imperative to explain all old texts, particularly the Vedic, through translation and notes in modern languages. 
Many of the Kalpasūtras have been translated into English, German, Dutch, French and other languages. The Baudhāyana Śrautasutra holds a prominent position among the Kalpasūtras for various reasons. It is extensive and dilates upon the sacrificial religion in a comprehensive manner. Full understanding of this text is essential for the scientific knowledge of the Vedic religion and culture. No complete translation of this significant text has been attempted so far in any language. Some portions of it have been rendered into English in detached manner in the various parts of the Śrautakosa published by the Vaidika Samshodhana 
Mandala at Pune. Herein the mantras have not been translated. Yasuke Ikari has translated in English the tenth chapter of this text laying down the piling up of the Fire-altar (Agnicayana) in the Volume of Agni (Berkley, 1983) again without the translation of the mantras. 
A complete English translation of the Baudhāyana Śrautasutra was therefore a desideratum, and it is my privilege to fill in the gap. In my translation I have mostly translated the mantra side by side with the injunctive part of a sutra. The Taittirīya- texts comprise both the mantra-portions and the Brāhmaṇa-portions. There is definite correlation between the mantra and the Brahmana. One cannot be fully understood without the other. This is true of the prose formulas and also of the verses. Such verses as are common to the Rgveda may bear loose relation to the ritual. I have not translated the Puronuvākyā and Yājyā verses which may hardly be said to have close relation to the ritual. While translating a mantra I have kept in view the relation of the mantra to the corresponding Brāhmaṇa. In this behalf I have consulted the commentaries by Bhatta Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa on the Taittiriya texts, who I believe, even though remote in time from the Taittiriya texts, were mostly conversant with that relation through their intimate knowledge of the continued ritual tradition. Even then I have not ignored the principles of Philology in translating the mantras. 
In translating the Sūtra-text I have consulted Bhavasvamin's Bhāṣya and also the commentary Subodhini as far as it is available. Even then certain points have remained obscure to me. Footnotes are added to the translation. References to the original sources of the mantra and Brahmana passages are given in the Footnotes. 
The Dvaidhasutra always goes in concurrence with the main text. Caland has, in his edition of the text, tried to give the references to the main text while presenting the Dvaidhasūtra. In some cases references have not been given by him.PREFACE 
vii 
I have tried my best to give at such places the references to the main text. The same thing applies to the Karmantasūtra also. I have tried to make the translation as literal as possible. Words essential for clear understanding have been put in parenthesis. 
Bhavasvamin's vivarana on a major portion of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra is available in manuscripts. Caland had intended to edit this vivarana which is a veritable source for good understanding of Baudhāyana's text. He however abandoned his design since the manuscript-material available to him was utterly insufficient. He has stated, "Perhaps I may in later times fulfil also this promise. (Preface to Vol. II p. xi). He however could not do so. T.N. Dharmadhikari has prepared a critical edition of the vivarana after a careful study of the available defective manuscripts. He has tried his best to present a readable text of the vivarana and has recorded the variants in Foot-notes. The vivarana is appended. A Glossary is also appended. The index of words prepared by my student Smt. Leena Sabnis will be found useful for a scientific study of the text. 
I am grateful to the authorities of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi, for assigning the project to me. I have tried to complete it to the best of my ability. The Centre granted me all facilities for the carrying out of the project. I am glad to acknowledge the help which I have received in completing the project. Caland's scholarly monograph Uber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana was a constant help to me. Many decades have passed since Caland published his monumental work. Knowledge of the ritualistic religion has considerably advanced during this time, and it has become possible to add to our knowledge of Baudhāyana's text. I have also consulted Caland's voluminous work on other Vedic texts and the scholarly work of Indian and western scholars including J.Gonda's History of Indian Literature. I thank Kumari Saroj Deshpande for neatly preparing the typescript of 
the translation. 
When in 1903 he published his important monograph Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhayana, W. Caland concluded by saying, "Möchte es mir gelingen sein, ein Interesse für diesen Text zu wecken" (p. 65). By simultaneously publishing his important edition of the Baudhāyana Srautasūtra, he may be said to have laid the foundation not only of the all-round study of this oldest Srautasūtra but also of the Śrauta texts in general. Since then significant research work has been done in the field of the ritual Sūtras. I hope this edition of the revised text together with translation and Bhavasvamin's vivarana will give a new impetus to the study of the Vedic ritualistic religion.

INTRODUCTION 
1. The Baudhayana Corpus 
The Baudhayana Śrautasūtra forms the initial and prominent part of the Baudhayana corpus.' This corpus comprises the Śrauta, Prayaścitta, Śulba, Grhya, Pitṛmedha, Pravara and Dharma Sutras. Tradition ascribes all these Sūtras to Baudhayana. While preparing his critical edition of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra (BaudhŚS), W. Caland examined all available manuscripts of the above-mentioned types of the Sūtra-texts ascribed to Baudhāyana, and formulated the order of the Baudhayana corpus.2 In the printed edition of the Śrautasūtra the Śulbasūtra forms the Praśna XXX. The Pravarasutra printed at the end is without the consecutive Praśna number. 
14 
Subsequent to the Śrautasūtra there is the Gṛhyasutra3 comprising four Praśnas including the Prayaścitta. "This Sūtra the greater part of which is no doubt comparatively old, is composed in the Baudhāyana style; discussions, motivations and even implicit polemics are not absent. The Gṛhyasütra proper is followed by the so-called Grhya-Paribhāṣāsūtra which consists of two Praśnas. Being generally speaking a collection of additions and enlarge- ments, it seems to owe its curious title to the desire of the compiler, not only to add some more definitions and general rules of interpretation but also, following the example of the Karmantasūtra of the Śrauta manual, to collect these in separate chapters annexed to the discussions of the Grhya rites. 
This collection may in the course of time have become the nucleus of the present two Praśnas. That this text has been recast and greatly enlarged is beyond all doubt. There is yet another Grhya part, namely, the Grhyaparisiṣṭa-or Grhyaseṣasūtra which comprises four Prašnas consisting of older and later material. Rites which occur also in other works of this class and create the impression of being Vedic-for instance the Yamayajña in 1.21 and the Vṛṣotsarga in 3.16-existed in all probability long before the compilation of these paralipomena. This collection has, on the other hand, received considerable additions many of which are much later than the composition of the proper Grhyasutra. The latest additions do not belong to the Vedic, but to the post-Vedic Hindu (so-called Purāņic) rituals, and 
xii 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
concern the cult of typically Hinduist deities viz. Śiva, Durgā, and Skanda. Parallels, if any, occur only in other doubtless late specimens of this literature and further in works of the Puranic and Agamic genres.5 
8 
The Baudhayana Pitṛmedhasūtra comprises three Praśnas; the Baudhāyana Pravarasutra consists of only one Praśna.7 The last portion of the Baudhāyana corpus, namely, the DharmasutraR comprises four Praśnas; Prašna IV is an interpolation. This Dharmasūtra is later than the Gautama Dharmasutra which is referred to in the Baudhayana Dharmasūtra. 
2. Baudhāyana-the Pravacanakāra 
Mahadeva, at the beginning of his commentary on the Satyāṣādha Kalpasūtra, pays homage to the Sūtrakāras of the Taittiriya recension where Baudhayana is mentioned first. This denotes that among the followers of the Taittiriya recension Baudhāyana was taken to be the seniormost teacher. In the Utsarjana-rite to be performed by a boy who has udergone the Upanayana rite the gods, Rṣis, Acāryas and the Pitrs are beseeched to be present and receive honour. Here the list of the Acāryas of the Taittirīya recension begins with Baudhāyana who is called as a pravacanakāra.o Apastamba is called as a sūtrakāra. In other Taittiriya Sūtra-texts also the list begins with Baudhayana. Thus the entire Taittiriya tradition respects Baudhayana as the seniormost ācārya. It calls Baudhāyana's text as a pravacana and each of the other texts as a Sutra. There is a difference in a pravacana and a Sūtra. A pravacana is a discourse which is orally delivered. A Sutra is not so; it is a collection of sūtras which are composed. Naturally a pravacana is extensive; sutrais brief. Brevity is a comparative term. While in the texts like Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī the author would try his utmost to attain brevity in his expression even by saving half a mātrā, it cannot be so in the other types of Sūtra-texts like the Kalpasūtras. 
The Kalpasūtras came to be composed with a specific purpose. It was difficult to perform any ritual simply by studying the mantra and the Brahmana concerned. A guide laying down the ritual following a particular Veda in a regular order was a necessity. Such manuals had to be studied closely side by side with the actual Veda. In order that the strain on the memory of the person concerned should be minimum, the manual had to be as short as possible. Consequently the manuals came to be composed in sutra-form. At the same time the concise sutra-form left certain ambiguities; so that Bhāṣyas and Paddhatis were composed in order to fill in the vacuum. The case of a pravacana was different; a detailed running exposition 
INTRODUCTION 
xili 
afforded much facility to the priest in performing his part of the ritual. Even then by its very nature the ritual is such a thing that a full understanding of the on-going rite was next to impossible. One therefore finds that even a pravacana was provided with a Bhāṣya and a Prayoga. 
... 
That the BaudhSS is a pravacana is shown also by the use of demonstra- tive pronouns with deictic force, i.e. imām diśaṁ nīrasyati 1.6; athe'mām abhimṛśati 1.19; imām disaṁ nītvāII.8; imām diśam nirasya IV.6; ¿yaty agre haraty athe'yaty athe'yati II.17; ittham aśvaṁ visāsate'tthā3m XV.30. Baudhāyana has in his lectures prescribed the mantras generally in extenso. There are of course exceptions. Looseness in uniformity may also point out the character of oral discourses. In Praśna X (Cayana) and also in Praśna XI (Vājapeya) the rule of sakalapatha has exceptions. In connection with the duties at the Full- moon and the New-moon sacrifices the BaudhSS prescribes sipping of water with the verse payasvatir oṣadhayaḥ... at two places (III.15,22) which indicates looseness. The formula taya devatayā ... and the verse tā asya südadohasaḥ are very frequently prescribed in the Praśna (X) for Cayana. Once they are given (X.21) there is no need to repeat them in subsequent occurrences. Therefore Baudhāyana very often simply says tayādevataṁ kṛtvā sūdadohasaṁ karoti. But in X.36 where he has referred simply to tayadevata and sūdadohasa a few times, at one place he has repeated the formula and the verse which is probably due to oral transmission. The general practice of Baudhāyana is that once he has prescribed a mantra in extenso, he mentions it by pratika at a subsequent occurrence or occurrences. There are certain exceptions to this rule. The verse mano jyotir... is given in extenso in BaudhSS III.18 and again in III.29. The formula vedo'si vittir asiis given in III.30 in extensoand also immediately afterwards with a small change. All this points to the fact that Baudhayana orally transmitted the discourses to his disciples. Probably he was the first ācārya who set the ritual of the Taittirīya recension in order for the facility in performance, and orally explained it to his pupils. 10 
3. Authorship of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra 
Tradition assigns the authorship of the entire Baudhayana Kalpasütra to Baudhāyana. Before tackling the wider problem, it will be proper to confine the discussion to the authorship of the BaudhŚS alone. Leaving out the Sulba, Gṛhya, Pitṛmedha, Pravara and Dharma Sutras, the Śrautasūtra itself covers Praśnas I-XXIX. Its broad divisions are: the main Sutra I-XIX, Dvaidha XX-XXIII, Karmanta XXIV-XXVI, and Prayaścitta XXVII-XXIX. 
xiv 
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA 
Can we attribute the authroship of these four broad divisions of this Sūtra-- text to a single ācārya Baudhāyana? Prima facieit may be taken that Baudhāyana himself composed all the four divisions. The claim will have, however, to be substantiated by strong evidence. The character of a pravacana would be one of the points to be considered. Keeping aside for the time being the main Sūtra, the Dvaidha may be examined first. The Dvaidhasūtra presupposes the main text. It records the different views of the acaryas of the Baudhayana school on the various rites, and while doing so, it always refers to the main text. The names of the following ācāryas are mentioned therein: Añjīgavi, Atreya, Adya or Ajya, Artabhāgiputra, Aupamanyava, Aupamanyavīputra, Kātya, Jyāyān Kâtyāyana, Kauṇapatantri, Gautama, Dīrghavātsya, Baudhāyana, Mangala, Maitreya, Maudgalya, Dakṣiṇākāra Rāthītara, Rāthītara and Śālīki. It is to be noted that this list of the acaryas includes the name of Baudhayana himself. The Dvaidhasūtra therefore cannot be said to have been composed by Baudhāyana himself. At the same time it has to be conceded that the different views on the various rites prevailed at the time of the composition of the main text itself. It may, therefore, be said that the Dvaidhasūtra was composed by some pupil of Baudhāyana or pupil's pupil at a time not very distant from the date of the composition of the main text. 
Generally there is correspondence between the main text and the Dvaidhasutra. There is however no Dvaidhasūtra for the Pravargya (Praśna IX), the Aśvamedha (Praśna XV), Samāvartana (XVII.39-44), Naiṣṭyayana (XVII.45-46), Vrātyastoma (XVIII.24-26), Bhāllavistoma (XVIII.27-30) and the Ekāhas (XVIII.37-52). In the Dvaidhasutra each topic is introduced by saying vyākhyāsyāmaḥ e.g. athāto'gnikalpaṁ vyākhyāsyāmaḥ (XXII.1). This shows that the Dvaidhasutra was equally understood as an authority for the prescription of the ritual. A comparison of the views recorded in the Dvaidha with the original injunctions recorded in the main text shows that corre- sponding injunctions are sometimes wanting in the main text.11 
Generally a unit of the Dvaidhasūtra first reproduces the pratika referring to a point for discussion from the main text, and then records the different views on that point held by the Acaryas of the Baudhayana school. The different views may be two in minimum and any number-five or six-in maximum. In most cases the injunction recorded in the main text is the view of some Acarya, in many cases, of Baudhayana. In such cases the unit begins with the remark that the sutra, that is, the view reproduced therein is the view of such and such teacher, and then records the views held in that

XV 
behalf by Acāryas. Sometimes the injunction recorded in the main text is an optional one. In such a case the Dvaidhasūtra mentions the names of the Acāryas advocating those respective views. Obviously the occasion for the variety of views arises out of the absence of a direct injunction in the Brāhmaṇa concerned. There is no source to understand the practice in respect of the omitted item which Brāhmaṇakāra himself intended. It was natural that in course of time different practices were introduced in the various geographical areas. These became known to the ritual-world when the priestly class had occasions to come together and undertake ritualistic performances in coordination. Among the various Acāryas two names occur prominently-Baudhāyana and Śālīki. It is observed that Baudhāyana gen- erally represents the conservative view while Śālīki lays stress on simplicity and convenience.12 It is interesting to note that whatever divergent view on some topic might have been expressed by any of the other Śrautasūtras, it is almost found advocated by some Acārya belonging to the Baudhayana school. It seems that during the period of the ritualistic activities of the Baudhayana school which immediately succeeded the Brāhmaṇa period, the ritual-tradition was strong and that the lively interest in practices gave rise to different views in regard to the topics not prescribed or discussed in the Brāhmaṇas. 
The Karmantasūtra which covers Praśnas XXIV-XXVI provides the explications of sacrificial rituals. It supplements or clarifies the rituals laid down in the main text. At the opening it makes certain general observations. It also lays down the objectives of certain rituals and rites. While the main text employs the present tense in all its prescriptions, the Karmantasūtra em- ploys the present tense and the potential mood in a mixed manner. Like the main text it also speaks in details so much so that sometimes the detailed description becomes monotonous. In this respect the Khanḍikās 14 and 15 of Praśna XXV are worthy of note. The topic is the rites to be performed by the Adhvaryu at early dawn on the pressing day of the Agnistoma. Khaṇḍikā 14 lays down Baudhāyana's view while the Khandika 15 lays down Śālīki's view. Both the Khandikās are identical. The difference is that while accord- ing to Baudhayana the ladles filled with clarified butter are to be carried directly to the Uttaravedi, according to Śālīki they are first to be carried towards the Agnidhrīya chamber and then towards the Uttaravedi. 
Sometimes the Karmantasütra provides an optional injunction. While BaudhŚS II.18 prescribes the offering of the Pūrṇahuti with the verse sapta 
xvi 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
te agne... the Karmanta XXIV.17 mentions a prose formula, agnaye pṛthivyai vāyave 'ntarikṣāya sūryāya dive varuṇāyā'dbhyaḥ svāhā. The commentary subodhini on II.18 treats this formula as an option. While II.18 prescribes milk as the oblation for the Agnihotra, Karmānta XXIV.17 mentions the clarified butter. While II.18 prescribes the wiping of the Agnihotra-ladle first in the upward and then in the downward direction, Karmanta XXIV.17 prescribes the reverse order. Sometimes one comes across in the Karmanta a mere repetition of a rite prescribed in the main text, e.g. the formulas to be recited for the drawing out and the depositing of the Ahavaniya fire are prescribed in the main text (III.4); they are repeated in the Karmanta (XXIV.30). Karmanta XXIV.30 is an exact copy of III.4 prescribing the Agnihotra-rite. The Karmanta has taken cognisance of one who has not set up the sacred fires; XXIV. 32 speaks about the Pinḍapitṛyajña and XXIV.33 about the Agrayana to be performed by one who has not set up the fires. 
The Rājasuya is prescribed in BaudhŚS XII. The Karmanta XXVI.3 lays down also a variety of the Rajasuya called Añjaḥsava according to Baudhāyana and another variety of the same according to Śālīki. It also lays down a different kind of the Rājasūya, namely, the Patantaka. The Vādhūla Śrautasūtra (X) has not mentioned any variety of the Rājasūya. As regards the setting up of the fires, BaudhŚS II.12 mentions a piece of wood of a tree struck by lightning among the substances to be put into the fire-places before the setting of fires. As substitute for such a tree, the Karmānta (XXIV.14) has mentioned a tree dried up by cold or by wind. Neither the Vādhūla nor any other Śrautasūtra has mentioned these substitutes. 
The characteristics mentioned above point to the conclusion that the Karmāntasūtra was composed not by Baudhāyana but by somebody belong- ing to the Baudhāyana school at a late date. The traditional position of the Karmanta subsequent to the Dvaidha supports the conclusion. 
Praśnas XXVII-XXIX are called the Prayaścittasutra. They deal with the expiation-rites in respect of ritual-deficiencies in the Agnihotra, Darśa- Pūrṇamāsa, Cãturmāsyas, Nirūḍhapaśu, Agnistoma, Agnicayana, Ekāhas and Sattras. Besides the expiation-rites the section includes the incidental rites, the so-called Anugrahas and certain other topics befitting the charac- ter of the Karmanta. Most of the Śrautasūtras have allotted only one chapter for the expiation-rites. 
It needs to be observed that we find in the main text expiation-rites laid down side by side with the Adhvaryava at different places. No expiation-riteINTRODUCTION 
xvii 
is mentioned for the Agnyadheya. We find expiation-rites prescribed in regard to the deficiencies in the Agnihotra-rite at the following places: nine in Praśna XIV (Aupānuvākya), four in Praśna XIII (Işțikalpa), one in the Dvaidha (XX.19) and two in the Karmanta (XXIV 23;31). For the Darsa- Pūrṇamāsa: three in Praśna III. 15-22 (Yājamāna), four in Praśna XIII (Iṣṭikalpa), one in Praśna XVII.50 (Kāmya Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa). For the Nirūḍhapaśu: one in Prašna XIV (Aupānuvākya). For Agniṣṭoma: sixteen in Praśna XIV (Aupānuvākya). In regard to the Pravargya, all expiation-rites have been laid down in Praśna IX (Pravargya) together with the main rite. These facts show that Baudhayana intended to lay down the expiation-rites side by side with the Adhvaryava; he did not intend to collect the expiation- rites separately in any Prašna. Some follower of the Baudhayana school felt it necessary to devote special space to the expiation-rites in the Sūtra-text following the practice of the other Śrautasūtras. While doing so, he took care not to touch the expiation-rites already dealt with in the Sutra-text following the Taittiriya texts. He recorded such expiation-rites as had become estab- lished in his time. For example, BaudhŚS XXIX. 3 has prescribed an incidental rite in case the moon does not become visible at night. the Sūtrakāra has prescribed the offering of two spoonfuls with the verses navonavo bhavati jāyamānaḥ... and yam ādityā aṁśumāрyāyayanti... (TS.II.4.14). · Here is a secondary employment of these two verses which are originally prescribed as the puronuvākyā and the yājyā to be recited by the Hot in an Işti to be performed by one who is suffering from a chronic disease (TSII.3.5). 
It is difficult to believe that all the three Prašnas were composed by one and the same person. We do not know whether the incidental rites, the Anugrahas and the Karmantalike portion were added by the Acārya who composed the additional Prāyaścitta-portion. There are clear indications which show that there was still another hand at work who newly added, particularly in the form of Kārikā, more expiation-rites in regard to the Agnihotra, Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa and other routine rites. It may thus be taken for certain that the Prayaścittasūtra (Praśnas XXVII-XXIX) was composed not by Baudhayana but by one or more Acaryas of the school some time later. We also do not know about the time when the present order of the three Prašnas of the Prayaścittasūtra was fixed.13 
Now the main text, Praśnas I-XIX, may be examined from two view- points. Firstly, whether it contains any portion whose authorship normally 
xviii 
BAUDHAYANAŠRAUTASŪTRA 
attributed to Baudhayana may be doubtful, and secondly whether the order of the text fixed by the tradition and adopted in the printed edition was fixed by Baudhayana himself. There is evidence to show that in the main text certain portions were misplaced at a very early period. 
14. 
In this connection Praśna II laying down the ritual of the setting of fires may be cited as an important case. A close study of the ritual and the text- portion describing it shows that the original order of the various Khandikās and other portions must have been different from what it is at present. Praśna II laying down the Agnyādheya comprises twentyone Khaṇḍikās. Dvaidha (XX.16-18) and Karmanta (XXIV.12-17) also deal with this rite. In the main text BaudhŚS II.12 must have been the first Khanḍikā; Khaṇḍikā 1 speaking about the pronouncement the second; Khandikās 3-4 dilating upon the choosing of the priests the third and the fourth; the Khaṇḍikā 2 prescribing the begging of the sacrificial place the fifth; Khandikās 13-14 speaking about the offering of the Brahmaudana the sixth and the seventh; Khanḍikās 8-11 laying down the Gopitṛyajña eighth to eleventh; and Khaṇḍikās 15-21 prescribing the rites beginning with the heating of the kindling woods and ending with the ancillary Istis twelfth to the nineteenth. Out of the remaining three Khaṇḍikās (5-7) Khaṇḍikā 5 records the formulas beginning with simhe me manyuḥ etc. called pāpmano vinidhayaḥ which do not belong to the Taittirīya recension. Hence they were repro- duced by somebody for ready use.15 Khaṇḍikās 6-7 are of the nature of the Karmāntasūtra. They, however, do not fit in with the present Karmāntasūtra. 
The basic Soma-sacrifice, namely, the Agnistoma is prescribed in Praśnas VI-VIII, and the Pravargya rite is prescribed in Praśna IX. Even though the position of the Pravargya as Prašna IX was already fixed in the period of Bhavasvāmin (eighth century A.D.) who in his Bhāṣya explains the Pravargya subsequent to the Agnistoma, it cannot be the original order. The Pravargya Praśna covers the preparation of the Mahāvīras and other imple- ments, the preparation and the offering of the Gharma, the disposal of the Pravargya-implements, the expiation-rites, and the Avantaradikṣā to be observed in connection with the learning of the Pravargya-mantras forming part of the Taittiriya Aranyaka - all in a single Praśna. Because the Pravargya rite involves the mantras contained in the Taittiriya Āraṇyaka, Baudhāyana must have assigned to it a position at the end of the entire pravacana. It is very important to observe that the Dvaidha and the Karmanta Sūtras have not taken note of the Pravargya; from the Agnistoma they have proceeded 
16 
INTRODUCTION 
xix 
to Agnicayana. Even though the order of the Pravargya was changed for convenience, the ritual was undoubtedly laid down by Baudhāyana. 
Some portion of the Sutra-text was lost in tradition. There are two types of the Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice in the Taittiriya-tradition-Caraka and Kaukili. While the Sautrāmaṇī in the Caraka tradition is preserved,17 that in the Kaukili tradition is lost. That it originally existed is clear from Bhavasvāmin's statement in his Bhāṣya that the Baudhāyanasūtra for the Kaukilī Sautrāmaṇī is lost. There is an internal evidence which supports this fact. There is a sutra in the Karmanta (XXIV 11) dvau sautrāmaṇyām, meaning that there are two (offerings to Aditi) in the Sautrāmaṇī. In the Caraka Sautrāmaṇī prescribed in the BaudhŚS there is no offering to Aditi. In the Kaukili Sautrāmaṇī two pots of cooked rice are to be offered to Aditi.18 Thus the reference to Sautrāmaṇī in the Karmantasūtra points to the Kaukilī Sautrāmaṇī which Baudhāyana must have prescribed, and which was lost. 
In the Taittiriya tradition the duties to be performed by the Hotr priest in the pre-Soma rites have been prescribed. In BaudhŚS III.27-31 one comes across the duties to be performed by the Hotṛ in the Full-moon and the New- moon sacrifices and also a few hints for those in the Animal-sacrifice. In Sāyaṇa's commentary on BaudhŚS Praśna 119 there are citations from Baudhayana's Hautraśesa Praśna which probably lays down the hautra for the Nirūḍhapaśu and the Caturmasyas following the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa. This Hautraseşṣa Praśna may have been the composition of some scholar of the Baudhāyana school. 
The Kāṭhaka Citis have been prescribed in BaudhŚS XIX. Neither the Dvaidhasūtra nor the Karmāntasūtra has taken account of the Kathaka Prašna. In this Praśna mantras have been cited in extenso even in the case of repetition. While BaudhŚS X. 48 has used the word carameṣṭaka, BaudhŚS XIX. 10 employs the word antyestakā. Bhavasvāmin has not written commen- tary on this Praśna. Probably Praśna XIX was added by some follower of the Baudhāyana school. 
4. The Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra and the Taittiriya- texts 
There is ample evidence to show that the redaction of the Taittiriīya recension was complete and fixed when Baudhayana delivered his dis- courses on the sacrificial religion. In his sūtras Baudhayana first gives the full mantra and then lays down the injunctive part. Not only does he cite the mantras in the order as they are found in the Taittiriya Samhită, most parts 
XX 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
of the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa and also the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, but also cites relevant Brāhmaṇa passages introducing them with atha vai bhavati.20 Even though Baudhāyana generally cites mantras from the Taittiriya texts in extenso, he cites by pratika the Puronuvākyā - Yājyā verses collected in the concluding Anuvākas of many Prapathakas of many of the Kāṇḍas of the Samhita and also some other verses. He also cites the mantras to be recited by the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer by saying anucchandasam or by referring to the specific Anuvāka; e.g. while prescribing the Vişņu-strides to be taken by the sacrificer at the Full-moon or the New-moon sacrifice, he records the first formula and further says iti caturbhir anucchandasam. In the Agnicayana while prescribing the pouring down of she-goat's milk in a continuous stream over the leaf of Calotropis gigantea placed on the north-western uppermost brick, he says (X.48) tat pratipadyate namas te rudra manyava ity āʼntam etam anuvākam nigadya dvitīyam trtīyam." He continues to refer to the Taittiriya text in similar terms. Further while speaking about the offering of the vasordhārā, he instructs tat pratipadyate'gnāviṣṇā sajoṣase'ti sarvām āʼntam vasordhārām (X.54). 
22 
21 
There is another piece of evidence which is equally strong. In the Taittirīya Samhita comprising seven kāndas the third Kāṇḍa is traditionally known as the upānuvākya.23 Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa have taken note of the designation aupānvākyain their commentaries on Kanda III. Upānuvākya means the supplementary scripture. It supplements the mantra and brāhmaṇa recorded in the original sections. Bhatta Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa have eluci- dated the mantra - and brāhmaṇa-portions of this Kāṇḍa with reference to the relevant topics contained in the original sections. Baudhāyana has devoted an entire independent Praśna, namely, the fourteenth, to the explanations of the mantra-brāhmaṇa contained in Kāṇḍa III. This indi- cates that the Taittiriya texts in the Sarasvatapatha stood in the established tradition in Baudhāyana' time. Among the Sūtrakāras belonging to the Taittiriya recension, Baudhayana alone has remained true to the tradition of recognising the independent position of the aupānuvākya. The other Sūtrakāras have deemed all the Taittiriya texts as one entity, and have laid down the rituals by exploiting the entire material as a whole. Even the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra has followed the same procedure. The aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa (III) comprises five Prapathakas, and the BaudhŚS XIV serially deals with their contents in Khaṇḍikās 1-22 of that Prašna. In the remaining eight Khaṇḍikās (23-30) it lays down injunctions following TBr 1.4.1-5.3. 
INTRODUCTION 
xxi 
Baudhayana thus expanded the extent of his aupānuvākya Praśna because, even though the TBr-portion is really anārabhyādhīta, it is related to the portions dealing with the Soma-rites prescibed in the TS Kāṇḍa III. The Baudhayana Dvaidhasutra presupposes the entire aupānuvākya Praśna XIV. 
As already observed, the tradition of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa was established before Baudhayana delivered his discourses. It is, however, to be noted that Baudhāyana has scarcely employed verses from the Acchidrakāṇḍa (TBr III.7) and the Upahomas (TBr II.4,5). The other Sūtrakaras of the Taittiriya recension from Bharadvāja downwards have, on the other hand, fully employed verses from these portions.24 
5. The Baudhayana Śrautasūtra and other Vedic Recensions 
By their very nature, ritual-practices in the Vedic and the post-Vedic periods were in a rather dynamic condition. The ritualistic religion was a collective activity which was bound to be influenced by the ritual-traditions being maintained within the surrounding areas. There is therefore no wonder that even in the BaudhŚS we come across certain borrowings from the Vedic recensions. 
In the Agnistoma sacrifice fire from the Ahavanīya in the Prāgvarśa shed and Soma are carried over to the Mahāvedi on the Upavasatha day (BaudhŚS VI 30). The Adhvaryu carries forward the fire with the verse ud agne tiṣṭhā 'nu mām etc. which is not traced to the Taittiriya texts. This verse is found in the Vādhūlasūtra (VādhŚS VI.19.21) with a little variation and a small modification in the employment. According to BaudhŚS VII.8 the Adhvaryu hands over two darbha-blades to the Udgātṛ or to the Prastoty with the formula ṛksāmayor upastaraṇam asi mithunatvāya prajātyai or silently. This formula which is not traced to the Taittiriya texts is employed in VadhŚS VII.7.13. This shows Baudhāyana's close association with the Vādhūla tradition. The Agnyādheya prescribed by Baudhāyana includes, among others, two rites, namely, the reciting of the formulas called papmano vinidhyaḥ and the Gopitṛyajña which are absent in the other Taittiriya Sūtra- texts. The VadhŚS has recorded in the Prapathaka XV (Parisesa) the formulas papmano vinidhayaḥ with certain variations; the Sūtra has also referred (1.1.8) to the cooking of a cow as a part of the Agnyadheya. 
We find some Kathaka element in Baudhayana's prescriptions. BaudhŚS X. 24 prescribes the laying of a stump of darbha-grass on the site chosen for the Citi either with the formula vāk tvā samudra upadadhātu etc. or silently. 
xxii 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
pre- 
This formula which is reproduced as a pratika is borrowed from KS XXXVIII 13. ĀpsS XIX.11.11 has prescribed this formula with a little modification in the Săvitra Kāṭhaka Cayana. In BaudhŚS X.44 the Vibhakti brick is scribed to be piled up with the verse agne stomam manāmahe cited by pratika. The verse is not traced to the Taittiriya texts even though the Brāhmaṇa from the TS (V.5.6.1) says agne stomam manāmaha ity āha. The verse is found in KS XX.14; MS IV.10.2; RVV.13.2 Most probably it was borrowed from the KS. In the Agnyādheya Praśna Baudhāyana (II.12) has prescribed the setting of the Ahavaniya at a distance of twelve steps (vikrāma) following TBI.1.2. The Karmantasūtra (XXIV.1) however thought it advisable to mention the different numbers of steps (prakrama) for a brāhmaṇa, a Rājanya and a Vaiśya following in essence KS VIII.13. 
Baudhāyana (VII.9) has prescribed the formula agnir ha daivīnām viśām etc. in connection with the choosing of the sacrificer at the Savaniya animal- sacrifice in Agnistoma. It is not found in the Taittiriya texts; it is traced in part to MS III.9.8. It is found also in ŚBr III.7.4.10 where the choosing takes place at the Agniṣomiya animal-sacrifice. It is difficult to locate the exact source of the Baudhāyana citation. 
W. Caland has, in the introduction to his edition of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa in the Kāṇviya recension 25 discussed the relationship of the Kāṇvīya Satapatha Brāhmaṇa with the Śrautasūtras of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, particularly with the BaudhSS. He has drawn attention to the similarities in linguistic features and also certain ritual features. If a few features are found to be similar in these two texts in the ocean of linguistic and ritualistic details, they cannot lead one to any drastic conclusion. But Caland has found a few instances where a reference made in the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas to the Carakādhvaryus is not traced to any of the available Brāhmaṇas of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, but is traced to the BaudhŚS. From this fact he hastens to conclude as follows: "The ritual of Baudhayana must have been known to the authors of the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas, that his Sūtra is prior to it.... How then are we to account for the agreement of Baudhāyana with the white Yajurveda ? It is not without hesitation that I venture to offer a conjecture on this point. From the researches of Bühler regarding the texts of Baudhāyana we know that the name of this author probably was Kāṇva Baudhayana. Now could not Baudhāyana originally have been a Kanva i.e. a follower of the Kanva school of the White Yajurveda and subsequently gone over to the Black Yajurveda refining many reminiscences of his former Śakha? This renunciation of 
INTRODUCTION 
xxiii 
school might then have taken place before the final redaction of the two Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas the authors of which may have known his ritual but could not but regard him as a renegade. In this way alone, it seems to me, can we account for the hostility which the texts of the white Yajurveda show towards a Kāņva to whom it is prohibited to offer any sacrificial fee if they are among the Prasarpakas. Now it is very remarkable that while Apastamba, Bharadvaja and Hiranyakeśin exclude the Kāņvas from the receipt of Dakṣiņās, this prohibition is not made by Baudhāyana though it could be natural enough if my conjecture were right and Baudhāyana had once been a Kānva." (pp. 99-101) 
This strange conjecture of Caland needs serious consideration. Firstly, Caland has inferred that since the view of 'some' teachers expressed in the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas is not traced to any of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda recensions, but is found in the BaudhŚS, the latter must be taken to have been known by both the Vajasaneya Brāhmaṇas. These Brāhmaṇas often mention a different ritualistic view belonging to the Carakādhvaryus or 'some' teach- ers. At present we know only three or four recensions of the Carakādhvaryus i.e. Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda. Patanjali has mentioned in his Mahābhāṣya one hundred and one recensions of Yajurveda out of which eightysix belonged to the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda. It is not impossible that the Brahmaṇakāras were aware of such a recension, not known to us, representing the ritualistic view which might have been mentioned in that Brāhmaṇa and which is found also in the BaudhŚS. Moreover, it is certainly to be borne in mind that, barring the numerous so-called Sāmveda Brāhmaņas, no Brāhmaṇa text was composed subsequent to any Śrautasūtra. Traditionally the mantra-brāhmaṇa are apauruşeya, and Śrautasūtras are pauruşeya. These two types of literature must be chronologically distinguished. Therefore the BaudhaŚS cannot be taken to have been composed before the Vajasaneya Brāhmaṇas. 
Secondly, in the Baudhayana texts (GS III.9.6; DHS II.6) the author is mentioned as Kāṇva Baudhāyana, that is, Baudhāyana belonging to the Kanva gotra. This gotra is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Pravarasūtra (21 and 54; also ApPravaraS XXIV 8.2-3). This Kanva was of course different from the Vajasaneya Kanva. Caland's conjecture on the basis of the identical name Kanva that Baudhāyana first was a follower of Kāṇva recension and later adopted the Taittiriya recension is therefore absurd. Caland has taken the support of one more fact: Dakṣiņās are to be given away to the visitors (prasarpaka) at a Soma sacrifice. Bharadvāja, Āpastamba and Satyāṣāḍha 
xxiv 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
Hiranyakeŝin (also Vaikhānasa) have said that one should not give Dakṣiņās to those belonging to the Kanva and Kasyapa gotras. Caland has also noted a similar statement from KāthS XXVIII.4. Such a prohibition is however not found in the BaudhŚS. This was natural, Caland says, because Baudhāyana was primarily a Kānva. In this connection it may be noted that the absence of such prohibition is found in many other Śrautasūtras also, e.g. Vadhula, Mānava, Āśvalāyana, Šārikhāyana, Lāṭyāyana, Drāhyāyaṇa and Vaitāna. So there is nothing special about Baudhāyana. The non-Baudhayana Taittirīya Sūtras observed the prohibition probably under the influence of the Kāṭhakas. It is important to note that the KatyŚS (X.2.32) itself belonging to the Vājasaneyas prohibits the giving away of Dakṣiņās to those belonging to the Kanva and Kasyapa gotras. It is therefore evident that the prohibition of giving away Dakṣiņās to the followers of the Kanva gotra has nothing to do with the alleged relation between Kanva and Baudhayana. Caland's conjec- ture regarding the Kaṇva-Baudhāyana relationship is therefore groundless. The Samaveda claims great significance in the characterisation of a Soma-sacrifice. The individuality of a Soma-sacrifice mostly depends upon the specifications given in the Sāmaveda-brāhmaṇas. Even then the Sutra- texts of Yajurveda have something to prescribe in respect of the Adhvaryu's duties. Baudhāyana generally follows the Tandya Mahābrāhmaṇa in dealing with the Ekāhas and the Ahinas. Even then he has maintained his individu- ality in that behalf on the authority of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. The Vratyastoma prescribed in the TaṇḍBr. and in BaudhŚS XVIII.24-26 is not laid down in the TBr. Bhallavistoma prescribed in BaudhŚS XVIII.27 is not traced to the TāṇḍBr nor to the TBr. In the Dvaidhasutra (XXIII.13) is prescribed the Gobala Daśarātra sacrifice which is not found in the TandBr. 
The Dvaidha, the Karmanta and the Prāyaścitta Sūtras seem to have come under the influence of the Rgveda. BaudhŚS XXVIII.2 has prescribed the Pavitreşti which may be performed as an incidental or optional rite. The puronuvākyā and yājyā verses prescribed herein for the Ájyabhāga offering to Soma are from the Rgveda, namely, yo dhārayā pāvakayā (IX.101.2; ĀśvŚS II.12.3) and ā kalaśeṣu dhāvati (IX.17.4, AśvŚS II.12.4). In the Agnistoma sacrifice the Pātnīvata draught is taken from the Agrayana vessel (BaudhŚS VIII.14). The Karmantasūtra (XXV.23) wanted to explicate that rite. It says, "This (Pātnīvata draught) drawn from the Agrayaṇa vessel is taken for thirtythree divinities. Where are they involved in the offering? In the Pātnīvata draught. It is said in the scripture, 'Do thou (O Agni) carry over 
INTRODUCTION 
XXV 
and 
the thirtythree gods together with their wives for the sacrificial drink, be exhilerated.”” (RV IIL.6.9). This half verse is the latter part of the verse which is recited as the yajya for the Pātnīvata offering. cf. AśvŚS V.19. Here is an indication of the deep insight of the ritualists and of the rationale of the rite. Baudhāyana has employed a verse even from the Atharvaveda. He has prescribed the laying of Durva grass as a brick in Agnicayana (X.24). The verse is āyane te parāyaṇe etc. (AV VI.106.1) 
6. Linguistic peculiarities of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra 
W. Caland has in his critical study of the BaudhŚS recorded information on grammar (morphology and syntax), style and lexicography of the BaudhŚS.26 This oldest Śrautasūtra is obviously under the influence of the Vedic language; it has retained many peculiarities of the Vedic language. Caland has already brought out the linguistic peculiarities of the BaudhSS. Any further attempt on this account would indeed be superfluous. Even then, with a view to making this Introduction complete, I would like to present here some select examples even though it would be a mere repeti- tion. A word-index appended to this edition would supply valuable informa- tion to a conscientious reader for his ritualistic and critical study of the text.

Just as in the Brāhmaṇa-texts, so in the BaudhŚS also one comes across a large number of cases of tmesis. e.g. uc ca māṛṣṭy ava ca mārṣṭi II.18; āvā hayaty ā vā hārayati IV.1; sam hai'va rohati IX.4; abhy enam āhvayate hotā VII.17; pari samidham sinaști 1.15; ati tam srjati XII.18; upai'tena grahena rama VII.20 etc.INTRODUCTION

Since the BaudŚS is a pravacana, one comes across in it certain 
distinctive marks which are rather absent in the Sūtra-texts, or at least are rather keenly felt. A teacher orally giving a discourse would have in his discourse a reflection of depicting a picture of the ritual which he might be visualising at the time. Speaking about the time-span, he says dvādaśyāṁ vyuṣṭāyām II.20; tisṛṣu vyuṣṭāsu XVII.6; srucā pañcamīm juhoti VI.4. When he has to employ a lengthy mantra-portion, he would say something like iti pratipadya ity ataḥ III.18 etc. Sometimes one meets with a natural alliteration: susambħṛtān sambhārān punar eva sambharati 11.6; susambhṛtān sambharaṇyām sambhṛtya VII.6. The prefix su- is joined to a past participle to denote abundance: susambhṛta (above); sūpanibaddha VI.25; susamtṛpta 1.18; suvicita VI.14; sudhupita IX.3. The use of the verbal form āste, āsate with a present participle is typical: ramayanto jāgarayanta āsate XV.3; dhūnvanta āsate IX.8; tām te pibanto ramamāṇā mahīyamānā āsate IX.11; gopayann āste X.1. Similarly the form eti or yanti: stṛṇann eti III.30; utkhidann eti XI.5; hotur vaśaṁ yanti IV.2. The use of the past participle prajñāta is typical: prajñātaṁ nidadhāti X.54; prajñāte barhiṣi nidhāya IV.5 explained by Bhavasvamin as yathā na samsriyete pratyabhijñāte tathā nidhāya.

VI.6= upasthanam eti. Bhavasvāmin explains taiḥ saha saṁgacchata ity arthaḥ, Payāṁsi víśāsti VI.34 “(The Adhvaryu) gives directions as regards the man- agement of the milk." When any action is to be done by somebody, not by a specific person, plural verbal form is used: athā' smai madhuparkaṁ ca gāṁ ca prahuḥ VI.17; hvayanti patnim hvayanti hotaram IV.7. When various views are to be expressed, the pronouns eka and apara are used e.g. tasmād yajñavāstu nā ’bhyavetyam iti, ahorātrāv ity ekam, yāvad agnayaḥ śītāḥ syur ity etad ekam, yāvad enam abhivarṣed ity etad aparam XXVI.7. 
Because a ritual is to be carried on with the collaboration of a number of persons, it becomes essential for the Adhvaryu, the chief executive priest, to give directions (sampraiṣa) to different persons at one and the same time. This is customary to all Yajurveda-Sūtrakāras. In the BaudhŚS however the occasions are more frequent, and the calls indeed are beautiful composi- tions. e.g. brahman pravargyena pracariṣyāmo hotar gharmam abhiṣṭuhy agnid rauhiņau puroḍāśāv adhiśraya pratiprasthātaḥ pravargyaṁ vihara prastotaḥ sāmāni gāya IX.6. "O Brahman, we shall proceed with the Pravargya-rite; O Hotr, do you recite verses in praise of the Gharma; O Agnidh, do thou put on fire the two Rauhina cakes; O Pratiprasthātṛ, do you arrange the Pravargya - imple- ments; O Prastotṛ, do you chant the (relevant) Sāmans”. One of the peculiarities of Baudhayana is that his Adhvaryu has many occasions to call upon the sacrificer to do his duties, and he does so by addressing him with the words ehi yajamāna "Come on, O sacrificer.. 
When there is an occasion for the Hotṛ or for the Udgātr to perform his part of the ritual, the Sūtrakāra refers to it by the expression yathā sa veda, yatha te viduḥ, yathāvedam (VI.27; VII.1;14). When there is an occasion for a discussion of a certain topic, Baudhāyana has used the term mīmāṁsā following the practice of the Brāhmaṇa-texts; e.g. athā'ta āprīṇām eva mīmāṁsā X.11; atha'taḥ prayāṇasyai’va mīmāṁsāVI.9; X.17; atha' to bhasmana eva'tivṛddhasya mīmāṁsāX.18; atha'taḥ sarpaṇasyai'va mīmāṁṣāXVI.9; athā'ta utthānānām eva mīmāṁsā XIX.5. When Baudhāyana has to refer to a view of some teachers in respect of some ritualistic item, he does so by saying iti vadantah following the Brahmaņa style, e.g. anu hai'ke samyanti pasava iḍe'ti vadantaḥ VII.12. The next sutra in such an instance is negative, and it begins with tad u tathā na kuryāt. 
The linguistic peculiarities recorded above cover all the four divisions of the BaudhŚS. It cannot however, be claimed on the basis of these peculiarities that one and the same author composed the entire BaudhŚS. It was quite natural that the immediate descendants of Baudhāyana who

fulfilled the mission of their teacher naturally imitated his style while doing their job. 
7. Literature on the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra 
30 
Generally the Śrautasutras are provided with means of comprehension such as the Bhāṣya, Ṭīkā, Paddhati, Kārikā and Prayoga. Bhavasvamin composed a Bhāṣya called vivaraṇa on the BaudhŚS. The Bhasya on Prasnas I-XVIII; XX-XXVI is available in manuscript-form.28 The Bhasya on Praśna I (Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa) is published.29 The manuscripts of the Bhasya are broken and have a corrupt text. W. Caland had thought of editing this Bhāṣya, but he abandoned the idea on account of defective manuscript- material. The Bhāṣya is short. Bhavasvamin aimed at elucidating only such points as were abstruse in his opinion. He lived in the eighth century A.D. Bhatta Bhaskara the commentator of the Taittiriya texts who lived before Sāyaṇa speaks respectfully about Bhavasvāmin. Personal names ending with - svāmin probably belonged to a specific period, e.g. Bhavasvāmin, Bharatasvāmin, Skandasvāmin, Kṣīrasvāmin etc. Most of them were Mīmāmsakas. An inscription dated Śaka 627 mentions a cluster of brāhmaṇa- names ending with -svāmin( cf. JBBRASIII 208, Bombay 1851). An undated inscription also gives such names (JAOSVI.589, cf. A. Weber, History of Indian Literature p. 79 and note). Burnell (p.26) has placed Bhavasvamin in the eighth century A.D. Bhavasvamin's bhāṣya, the oldest on the oldest Śrautra- sūtra, needs to be published in the interest of the history of the ritualistic religion. The attempts towards that direction are therefore welcome. 
Sāyaṇa has written a commentary on Praśna I (Darsa-Pūrṇamāsa).29 He was a follower of the Baudhayana school; therefore he cited the BaudhŚS in his commentary on the TS at the beginning; subsequently he shifted to the ApŚS. Vasudeva Dikṣita of Thanjavur wrote a commentary called mahāgnisarvasva on the tenth Praśna (Agnicayana) of the BaudhŚS and also on XVII.11-16 (Ekādaśinī). Both are in manuscript-form. Venkaṭeśvara wrote a commentary on the Karmāntasūtra (XXIV-XXVI), Dvārakānātha- yajvan wrote a commentary on the Prayaścittasutra (XXVII-XXIX) and also on the Sulbasūtra (Praśna XXX in Caland's edition). 
Mahādeva Vājapeyin of Thanjavur has written a commentary called subodhini on Praśnas I-VIII.31 It is extensive and is based on the vivarana of Bhavasvamin. It reproduces relevent portions from the Dvaidha and the Karmânta while elucidating the main Sutra, and renders great help in 
XXX 
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA 
understanding the text. At the beginning of his commentary Mahadeva Vājapeyin has given his geneology and has also given information about his patron, the Maratha King of Thanjavur. Other members of his family also composed works pertaining to the Baudhayana rituals.32 This family was resident of Shahajirājapuram-modern Tiruvisanalloor near Kumbakonam (Thanjavur district). Shahajirājapuram was donated by Shahaji the ruler of Thanjavur as an agrahāra to fortysix learned Pandits well-versed in the different branches of Sanskrit learning. Mahadeva Vājapeyin who lived in the seventeenth century A.D. was the Adhvaryu of Tryambakarāya Makhin, Minister of Thanjavur. Tryambakarāya was the younger brother of Narasimharāya, father of Anandaraya Makhin who wrote, among other works, the Aśvalāyanasūtravṛtti. 
Sometimes the subhodhini gives readings of the Sūtra-text which are different from those in the printed text. Since it closely follows the vivarana of Bhavasvamin, its different renderings may be said to have the same value as that of the vivaraṇa, because many times Bhavasvamin who is too short in his explanations is silent on the elucidation of certain words from the Sūtra- text. Mahādeva Vājapeyin often cites passages from several Śrautasūtras. Being a South Indian, he quotes, among others, the Drāhyāyaṇa Śrautasūtra of Samaveda which was followed in Tamil Nadu. He never quotes the Latyāyana Śrautasūtra which was followed in Gujarat and Varanasi. The late and detailed production of the subodhini suffers at the same time from a draw-back, namely, that sometimes it is not definite about the old tradition of the Sūtra; at certain places it gives optional renderings. 
Coming to the Prayoga literature, we meet with the oldest Prayogakāra, namely, Kesavasvāmin who wrote his prayogasāra presenting the manuals of all the major sacrifices.33 Kesavasvāmin is referred to by Rāmāgnicit in his Vṛtti on Dhūrtasvamin's bhāṣya on the ApŚS. Rudradatta, the commentator of the ApŚS often cites Kesavasvamin. Besides the commentary on BaudhŚS I (Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa) Sāyaṇa composed manuals called yajñatantrasudhānidhi of several rituals.34 Anantadeva wrote several works on Dharmaśāstra. In his samskārakaustubha he has given the pedigree of his patron family. His patron, named Bājbahadur, was reigning in Himalayan territories. Anantadeva's literary career may be assigned to the third quarter of the seventeenth century (1645-75). There are Prayogas written by persons belonging to the family of Seṣa which, originally resident of Nanded on the bank of river Godavari in Marathawada (Mahārashtra) migrated to Varanasi in the six- 
INTRODUCTION 
xxxi 
teenth century A.D. and won great honour among the Pandits of Varanasi. A member of the Navahasta family is also credited with the composition of Prayogas following the BaudhSS. Gopala wrote a manual known as Gopalakārikā dilating upon the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa and Agnicayana. 
8. The Chronology of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra 
The chronology of the BaudhŚS, indeed of any Śrautasūtra, is a vexed problem. As we have already seen, there are the Śrauta, Grhya and Dharma Sūtras which are ascribed to Baudhāyana. There are also the Sulba, the Pravara, the Gṛhyaparibhāṣa and the Gṛhyaśeṣa Sūtras with which Baudhayana's name is associated. W. Caland35 has enumerated all these Sūtra-texts and has also made an attempt to fix their order in the tradition. It cannot be said that all these works were compiled by one and the same person. The pravacana style of the BaudhŚS is absent in the other Sutra-texts. Even in regard to the BaudhŚS we have seen that the Dvaidha, the Karmānta and the Prayaścitta sections were the compositions of the descendants of Baudhayana. Therefore while speaking about the chronology of the BaudhŚS, I have in view Praśnas I-XVIII (excluding the Kathaka Praśna XIX) of the BaudhŚS which are before us in the literary form given to Baudhāyana's lectures by his disciples. 
It is appropriate first to fix the relative chronology before attempting to fix the date. Mahadeva has paid homage to the Taittiriya Sūtrakāras at the beginning of his commentary vaijayanti on the SatyāṣādhaŚS. Here he has begun with the name of Baudhāyana, and his order of the Sūtrakāras is mostly acceptable also as a chronological one. From the linguistic pecularities of the BaudhŚS as already recorded, it becomes obvious that Baudhāyana was very much under the influence of the idiom of the Taittiriya mantra and Brahmana which formed the basis of his ritual discourses. It was natural that all the nuances of the Vedic language should flow down in his composition. 
One of the points helping fixation of relative chronology of the Śrautasūtras is the position of paribhāṣā among them. In most of the Śrautasutras one comes across the paribhāṣā, long or short, laid down at the beginning or in the middle, recorded collectively or in a scattered manner. The Karmanta section of the BaudhSS has at its beginning eleven Khaṇḍikās which bear some similarity with the paribhāṣā. The Prayaścitta section contains a Khanḍikā (XXVII. 14) of a similar nature. The main Sutra includes nothing like the paribhāṣā. This is in full consonance with its pravacana character. 
xxxii 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
The Purva Mīmāṁsā character of discussion is another point in consid- eration of chronology. Certain Śrautasūtras bear the character of discussion as found in the Purva Mimāmsā sūtras. They can therefore be said to have been composed subsequent to the Purva Mīmāṁsā sūtras. The BaudhŚS does not possess any Pūrva Mīmāmsā element. It can therefore be easily taken to have been composed prior to the composition of the Purva Mīmāmsā sūtras. 
The Taittiriya Śrautasūtras are of course closely related to the Samhită, Brāhmaṇa and Aranyaka of the Taittirīyas. Almost all Śrautasūtras of this recension presuppose all the Taittiriya texts as have come down in tradition. The BaudhŚS has, however, not cited any verses from the Upahoma and Acchidrakanda sections of the TBr (II.4,5; III.7) as we have already seen. This indicates that in Baudhāyana's time certain parts of the TBr had not attained full recognition. This points to the high antiquity of the BaudhŚS. 
The other Śrautasūtras belonging to the Taittirīya recension are: Bharadvaja, Āpastamba, Satyāṣāḍha Hiranyakešin, Vaikhānasa and Vādhūla. The first four out of these are also in the chronological order. The common feature is that all of them are composed in sutra-style. The time-span. between the Bharadvāja-the first and the Vaikhānasa-the last covers a few hundreds of years. Barring minor differences, the ritualistic pattern of all of them is almost the same. While the BaudhŚS often quotes brāhmaṇa- passages from the Taittiriya recension, the BhārŚS quotes only a few, and refers to them by saying iti vijñāyate; brāhmaṇavyākhyātamor yathāsamāṛnātam. While the BaudhSS is silent about the Upahomas and the Acchidrakāṇḍa of the TBr, the BharŚS has cited a few verses from them. 
An important difference between the BaudhŚS and the other Taittiriya Sūtras concerns the close relationship between the mantra and its ritualistic employment. In some cases it is observed that while the BaudhŚS is particu- lar in maintaining that relationship, the other Sutra-texts bear a rather loose relation. In BaudhŚS III.21 there is a bunch of four formulas to be recited by the sacrificer as a part of the prayers pertaining to the performance of the Full-moon and the New-moon sacrifices. They are to be recited after the Viṣṇukrama formulas. With the first aganma suvaḥetc. the sacrificer prays to the Ahavaniya. With subhur asi śreṣṭho etc. he prays to Aditya. With idam aham amum etc, he drives away his enemies. With saṁ jyotiṣā bhūvam he touches himself. According to BhārŚS IV.20.8, the sacrificer prays to Aditya with all the four formulas. ApSS IV.14.11 says that the sacrificer prays to Aditya with 
ĀpŚS 
INTRODUCTION 
xxxiii 
the verse aganma suvaḥ etc. The Sūtra is silent about the subsequent three formulas which however may be presumed. The relevant Brāhmaṇa (TS 1.7.6) enlightens the rite. It is remarkable that the BaudhŚS, rather than the other Sutras, faithfully follows the intent of the Brāhmaṇa, and may be said to be recording the tradition prevalent in the period of the Brāhmaṇa. 
There are numerous other points in the Taittiriya ritualistic tradition where the BaudhŚS differs from others. After the Anuyāja offerings in the Avabhṛtha in the Agniṣṭoma (VIII.20) the Adhvaryu holds the ladle upon the water with samudre te hṛdayam apsv antaḥ...... He fills it with water with sam tvā višantu oṣadhir uta" paḥ. He offers water into water with yajñasya tvā yajñapate vidhema svāhā. Now the Avabhṛtha-material whichever is besmeared with Soma is scattered upon the water with the verse avabhṛtha nicańkuna.... He takes water into folded palms with sumitrā na āpa oṣadhayaḥ santu; he throws it towards that direction where his enemy lies with durmitrās tasmai ... . Touching water, he floats (or they float) the residue of Soma together with the skin of black antelope with devir āpa eșa vo garbhas ... (TS 1.4.45). He touches the drops, does not consume them. BhārSS XIV 22.14- 17 prescribes as follows: with samudre te.... the Adhvaryu strikes into water the ladle filled with the residue of Soma. Wherever a drop of Soma appears, he consumesit with apsu dhautasya... (TS III.2.5.6). According to some teachers he should merely touch them. They pray to the Avabhṛtha-material with devīrāpa ... ÄpŚS XIV.20.10-21.1 prescribes similarly. Here it will be observed that Baudhāyana's prescriptions are more closely in association with the TS- formulas. There is also difference in the marking of the formulas. Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa on TS I.4.45 have followed Baudhayana. A typical case is the employment of the formula apsu dhautasya... (TSIII.2.5.7). Baudhāyana (VIII.17) has employed it at its proper place after the offering of the Hāriyojana goblet, so also BhārŚS (XIV.19.3) and ĀpŚS (XIII.17.9). As seen above, BhārŚS and ApSS have reemployed that formula in relation to the Avabhṛtha. Here is an enlargement of the ritual. 
Sometimes it is observed that while the BaudhŚS has marked the distinction between the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer in regard to the utterance of the formula, the BhārŚS and the ApŚS have ignored it. According to BaudhŚS VI.5 the Adhvaryu hands over to the sacrificer the horn of black antelope on the occasion of his initiation for the Agnistoma. The Adhvaryu hands it over with indrasya yonir asi; the sacrificer receives it with mā mā himsîḥ. The BhārŚS (X.6.13) and the ApŚS (X.9.17) ask the 
xxxiv 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
Adhvaryu to hand it over with the combined formula indrasya yonir asi mā mā himsiḥ. The propriety of Baudhāyana's prescription is obvious. Another passage may be looked into. TS 1.3.11.1 reads adbhyas tvau'ṣadhibhyo mano me hārdi yaccha tanūṁ tvacam naptāram ašīya. TS VI.4.1 provides a Brāhmaṇa- explanation only for mano me hārdi yaccha. Baudhāyana (IV.10) divides the above-mentioned mantra-portion into two and explains, "with adbhyas tvau'sadhibhyo mano me hardi yaccha the sub-offerer wipes out his hands on the sacrificial grass; with tanum tvacam putram naptāram ašīya (the sacrificer) gazes at the smoke (issuing out of the cooked cuttings of the anus of the animal in the animal-sacrifice)." Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara on TSI.3.11 agrees to this. BhārŚSVII.21.13-14 lays down, "with adbhyas tvau'ṣadhibhyaḥ the Pratiprasthātṛ wipes out the smearing on the sacrificial grass; with mano me hārdi yaccha (etc.) he touches himself." Here the remaining formula tanum tvacam putraṁ naptāram asiya may be understood. By 'he' it is proper to understand the Pratiprasthaṭr in consideration of the Brahmaṇa- explanation in TS VI 4.1 Bharadvaja's prescription for mano me hārdi yaccha is acceptable; but the subsequent portion, if presumed, cannot be applicable. ApŚS VII.26.12 generally agrees with Bharadvāja. Baudhāyana's employment of tanum tvacam putram naptāram asiyawhich is distinct from Bharadvaja and Apastamba is the reasonable one. Numerous other cases of this nature can be found out. The instances cited above are adequate to indicate the partial artifici- ality of the prescription of Bharadvāja and Āpastamba and their consequent posteriority. The Satyāṣāḍha Kalpasūtra and the Vaikhānasa Śrauasūtra are admittedly later than the BharSS and the ApŚS. 
The Vadhula Śrautasūtra (VādhŚS) deserves consideration for ascer- taining the comparative chronology of Śrautasūtras. VādhŚS first became known to the scholarly world when W. Caland published a few parts of it in four instalments (Acta orientalia Vols. I-VI, Lugduni Batavorum 1924-28). After a long time M. Witzel shed some light on the extent and character of that text. 
36 In 1993 B.B. Chaube37 published a critical edition of this Sūtra based on the manuscripts and other material available to him. Yasuke Ikari of the Kyoto University in Japan has now undertaken the project of publish- ing in Roman script yet another critical edition of this Sūtra-text. He has succeeded in securing the original manuscript of that text from Kerala. It will be published in instalments, and will probably be an improvement over the edition published earlier. This is not the place to go into the merits of the printed editions. My remarks will be confined to the contribution of the VādhŚS towards the comparative chronology of the BaudhŚS.

INTRODUCTION 
XXXV 
As already observed, Mahādeva, the author of commentary vaijayantī on the Satyāṣāḍha Kalpasūtra has mentioned VādhŚS as the last one among the Taittiriya Sutras. There must be some reason behind it. An examination of the mantras employed in the VādhŚS shows that the text of those mantras is at variation in many places from those in the Taittiriya texts. These variations cannot be set aside as modifications occurred in oral transmission or as scribal errors. The VādhŚS probably belonged to some branch of the Taittiriyas other than the Khāṇḍikeya to which the other Taittirīya Sūtras belong. 
The character of the VadhŚS is close to that of the BaudhŚS; there is even literal agreement in many cases. Vādhūla is extensive in his prescrip- tions. He cites the mantras in extenso in his specific style. He often quotes Brāhmaṇa-passages from the Taittiriya recension-perhaps to a larger extent than Baudhayana. The Vadhūla manuscript even contains numerous Brāhmaṇa-passages, not exhaustive, which are known as anvākhyāna. One comes across deictic use of pronouns. The language is archaic. The so-called sütra-marking is not of a uniform character. There is no clear division of Praśna, Prapathaka and Anuvāka. There is also a Patala division. The beginning sutra of the next Patala is often employed as the end of the present Pațala. All these features lead to the conclusion that the VādhSS is a pravacana like the BaudhŚS. 
A comparison of the contents of the BaudhSS with those of the VādhŚS shows that the two texts go parallel to a certain extent. The available VādhŚS- text has not laid down the Ekāhas, the Ahīnas and the Sattras. It is remarkable that the fourteenth Prapathaka, a short one, records the duties of the sacrificer in those rituals and also the incidental rites. In Chaube's edition of the VādhŚS the Agnyādheya forms the first Prapāṭhaka. All other recensions, except the Vaikhanasa Śrautasūtra, begin with the Darsa- Pūrṇamāsa in consonance with the general Yajurveda tradition. From the information supplied by Ikari about the Kerala MSS of VadhŚS it appears that the VadhSS also began with the Darŝa-Purṇamāsa. 
Caland has acknowledged the close relationship between the BaudhŚS and the VadhSS. From the larger number of Brāhmaṇa-citations in the VādhŚS he had expressed the possibility of the anteriority of Vādhūla to Baudhayana. The VadhSS was known to the author or authors of the Dvaidha, the Karmânta and the Prayaścitta Sutras. There is no evidence to infer that Vādhula was known to Baudhayana the author of the main Sūtra- 
xxxvi 
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA 
text. 39 Like Baudhāyana, Vādhūla gives at the outset a list of things required for the performance of the ritual under discussion. A comparison of these things with those mentioned by Baudhāyana shows a little difference here and there. A clear indication of Baudhāyana's anteriority over Vadhula is the treatment of third Kanda of the TS known as Aupānuvākya. That Kanda has recorded such mantras and the Brāhmaṇa-portions as support mainly the mantra-and Brāhmaṇa-portions laying down the Soma-sacrifice. Baudhāyana has independently dealt with the Aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa in Praśna XIV; he has not at all touched it while prescribing the Soma-sacrifice on the basis of the principal portion of TS. This is not so with Vādhūla who, even though he is aware of the Aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa, has suitably exploited the provisions made in this Kānda side by side with the main portions. 
The Agnyādheya is prescribed in Praśna II of the BaudhŚS. As already observed, the Khaṇḍikās of this Praśna are not in the proper order. The regular procedure is given in Khaṇḍikās 12-21. It is remarkable that the VādhŚS has nothing parallel to Khaṇḍikās 1-11 of the BaudhŚS except that the formulas called papmano vinidhayaḥ are recorded in the Pariseșa. The Karmānta (BaudhSS XXIV.15) has mentioned different periods at which the rite of setting the fires should commence, namely, one year before or twleve days or thirteen days or one day before, which agree with Kath. VII. 15. These options are absent in the VadhŚS. According to Baudhayana the formal choosing of all seventeen priests takes place at the setting up of fires. The other Taittirīya Sūtrakāras ask the sacrificer to choose them at the Agniṣṭoma - the proper occasion for the functioning of all of them. It is striking that the choosing of priests is not met with in any part of the available VadhSS. 
In Prapathaka III of the VādhŚS Kaṇḍikās 1-10 are assigned as the yājamānawherein we find certain expiation-rites in respect of the Agnihotra and the Darsa-Purnamasa which are apparently to be performed by the sacrificer. In Prapathaka XIV there are certain expiation-rites to be observed by the sacrificer initiated for a Soma-sacrifice. Nowhere does one come across the expiation-rites to be performed by the Adhvaryu. 
Prapathaka XIII of the VadhŚS is devoted to the Pravargya-rite. In all Taittiriya Sūtra-texts the expiation-rites pertaining to the Pravargya and the Avantaradīkṣā to be undergone by the sacrificer for learning by heart the Pravargya-mantras contained in the Taittiriya Aranyaka are prescribed side by side with the Pravargya-rite and the disposal of the Pravargya-implements.INTRODUCTION 
xxxvii 
These are absent in this Prapathaka. Prapāṭhakas VI and VII prescribe the Agniṣṭoma. While laying down the procedure of the Agnistoma and while speaking about the subsequent Soma-sacrifices, Vādhula refers to the Ukthya, Şoḍaśin and Atirātra sacrifices. A barren cow is to be offered to Mitra-Varuna as the Anubandhya animal-sacrifice after the performance of the Udayaniyeṣṭi in a Soma-sacrifice. Baudhāyana (ŚS VIII.21) has men- tioned the offering of Amikṣā as a substitute to the animal. Vādhūlā (VII.22.55) has not allowed this substitute. 
BaudhŚS XV.24 prescribes the wholesale employment of the fourteen verses towards the armouring of the royal sacrificer. The verses are recorded in TS IV. 6.6 and the Brahmana is given in TBr III.9.4. It would be interesting to have a look on the employment of the relevant TS-verses - twenty in all. BaudhŚS XV.24 prescribes: 
अथ यजमानं वर्मसंनहनीयाभिः संनह्यति जीमूतस्येव भवति प्रतीकमिति चतुर्दशभिर्यथारूपम् । अथ रथमुपतिष्ठते वनस्पते वीड्वङ्गो हि भूया इति तिसृभिरनुच्छन्दसम् । अथ दुन्दुभिमुपश्वासयत्युपश्वासय पृथिवीमुत द्यामिति तिसृभिरनुच्छन्दसम् । 
Thus Baudhayana asks the Adhvaryu to equip the sacrificer with the various implements and weapons while reciting the fourteen verses one by one, and then in triads. He presumes the proper understanding on the part of the Adhvaryu. VādhŚS XI. 15.56-16.14 prescribes: 
वर्मसंनहनीयेनानुवाकेन यजमानं संनह्यति || जीमूतस्येव भवति प्रतीकमिति ॥ 
He further gives instructions to be carried out reciting each subsequent verse (ekayā) and then in triads. Thus Vādhūla prescribes the equipment of the sacrificer as prescribed in the Anuvāka; he furthermore thinks it desirable to give several directions to be carried out with the several verses. Apastamba (XX 16.4-14) does not refer to the Anuvāka in laying down the injunctions; he mentions each verse and lays down the action to be carried out with it. A comparison of the instructions given in these three Sūtra-texts shows that their attitude towards explanation is gradually modified. Vādhūla was inclined to give detailed instructions as compared to Baudhāyana. A thorough comparison of the BaudhŚS and the VadhSS will shed welcome light on their mutual relationship. 
I have given these details of the VadhŚS because of its close affinity with the BaudhŚS and also because the study of the VadhŚS is still in its infancy. From this comparative study it may be concluded that Vādhula was posterior to Baudhayana the author of the main Baudhayana text. The VadhSS was 
Xxxviii 
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASÜTRA 
composed before the composition of the Dvaidha, Karmanta and Prayaścitta sections of the BaudhŚS. Not much time passed between Baudhāyana and the composer or composers of the Dvaidha and Karmanta. Consequently the chronological difference between Baudhāyana and Vadhūla could be very little. If a definite chronology is to be attempted, I am inclined to assign the period 800 B.C. to 600 B.C. to the BaudhŚS. This span covers three steps : (i) composition of the main text of the BaudhŚS, (ii) composition of the VādhŚS, and (iii) the composition of the Dvaidha, Karmanta and Prayaścitta sections. The main part of the BaudhŚS is thus the oldest among the Kalpasūtras belonging to the Taittirīya recension. 
The chronological relationship of the BaudhŚS with the Śrautasūtras belonging to the other existing recensions of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, namely the Kāthaka, Kapisthala-Katha and the Maitrāyaṇī is a point to be consid ered. Two Śrautasūtras, the Manava and the Vārāha, belong to the Maitrāyaṇī recension; the Manava is senior to the Vārāha. The MānŚS is a Sūtra-text, not a pravacana. It therefore cannot be older than the BaudhŚS; it is junior to the latter. The Maitrāyaṇī recension was of course in need of a Śrautasūtra. Even though the Maitrāyaṇīya ritualists must have found some device for setting their ritual in order, it seems the actual Sütra-composition was undertaken at a rather late date.

The Kathaka Śrautasūtra (KāṭhŚS) is unfortunately lost. It comprised thirtynine Adhyāyas, vide Devapāla's commentary on the Laugākṣi (Kāṭhaka) Gṛhyasūtra. Suryakānta has published in his Kāṭhakasaṁkalana11 extracts from the Kathaka Brāhmaṇa collected from manuscript-collections pre- served in Lahore, and from Devapāla's commentary on the Laugākṣi Gṛhyasūtra; those from the KāthŚS-one collected from a manuscript and many others from the commentaries by Karka and Devayājñika on the KatyŚS (edited by A. Weber, Berlin 1859), and a few quotations from the Crhyasutra of the Kathakas collected from various sources. The first among the Śrautasūtra-passages lays down the group of Divaḥ Śyeni and Apāghā Istis. The passage is said to have formed the fourth Patala (that is, Kaṇḍikā forming part of some Adhyāya). It is striking that citations from the KāthŚS composed in north-western India have been reproduced by the commenta- tors of the KatyŚS which was composed in the north-eastern part. Probably some followers of the Kāṭhaka school had migrated towards the north-east with whom the Vājasaneyins came into contact. Sometimes Katha and Maitra (=Maitrāyaṇīya) passages are cited together. The Kathaka Śrautasūtra is so 
INTRODUCTION 
xxxix 
called because it belongs to the Kathaka recension. The author of the Kathaka Gṛhyasūtra was Laugākṣi. Even though Karka and Devayājñika have cited in their commentaries passages from the KāṭhŚS mostly under the designation ‘Katha' or 'Kāthaka', at about a dozen places they have quoted under the name 'Laugakṣi'. It may therefore be said that Laugākṣi was the name of the author of the KāthSS also. 
42 
It would rather be hasty to assess the character of the KāṭhŚS as a whole on the basis of only a few available extracts. The TBr together with the TÃ deals with the Kāṭhaka citis, and the mantra and Brāhmaṇa for the Divaḥ Śyeni and Apāghā Iṣṭis are recorded in TBr III.12.1-4. The Taittiriya Śrautasütras have referred to these Istis. Thus the Taittiriyas have from the very beginning borrowed certain ritual - elements from the Kathakas. A study of all the KathŚS - passages so laboriously collected by Suryakānta shows that the Sūtrakāra has described the ritualistic items in a detailed manner. He has not adopted the sutra - style; he is a pravacanakāra. Hence the Śrautasūtra must have been composed in very old days. There are certain indications showing the archaic language and archaic ritualistic elements. There is deictic use of demonstrative pronouns. An interesting point arises out of the definition of prakrama. A long KāthŚS - passage is cited in the commentary on the KatyŚS while prescribing the measuring of the Mahāvedi for the Agnistoma. The measuring of the Mahāvedi is prescribed in detail, and while doing so the Sútrakāra gives the definition of prakrama and pada: tripadaḥ prakramo'rdhacaturthapado vā padam pañcadašāngulam dvādaśāngulam vā (Kāṭhakasaṁkalana p.16, KātyŚS edn. p. 687). Here two things are worthy of attention: firstly, the Sūtrakāra, while prescribing the measuring also gives the definition of prakrama and of pada. Here is the pravacana style of speaking all things together. While prescribing the measuring of the Mahāvedi (VI.22) Baudhāyana has not given the definition of prakrama; he simply uses that word. In Baudh. ŚulbaS (1.5) he has given the definition. Here Kāthaka's pravacana style seems to be more prominent than that of Baudhayana. Secondly, while Baudhāyana defines a prakrama as dvipada, Kāthaka defines it as tripada and even ardhacaturthapadai.e. three and half padas. It may be observed that the longer prakrama of Kathaka points to an older period. According to Baudhāyana (SuS.1.9) a pada consists of fifteen angulas while Kathaka allows the option of fifteen or twleve. 
A few other points may be noted: the Caturmasya sacrifices to be completed consecutively in five days as an option are attributed to Katha 
xl 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
(p.12, KātyŚS edn p. 554). These are not mentioned in the BaudhŚS main text nor in the Karmanta. The Anugrahika (Parisiṣṭa) of the ManŚS has mentioned it. In the sūtra for Divah Syeni the Sūtrakāra has given two Ślokas, and in that for the Apagha one Śloka. Parallel construction is found in BaudhŚS Prāyaścitta. Such features pointing to a late date may perhaps be the additions made by some follower of the Kāṭhaka school in course of time. This should however not speak against the conclusion of the Kāṭhaka main Sūtra-text being a pravacana and therefore being as old as, if not earlier than, the BaudhŚS. Just as Baudhayana may be said to have been the first teacher setting the Taittirīya rituals in order immediately after the Brāhmaṇa period, similarly Kāṭhaka (Laugākṣi) may be said to have been the first teacher setting the Kathaka rituals in order. 
The comparative chronology of the BaudhŚS, the VadhŚS, the MānŚS and the KāthSS is noteworthy. 
The Kapisthala-Katha sub-recension does not seem to possess an inde- pendent Śrautasūtra. 
9. The Home of the Baudhayaniyas 
Since the last few centuries the followers of the Baudhayana school have been the inhabitants of Karnataka and Kerala. These regions should how- ever not be understood as their original home. Baudhāyana who may be regarded as the first teacher who, immediately after the Brāhmaṇa-period, set the Taittiriya rituals to order in the pravacana form, must have lived in the north-western parts of India where the Taittiriya and all other recensions of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda took their root and flourished. We find the following geographical references in the BaudhŚS43: āraṭṭaVIII.13; Karaskara XVIII.13; Kalinga II.3; XVIII. 13; Kāśīvideha XVIII.44; Kurukṣetra XVIII.45; kurupañcāla XVIII.44, Kurubrahman XVIII.26; khāṇḍavaprasthaXVII.18, gāndhāra XVIII.13; 44; pañcāla XVIII.25; plākṣa prasravaṇa XVI.29; 30; bisavatī (pl) XVIII. 45; mahāvarṣa II.3; mūjavat II.3 VI.14; varṣiṣthiya prastha XVIII.49; videha II.3; saphāla XVIII.13; sarasvati (river) XII.8; XVI.29; XXII.18; suvarņasavanī XVIII.45; sauvîra XVIII.13. 
Some of these localities and places were most probably intimately known to Baudhayana or his descendants; the others were known merely by hearsay. There was close contact of the Taittiriyas and therefore of Baudhāyana with the followers of the Kathaka** and the Maitrāyaṇī recensions which flourished in the Panjab and the other north-western parts. There is also 
44 
INTRODUCTION 
xli 
evidence (e.g. the Kāthaka citis) which shows that Baudhayana was in the neighbourhood of the Kathakas. The river Sarasvati which was flowing in his neighbourhood was held in respect (BaudhŚS XII.8) as we find also in TBr (1.7.5). It would therefore be proper to hold that Baudhāyana was living in the Panjab. It is not possible to restrict the region any more. 
45 
Suryakanta15 has expressed his displeasure over the dominent position assigned by scholars of cultural history of ancient India to the Apastambas and Baudhayanas setting aside the rightful claim of the Kāṭhaka recension as representing the oldest Yajurvedic ritual-tradition. He has further deemed the so-called dominant position of the Apastambas and Baudhayanas as “a deliberate attempt at misrepresentation." It may, however, be observed that recent researches have proved that the original home of the Apastambas and Baudhayanas was in northern India, not in southern India. Therefore there is no question of any dominance. The Kathas, even though they established colonies in eastern and central India as the epigraphical evidence shows, maintained their position in the Panjab and Kashmir. Due to frequent political unrest they received a severe setback in their main land and their colonies outside also vanished. The Baudhāyanas and the Āpastambas could maintain their traditions because they migrated towards south India-the area which was politically peaceful. Anyway the disappearance of the KathŚS is a great loss to the Vedic literature and to the history of the ritualistic religion. 
The Vadhūlas may have been living on the eastern border of the regions occupied by the Baudhayanins. Since a very long historical period the Baudhayanins left their land. Why they left, when they left, under which conditions they left--all these questions remain without any answer under the present state of our knowledge of the economic and cultural conditions of northern India in ancient times. Those of the Baudhayaniyas who chose to stick to their places possibly adopted a different Vedic school-Kāṭhaka or Maitrāyaṇī. 
Baudhayanins have been living in Karnataka at least for the last six centuries. Sāyaṇa the well-known commentator of several Vedic texts lived at Vijayanagar in Karnataka in the fourteenth century A.D. He was a follower of the Baudhayana school. In the entire northern India no follower of the Taittiriya recension has been living since the last few centuries. The ritual- istic tradition indicates the association of certain Vedic schools in the various regions. The performance of a Soma-sacrifice-the principal ritual-neces- sitates the collaboration of a Baudhayanin, an Asvalayanin and a Kauthumin. 
xlii 
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA 
The tradition was that a Rgvedin of the Aśvalāyana school should have as the Adhvaryu a follower of the Baudhāyana school. In several religious tracts composed in the medieval period the prominence of the Baudhāyana school in the field of religious life is keenly felt. The supremacy of the Baudhayanins was maintained in Maharashtra where the Aśvalāyanins lived in large numbers for many centuries. Later on the Apastambins from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh came in contact with the Maharashtrians. The result was that an Äśvalāyanin was allowed to have an Apastambin as his Adhvaryu provided a matrimonial relationship had been established. 
Followers of the various Vedic schools have been living in different parts of India. The prevalence of the different Vedic schools in historical period has been traced; and this history has been helpful in compiling the history of the Vedic literature and culture. The efforts need to be continued further. The history of each Vedic school prevailing at present in the specific region should be traced to the place where it took its roots with the help of the literary and historical records and the tradition which is fortunately main- tained even to a small extent in spite of the social and economic revolution. Such a history, if compiled, will be a veritable source for the social and cultural history of India.

FOOTNOTES 
The name Baudhāyana is spelt in two ways. In some manuscripts it is written as Baudhāyanawhile in many others, particularly written in Karnataka and the adjoining regions where the Baudhayana school flourished in the historical period, it is written as Bodhayana. I had therefore resorted to that spelling so far. Gramnatically, however, the suffix ayana affixed to the word budhawith the meaning of gotrāpatyawould involve the vṛddhi of the initial vowel. Hence it is reasonable to read the word as Baudhāyana. cf. W. Caland, "Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana”, Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Morgenlāndes Band XII No. 1, Leipzig 1903, pp. 12-13. It is further to be noted that Bodhāyana is Prakṛtisation of Baudhāyana.

The other Śrautasütras which claim the character of a pravacana are the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra belonging to the Taittiriya recension, the Jaiminiya Śrautasūtra belong- ing to the Jaiminiya recension of the Samaveda, and the Kathaka Śrautasūtra. e.g. XX.19; Duayor homa iti cf. III.4; XX.10: patnyām avidyamānāyām; XX.8: carumukheşʊ iti, XX.13; abhikrāmaṁ juhotī’ti; XX.13: pañcamasyā’vadānasyā 'bhivṛddhyā iti etc. The first three items of Dvaidha in the Pasúbandha section do not speak about the Nirüḍhapaśu; they deal with the optional animal-sacrifices. The topic sphyena'gnïdhro nighnann anveti hotuḥ padāni'ti XX.26 is not traced to the original Sūtra. The topic ašiḥṣu iti XXIII.8 is not traced to the main text, Dvaidha XXIII. 19 the last Khandikā of the Dvaidhasutra lays down the Dvaidhasūtra for the Sarvatomukha sacrifice; it is found in some manuscripts as a separate folio. The main text has not prescribed this sacrifice. Its position even in the Dvaidha is insecure. Kesavasvamin has reproduced this Khandika in his prayogasara in extenso. The Dvaidha on the Sarvatomukha has recorded the views of Baudhayana, Śālīki, Aupamanyava, Gautama, Maudgalya and Añjigavi. When there is no main text for the Sarvatomukha, what was the source for the various topics selected for the Dvaidha? And how should one trust the genuinenss of the different views attributed to the Acaryas? 
Sāvitra offerings are prescribed in the Vajapeya sacrifice vide TBr 1.3.5.1: sāvitrāṇi juhoti karmaṇaḥ karmaṇaḥ purastāt. While Baudhāyana enumerates seventeen occa- sions for Sāvitra offerings-fourteen prior to the pressing day and three on the pressing day, Śāliki prescribes only three offerings on the pressing day. 
One reads in XXVIII.8 āʼmāvāsyasya kālād iti vyākhyātaḥ. This refers to ā’māvāsyasya kālāt paurṇamāsasya kālo nā’tîyāt etc. XXVIII.12. It is difficult to explain the disturbed order of the text.

Kashikar, "The text-problem of the Baudhāyana Ādhāna-sūtra” ABORI XXIX parts i-iv 1949, pp. 107-117; "Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra II-A Fresh Study", Journal of the Gangānāth Jha Research Institute, Allahabad, Vol. XV parts 34, pp. 155-159; cf. also Caland, op. citp.7. Incidentally it may be noted that a few lines in BaudhŚS VI,8 read like the Karmanta and those in BaudhŚS VII.4 read like Dvaidha, 
15. The formulas pāpmano vinidhayaḥ recorded in the Prapathaka XV (Pariseṣa) of the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra (pp. 367-368) are rather different. The Pariseșa also records the formulas to be recited by the sacrificer at the various rituals. 
16. In the Katyāyana Śrautasūtra the Pravargya chapter is the last one (XXVI). In the Satyaṣāḍha Kalpasūtra the Pravargya comes at the end of the Śrauta portion (XXIV). Similarly in the Vadhula Śrautasūtra (Prapathaka XIII). In the Bharadvāja Śrautasūtra it is conveniently inserted as Praśna XI into the Praśnas laying down the Agnistoma (cf. Intro. p. Ixxvi). Äpastamba and Vaikhānasa have attached the Pravargya to the Agnistoma for convenience. The Mānava Srautasūtra (new edn., Delhi 2001) has not attached the Pravargya to the Agnistoma.

In two places the views expressed by Baudhayana under the designation eke are found in the VadhŚS. This much is the basis for his claim.

I-II, Lahore 1932, 1934. Suryakanta's valuable work was partially utilised in the compilation of the Śrautakosa (Vol. I cf. Sanskrit Section Preface p. 27; English Section, Part 1, Intro. p. 16) published by the Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala, Pune. cf. also C.G. Kashikar, A Survey of the Śrautasutras, Journal of the University of Bombay, September 1966, Vol. XXXV (New Series) Part 2, Arts Number (No. 41) 1968, p. 76. A subsequent contribution to the study of the Kathaka recension was made by A. Witzel when he critically edited the Katha Aranyaka together with a German translation (Nepal Research Publication No. 2) Kathmandu (1979). Suryakanta's scholarly work deserves still closer attention. A study of even the stray passages is likely to shed welcome light on the character of the Kathaka recension in particular and the Yajurveda literature in general.

44. Suryakanta has made an attempt in his Introduction to the Kāthakasaṁkalana to equate the Kathas with the Hattis or Hittites, the Khata or Kheta of the Egyptian monuments, Khatta or Khate of the Assyrians and Kheta or Khitti of the Hebrews. His equations are however too fanciful, based on very meagre evidence. It is indeed hard to believe that the name of one of the Vedic schools, namely, Katha, was accepted for the entire community of the original region of the Kathas and that the people of that region migrated to several other parts of the world.

Four pitchers filled with water have been procured at the beginning of this rite. Two out of these have already been used. The fourth and the last one will be utilised just a little ahead for sprinkling.

CHAPTER- III 
RESETTING OF THE FIRES 
III.1 


(Now about one who) is going to reset his fires. They say, "(the Adhvaryu) had (already) recited the yajus (pertaining to the setting) and had procured the substances. (Therefore, at the resetting) the substances need not be procured, nor is the yajus to be recited. (This is not correct). The substances are indeed to be procured and the yajus (also) is to be recited for the accomplishment of the resetting."[^1] He (the sacrificer) procures a refurnished chariot, resewn garment, a bull who is let loose again, aweb of darbha-grass and three handfuls of darbha-grass. The substances pertaining to the setting of fires are well-known. The new-moon day which precedes the full-moon of the month of Aṣādha coalesces with the Punarvasu constellation only once in a year; one should reset on that day.  

On the Upavasatha of that day, having consigned the fires into the kindling woods, having gone away, having churned the fire and having spread out fires (the Adhvaryu) who is going to dispose of the (old) fire pours out paddy for (a cake on) eight potsherds for Agni and another on twelve potsherds for Vaiśvānara Agni. That Iṣṭi comes to a conclusion with the established procedure. Subsequently, having effused the fires with water and having cooked Brahmaudana (the sacrificer) observes the Upavasatha vow. Next morning the rite pertaining to the setting of fires starts. This much is different: There it is a web of muñja grass here it is a web of darbha-grass. There it is a faggot to be carried forth; here are bundles of darbha-grass. One sets up the Gārhapatya with darbha-blades; the Anvāhāryapacana with darbha-blades; the Āhavanīya with darbha-blades. When he sets up the Gārhapatya, he adds the Sarparājñī verses[^2] in recitation.

Four with regard to the Gārhapatya: "Thou art the earth in depth, sky in width, mid-region in greatness. In thy lap, O goddess Aditi, I place Agni the food-eater for the eating of food-The spotted bull has come and reached again the mother and

the father, faring to the heaven-Thirty abodes shine forth. Speech took resort (in them) for the sun. Do thou leave away (O fire, our harshness). Carry (our oblations) day by day-The brilliance of this (fire) moves within (heaven and earth) expirating and inspirating. The great (sun) has illumined the heaven. Three with regard to the Āhavanīya: "O Fire, if I excited, disposed of thee through rage or misfortune; may that (disposal) of thine be recompensated. We reillumine thee. That lustre of thine, disposed by me through rage which is dispersed on the earth, may Ādityas, Viśve Devas and Vasus recompensate-May the adorable light rejoice in clarified butter; may it unite this scattered sacrifice. May Br̥haspati accomplish it for us. May Viśve Devas rejoice here." The procedure upto (the rotating of) the chariot-wheel is similar. This much is different: What is there the Agnihotra-offering without reciting any mantra, here he offers with the verse, “O Agni, seven thy tongues, seven R̥ṣis, seven dear abodes, seven priesthoods, sacrifice There is a cake on to thee sevenfold; do thou fill seven birth-places with ghee."[^3] There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; here is a cake on five potsherds for Agni. To the Prayāja- yājyās in that Iṣṭi (the Hotr̥) adds four case-forms (as follows); (The first as) “O Agni, do thou come to consume (the oblation); O Agni, may the Samidhs consume the clarified butter." (The second) "We choose Agni as the messenger; O Agni, may Tanūnapāt consume the clarified butter" (The third) "Agni is enkindled together with Agni; O Agni, may the Iḍās consume the clarified butter." (The fourth) "May Agni dispel the evils, O Agni; may Barhis consume the clarified butter." The last Prayāja (yājyā) is self evident. Now the consideration of the two Ajyabhāgas. The Ajyabhāgas should be Vārtraghna. This is the view of some teachers. The Ajyabhāgas should be Vr̥dhanvant. This is the view of some teachers. (The puronuvākyās of the Ājyabhāgas should be agnim stomena bodhaya[^4] and tvam naḥ soma..[^5] respectively. This is the view of some teachers. They should be agna āyūṁṣi pavase and agne pavasva svapā."[^6] This is the view of some teachers. (This is because) what is said to be "passing through" has the form of Soma. The puronuvākyā-yājyā of the principal offering are in Paṅkti metre, namely, agne tam adya..[^7] and adhā hy agne.[^7] The Adhvaryu offers two oblations (of clarified butter) on both sides of the offering of the cake (that is, before and after) respectively with the verses, "Return with strength, return, O Agni, with food and life. Guard us again on all sides. Return with

wealth, O Agni, swell with the stream gaining all on every side." The Hotr recites loudly with regard to Svistakṛt Agni. The puronuvākyā-yājyā are ābhiṣ te adyaR and ebhir no arkaiḥ... respectively. Having deposited the Anvāhārya cooked rice (within the altar). 


(The sacrificer) gives away the Dakṣiņās pertaining to the resetting of fires-refurnished chariot, resewn garment, a bull again let loose. To the Anuyāja- yājyās of that (sacrifice) (the Hotṛ) adds the two case-forms (as follows); (The first Anūyāja-yājyā is) “A person who delights in honouring and praying Agni through his prayers shines as the foremost. He would receive food for his sustenance."[^1] May the divine Barhis accept the gift of wealth for the desirer of wealth (ie. the sacrificer). “(The second Anūyaja-yājyā is)” We the desirers of wealth exclaim the desire-yielding praise of Agni residing in the heaven (as the sun).[^2] May god Narāśamsa accept the gift of wealth for the desirer of wealth (i.e. the sacrificer).” The last Anūyāja is self-evident. This Iṣṭi comes to an end with the pouring down of Praṇītā-water and the Viṣṇu-strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his Vow.  

 
At the same time, (the Adhvaryu) having strewn the Pr̥ṣṭhya line and having carried forth Praṇīta-water, pours out secondarily a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Viṣṇu. Having baked, he deposits (it within the altar). For this (Iṣṭi) there are fifteen Sāmidheni verses, five Prayājas and the Ājyabhāgas should be Vārtraghna.[^3] and sa tvam The puronuvākyā-yājyā for the principal oblation are tuam no agne..[^3] sa tvam no agne....[^3] The puronuvākyā-yājyā for the Sviṣṭakr̥t offering should be in Triṣṭubh metre. Having deposited the Anvāhārya cooked rice (within the altar) (the sacrificer) gives away an ox. This Iṣṭi comes to an end with the pouring down of Praṇīta-water and the Viṣṇu-strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his vow. The resetting (of fires thus) comes to an end.  

Now the resetting of fires for prosperity. It is indeed said, “One who sets up the fire subsequent to the resetting, should offer these oblations." In the third setting of fires (the Adhvaryu) offers prior to the Sviṣṭakr̥t offering pertaining to the offering of a cake on five potsherds for Agni oblations by means of a spoon with the formulas, "Leka, Saleka and Suleka-may these Ādityas rejoicing, partake of clarified butter-Keta, Saketa and Suketa-may these Ādityas, rejoicing, partake of the clarified butter-Vivasvant, Aditi, Devajūti-may these Ādityas, rejoicing

partake of clarified butter.[^4] The third setting up (thus) comes to an end. In the case of one whose fires have been carried away or of one whose kindling woods are lost, (the Adhvaryu) begins the rite with (the offering of) Brahmaudana. The setting up of fires takes place as prescribed.  

AGNIHOTRA-OFFERING III.4  

(The Adhvaryu) having added fuel to the Gārhapatya before sunset and having brought the Anvāhāryapacana, draws out flaming Āhavaniya for the evening (Agnihotra) offering. Having added fuel to the Gārhapatya before sunrise, and having fetched the Anvāhāryapacana, he draws out flaming Ahavaniya for the morning (Agnihotra) offering. (He draws with the formula), "I draw thee out with speech as the Hotṛ, Prāna as the Udgātṛ, the eye as the Adhvaryu, the mind as the Brahman, the ear as the Agnidhra-with these five divine priests (the sacrificer prays with the formula), "Bhur bhuvaḥ suvaḥ (O Agni) being drawn out, do thou draw me out of the sin which I might have perpetrated knowingly or unknowingly. Whatever sin I have committed by day, do thou, drawn out, relieve me of all that" (thus in the evening)."... whatever sin I have committed by night, do thou, drawout, relieve me of all that" (thus in the morning). (The Adhvaryu) deposits the fire with the verse, "I offer the oblation of ambrosia into the ambrosia, the fire into the earth for the winning of immortality. May I win the unending desire through it which Prajāpati won first. I offer Agni into Agni, ambrosia into Vaiśvānara, svāhā.” Thus in the evening. "... I offer Sūrya into Agni, ambrosia into Vaiśvānara, svāhā” in the morning. The sacrificer's wife is present in the evening and in the morning. According to some teachers every evening.  

(The Adhvaryu) places towards the north of the Gārhapatya the Agnihotra-implements which have been washed, either on a bunch of darbha-grass or in a basket a vessel together with a spoon, ladle, illuminator and a fire-stick. Having made the Agnihotra-cow stand towards the south, facing north, a brāhmaṇa milks her. He should (first) milk the front two udders for a sacrificer who is the eldest brother, or the son of the eldest wife of his father or a gataśrī.[^1] He should (first) milk the rear two udders for a sacrificer who is the youngest son or a son of the youngest wife or who desires prosperity. He should not touch all the udders together.[^2] For

[III. 4III.5]  

a sacrificer desiring cattle, one should milk the milk of two cows. (In that case) having placed over fire (the first milk), one should pour into it the second milk. Having carried around the Agnihotra (milk) along the front of the Āhavanīya and having brought in by the eastern door (of the Gārhapatya chamber) and having put down to the rear of the Gārhapatya, the Adhvaryu sprinkles water around it.  

III.5 

(The Adhvaryu) sprinkles around at the evening Agnihotra with the formula, "I sprinkle thee around, the holy order with truth." At the morning Agnihotra with the formula, "I sprinkle thee around, the truth with holy order." Similarly he sprinkles around after having offered (the Agnihotra). Then turning by the right, hastening towards the west and having sat down to the rear of the Gārhapatya, having taken out the embers towards the north, having spread them and having placed upon them (the Agnihotra milk), he illumines it with the illuminator with the formula, "Let the fire not burn out thy lustre." He brings into it water by means of the spoon with the formula, "Thou art ambrosia." Having again illumined it, he moves a fire-brand around three times with the formula, "The Rakṣas is obstructed, 'the evil spirits are obstructed." Having taken (the vessel) down towards the north making a mark on the ground and having put back the embers, he takes the spoon and the fire-stick with the right hand and the Agnihotra-ladle with the left one with the formula, "Under the impulse of god Savitr̥, with the arms of Aśvins, with the hands of Pūṣan, I take thee." "He heats (the ladle) over the Gārhapatya with the formula, "The Rakṣas is burnt, the evil spirits are burnt" recited three times. Having placed the ladle on the bundle of darbha-grass, he addresses the sacrificer, "Om, I shall fill in the ladle." The sacrificer responds, “Om do you fill in.” (The Adhvaryu) takes up four spoonfuls either full or a little less with the formulas, “Bhūriḍā, bhuva suvariḍā.” iḍā suvar iḍāand bhūr bhuvaḥ suvar iḍā." Having kept back the spoon into the vessel, he touches them together with the formula, "Along with the gods coming in the evening. May the gods coming in the evening lead me safely together with the cattle" in the evening and "Along with the gods coming in the morning. May the gods coming in the morning lead me safely together with the cattle" in the morning. 
Having held the fire-stick on the handle of the ladle, he keeps (the ladle) on the bundle of darbha-grass to the rear of the Gārhapatya with the formula, Obeisance to Īśāna. May my progeny and cattle increase; may I, the sacrificer not meet with any calamity." Taking it up with the Daśahotr̥ formula, he carries it forward with the formula, "bhūr bhuvaḥ suvaḥ do thou move along wide midregion. This path leading to the gods is stretched far away by which the R̥ṣis longing for

heaven passed. I pass to the highest heaven along it so that I may not be deprived of the vicinity of good-doers."[^1] He places (the ladle) on a bundle of darbha-grass to the rear of the Āhavanīya with the formula, “Obeisance to Īṣāna. May my progeny increase. May I, the sacrificer, not meet with calamity." At this juncture he puts the fire-stick in the middle of the Āhavanīya.  

III.6 

(With the formula), "I pile up thee silverish, with fiery lustre, possessing wind, leading to heaven, the night, inexhaustible brick for attaining heavenly world. I place ambrosia in expiration. May Prajāpati place thee."[^1] He recites over (the fire-stick) the formula, "With that deity do thou be seated firm like Aṅgiras." He recites over it the verse, "Those cows, streaming with milk mix his Soma, clans in the birth-place of gods in the three realms of heaven." This in the evening. Now in the morning : "I pile up thee, golden, with solar lustre, possessing wind, leading to heaven, day, inexhaustible brick for attaining heavenly world. I place the ambrosia into inspiration. May Prajāpati place thee." Having recited over (the fire-stick) the tayādevata formula, he recites over it the verse tā asya sūdadohasaḥ. As soon as it catches flame he offers (the Agnihotra-milk) twice with the ladle (facing the opposite direction) the formula, “Agni is light, light is Sūrya svāhā” in the evening; and "Surya is light, light is Agni, svāhā" in the morning. This is the mixed up formula. The non-mixed is: “Agni is light, light is Agni, svāhā” in the evening; “Sūrya is the light, light is Sūrya, svāhā” in the morning.  

Having moved (the ladle crosswise) once and having placed the ladle on the bundle of darbha-grass, turning by the right, he gazes at the Gārhapatya with the verse, "Do you approach, pass together; let not the share of the sharing be lost. Do you place the sacrifice and sacrificer there which is the world of the seven R̥ṣis and good-doers." Passing over the first oblation, he offers the other in a larger quantity on the fire-stick itself with the formula, "To Prajāpati, svāhā" recited mentally. Having moved the ladle thrice (crosswise) and having placed it on the bundle of darbha-grass, cleansing it downwards, he washes away the smearings on the darbha-grass with the palm turned downwards and facing the west with the formula, "For plants thee, impel the plants." Having similarly cleansed downwards for the second time, he washes away on the darbha-grass towards the south with the sacred cord hanging on the right shoulder with the formula, "For Pitr̥ thee; do thou impel the

Pitr̥s" in the evening. At the morning (Agnihotra), having cleansed upwards, he washes up the smearings on the darbha-grass with the palm turned upwards and facing east with the formula, "For plants thee, do thou impel the plants." Similarly, having cleansed downwards for the second time, he washes out on the darbha-grass towards the south with the sacred cord hanging on the right shoulder with the formula, "For Pitṛs thee; do thou impel the Pitrs." Having touched water, he consumes (the remnants) twice with the forefinger with the formula, "Progeny is the light." Having turned towards the north, he drinks with the ladle its handle being towards the east.  

III.7 

(With the mantras), "May this offering of mine be procreative, rich in ten heroic sons, rich in full numbers, for auspiciousness, with self as the gain, affording progeny, affording cattle, affording fearlessness, affording region, affording rains May Agni grant me ample offspring; do you, (O gods) place within us food, milk and semen virile; may (Agni) place within us abundance of prosperity, food and strength, svāhā" in the evening: "... may Sūrya grant me ample offspring" in the morning. Having cleansed and heated the ladle, and having filled it with water, he tosses the water towards the north with the formula, “Do thou gratify seven R̥ṣis, do thou impel seven R̥ṣis, svāhā to seven R̥ṣis." Thereby he gratifies the seven R̥ṣis. So the Brāhmaṇa says. To the rear of the Gārhapatya he pours down water with the formula, "Here I offer ambrosia into Vaiśvānara Agni, svāhā." With the formula, "I offer the inexhaustible oblation in inexhaustibility svāhā," he pours down water within the altar. After having made the (Agnihotra) offering he adds fuel to the fire for the enkindling of Brahman splendour; he pours down water; (thereby) he reproduces the form of Avabhr̥tha. So says the Brāhmaṇa.[^1]

AGNIHOTRA-PRAYERS III.8 

After the evening Agnihotra has been offered, the sacrificer having suspended the sacred cord over the left shoulder and having sipped water, standing on the sacrificer's seat, prays to the Āhavanīya with six verses, consecutively, “Let us approaching a sacrifice, utter a hymn to Agni who listens to us even from afar-After his ancient splendour, the bold ones have drawn the white milk from

[III. 8- III.8] 


the seer who wins a thousand-Agni is the head of the heaven, the height, lord of the earth. He quickens the seed of the waters-Here has he first been set up by the setters, the Hotr̥, the best sacrificer, to be invoked at the sacrifice, whom Apnavāna and the Bhr̥gus caused to shine, bright in the woods, spreading, from house to house-O Indra-Agni, I invoke you two; you two shall rejoice in the offering; you two, givers of food and wealth, I invoke you two for the winning of the strength. This is, O Agni, the natural birth-place, born of which thou hast shone. Mount it, O Agni, knowing it and make our wealth increase"[^1] With the subsequent six Āgnipāvamānī verses he again prays to the Āhavanīya, “O Agni, thou purifiest life; do thou give food and strength to us; do thou drive away ill-fortune-O Agni, good worker, do thou purify for us the glory in good heroes, giving abundance of wealth to me-O Agni, purifying with thy light, O god, with thy pleasant tongue, bring hither the gods and sacrifice-Do thou, O shining and purifying one, O Agni, bring hither the gods to our sacrifice and our oblation-Agni, of purest vows, pure sage, pure poet, shines in purity when offering is made- O Agni, thy pure bright flaming rays arise, thy lights, thy flames."[^1] He again prays to the Āhavanīya with the formula, "Thou art giver of life, O Agni, give me life. Thou art giver of radiance. O Agni, give me radiance. Thou art guardian of the body. O Agni, guard my body. O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body do thou make that good for me." He prays to the night with the formula, “O thou of various splendour, may I reach the end of thee in safety." He puts a firestick on the Āhavanīya fire with the verse, "Kindling thee, may we, full of radiance, strong, famous, having good heroes, kindle thee, giver of strength, giver of fame, infallible, and striker of the enemy, for a hundred years, O Agni, in the highest heaven, svāhā." Again he prays to the Āhavanīya with the formula, "Thou O Agni, hast attained the radiance of the sun, the praises of the R̥rṣis, thy beloved splendour. Thou, O Agni, hast the radiance of the sun; grant me life, radiance and offspring:"[^3]   


It is indeed said, "just as a person, horse, bull becomes old, similarly the set up fire becomes old. (Therefore the sacrificer) prays (to him) with Agnipāvamānī verses after a year. He (the sacrificer) prays to the Gārhapatya at the expiry of a year with Agnipāvamānī verses. Thereby he renders him new and ageless." So the Brāhmaṇa says. He prays to the residence and cattle with the mantras, "I gaze on offspring, offspring of Iḍā, connected with Manu; may they all be in our house-You are water; may I share your water. You are greatness; may I share your greatness. You are might; may I share your might. You are strength; may I share your strength-You wealthy ones, stay in this place, this fold, this dwelling, this birth-place. Do you be

May I prosper with your thousandfold[^5] He prays to the Gārhapatya with verses prosperity; may your wealth rest in me. having three and two pādas, "We come, O Agni, to thee that shinest in the darkness, everyday, praying homage with our devotion-Lord of the sacrifices, guardian of holy order, shining, waxing in his own house-O Agni, do thou become of easy access to us as a father to his son. Accompany us for our prosperity-O Agni, do thou be our nearest, our protector, auspicious and affording shelter-Thee, O shining and most radiant one, we implore for favour for our friends-O Agni, bright, of bright fame, come hither in thy greatest splendour and give us wealth."[^6] Then he prays to the residence and the cattle.

O bountiful one, thy divine gift is increased more and more.[^2]  

He prays to the Gārhapatya with the verse, "May we set thee around us, O Agni, the sage, the strong, as a fort, of daring hue, day by day destroyer of that which may be broken."[^2] He again prays to the Garhapatya with the formula "O Agni, lord of the house, through thee as the lord of the house mayest thou be a good lord of the house. For a thousand winters I invoke this blessing-bringing light for the race; I invoke this blessing-bringing light for N.N."[^3] (He repeats the last portion of the formula) as many times as sons are born to him; finally (he says) "for progeny."

is indeed said, “One who prays to Agni facing westwards, him Agni burns. One who prays outwards, becomes devoid of offspring and cattle. (Therefore), one should pray (while standing) a little crosswise." He prays standing a little crosswise (that becomes) not westwards, not outwards.  

PINDAPITRYAJÑA III.10  

(The sacrificer) who is going to perform the Piṇḍapitryajña procures sacrificial grass rooted out at one attempt, darbha-blades for strewing, paddy, winnowing basket, the mortar and pestle which are washed, a vessel together with a spoon and a corn-stirring stick, a mattress of eraka grass and pillow, ointment and collyrium, a fringe of a garment, wooden sword, water-pot and sacrificial implements. He strews around the Anvāhāryapacana fire. To its north he places one by one; the mattress of eraka and pillow, ointment and collyrium of eraka and pillow, ointment and collyrium, a fringe of garment, wooden sword, waterpot and sacrificial implements. Having suspended the cord over the right shoulder and having sat down to the rear of the Anvāhāryapacana, he pours out paddy in the vessel provided with the strainer with the formula, “I pour you out dear to the Pitr̥s" or without reciting it. Having filled the vessel more than half and having placed the mortar and pestle on the skin of a black antelope being used usually, he pounds (the paddy) only once, facing the south. Without winnowing the paddy, having poured water into the vessel across the strainer, having kept (the vessel) over the fire, he pours out the rice-grains into it across the strainer. He pours clarified butter (into the vessel being normally used). He keeps the clarified butter over the fire. Having moved fire around both (the vessels of rice and clarified butter) he cleanses the corn-stirring stick and the spoon. Having cooked the rice and having poured ghee over it, he takes it down towards the north. 

Having suspended the cord over the left shoulder and having added fuel to the Anvāhāryapacana, he offers three oblations with the corn-stirring stick thrusted (into the rice) in the eastern half of the southern half (of the fire) respectively with the formulas, "To Soma drunk by the Pitr̥s svadhā namaḥ svāhā, to Yama along with the Aṅgiras and Pitr̥s svadhā namaḥ svāhā, to Kavyavāhana Sviṣṭakr̥t. Agni svadḥā namaḥ svāhā.” Having put the corn-stirring stick (on the fire) without reciting any formula, having suspended the cord over the right shoulder, having dug out the ground by means of the wooden sword towards the south of the Anvāhāryapacana, having sprinkled (the ground), having spread the sacrificial grass with its tips towards the south, he sprinkles (the ground) with the formulas, "May the Pitr̥s be sprinkled, may the grandfathers be sprinkled, may the great grandfathers be

He then offers three rice-balls for which clarified butter has first been spread and on which clarified butter has been poured, with the formulas, "This to thee father N.N. and those who follow, this to the grand father N.N. and those who follow, this to thee great grandfather N.N. and those who follow."[^1] Having said, "Here, O Pitr̥s do you rejoice your shares"[^2] and having turned towards the north he awaits until the cease of the steam. They announce, "The steam has ceased." Then turning around, he smells rice.

With the verses, "The Pitr̥s who, common and harmonious, are in the kingdom of Yama, may the region belong to them, svadhā obeisance and offering may rest with gods-May the splendour of them who are kindred, harmonious, and my own breaths among the living beings, rest in me for a hundred years in this world."[^1] He sprinkles as before[^2] respectively with the formulas, "May the Pitr̥s be sprinkled, may the grandfathers be sprinkled, may the great grandfathers be sprinkled." Then he offers them collyrium respectively, "May the Pitr̥s be offered collyrium, may the grandfathers be offered collyrium, may the great grandfathers be offered collyrium." He offers ointments respectively, "May the Pitr̥s be anointed, may be grandfathers be anointed, may the great grand-fathers be anointed." He offers pieces of cloth respectively, "These O Pitr̥s are your pieces of cloth;, these O grandfathers, are your pieces of cloth, these O great grandfathers, are your pieces of cloth." If (the sacrificer is) in advanced age, he should pick up the hair on his body (and offer instead of the pieces of garment). So says the Brāhmaṇa.[^3]  

He prays with six Namaskāra formulas by reversal: “O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your Rasa, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you. O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your vigour, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you. O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your vitality, O Pitr̥s, obseisance to you, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your excitement, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you. O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your self-power, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you. O Pitr̥s, obeisance to your terror, O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you. O Pitr̥s, obeisance to you who are in that world, may they follow you, who are in this world, may they follow me. Those you who are in that world, may you become the most fortunate among them. Those who are in this world, may I become most fortunate among them."[^4] He asks for a heroic son with the formula,

“O Pitr̥s give me a heroic son, O grandfathers, give me a heroic son; O great grandfathers, give me a heroic son, may I be possessing Pitr̥s through you; may you be possessing good offspring through me." He then makes them rise with the verse, "Rise up, O brave Pitr̥s, proceed along the old path of Yama. Give unto us auspicious wealth, pronounce us, the sharers, unto the gods." He makes them depart together with the verse, “May the Pitr̥s go to their respective worlds with the speed of mind. Go away, O Somya Pitr̥s by the old secret paths; then join the gracious Pitr̥s who rejoice together with Yama."[^5] With three verses he invokes the mind, "We summon the mind hither with the praise of Narāśaṁsa and the reverence of the Pitr̥s-Let our mind return to us for vigour, for insight, for life, and that we may long see the sun-May the Pitr̥s restore mind to us; may the host of the gods, may we belong to the band of the living.[^6] At this stage he puts into the fire those rice-balls together with the sacrificial grass.

ĀGRAYANA SACRIFICE 
III.12 


(The sacrificer) proposes to perform the Āgrayaṇa sacrifice of Śyāmāka grains (Panicum fromentaceum). The Upavastha rite of it (the sacrifice) is as is known. On the (next) morning, after the Agnihotra has been offered, (the Adhvaryu) having strewn the Pr̥ṣṭhyā line and having carried forth the Praṇītā water pours out Śyāmāka grains for cooked grains to Soma. Having released speech with the call to the oblation-preparer, having melted clarified butter over the Gārhapatya, having purified it, and having taken up four spoonfuls into the ladle, he offers ajyānī oblations on the Āhavanīya with five verses, "(Obeisance) to the hundred weaponed, having a hundred powers, having a hundred aids, the overcomer of hostility, Indra, who is capable of leading us for a hundred years without any harm beyond all evils-O gods, do you all entrust us to that divinity (=Indra) who would lead us without any harm and loss along the four Devayāna paths which stretch differently between the heaven and the earth-May the summer, winter, and spring, autumn and the raining season be favourable to us. May we enjoy the favour

and protection of these seasons through a hundred years-Do you pay great honour to the Iduvatsara, Parivatsara and Saṁvatsara. In the good will of those who are worthy of sacrifice, may we long be harmless and unsmitten. —O gods, lead us from good to better. May we, O drop attain thee through thy aid (that is, by partaking of thee). Do thou wonder-working enter us. Be propitious and kindly to our children and to myself."[^1] Having cooked the grains, he places them (within the altar). For this, (sacrifice) there are fifteen Sāmidhenī verses, five Prayājas and Vārtraghna Ājāyabhāgas. The puronuvākhyā yājyā for the principal offering are respectively a pyāyasva....[^2] and sam te....[^2] The puronuvakya-yājyā for the Sviṣṭakr̥t-offering are in Triṣṭubh metre. Having deposited the Anvāhārya-rice (within the altar, the sacrificer) gives away a piece of cloth (as Dakṣiṇā). He consumes the sacrificer's portion (of the oblation) with the verse, "May Agni consume first; he knew the oblation. May he friendly to all make the plants auspicious to us."[^3] This Iṣṭi comes to an end with the pouring down of the Praṇītā water and the Viṣṇu strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his vow.  


In the autumn he proposes to perform the Āgrayaṇa sacrifice of paddy. The Upavasatha of the sacrifice is well known. In the morning after he has offered the Agnihotra, the Adhvaryu, having strewn the Pr̥ṣṭhya line, and having carried forth the Praṇītā water, pours out (paddy for a cake) on twelve potsherds for Indra-Agni, rice for Viśve Devas and (a cake) on one potsherd for Dyāvāpr̥thivī. Having released speech with the call to the oblation-preparer, having melted clarified butter over the Gārhapatya, having purified it and having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle, he makes five ajyānī offerings on the Āhavanīya with the verses "(Obeisance) to thee hundred-weaponed..."[^4] Having cooked, he deposits (the oblations within the altar). For this (Iṣṭi) there are fifteen Sāmidhenī verses, five Prayājas and Vārtraghna Ājyabhāgas. (The puronovākyā - yājyās) of the principal oblations are respectively: indrāgni rocanā divaḥ....[^5] and śnathad vr̥tram...[^5] for (the oblation to) Indra-Agni; viśve devā r̥tāvr̥dha....[^6] and viśve devāḥ śr̥ṇute' mam....[^6] for Viśve Devāḥ, dyāvā naḥ pr̥thivī....[^7] and pra pūrvaje pitarā....? for Dyāvāprithivi. The puronuvakyāyājās for the Sviṣṭakr̥t offering are in Triṣṭubh metre. Having deposited the Anvāhārya rice (within the altar, the sacrificer) gives away a calf first born (during the year as Dakṣiṇā). He then consumes the sacrificer's portion with the verse, “O gods, lead

Be propitious and kindly to our children and to myself."[^8] This Iṣṭi comes to an end with the pouring down of the Praṇīta-water and Viṣṇu-strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his vow.  

In the spring (the sacrificer) proposes to perform the Āgrayaṇa of barley. The Upavasatha of that (Iṣṭi) is well known. The procedure is similar to that of the Āgrayaṇa of paddy. This much is different: (The sacrificer) consumes the sacrificer's portion with the verse, "The gods ploughed for Manu. This barley mixed with the sweetness of Sarasvatī. Indra, the hundred-powered, was the lord of the plough. Maruts, giving richly were the ploughers."[^9] This Iṣṭi comes to an end with the pouring down of the Pūrṇapātra (within the altar) and the Viṣṇu-strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his vow.  


PRAYERS DURING JOURNEY III.13 

(The sacrificer who) is going away from his fires, suspending his cord over the left shoulder, having sipped water, having gone around along the front of the Āhavaniya, standing on the sacrificer's seat prays to the Ahavaniya with the verse, “O Jātavedas, do you bear until I return, the name which first my father and mother bestowed upon me; O Agni, may I bear thy name." Restraining his speech, he starts. Going away from the fires, he releases his speech. Sleeping on ground, not eating flesh, not approaching his wife, he goes on journey. He does not stay away beyond the twelfth day (of fortnight). he does not allow to pass the Upavastha-day while in journey. While returning he collects fire-sticks on the way. Gazing at his fires from far away, he restrains speech. He prays to the Ahavaniya with the verse, “My name and thine, O Jātavedas, which we bear like man changing garments, let us exchange again-thou for food and we to live." 
He prays to the Gārhapatya with the verse, “Obeisance to Agni the unpierced, obeisance to unapproachable, obeisance to the ruler. Agni is irresistible, very powerful, all conquering, assailing, the best Gandharva." He prays to the Anvāhāryapacana with the verse, "O Agni, gods have thee for the father, they offer oblations to thee and have thee as an umpire. Do thou endow me with life, with lordship of cattle, and bestow on me good fortune." He prays to the Ahavaniya.

(With the verse) “Agni here is the best of all; he is most adorable; most ready to win us a thousand, may all good strength be to him." If he is informed about the failure in ritual-practice that one did not offer your Agnihotra, he, having melted clarified butter on the Gārhapatya and having purified it, having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle, offers on the Ahavaniya a connecting offering (Samtani) with the verse, "May the adorable light rejoice in clarified butter. May it (the light=Agni) join this broken sacrifice. The mornings and evenings which were sought for offering, I join them with ghee as the oblation, svaha. 
He pours out (paddy) for a cake on eight potshards for Tantument Agni. (The sacrificer) gives away a panful (of grains as Dakṣiņā). The Isți comes to a conclusion in the established manner. Then he offers the transgressed Agnihotra-oblations. The ancient ritualists, desirous of maintaining holy order, desiring lustre, glory and brahman-splendour used to pray in this way. This has (now) gone out of practice on account of the heaviness of the vow. Therefore, (one should observe) the Vairāja prayers. (He prays) to the Gārhapatya with the formula, “O manly (Agni) do thou guard my offspring...", to the Anvāhāryapacana with the formula, “O Atharva, do thouguard my nourishment...", to the Ahavaniya with the formula, “Opraiserworthy Agni, do thou guard my cattle....", to the Sabhya with the formula, "O spreading wide, do thou guard my meeting place....", to the Avasathiya with the formula, "O Ahi Budhniya, do thou guard my prayer." He goes away for an indefinite period. While returning back he collects fire-sticks on the way. Having witnessed the fires at a distance, he restrains his speech. Having returned, he prays with these (Virājakrama formulas) only. The expiation (for non-offering because of journey) is similar.

(With the verse) "By the Yajus I pour on thee offspring, life and wealth. Instigated by Bṛhaspati may the sacrificer here come to no harm." He follows the spilt out portion with "Svāhā to Bhupati, Svāhā to Bhuvanapati, Svāhā to lord of Bhūtas." He proceeds with whatever (clarified butter) might have been left. He causes the sacrificer to gaze at the clarified butter with the formula, "Thou art butter; thou art truth, thou art the overseer of the truth; thou art the oblation of Vaiśvānara Agni, of Viśve Devas, with pure strength, of true might. Thou art power, overpowering. Overpower hostility; overpower those who practicse hostility, over- power enmity, overpower those who practise enmity. Thou art of thousandfold strength; do thou quicken me. Thou art the butter of butter; thou art the truth of truth, thou hast true life; thou hast true strength; with truth I besprinkle thee. May I share thee that art such. (The sacrificer) follows each portion of clarified butter as it is taken up-that in the Juhû with the four formulas, “I take thee for the control and holding of the five winds, I take thee for the control and holding of the five seasons, I take thee for the control and holding of the five directions, I take thee for the control and holding of the five people." In the Upabhṛt with the eight formulas, "I take thee for the control and holding of the sky having five cavities; I take thee for the control and holding of the splendour of a brāhmaṇa, I take thee for the control and holding of the valour of Ksatriya, I take thee for the control and I take holding of the subjects, I take thee for braveness, I take thee for good progeny, thee for prosperity; I take thee for the Brahman splendour." In the Dhruva-ladle with the four formulas, "The earth (is) ours; the oblation (is) of gods; the benediction (is) of the sacrificer. I take thee for the divinities of gods." He follows (the Dhruvā) being filled (with clarified butter) with the formula. "I take thee for (the fulfilment of my) desire." 
He follows the enclosing sticks being laid around-the middle one with the formula, "Thou art firm; may I become firm among the kinsmen, intelligent, wise and winning wealth." The southern one with the formula, "Thou art mighty; may I become mighty among the kinsmen, intelligent, wise and winning wealth. The northern one with the formula, "Thou art overcoming, may I be overcoming among the kinsmen; intelligent, wise and winning wealth," He joins them with the Yoga formula, "I yoke thee with the divine Brahman to bear this oblation, O wise one. While the two fire-sticks are being kept erect, he murmurs the verse, "Kindling thee, may we live long with good offspring, good heroes and preventing thee tribute. He recites over the oblations being deposited within the altar the verse, "Whatever O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled, whatever of the clarified butter, O Visnu, may be spilt, therewith do I smite the rival who is hard to slay. I place him on the lap of Nirṛti.'

"One should keep down the Agnihotra (ladle filled with milk) with the Vyahṛtis, bhur, bhuvaḥ suvaḥ. Agnihotra indeed is the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyāhṛtis indeed are the Brahman; he (thereby) places the Brahman in the mouth of sacrifice. He should keep it down with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. (Thereby) he enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman." So says the Brāhmaṇa. Thus indeed (the Brāhmaṇa) goes, "One who is performing the Full-moon or New- moon sacrifice should deposit the oblations with these Vyahṛtis. The Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices are indeed the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyahrtis are the Brahman. He places the Brahman into the mouth of sacrifice. He should deposit (the oblations) with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. He enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman." So says the Brāhmaṇa. Thus, indeed (the Brahmana) goes, "One who is performing the Caturmasyas should deposit the oblations with these Vyahṛtis; the Caturmasyas indeed are the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyāhṛtis are the Brahman. He places the Brahman in the mouth of sacrifice. He should deposit (the oblations) with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. He enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman." So says the Brahmana. Thus, indeed (the Brāhmaṇa) goes, "Whatever of the sacrifice is done with the Saman, the blessing of the sacrifice goes to the ruling class; whatever with Rk, the blessing of the sacrifice goes to the Vis. (Consequently) a Brāhmaṇa performs a blessingless sacrifice. 
"(The Hot who) is going to recite the Samidheni verses should first utter these Vyahṛtis. (Thus), he makes a beginning with Brāhmaṇa. Therebya Brāhmaṇa performs a blessingful sacrifice." So says the Brāhmaṇa. "(The Brāhmaṇa) indeed goes: "In the sacrifice of sacrificer about whom (the Hotr) desires that the blessing of his sacrifice may go to his enemy, he should join the Vyahṛtis to the puronuvākyā. The puronuvākyā has the enemy for its deity. The blessing of his sacrifice goes to the enemy" So says the Brahmana. In the sacrifices of those sacrificers about whom (the Hotṛ) desires that the blessings of the sacrifice should equally go to them, he should insert the first of the Vyāhṛtis after the half verse of the puronuvākyā, the second at the beginning of the yājyā, and the third after the half verse of the yājyā. Thereby the blessing of the sacrifice equally goes to them. So says the Brahmana, (The Brāhmaṇa) indeed goes, “Just as a cloud rains abundantly, so a sacrifice pours for the sacrificer. Water is enfolded by ground. The sacrificer enfolds the sacrifice by the blessing." So says the Brahmaṇa. (The Hot) commences (the sacrifice) of a brāhmaṇa with Vyāhṛtis, of a Rājanya with Himkāra; of a Vaišya with the Rk. All these three should be adopted; this is another view. (The sacrificer) follows the faggot being put (on the Ahavaniya).

(The Brāhmaṇa) indeed goes "Whoever, having commenced a sacrifice does not release it, becomes unstable. Whoever joins you, let him release you." So it is. At the proper time (the sacrificer) disintegrates the potsherds with the verse, "The potsherds which wise men collect for the cauldron, these are in Püsan's guardian- ship. Let Indra and Vayu set them free."1 Having returned by the same route by which he had gone, and having sat down on the sacrificer's seat, he sips water across the strainers in the same manner with the verse, "The plants are full of sap, the sap of creepers is full of sap. O Indra, do thou unite me with that sap which is of the sap of water.'

He puts fire-sticks on the Ähavaniya with the formula, "O Agni, lord of vow, I have observed the vow; I have been capable of it, it has flourished for me, svaha.”4 Having stood up, he murmurs the formula "The re-acceptance of the sacrificer," namely, "The sacrifice has become, it has come into being. It has been born; it has waxed great. It has become the overlord of the gods, may it make us overlords; may we be lords of wealth." Stepping towards the east, he murmurs the verse, "Rich in

The sacrificer chooses him as the Brahman with the formula, "O lord of the earth, lord of the mid-region, lord of the heaven, we choose thee as the Brahman, a priest for a Soma-sacrifice through which gods and Angiras reached the highest heaven.” 
The Brahman who is chosen murmurs the formula, "I am the lord of the earth, lord of the mid-region, lord of the heaven. Impelled by god Savitṛ, I shall officiate as a priest.

With two verses he receives Agni within, "I receive Agni within me for the abundance of wealth, good offspring and good valour. I hold offspring and strength within me. May we be uninjured in our persons and rich in brave sons--O Pitrs, Agni the immortal who has entered the hearts of us the mortals, we receive him within us, may he not go away leaving us." He enters (the sacrifical hall) inbetween the altar and the rubbishheap with the formula, "I resort to truth, I resort to the cosmic order, I resort to the immortal, I resort to Prajapati's dear and harmless body. I trample down with the fifteenfold thunderbolt the enemy who hates us and whom we hate. Bhür Bhuvaḥ Suvaḥ, I stand in Visnu's place." He stands tresspassing the northern border of the altar with the right forefoot.

formula, "Paravasu is removed." Having touched water and having put a darbha- blade, he sits (on the seat) with the formula, "Here I sit on the seat of Arvāvasu” with his right leg on the left thigh. Turning by the right he gazes at the Garhapatya with the formula, "O Viśvakarmna, thou art the protector of body; do thou protect my body." He gazes at both the fires (Gārhapatya) and Ahavaniya with the formula, "O Agni-Viṣņu, let me not tresspass you, split asunder the profane power, do not afflict me; O makers of the world, make me a world." With the formula, "This is your world" he moves a little northwards. He murmurs three verses; “O Viśve Devas, do you guide me how and what I may mind after having sat down here as the chosen Hotṛ. Do you pronounce my success about the path along which I may convey the oblation to you.' 
-Now I proclaim that main speech with which we may attack the Asuras. O five people, consumers of food and worthy of sacrifice, do you approve of my pristhood." --Obeisance to the great; obeisance to the small, obeisance to the young, obeisance to the old. We shall make offerings to gods provided we are enabled to do so. May I not be deprived of the praise of the venerable deity.

After having caused the Adhvaryu to take up the two ladles with the srugādāpana formula, he recites the yājyās for the offerings in accordance with the deity. The consecration-formula for the Vașat-utterance (is): "O Vasaṭkāra, do not ruin me; may I not ruin thee; I invoke the mind with speech, the vital breaths with Mātariśvan; do thou not (ruin) my speech;13 I carry the oblation towards the gods; power is strength; speech is power and strength." If the Vasat-utterances are uninterrupted, he should follows them with this much, "Power is strength; speech is power." (The Adhvaryu) anoints (the Hotṛ's) finger at two (phalanxes). What is anointed first, he moves upwards on the upper lip with the formula, "(The oblation) offered to Vācaspati I consume for food and Prāņa.” He moves (the clarified butter applied to the second phalanx) downwards upon the lower lip with the formula, "Offered to Sadasaspati I consume for strength and Apana." Having touched water, he causes (the Adhvaryu) to give the intermediate Iḍã in four portions on extended palm with not closed (fingers). He invokes the Iḍā(held) at the height of his mouth.

If he is going to consume the entire Iḍā, after having consumed the portions placed on his palm, he should consume it from the Iḍa-goblet itself. If he desires to give it (to somebody) or to retain, he should consume after having cut the part of the cake with the formula, "Thou art Iḍā; thou art giving happiness. Do thou retain us in prosperity and with good offspring. I consume thee for the power of the face and fragrance of mouth." Having consumed (the Iḍā) and having sipped water, he pours down a line of water towards the east or north without reciting any formula. This is the view of Ajya." He murmurs this verse. “(O Agni), may the remarkable brilliance enjoy the clarified butter. May it join this disintegrated sacrifice. May the Viśve Devas rejoice here.” After having recited the Anŭyaja-vājyās and having pronounced the Samyuvāka, he removes the deficiency by folding hands over the sacrificial grass with the formula, “O sacrifice, be auspicious to me; be along with me O Prajapati, O sacrifice I leave unto Prajapati whatever rite of thine is deficient and whatever is excessive.” Having deposited the Veda into the southern half of the altar, he makes the sacrificer recite.

Thou art deed; thou art means of deed; may I do holy act. Thou art gift, thou art giver, may I give it. May Veda give me prosperity consisting of ghee, residence, counted in thousands and food."

Thou art deed, thou art means of deed, may I do holy act. Thou art gift, thou art giver, may I give it. May Veda give me prosperity consisting of ghee, residence, counted in thousands, and food." Having loosened the Veda, he hands over half of it to the sacrificer's wife. She puts it between her thighs or holds by the side of her right thigh. Turning towards the east2 (the Hotṛ) goes on spreading the other half with the verse, “O Agni, spreading the line, do thou follow the Sun from the region. Do thou guard the brilliant paths prepared with (good) intention. May Agni render the act of the worshippers faultless. Do thou be thinking and create divine being."

CHAPTER- IV 
THE ANIMAL-SACRIFICE 
IV.1 
(The sacrificer) proposes to perform an animal-sacrifice. He procures enclosing sticks of Acasia catechu, Bdellium, fragrant substance, white wool between the horns of a goat, two cords-one with two strands and another with three strands, two omentum-bakers--one one-pronged and another two-pronged, a heart-spike, enclosing sticks of Gmelina arborea, Maitrāvaruņa's staff made of Ficus glomerata as high as the mouth, sacrificial grass and faggot, faggot for carrying forth (fire), a twig of ficus infectoria, a board for cutting animal-organs, barley-grains for water mixed with barley-grains, flour of parched barley for offering of the same, curds for clotted clarified butter and gold. Now after having performed the New-moon sacrifice or one on an (auspicious) constellation, after having melted clarified butter over the Garhapatya fire, having purified it, having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle and having mentally gone over the Saddhotr formula, (the Adhvaryu) makes an offering on the Ahavaniya fire with svāhā while the sacrificer has contacted him. Having taken up another four spoonfuls, he offers an oblation pertaining to the sacrificial post with the verse, "O Viṣņu, do thou bestride wide. Make a wide (provision) for our residence. Do thou, who hast ghee as thy birth-place, drink ghee and increase the lord of sacrifice." Having taken up another four spoonfuls (in the ladle), he asks for a vessel of clarified butter together with a spoon, sacrificial grass, (a piece of) gold and a pot filled with water. They call out the wood-cutter holding an axe. He says, "O sacrificer, do you come along." 
.2 
Having gone out by the eastern door they move towards that direction where (a tree suitable for) the sacrificial post is visible or where he thinks he may come across one. He prays to that tree which is grown on level ground independently, which has many leaves, many branches, with undried tip and bent towards the west with the formula, "I have passed over other (trees), I have not approached other (trees). I have come across thee nearer than the distant ones, distant than the He inferior ones. I welcome thee that belongest to Visnu for the sacrifice to gods. besmears it with clarified butter with the formula, “May god Savity besmear thee with honey." With the formula, "O plant, do thou guard him," he holds erect a darbha-blade with its tip upwards alongside the tree. He strikes it across with the axe with the formula, "O axe, do thou not injure him." He preserves knowingly the first chip which falls down. (The wood-cutter) cuts (the tree) without allowing it to crack around and in such a way that its stump would not clash with the axle (of a cart),

(The Adhvaryu) follows the tree falling down towards the east or north with the formula, “Do thou not scratch the sky with the top; do thou not injure the mid- region with middle portion; do thou be united with the earth." Having kept a piece of gold on the stump (of the tree) and having strewn it around with darbha-blades, he offers clarified butter with the formula, “O tree, do thou grow with a hundred shoots." He touches himself with the formula, "May we grow in a thousand shoots." He chops off the branches towards the top with the verse, "Do thou whom this sharp axe has brought forward for great good fortune." One should cut the post measuring five aratnis.* This is the shortest among the posts of different lengths mentioned in the Brahmana." He cuts off at the spot where the cașăla is to be set, that post whose maximum (circumference) is of the embrace and minimum of the measure of a span with the formula, "May the wealth consisting of brave sons be uninterrupted.'

Āgnīdhra carries away (the Stambayajus) three times. When the Ägnidhra carries three times, then the Adhvaryu calls for the wooden sword, a pot full of water, sacrificial grass and the yoke-halter. Having taken all this, he says, “Do you come O sacrificer." Having dug out by means of the wooden sword towards the north of the altar at a distance of two or three Prakramas, and having sprinkled water over it, he measures out the catvāla by means of the yoke-halter. With the formula, "Thou art the abode of possessions for me' he draws a line in front, inside the yoke-halter held with its thick end towards the north. With the formula, "Thou art the resort of the afflicted for me," he draws a line towards the south inside the yoke-halter held with the thick end towards the east. With the formula, “Do thou guard me when in want," he draws a line towards the west inside the yoke-halter held with its thick end towards the north. With the formula, "Do thou guard me when afflicted,' he draws a line towards the north inside the yoke-halter held with its thick end towards the east. Having kept a darbha-blade on the cātvāla, he hits at it by means of the wooden sword with the formula, "May Agni, named Nabhas know thee, O Angiras Agni, thou who art on this earth." He take it up with the formula, "Do thou come with (Agni) named Ayus. Having carried it over, he puts it down on the Uttaravedi with the formula, "I place thee with whatever name of thine invincible and worthy of sacrifice."

He draws around a line with it for the hole for the sacrificial post in such a way that (the post) would be half within the altar and half outside, with the formula, “A line is drawn around the Rakṣas, a line is drawn around the evil spirits; here do I cut the neck of the Raksas; here do I cut the neck of one who hates us and whom we

He (the Agnidhra) himself digs out or causes it to be dug out. While the Adhvaryu is in action, the Pratiprasthātṛ puts (on fire) the faggot to be carried forth. Supporting earth is collected from the catvāla. The Adhvaryu himself takes up the Prokṣaṇi water with the formula beginning with the word indraghosa. He hands over to an assistant (a ladle filled with) five spoonfuls of clarified butter. The required materials are with the Brahman. Then (the Adhvaryu) gives out the call, "Do you (O Hotr) recite the verses for the fire being carried forth, O Agnidh, do thoufollow with a line drawn with the wooden sword." After (the first verse) has been uttered thrice, the fire is lifted up. They follow the Hotṛ. They move along the north of the altar. The fire is held up while the Adhvaryu sprinkles the Uttaravedi with Prokṣaṇī- water sanctified with the formulas begining with the word indraghoṣa.

It is reasonable to understand the word prādeśamātrim as denoting the height of the Uttaravedi, Bhavasvamin and the author of the commentary subodhini on the BaudhŚS relate this word to the Uttaranābhi. The subodhini, however, cites a view according to which the word denotes the height. I find this view as reasonable, and have given the translation accordingly. No other Sutra-text has spoken about the height of the Uttaravedi.

Here the highest step of wide going and mighty Vişņu shines-Do you behold the deeds of Viṣņu in which he-Indra's trustworthy post with the friend, saw the holy laws." When he adjusts the Agnistha edge of the Ähavaniya, he causes the sacrificer to gaze at the casala of the post which is now fixed firmly with the verse, "The singers always gaze upon that highest abode of Vişņu like an eye stretched in the heaven." Then he piles it round by the right with the earth with the formula,” I pile thee round, the winner of the Brahmanhood, the winner of the Ksatriyahood, the winner of good progeny and the winner of abundance of wealth." He presses (the earth) with the Maitrāvaruņa's staff with the formula, “Do thou strengthen the Brahman; do thou strengthen the Ksatra; do thou strengthen the progeny, do thou strengthen the abundance of wealth." Having buried around (the post) neither less nor more and having poured down the pot filled with water, and making into three parts the cord of three strands, while winding around with the middle part at the height of the navel, he says (to the Hotr), "Do you recite verses for the post being wound round." He winds around three times by the right with the formula, "Thou art wound round, may the divine subjects wind thee; may increase of wealth, may men wind round the sacrificer. He twists (the two ends of) the cord close (to the windings) and intertwines (the two ends) up to the end. He inserts the bigger end into the smaller one. Towards the north of the Agnistha edge he fixes the Svaru into the middle winding with the formula, “I conceal thee on the top of the mid-region." The sacrificer leaves (the contact of) the post after the Svaru has been fixed in.

Having brought in the washed animal between the Catvāla and the rubbish heap, (the Adhvaryu) makes him stand in front of the post facing the west. Taking two darbha-blades with the formula, "For food thee", he formally dedicates him with the formula, "Thou art approaching; the divine subjects have come to the gods, conveyors of oblations, ardent; O Bṛhaspati, do thou support the wealth; may the oblations be agreeable to thee; O Tvastr, do thou glorify our possessions, Orich (cows), do you remain here being generated by Prajapati.

Caland, the editor of the Sūtra-text is right when he reads the sutra-samdadhāti dharṣā mānuṣān iti, and further deems niyunakti as a single-worded sutra. As a matter of fact, joining of two cords-one of the post and the other of the animal itself means the fastening of the animal. The next single-worded sūtra must be regarded mainly as an explanatory repetition, BhārŠS, ApsS etc, have connected dharṣā mānuṣān with niyunakti.

the verses pertaining to the drops have been enclosed," after the omentum has been baked, having taken the Juhu and Upabhṛt ladles, having crossed the altar (towards the south) and having caused to announce, (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Maitrāvaruņa)," Do you direct the Hour to recite the yājyā for Svāhākṛtis." He makes the offering at the Vasat-utterance. Having crossed towards the north and having poured the drop (of clarified butter from the Juhu) over the Pṛṣadājya, he pours clarified butter over the omentum. Having spread clarified butter (into the Juhu) twice with the spoon, while seizing the omentum, he says (to the Maiträvaruņa)," Do you recite the puronuväkyä relating to the offering of the fat-the omentum of the goat set forth for Indra-Agni." There should be twice pouring over the oblation. Having crossed the altar and having caused to an- nounce, he says (to the Maitrāvaruņa), “Do you direct the Hoty to recite the yājyā for the offering of the fat-the omentum of the goat set forth for Indra-Agni." Prior to the offering to Svāhākṛtis, he offers a spoonful with the formula, “Svāhā to gods." At the Vaṣat-utterance he offers the omentum with the verse, "O Jātavedas (Agni), do thou go with the omentum to the gods, for thou art the first Hotṛ. Do you strengthen their bodies with clarified butter. May the gods eat the oblation offered to the accompaniment of Svähä-utterance."" Subsequent to the offering to Svähäkrți, he offers a spoonful with "To gods Svähā." He throws the two forks into the fire-the two-pronged one pointing towards the east and the single-pronged one pointing towards the west with the formula, "Svāhā, do you two go to Urdhvanabhasa, the son of Maruts." He puts drops (of clarified butter) over them.

Having crossed towards the north and having kept the two ladles at their places, having stepped up, they sprinkle themselves with water at the catvala. They call the Brahman, they call the Pratiprasthātṛ, they call the Prasästṛ, they call the Agnidhra. (The Adhvaryu says) "Come, O sacrificer." (All of these sprinkle themselves) with the verses, “O waters, do you wash off what is impure and dirty. what I have disliked as untruth and what I have sworn in as harmless-I relieve myself of the curse of Varuna, of Yama's fetters, of all sins against gods, of the sin against men.” (Each one) takes water in folded palms with the formula, "May the waters and plants be friendly towards me. 'He throws (that water) in that direction towards which one whom he hates lives, with the formula, "Let them be unfriendly to him who hates us and whom we hate."

(The Adhvaryu) gives out the call, “O Agnidh, do thou pour out (paddyfor) the cake pertaining to the animal; O Pratiprasthätṛ, give instructions with regard to the animal." The Agnidhra pours out (paddy for) the cake on eleven potsherds for Indra-Agni. The Pratiprasthätṛ gives instructions with regard to the animal, “O Śamitr, do thou keep together the heart, tongue and sternum; keep together the liver and lungs; keep the left forearm separately; keep the two thoracic walls separately, keep the right buttock and testis with penis (together); the right forearm, left buttock and thinner portion of the rectum and anus-keep these three parts (together); keep the large intestime and supine part of the tail together; prepare ample broth, stir (the organs of) the animal three times; of (the organs of) the animal retain the heart uppermost." 
After (the organs of) the animal have been cooked, (the Adhvaryu) asks for the cake pertaining to the animal. Having taken it down, he keeps it within the altar after clarified butter has been first spread and after clarified butter has been poured over. Then while spreading clarified butter into the Juhû and Upabhṛt, he says (to the Maitrāvaruņa), "Do you recite the puronuväkyä for the cake being cut out for Indra-Agni." Having first taken portion from the eastern half, he takes portion from the rear half. He pours (clarified butter). He anoints back (the cake). He takes portion once from the northern half for the Svistakṛt offering in the Upabhṛt. He pours 
clarified butter (over it) twice. He does not anoint back. Having crossed (the altar) and having caused to announce, he says (to the Maiträvaruṇa) "Do you direct (the Hotr) to recite the yājyä for the cake set forth for Indra-Agni.” He makes the offering at the Vașat-utterance. While taking into the Juhu the oblation from the Upabhṛt, he says to the Maitrāvaruṇa, "Do you recite the puronuväkyä for Agni.“ Having caused to announce, he says, "Do you direct (the Hot) to recite the yājyä for Agni." At the Vasat-utterance he makes the offering in the eastern part of the northern half transgressing the earlier offerings. Having placed the ladles in their places, and having cut up the Präšitra, he takes up the Iḍa. After the Ida has been invoked, he gives six portions to the Agnidhra. The priests consume (their respective portions and Iḍā), and sprinkle themselves. (The Adhvaryu) gives out the call, “O Agnidh, do thou deposit Uttarabarhis; O Pratiprasthātṛ, do you converse with regard to (the cooked organs of) the animal."The Agnidhra fixes the wooden plank for cutting flesh on the twig of a Plakṣa tree. It is called Uttarabarhis. 
The Pratiprasthätṛ, having dipped the spoon into the Pṛsadājya, having taken it into the Juhu and having gone out towards the north between the catvāla and the rubbish-heap, enquires: "Is the oblation cooked, O Samitṛ?” The Samitṛ stands towards the north holding the heart-spike. “(The oblation) is cooked," he replies stepping forward.

Taking the heart-spike from the Samity, having pricked the heart with it, and having handed it over to the Samity, he pours Pṛṣadājya over it with the verse, "Let thy mind (be united) with the mind (ofgods); let thy breath with breath.

Embers for Upayajs are brought from the Samitra fire; (the Adhvaryu) pours them down in front of the Hotṛ. The offerer of the Upayajs sits down taking one third part of the rectum with anus. The Adhvaryu having dipped the spoon into the Pṛṣadājya, having taken it into the Juhu, having crossed (the altar) and having caused to announce, says to the Maitrāvaruņa, “Do you direct (the Hotṛ to recite the yājyä) for the gods." He makes the offering at the Vasat-utterance. (Subsequently he says) "Do you direct", "Do you direct." Similarly the offerer of the Upayajs makes offering of each piece of rectum with anus with the eleven formulas beginning with "Do thou go to the occan svāhā." With the formula, "Do thou go to Vaiśvānara Agni, svähä” he finally puts into the fire the remaining portion. He cleanses his hands on the Barhis with the formula, "To the waters thee, to the plants thee; do thou grant me mind and heart." He gazes at its smoke with the formula, "May I acquire body, skin, son and grandson." Having crossed towards the north and having put the Svaru into the Juhū, he offers it standing to the east and facing the west, with the formula, "Let thy smoke go to the heaven, the flame to the midregion; do thou fill in the earth with ashes, svähā."

VAIŠVADEVAPARVAN V.I 
(One who) is going to offer the Vaiśvadeva-oblations (should do so) on the full- moon day of Phalguna or Caitra. Some say that one should do so under the specific constellation. One should offer them in the northern course of the sun in the bright half of the month on an auspicious day. He procures a three-striped quill of a porcupine, an iron-razor, four sets of potsherds for cakes, four cooking vessels, as many corn-stirring sticks, two (pots of) milk, curds for Prṣadājva and for curdling, sacrificial grass tied up in three bundles which are again fastened in one bundle and a Prastara of darbha-grass with tuft. 
On the Upavasatha-day (the Adhvaryu) performs the Årambhaniyā Işti com- prising two oblations-a cake on twelve potsherds to Vaisvänara Agni and cooked rice to Parjanya. The Iști comes to a conclusion in the prescribed manner. This day the calves are separated from their mothers for the oblation to Viśve Devas. Having caused the milk to be milked for the oblation to Viśve Devas (the sacrificer) observes the vow following the procedure applied in the case of Samnayyal or without reciting any formula. 
After he has offered the Agnihotra, the Adhwaryu, prior to the carrying forth of Pranita-waters, having melted ghee over the Garhaparya and having purified it, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, having mentally gone along the Pafcahotr formula, makes an offering on the Ahavaniya with Svähä-utterance while the sacrificer has contacted him. Having strewn the Prsthya line and having carried forth water, he pours (paddy for a cake on) eight potsherds to Agni, rice to Soma, a cake on twelve potsherds to Savity, rice to Sarasvant, rice to Püşan, a cake on seven potsherds to Maruts, Amikṣă (coagulated milk) to Viśve Devas and a cake on one potsherd to Dyäväpṛthivi. (The sacrificer) releases speech at the call to the preparer of oblation-material. The ritual up to the pouring of rice-grains on the lower crushing stone is similar. Having poured (the rice-grains), be lays down eight potsherds in the southern half of the Garhapatya fire-place. In the northern side he puts over fire a vessel for cooked rice to Soma after having poured into it water across the strainers. Towards the north he lays down twelve potsherds for the cake to Savity. Towards the north he puts over fire vessels for rice to Sarasvant and Püsan after having poured into them water across the strainers. To the north he lays down

seven potsherds for the cake to Maruts. Towards the north he puts over the fire a vessel for preparing Âmikṣä after having poured into it milk across the strainers. To the north he lays down a potsherd for the cake to Dyaväpṛthivi. Fuel is put around the potsherds and under the cooking vessels. Having poured the flour which has been obtained by crushing into the pan, and having mixed it with water, he puts on eight potsherds (the dough) for Agni. He pours (rice-grains) for cooked rice to Soma across the strainers. He places on twelve potsherds (the dough) for the cake to Savity. He pours (into the vessels) rice-grains for cooked rice to Sarasvant and Pūşan. He places (dough) for the cake on seven potsherds to Maruts. He pours curds across the strainers into the hot milk. Some expert, having cooked it by adding fuel around and having rendered it free from whey, keeps it in a cool place. Then he keeps (the dough of) the cake on one potsherd for Dyäväpṛthivi. After having made the cakes catch the crust, having baked, having taken down, having gone to the east, having poured down (the wash-water for the Apyas, he carries the Stambayajus.

(The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍāsika Brahmana. (The Adhvarvu carried the stambayajus) three times with the formula and the fourth time without reciting any formula. He does the first tracing (of the altar). He murmurs the Karana formula.2 He digs out (the altar). From the dug out part the Agnidhra carries (the earth) three times. When the Agnidhra carries earth three times, the Adhvaryu, having done the second tracing out, having made the ground firm, having stuck the wooden sword crosswise, gives out the call, “Do thou (O Ágnïdhra) put down the Prokṣaṇi-water, keep ready the faggot and sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and the ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prsadajya-ladle silently. wind the girdle round (the waist of) the sacrificer's wife, and come up with the clarified butter and curds." After he has brought the Proksani-water, having cleansed and thrown the wooden sword, having kept near the faggot and the sacrificial grass, turning by the right and hastening towards the west, the Âgnidhra cleanses the spoon and ladles (with formulas) and the Prsadajya-ladle silently. After the Agnidhra has wound the girdle round the waist of the sacrificer's wife and after he has come up with clarified butter and curds, the Adhvaryu, having purified the clarified butter and the Prokṣani-water, having taken up clarified butter into the ladles in the prescribed manner together with the Prṣadajya, stands up with Prokṣaṇi-water in hand.

After four months he proposes to sacrifice with Varuṇapraghasa oblations. He procures a three-stripped quill of a porcupine, a razor of black iron, four sets of potsherds, five vessels for cooking rice, as many corn-stirring sticks, milk in two (pots), curds for Pṛṣadājya and for coagulating, leaves of Sami-tree (Prosopis spicigera), flour of parched Karira fruits, a winnowing basket of Işika grass, Karambha- pots as many as male persons plus one made of barley-grains which are a little frosted and powdered after being besmeared with ghee. A male sheep and a female sheep are also made out of those (grains). The male sheep is with horns; the fernale sheep is hornless. They are covered with white wool. Two Adhvaryus, two sets of sacrificial implements, two sets of faggot and sacrificial grass, two altars--the northern one like that in an animal-sacrifice; the southern one like that in Full- moon and New-moon sacrifices. They are in a line towards the west, in different lines towards the east. The altars are distant from each other by thirteen angulas. On this day two sets of calves are separated from their mothers-for the Maruts and for Varuna. Having got milk milked at two places (the sacrificer) observes fast in the manner of Sämnäyya or silently. 
In the morning when he has offered the Agnihotra, the Adhvaryu, having strewn the Prṣthyā line, having carried forth (Praṇītā) waters, pours (paddy) for five passing (samcara) oblations beginning with a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, (then) a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra-Agni, coagulated milk to Maruts, coagulated milk to Varuna and a cake on one potsherd to Ka. (The sacrificer) releases speech at the call to the preparer of oblation-material. The rite up to the carrying round of the fire is similar. Here fire is carried round the Karamblia pots, female sheep, male sheep, leaves of Sami tree and flour of parched Karira fruits and the winnowing basket of Işika grass. Having made the cakes catch the crust, having cooked (the oblations), having taken them down, having gone to the east, having poured down (wash-water) for the Apyas, (the Adhvaryu and the Praprasthat) carry the Stambayajus. The Adhvaryu carries the Stambayajus from the northern altar, the Pratiprasthätṛ from the southern one. Of the two carrying Stambayajus, the Adhvaryu goes first, of the returning two, the Pratiprasthat goes first. (The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍāšika Brahmana.2 (They carry the Stambayajus) three times with the formula, and the fourth time silently. They do the first tracing of the altar. After the altars have been dug out, the Adhvaryu alone murmurs the Karana formula. From the dug out altars the Agnidhra carries (the earth) three times.

When the Agnidhra carries earth three times, the Adhvaryu alone traces around the Catvala in the manner of the Catvala.3 The Uttaravedi is piled up in the manner of the Uttaravedi. After the Adhvaryu has piled up the Uttaranǎbhi, he and the Pratiprasthätṛ carry forth two fires in the manner of the carrying forth of the fire.5 The Adhvaryu alone, having deposited fire on the northern altar offers the Adhvarähutis.

Having done the second tracing of the two altars on whose Uttaravedi fire has been carried forth, having levelled (the altars).

Having girdled the sacrificer's wife, they come up with two vessels of clarified butter and curds. Having purified the clarified butter in two vessels and Prokṣaṇī waters, the Adhvaryu takes clarified butter in the ladles together with the Prṣadajya in the Uttaravedi.

While the northern fire is cleansed and the southern one is not, the Pratiprasthätṛ asks the sacrificer's wife, "O sacrificer's wife, who is thy paramour?" "N.N." (she replies). "May Varuņa catch him", says he. If she does not mention even though one exists, she would bring calamity to her beloved kinsmen. She should therefore refer, "N.N. is my paramour." Mentioning his name, she causes him to be fastened with Varuņas' bond, so says the Brāhmaṇa. Having collected in a winnowing basket of Iṣika grass the Karambha-pots round which fire has been moved, he hands it over to the wife. She holds them on her head. 
Then having led her out by the southern door, while leading her towards the east, having gone around along the south of the Anvähäryapacana fire and along the south of both the altars, makes her utter the verse, "We invoke the voracious Maruts, the receivers of sacrifice and agreeable with the Karambha." They stand in front of the southern fire facing towards the west-the Adhvaryu to the north, the sacrificer to his south and the wife to his south. The wife hands over the Karambha-pots to the sacrificer. He holds them over his head. He recites the puronuvakya.

(The sacrificer) throws into the fire the winnowing basket of Işīka grass. Or it is brought in use after sprinkling with water. The two depart variously.

Having offered nine Prayājas and having crossed towards the north, they pour clarified butter over the oblations successively. The Adhvaryu pours over the oblations beginning with that for Agni in the prescribed manner upto that for Indra-Agni. The Pratiprasthatr (offers the coagulated milk) to the Maruts; the Adhvaryu offers to Varuna and the cake on one potsherd to Ka. They offer the Ajyabhāgas for Agni and Soma. The Pratiprasthātṛ stops. 
The Adhvaryu offers the oblations serially in the prescribed manner upto that for Indra-Agni and stops. Taking the portion (of the coagulated milk) for the Maruts, the Pratiprasthätṛ says (to the Hour), "Do you recite the puronuväkyä for (the offering to) the Maruts." As the first portion he takes leaves of Prosopis stricigera, flour of parched Karira-fruits and the coagulated milk. As the second portion he takes leaves of Prosopis spicigera, flour of parched Karira fruits, coagulated milk and the female-sheep. He pours clarified butter over it, and anoints back (the oblation within the altar). Having crossed the altar and having caused to announce, he says (to the Hotr), "Do you recite the yājyä for the Maruts." He makes the offering at the Vasat-utterance. The Pratiprasthätṛ stops. While taking the portion (of the coagu- lated milk) for Varuna, he says (to the Hotṛ) "Do you recite the puron uvákyå for Varuna." As the first portion he takes the leaves of Prosopis specigera, flour of parched Karira fruits and the coagulated milk. As the second oblation he takes leaves of Prosopis spicigera, flour of parched Karīra fruits, coagulated milk and the male sheep. He pours clarified butter over it, and anoints back (the oblation within the altar). Having crossed and having caused to announce he says (to the Hotr). "Do you recite the yǎjyä for Varuna."

Caland's text reads pratyanktah, while many MSS lead to prutyanaklaḥ, in BaudhŚS V.7 where the printed text is sinastaḥ no manuscript gives the correct form fimpiak. It may therefore be said that the author of BaudhSS wrote (or rather uttered, the text being a Pravacana) šinasṭaḥ and pratyanaklaḥ.

On the southern fire the Pratiprasthätṛ offers one Samiștayajus offering prescribed in the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices. (The sacrificer) having gone through the Purnapātra offering and Vişņu-strides does not release the vow. 
(The Adhvaryu) asks for the vessel for clarified butter together with the spon, the ladle, sacrificial grass, pieces of cloth for wearing, the scrapings of the coagulated milk for Varuna and husks. Taking all this, he says, "Come O sacrificer." Following him the sacrificer, following him his wife, having gone out between the Catvāla and the rubbish-heap, go to that place where there is water. The Avabhṛtha rite (is to be gone through) as prescribed. He does not give out a call for Såman- chanting, nor does he recite the formula, “O divine waters, this is your womb; glad and well-tended have we made it for you; proclaim us as doers of good deeds among the gods." They return without gazing back for the concealment from Varuņa. On the way they collect fire-sticks with the formula, Thou art the fuel; may we prosper. 4 Having come he puts (a firestick) on the Ahavaniya with the formula, "Thou art a fire-stick; thou art brilliance, grant me brilliance." They pray to the Ahavaniya with the verse, "I have penetrated to the waters; we are united with sap. Rich in sap, O Agni, I have come; do thou unite me with strength." Here (the sacrificer) releases the vow.

After four months (the sacrificer) proposes to offer Sākamedha-offerings. He procures a three-striped quill of a porcupine, a razer of black iron, four sets of potsherds, four vessels for cooking rice, as many corn-stirring sticks and curds for Prṣadajya. On the Upavasatha day of the full-moon the (Adhvaryu) pours (paddy) for a cake on eight potsherds to Anikavant Agni at sunrise. The Işti comes to an end in the prescribed manner. At midday he pours (paddy for) cooked rice for Samtapana Maruts. The Işti comes to an end in the prescribed manner. On this day calves (of the cows) are driven away for an oblation to Gṛhamedhin Maruts. In the evening after he has offered the Agnihotra, (the Adhvaryu) having cooked rice for Gṛhamedhin Maruts in the milk of all cows on the Gärhapatya fire and having poured ghee over it, takes it down towards the north. Having cleansed the vessel and having spread clarified butter in it, he draws into it the rice as if without striking at it. Having made a cavity for ghee into it, and having poured ample ghee, he places it within the altar. He offers the Ajyabhāgas to Agni and Soma. Having spread clarified butter (into the ladle), while taking portion of cooked rice from the eastern half, he says (to the Hotr) "Do you recite the puronuväkyä for Gṛhamedhin Maruts." Having taken portion from the eastern half, he takes portion from the rear half. He pours clarified butter over it and anoints back (the oblation). Having crossed and having caused to announce, he says (to the Hot), "Do you recite the yajyä for Gṛhamedhin Maruts." He offers at the Vasat-utterance. Then he offers the Svistakṛt offering. The Gṛhamedhiya sacrifice comes to an end with the Ida. He keeps back the scrapings of cooked rice for the Pürnadarvya offering. Auxiliary rice is cooked for womenfolk and children. They consume it. All put collyrium into their eyes and anoint themselves. The calves are allowed to join (their mothers). The calf of two cows having the same calf is tied at this night. 
Having hastened towards (the fire-hall), the Adhvaryu offers the Agnihotra with the milk of a cow having her own calf. Having cleansed the ladle and having spread clarified butter in it, he puts in it the scrapings in entire quantity. He pours clarified butter over it twice.

Immediately afterwards, having strewn the Prsthyä line and having carried forth (Praṇītā) waters, he pours out (paddy) for passing (samcara) oblations beginning with a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra-Agni, cooked rice to Indra and a cake on one potsherd to Viśve Devas. Having made the cakes catch the crust, having kept them on fire, having covered them with ashes, having gone forth and having poured down (the wash-water) for the Apyas, he carries the Stambayajus.

When the Agnidhra carries three times, he draws around a line for the Carvala with the procedure for Cätväla.1 He pours down earth for the Uttaravedi with the procedure for Uttaravedi. Having carved out the Uttaranābhi, he carries forth the fires with the procedure for carrying fire.5 Having done the second tracing out of the altar after the fire has been deposited on the Uttaravedi, having levelled (the altar), having held up the wooden sword crosswise, he gives out the call, “Do you keep down the Prokṣani-waters, place the faggot and sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prşadajya-ladies silently, girdle the sacrificer's wife and come up with the clarified butter and curds.” After the Prokṣaṇī-water has been brought, having discarded the wooden sword, having sprinkled himself, having placed the faggot and sacrificial grass, turning by the right and hastening to the rear, he cleanses the spoon and the ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prṣadājya-ladle silently. Having girdled the sacrificer's wife, having come up with the clarified butter and curds and having purified the clarified butter and Prokṣani-water, he concludes the rites in the manner pre- scribed for Vaisvadeva-offerings except the (offering of) whey.

(The sacrificer who) is going to perform the Mahäpitṛyajña procures paddy, barley, six potsherds, half potful of milk of a cow feeding another's calf, two new pots, a stem of sugarcane, three tri-leafs of Butea frondosa, sacrificial grass with roots, a bigger faggot, a curtain, mattress and pillow, collyrium and ointment, a fringe of cloth, wooden sword, two water-pitchers and sacrificial implements. The Adhvaryu strews darbha-blades round the Garhapatya. Towards the north he deposits one by one the mattress and pillow, collyrium and ointment, a fringe of cloth, the wooden sword, two water-pitchers and sacrificial implements. Having suspended the cord over the left shoulder and having sat down to the north of the Gärhapatya, he pours out by means of the Agnihotra-ladle provided with the strainer. With the formula, "In the impulse of god Savity, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Püsan I pour out (the oblation) dear to Pitṛmant Soma" he pours out four handfuls of paddy. Repeating the same formula (with the modification), "I pour out (the oblation) dear to Barhiṣad Pitrs", he pours out four handfuls of barley. Repeating the same formula (with the modification), "I pour out (oblation) dear to Agniṣvätta Pitrs" he pours out again four handfuls of barley. 
Among these (oblations) he gives out a call to the preparer of oblation - material with regard only to paddy. The barley is taken up. The sacrificer releases speech at the call to the preparer of the oblation-material. The rites upto the crushing of rice-grains is similar. Having crushed the grains, he lays down six potsherds in the southern half of the Gärhapatya fire-place. Having crushed the barley in the mortar, and having placed a potsherd on the Carhapatya fire, they roast it. The barley is roasted out of which half the quantity is turned into roasted grains. Other grains are turned into flour. Having poured the flour (of rice-grains) into the pan and having mixed it with water, he bakes the cake on six potsherds. Having taken away towards the north embers mixed with ashes, having kept a new pot upon them, and having poured into it clarified butter across the strainer, he pours into it the roasted grains across the strainer. He asks for the half potful of milk of a cow feeding another's calf. Having poured into it flour of parched barley across the strainer, he churns it with the stem of sugarcane. He churns by the right. "He churns in a detached manner", so says the Brahmana. Having taken out embers mixed with ashes towards the north, he keeps (the pot) on them. Having made the cake catch the crust, he pours down (the wash-water) for the Apyas. A levelled mound is prepared towards the south. Here he draws a square altar, he does not dig it. Having enkindled the Anvähäryapacana fire in the middle of it, he carries the Stambayajus.

(The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍāšika Brāhmaṇa. (He carries the Stambayajus) three times with the formula and the fourth time silently. He does the first tracing out (of the altar); murmurs the Karana formula.2 He turns up (the earth); the Agnidhra carries away three times (the earth) which is turned up. When the Agnidhra carries (earth) three times, having done the second tracing of the altar, having levelled (the ground) and having held the wooden sword crosswise, the Adhvaryu calls out, "Do you place the Prokṣaṇi-water, keep ready the faggotand sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and ladles and come up with the clarified butter." After the Prokṣani-waters have been brought, having thrown the wooden sword, having sprinkled (himself), having kept the faggot and sacrificial grass, having turned by the right and having hastened to the west, he cleanses the spoon and the ladles. Having come up with the clarified butter, having purified the clarified butter and the Prokṣaṇī-waters, having taken up five spoonfuls or six spoonfulls of clarified butter in the ladles, he stands up with Prokṣani-waters. He sprinkles the faggot, sprinkles the altar and sprinkles the sacrificial grass. Having sprinkled the sacrificial grass placed (within the altar) and having poured down (water over the knot of the sacrificial grass), he takes up the Prastara of grass having roots towards the front silently. Having suspended his cord over the right shoulder, he goes around (the altar) three times by the left strewing darbha-blades. First close to the altar, then externally and again externally. Having suspended the cord over the left shoulder, he moves around three times reversely. Taking the Prastara in hand, he lays down two enclosing sticks-the middle one and the southern one. He keeps erect two fire-sticks. He lays down two separating blades crosswise. On the separating blades he keeps silently the Prastara (of grass) with roots; the Juhú on the Prastara; other two ladles on the sacrificial grass. 
Having touched them all together with the formula, "These have sat down in the world of good action; protect them, O Visņu protect the sacrifice, protect the lord of sacrifice, protect me the leader of sacrifice," having turned by the right and hastening towards the west, he takes down the oblations serially, having first spread clarified butter in the pan and after pouring clarified butter over. Having poured clarified butter over the cake (he pours over) the roasted grains and Karambha. The oblations are taken up one by one. He deposits the cake towards the south,

The Brahman and the sacrificer sit towards the south, and the Adhvaryu and the Agnidhra towards the north. 
V.13 
Taking a fire-stick from the faggot, (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Hotr), "Do you recite verses for the fire being enkindled for the gods and Pitrs." He puts the faggot on fire once or thrice. He keeps back a fire-stick. He fans the fire with the Veda. After the Samidhenī verses have been recited one by one, he pours the Aghara-libation by means of the spoon. After the fire has been cleansed,1 he offers the second Āghāra-libation by means of the two ladles. Having crossed the altar towards the north without bringing the two ladles in mutual contact, having anointed the Dhruva with the Juhu and having kept the ladles, he chooses the Pravara. He causes (the Agnidhra) to announce, "Do thon announce." "Let it be heard" (is the response). "May god Agni the Hot offer to gods and Pitrs. Do thou be seated"--this much is the Pravara. The Hotṛ sits down. The Adhvaryu awaits his impulse. 
Impelled, having taken the two ladles, having crossed and having caused to announce, he says (to the Hotṛ) "Do you recite the yäjyä for Samidhs." He makes the offering at the Vaṣat-utterrance. (The next calls are) "Do you recite the yäjyä” "Do you recite the yajya." Having offered four Prayājas excluding the one for Barhis, having crossed towards the north, he pours drops of clarified butter from the ladle serially over the oblations. He offers the Ajyabhāgas (with the intital calls, "Do you recite the puronuvākyā) for Agni” “(Do you recite the puronuväkyä) for Soma.* Having crossed towards the north, he places the ladles in their places.

He says to one who is strong, "Do thou go round three times by the left sprinkling around a continuous stream with this water-pitcher."He does so. Having kept down the pitcher, he goes round in a reverse order. Having spread (clarified butter in the Juhu), taking portion from the eastern half of the cake, he says.

"Pre-svadhā for Pitṛmant Soma."2 He cuts portion from the eastern half of the cake, from the eastern half of the Karambha. He pours clarified butter over them; anoints back (the oblations). Having taken portions while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north, causes to announce with “O Svadhā.” The Ägnidhra responds with astu svadhā. (The Adhvaryu gives the call to the Hotr) "Do you utter Svadhā to Pitṛmant Soma." (The Hot) having uttered the aguras ye sadhā or pe svadhamahe, utters the Vasat-utterance as svadhā namah. (The Adhvaryu) makes the offering at the Vaşat-utterance (ie. at svadhā namaḥ). Having spread (clarified butter into the Juhu, while taking portion from the middle part of roasted grains. he says (to the Hotṛ), "Pre-svadha2 for Barhiṣad Pitrs." He takes roasted grains from the middle part; Karambha from middle part; cake from the middle part. He pours clarified butter over them; anoints back (the oblations). Having taken the portions while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north. He causes to announce with O Svadha. The Agnidhra responds with astu svadbā. (The Adhvaryu gives call) 
1. Caland's text reads asaya eva dhänā bhavanti. In place of alaya the variants noted are āśayā and saya. The reading saya is acceptable. When roasted grains (dhn) are prepared (cf BaudhŚS V.II) it is not said that they are kept in an adaya. There are three oblations. In transposition Nos. 1 and 3 exchange their positions. The oblation in the middle viz. dhānā remains in its place. This is the meaning of the sûtra layä na diánë bhavanti. The sutra again occurs in BaudhŚS V.14. Here also saya is required to be corrected as sayā. Even if dhānās were kept in a container, the latter has no relevance here. The word aŝaya in the sense of "a container" occurs in BaudhSS X.7, X.10 in the context of Pravargya utensils, in BaudhŚS XX.12 in the context of care and in XXI 2 in the context of a cake on one potsherd. In ApŚS the word jaye occurs in the above mentioned sense in the context of days in Gavārn Ayana ApŚS XXI. 15.9,14,22:16 2,7.12. In ManŚS the word saya occurs in a different sense. viz. Aratni. 
2. 
Anu svadhā stands for anu brühi. This is a call to the Hotr to recite the puronuváky Caland (APSS VIII. 15.8) deems these words as untranslatable. While sundhi in untranslatable, anu could be rendered since it stands for anušky, purseunäkyä. I have thought it suitable to render anu as "Pre" in consideration of the fact that the puronuväkyä is to be recited before the yājyä.

"Do you utter Svadhā (i.e. recite the yājyä) for Barhiṣad Pitṛs." (The Hotṛ), having uttered the aguras ye svadhā or ye svadhamahe utters the Vasat as svadhā namah. (The Adhvaryu) makes the offering at the Vaṣat (i.e. svadhā namah). Having spread (clarified butter in the Juhû) while taking portion of Karambha from the rear half, he says (to the Hotṛ) "Pre-svadhä for Agniṣvätta Pitṛs." He takes portion of Karmabha from the rear half of the cake from the rear half; of roasted grains from the rear half. He pours clarified butter over them; anoints back (the oblations).

(The Adhvaryu) makes the offering at the Vasat (i.e. at svadhā namaḥ). Having spread (clarified butter in the Juhu), while taking portion of the cake from the southern half (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Hotṛ) “Pre-svadhā for Kavyavahana Svistakṛt Agni." He takes a portion of the cake from the southern half; of roasted grains from the southern half; of Karambha from the southern half. He pours clarified butter twice. He does not anoint back. Having taken portion while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north. He causes to announce with O svadhä. The Agnidhra responds with astu svadha.

At the utterance of Vaṣaț (i.e. svadhā namaḥ) he makes the offering in the eastern half of the southern half transgressing the earlier offerings. 
Here he throws into the fire the corn-stirring stick and the stem (of sugarcane), and pours over them drops (from the Juhů). Having crossed towards the south, he places the ladles in their places.

the north, having placed the two ladles in their places, he separates the two ladles with two Vājavatī verses. Having dispersed the Prastara and the enclosing sticks at the Samyuvāka formula (recited by the Hotr), having left drops of clarified butter (from the Juhu on the fire), having released the two ladles, he offers the Samistayajus offering. The sacrificial implements are carried away in pairs. Having suspended their cords over the left shoulder, the priests pray to the Garhapatya with the verse, “O Prajapati, none other than thee has encompassed all the creations. With whatever desire we offer unto thee, may we attain that desire. May we be lords of wealth." Here he murmurs the second verse," Whatever harm we have done to the midregion, to the earth and to the heaven, to mother and father, may Agni, the lord of the house, free me from that sin; may he make me blameless in respect of all the evils that we have committed." The Mahāpitṛyajña comes to an end.

While the Adhvaryu is functioning (in the Mahäpitṛyajña), the Pratiprasthätṛ, having baked on the Garhapatya cakes on one potsherd as many as the persons (in the sacrificer's family) plus one pertaining to Tryambaka. After having taken them down over whom clarified butter has been poured, and having collected them in a pan or a platter or an old box, he keeps waiting. (The Adhvaryu) asks for blue and red threads, side-leaf of a Palāśa tri-leaf, a fire-brand procured from a nearby house and a pot full of water. Having taken up all this, (the priests) pray to the Gärhapatya with the formula, "As many members of the house as we are, to them I have made prosperity. Thou art the welfare of the cattle, the welfare of the sacrificer; do thou grant me welfare."1 Having gone out, they go towards that direction towards which they may find a crowded square. If there is none, they go by a cart or a chariot. 
Having enkindled there the firebrand, having strewn it around and having taken up in the side-leaf a portion of each of the Tryambaka-cakes, he makes the offering with the mantras, "Rudra is the only one; he does not endure the other. The rat, O Rudra is thy animal; do thou approve of it. This is thy portion, O Rudra;

We have appeased, O lady, Rudra the god Tryambaka, that he may make us prosperous; that he may increase our wealth; that he may make us rich in cattle; that he may embolden us, Svāhā."2 Here he throws the side-leaf in the space trodden by the cattle of one whom (the sacrificer) hates. If the sacrificer does not hate anybody, he puts it in the hole of a rat. 
Out of these Tryambaka-cakes he gives one each to the family members; two to the sacrificer. All of them go round the fire striking their right thighs with the verse, “We make offering to Tryambaka, the fragrant, increaser of prosperity. May I be loosened, like a cucumber from its stem, from death, not from immortality." Having gone around once, they stand towards the north. They throw up the cake and catch it with the formula, "For fortune thee." Similarly they go round a second time; go round a third time. (A daughter) desirous of a husband goes around three times by the left, striking her left thigh, with the verse, "We make offering to Tryambaka, the fragrant, giving a husband. May I be loosened, like a cucumber from its stem, from here; not from the husband." Having gone around once, she stands towards the north. She throws up the cake, and catches with the formula, "For fortune thee." Similiarly a second time, similarly a third time. Each one puts (the cake) into the folded palms of the sacrificer.

(With the half verse) "I unite thee with offspring, like the Sura with mixture of rice and water." The sacrificer puts them into the folded palms of the sacrificer's wife with the half verse, "I unite thee with offspring and cattle like the Sura with the mixture of rice water." The sacrificer's wife (hands them over) to her daughter desiring fortune with the half verse, "I unite thee with fortune like the Sura with the mixture of rice and water." Having collected them in a basket and having tied it with blue and red threads, he fastens it on a dried stump of a tree or on a post with two prongs with the formula, "This is thy portion, O Rudra, rejoice in it. With it for food, do thou go away beyond the Mujavant (mountain) with unstrung bow, thy club in hand and clad in skin." They pray with this formula holding their breath as long as they can. Having sprinkled away water and having thrown the pot, they come back without gazing behind. They wash hands and feet. Having entered the firehall

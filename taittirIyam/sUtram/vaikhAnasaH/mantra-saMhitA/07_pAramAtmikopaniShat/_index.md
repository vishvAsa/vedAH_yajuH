While the Indological opinion holds the paramAtmikopaniShad to be a late work composed at tirumala, we go against the grain and believe that it contains archaic vaikhAnasa material at its core. Into this tirumala-centric incantations were added at a later date.

The Paramatmika Upanishad is a hymn to Vishnu, in 11 anuvakas, consisting of 105 Mantras.  Though termed an Upanishad, it is found within the Vaikhanasa Samhita of the Krishna Yajur Veda. Hence for all purposes, it is a grand-Sukta or a mantra upanishad.  These mantras are considered as some of the most important Vedic mantras to Vishnu.  

The entire Sukta is recited as part of Homas, particularly in the Maha-Shanti Homa , as a pinnacle to it.  

The Paramatmka is also key and plays a central role in Prana-Prathistha ceremonies, as chanting of all 11 anuvakas is deemed to bring life-energy into a Bimba or Vigraha.   
  
There are 3 recessions of this sukta -

- The Dravida Patha is more popular in Tamil Nadu, commented upon by BhattaBhaskara.  
- The Andhra Patha is commented upon by Srinivasa Makin Vedanta Desika, aka Srinivasa Deekshita.  
  - The anuvakas, and mantras are the same between the 2 recessions, but there are some significant differences in the wordings of the mantras, and their interpretation by both commentators.   
- prachina vikhanasa patha (rediscovered and published in 2020s)

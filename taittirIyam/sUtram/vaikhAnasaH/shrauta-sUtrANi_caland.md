NOTE. 
The late Dr. Willem Caland, Emeritus Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Utrecht, Holland, who had previously published several works in our Bibliotheca Indica Series sub- mitted materials for this present edition of the 'Vaikhānasa- Śrauta-Sutram' in the latter part of 1930. The work was accepted at the end of 1930 and the manuscript was sent to the press early in 1931. The progress of the work was very steady in the beginning and only 158 pages were left to be seen through the press and the index prepared, but unfortunately the sudden death of Dr. Caland in March 1932 at the age of 73 put a stop to the further progress of the work. 
Dr. J. Gonda of V. Beverninghlaan, Gauda, Holland, who was assisting Dr. Caland was entrusted with this task of complet- ing the work by Madame Caland. 
Dr. Gonda was good enough to complete the text portion of this work when suddenly all touch with him was lost and the Index remained unfinished. In 1934 arrangements were made with Dr. Raghu Vira of the International Academy of Indian Culture, Lahore, to prepare it. But unfortunately all further progress in this work like many others remained at a stand still till 1939. The Special Enquiry Committee took up the question of completing all work that were lying in the press and made definite arrangements with Dr. Raghu Vira to prepare the index on usual remuneration. 
Of the other works published in our Bibliotheca Indica Series by Dr. W. Caland, the following may be mentioned:- 
(1) Baudhayana-Śrauta-Sūtra (text) in 3 vols., published 
between 1904-1923. 
(2) Vaikhanasa-Smärta-Sutra (text) in 1 vol., published in 
1927. 
(3) Vaikhānasa-Smārta-Sūtra, Eng. trans., published in 
1929.

NOTE. 
(4) Pañcavimsa Brahmaņa (text), 1 volume, published in 
1931. 
The Council of the Society wishes to record its great indebtedness to Dr. W. Caland for his great work in our Bibliotheca Indica works and to Madame Caland and Dr. Gonda for their labours.

A. Manuscripts of the Sutra. 
1. M (Madras), copy of a Ms. belonging to the Government Library of Madras: No. 1605 of "a triennial catalogue of Mss. 1913-14 and 1915-16 collected for the Government Or. Mss. Library", Vol. II, Part I, Sanskrit C, page 2262. In Telugu script. This Ms. contains not only the Śrautasutra but also the Grhya-dharma- and pravara-chapters. The text is designated throughout as grhyasütra", and the prasnas (the grhya: 7 prasnas; the dharma: 3 prasnas; the pravara: one praśna; the srauta: 21 praśnas) are numbered continuously, so that the first prasna of the Śrautasutra here figures as the 12th, and the last as the 32nd praśna. 
** 
2. L (Lahore), modern copy on paper made in the year 1926, in Devanagari, of the Srautasutra only, belonging to the Daya- nand Anglo-Vedic College at Lahore. The prasnas are number- ed: 1, etc. up to 21; last words: iti śrīvaikhānasasrautasütre somaprāyaścittividhir nāmaikavimśaḥ prašnaḥ | sampūrṇam idam 
vaikhānasasrautasūtram 
3. A (Ākulamannäḍu), palm-leaf Ms. in Telugu script, complete, containing 146 leaves, long 44 c.m., high 3 c.m., eight lines on a page. The praśnas are numbered from 1 to 21. 
4. B, a Ms. belonging to the Adyar Library at Madras, registered x. 8.17; modern copy in Grantha (made in the year 1917), complete on 783 pages; high 21 c.m., broad 17 c.m.; 15 lines on a page. The prasnas are numbered 1-21. 
5. T (Telugu), paper Ms. from Ãkulamannäḍu, belonging (as does No. 3) to Pandit Parthasarathi Iyangar, bound in book-form (octavo); complete: 470 pages, 17 lines a page. Numbered in continuation of the Grhya-dharma-pravarasutra - So the colophon of the first praśna in the Śrautasūtra runs : iti śrīvaikhānasagṛhyasütre dvādaśaprašnaḥ and so mutatis mutandis up to ekavimsaprasnaḥ. The colophon of the 23rd praśna is: iti srimad aukheyasäkhāyām vikhanasa prokte

PREFACE. 
śrivaikhānasasütre mulagṛhye trayovimsat praknak. In the second half of this Ms. the upadhmaniya is used before voiceless guttural and labial. The Ms. is neatly written by two different hands; after praśna 15, four pages are left blank, but in the text nothing is missing. 
6. V, complete Ms. in Telugu script, 186 palm-leaves, 39 cm. long, 3 c.m. broad, 6 à 7 lines on a page. Neatly written by one and the same hand with the exception of a few pages. The type of Telugu here used is rather difficult to read, it has a peculiar form of some aksaras. The prasnas are reckoned as 1-21. This Ms. is peculiar by its verses outside the text proper, which contain some data of importance to ascertain the contents of the sutra, the age of the Ms. and the locality where it has been written. The Ms. seems not to be very old. It belongs (as do the Nos. 3 and 5) to Pandit Pärthasarathi Iyangar and bears on the cover the number 84.--The Ms. begins: 
srilakṣmivallabhadyantām vikhanāmunimadhyamām | asmaḍācāryaparyantäm vande guruparamparām || 
After the first praśna follows:

The colophon after the end of the 7th prasna runs:

7. H (Haug), the devanagari Ms. of Munich, a copy made for M. Haug, see Catal. cod. Mss. bibl. regiae monacensis, No. 119, page 56. From a note of Bühler in Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XXV, page XXIX, we gather that this Ms. is a copy from an original at Baroda, cp. also the Madras Triennial Catalogue 1913-16, Vol. II, part 1, page XVIII. From the clerical errors it is apparent that the original must have been a grantha Ms. At the end a part is missing and here and there parts are left out. The prasna-numbers are 1, etc. 
8. R, a rotographic reproduction of 172 palm-leaves, belong. ing to the University Library of Lahore; 6 lines a page, old and damaged; grantha characters. The last two prasnas are missing. The reproduction is rather bad, many pages are wholly illisible. 
9. G, grantha manuscript, belonging to Pandit Parthasarathi Iyangar, on 34 palm-leaves, long 45 c.m., broad 4 c.m., 7 à 8 lines on a page. 
It is old and much damaged and broken off, especially the first leaf. This Ms., which is bound up together with A, contains only a big fragment, from the begin- ning up to the middle of VI. 11. 
1 At my request Mr. S. C. Nandimath, a scnolar of Telugu origin, now in London. tried to ascertain the date and place of this Ms. His conclu- sion is that the most probable identification of the date is: 19th May, 1702 A.D. As to the place where the Ms. was written, probably the name Süharija points to Sahāji III, ruler of Tanjore 1671-1711; a town or village Säharajapurn seems to be unknown.

PREFACE. 
B. Manuscripts of the Commentary. 
1. A copy of the Vyakhya by Srinivasadiksita, belonging to the Madras Gov. Library, registered as No. 1606 in a Trien- nial Catal. of Mss. (1913-14, 1915-16) for the Government Or. Mss. Library, Madras, Vol. II, Part I, Sanskrit C. pago 2263. It treats of praśna I up to X. 
2. A copy of the same work, in the possession of Pandit Parthasarathi Iyangar at Akulamannādu, containing the Vyakhya of praśnas I-XIV and four khandas of prašna XV. 
3. A copy of the Vyakhya made for me by the alrea ly men- tioned Pandit, from praśna XV. 4 (middle) unto the end of praśna XVI. In this copy the praśnas are numbered undepend- ently from the smartasūtra, as I-XII, but after these the con- tinuous numbering is taken up, so that the next prasna is designated as XXIV. A further peculiarity is that in this Ms. the chapters are not called khanda but sakala. 
The Vyakhya (or Vyakhyāna as it is called also) opens with some verses, of which I cite only the following one : 
yena vedärtham1 vijñāya 
1 
lokānugrahakāmyayā | pranītam sütram aukheyam | 
tasmai vikhanase namaḥ || 
The date of at least the copy of Akulamannäḍu is con- tained in the following verse (at the end of the Vyakhya on the first prasna): 
samvatsare citrabhānau sucau māse caturduse | 
mantriharasya säyähne nämnä tirumalāyeti || 
There is an indication of the region, where this Vyakhya was composed, in the example given for the passage (śrs. XII. 11): vicakṣaṇāntam rājanyasya, which example runs: ho rajendra colavicaksana. This points to Coromandel. 
C. The text as handed down in the Mss. and the value of the 
Vyakhyā. 
The nine manuscripts on which our text of the Vaikhinasa śrautasūtra is based, can be divided in a rough manner into two 
1 vedārthavijñāya, veḍārthavijñeya, veḍārthuvijñeyo the Mss. 
PREFACE. 
xiii 
groups: AHRBG on the one side and MLTV on the other side; in some cases M agrees with the other group. 
We note that some omissions have been made, which are common to each group or at least to the plurality of Mss. which constitute such a group. See for instance II. 6, where four words have been overlooked by LTV; in XVIII. 16 more than one sentence is omitted in MAB. In each of these two groups many passages can be noted which disagree more or less, whilst these disagreements cannot be said to rest on faulty tradition or corruptedness of the manuscripts. Sometimes one group has a word which is missing in the other one: prayasyan (XII. 14) only in MLTV; uttanam (XII. 9) only in BAH. Striking differences are the following: 
MLTV (IV. 10).

MLTV (XIV. 14). 
The reading in V. 6 and IX. 2 of MLTV differs widely from that of ABH(R). 
Two very striking examples of disagreement are: angulyā- nvavadīšati AB: angulyā nirdiŝati MLTV (VII. 6), pascādupa- cāro vāgniḥ AHB: paścad vopacāro 'gniḥ (XVIII. 17). These two discrepancies are so striking because in these two cases the group AB(H) is in accord with Hiranyakeśin, the group MLTV with Apastamba. 
Now, as the Ms. A shows many traces which point to a Grantha-original, we may perhaps surmise, that of old there existed two recensions: a Grantha-recension (represented by ABRHG) and a Telugu-recension (represented by MLTV), which were slightly different.

PREFACE. 
About the single Mss. may be remarked that G is rather independent, as it contains readings which are found only here, e.g., udicīnapravanām and sītāmātrām both in V. 1; it is the only Ms. that preserves the correct reading ata ürdhvam in IV. 8. Although the Ms. H (a copy of the Baroda Ms.) is very corrupt, it contains valuable readings. Probably the Ms. R is a copy of the same Baroda Ms., as it agrees nearly with H. 
On the base of these Mss. and with the help of the Vyakhyä the text of the Śrautasutra can be fairly well established, although the tradition in the Mss. is in many passages very corrupt. But here the comparison with the sutras of Baudha- yana, Apastamba and Hiranyakesin is of great help. Never- theless, there remains many a passage where the editor had to emend the reading of the Mss. or to leave it ununderstood; in this latter case a sign of interrogation is added before the variants. As has already been mentioned, the Vyakhya of Śrīnivāsadikṣita was also of help, but as this Vyakhya is properly a prayogavrtti and thus gives rather a periphrase of the text than an explanation of the words, leaving out many passages, which do not bear directly on the rites, the help to be got from the Vyakhya is not so great as we might have hoped. Espe- cially difficult are of the first prasna the last half of the first and the first half of the second khanda, and of the XIth prašna the description of the sacrificial utensils, of which the Vyakhya does not treat. 
D. Remarks on the Śrautasutra in general. 
Some years ago (in 1920) I made in my paper “Brāhmaṇa- en Sutra-aanwinsten" (Versl. en Meded. der K.A.v.W. te Amsterdam, 5e Reeks, dl. IV, page 472) the following remark. "Whether besides the Śrautasutra a similar Mantrasamhita has existed (as the Mantrasamhita for grhya-rites), is uncer- tain; to me it seems very probable, as here (in the Śrauta- sutra) also many a mantra is indicated by its beginning words. which does not occur in any Samhita, Brähmaṇa or Sutra." By a mere fortune we are now enabled to answer the question 
PREFACE. 
XV 
put in 1920: the guess made by me has now come true: there exists a separate Mantra samhita also for the Śrautasutra! In the middle of the bulky Ms., described under A. 3 and 9, lent to me so kindly by the Telugu pandit, I found 39 palm-leaves in Telugu script, which begin as fol- lows: 
darbhesv asino darbhān dharayamāṇaḥ patnya saha prāṇān ayamya agnin ädhäsye sarvakratvartham yair asmy adhikṛto yāms ca sakṣyāmi prayoktum | adhvaryum tvā vṛṇīmahe | bhavi- ṣyāmi | vaiśvānarasya rūpam sampad astv (ity) antam | tat savitur varenyam | bhargo devasya dhimahi | dhiyo yo nah pracoday it | bhūḥ | suvaḥ | vidur (r. vedir) asi bhuvah janaḥ | mahaḥ | iṣe tvorje tvā | etc., etc. 
Here, then, we have found a great part of the text whose existence was presupposed: the Mantrasamhita for śrauta pur- pose; here we find together all the mantras to be used accord- ing to the prescripts of our Śrautasutra in the order in which they are mentioned in this sūtra. But the Samhitā gives more than these mantras: it contains also those which implicitly are to be understood, as for example the samkalpa (the first mantra together with its accompanying act). Often the Sam- hitā works out what is only indicated in the sutra, giving all the mantras. Now, we remark, that this Samhita presupposes the Grhyamantrasamhita, it gives only the pratikas of those mantras which had already been given in full in the other Samhita. One of the proofs is the mantra which begins : vaiśvānarasya rupam and which ends: sampad astu. This is the vaisvānara-sukta mentioned in śrs. I. 1 ; in note 15 on the translation of Smärtasutra 1. 21, I cited only the beginning words, the closing words are: sarvam asmākam sampad astu. A similar abbreviation is found elsewhere in the Śrauta- mantrasamhita: prajā sthālīm abhimantrayāmi | prajānann ity antam, cp. note 13 on the translation of Smartasutra III. 5. 
This fragment of the Śrautamantrasamhita (in the Ms. there is no indication of its name or title) contains the first four prasnas; the first prasna consists of 13 anuvākas, the second of 12, the third of 21, the fourth of 15. It contains 
xvi 
PREFACE. 
the mantras mentioned in prašna I-VI (incl.) of the Srauta- 
sutra. 
This point being settled satisfactorily, another difficulty. a new uncertainty arises. If the Vaikhanasas possessed a separate Samhita, which contained all the mantras for sacrifi - cial practice, had they, as, e.g., the Vājasaneyins have, a separate book containing the brahmanas? It is a fact that portions of the brahmana as they are now found in the Taittiriya-samhita, brahmana, and aranyaka, were known to them; very often in the Śrautasutra a passage found in those texts is cited ending on ity uktam or ili vijñāyate, once ili śrutiḥ, and oftentimes on iti brāhmaṇoktam or brāhmaṇoktāni. Nearly all these passages can be traced in the brähmaṇa-parts of the books of the Taittiriyas, but there are a few that only partly agree with them and others that have not at all been traced in them, see II. 6, VIII. 1 (beg.), IX. 12, XVIII. 1 (heg.), XX. 3, XX. 15. This question, whether the Vaikhanasas possess also a separate brāhmaṇa-book can, for the moment, not be answered definitely. Perhaps, though, it might be answered affirmatively, on the ground of a passage in the Anandasambitä (I. 78): 
vaikhānasam taittiriyam tathā vājasaneyakam | 
:: 
yajurvedas tridhā proktaḥ śuddham vaikhīnasam smrtam | aśuddham taittiriyam ca suddham vājasaneyukam || Here suddha must mean kept clear" 
separated", so that the yajus-portions and the brahmanas are kept asunder. Just as the Śrautamantrasamhita after all has been proved to exist perhaps further research will throw light also on this uncertain- ty. Still the following remarks must be made. It seems that the contents of the Vaikhanasa-yajurveda are the same as of that of the Taittiriyas. In the Anandasamhita (II. 55 sqq.) we read: 
tām tu vaikhānasīm śākhām yajurvedataror viduḥ || asyās tu mūlašākhāyāḥ kāṇḍānukramanam tv idam | athadhvaryavatadyāgayājamänägnihotrikāḥ || 
hautram vidhāyakaś caiṣām pitṛmedhas ca tadvidhiḥ | prajapatyakhyakanḍe tu yajñakāndān iman viduḥ || 
PREFACE.

xvii 
As long as we do not know this passage better (for it must be incomplete and contains some errors), we cannot say with certainty which parts constituted these five kändas. The passage may be compared with the description of Baudhayana (see my paper, "Ueber des rituelle sutra des Baudhayana ", page 32) and with the kandanukramana of the Atreyas (Ind. Studien, Vol. II). 
In the same book, sloka 7, we read the following state- 
ment: 
vaikhānasam yajurvedam pañcakāṇḍam udähṛtam | saptakandam yajurvedas tat kṛṣṇnam taittiriyakam || 
This statement, however, that the Vaikhanasa-sakha con- sisted of five kändas as against seven of the Taittiriyas, differs from another one, mentioned in note 6 on the Translation of Smartasūtra II. 10.-This is all confused and uncertain, but I thought it worth while to lay these facts before the reader. 
E. Grammatical, stylistic, and general peculiarities of the Śrautasutra. 
Before treating of the interrelation of the Smärta- and the Śrautasūtra it will be useful to collect some grammatical and stylistic features of the Srautasūtra. 
1. Sandhi. Besides strnams triḥ (IX. 5), hosyams tena (VI. 2), pracchādayams triḥ (IV. 7) we find sṛjan tasmin (IV. 6), abhicchädayan trih (V. 6); besides itarāms trîn (III. 4) we find tasmin tvästram (XX. 39).-Pragṛhya is neglected: dogdhre 'pah for dogdhre apaḥ (XIII. 5). 
2. Irregular and faulty gender and number of nouns.-prṣadājya, masc. (XX. 36); mrd, plural (XIII. 
xviii 
PREFACE. 
1, 3); etam ṛgdvayam, mase, (XXI. 2); chadiḥ is used correctly as a neuter, but nevertheless the Sutrakära says: madhyamam chadiḥ prâñcam udañcam vā nidhāya (XIV. 6); rukma as a neuter (XI. 3, XVIII. 11, cp. Hir. VIII. 25); câturmãsya as a masc. (and cp. note 28 on the Translation of Smartasūtra I. 1), in praśna VIII it is used as a neuter; asthîn (XXI. 9), but somewhat furtheron asthini. Often we find the mase. to which must be understood mantra (e.g., trin, dvau III. 2, V. 4). This never occurs in the older Sutras. 
3. Verb. Just as in the Smärtasūtra (see Translation, page 236) adadyat (XIII. 4, end) and ādadāti (XI. 10) are used instead of the regular adadīta and adatte; sisyet instead of sisyeta occurs XXI. 4. 
4. Adverbs. caturdisam is used (X. 4) quasi adverbially a. in the Smartasūtra (see note 8 on the Translation of I. 9). For ekaikam in ekaikam dhavitrāny ädatte (XIII. 9) we would expect ekaikasah. 
5. Compounds. Besides the older vaisyarājanyau of XV. 31, which is taken from Hir., we find rajanyavaisyau (XI. 5, end; XIII. 12) and kṣatriyavaiśyau (XII. 10, as Ap.). A very strange compound is purodaye (XVIII. 12), if it is not a fault for purodayāt. Striking is the compound sapāņi in the expres- sion sapanya rasanaya X. 9, which must mean; "with the rasana in his hand". Instead of a compound prädesamatra we find simply prädeśa in XVIII. 18. 
6. Use of cases. On the whole, the Sūtrakära avoids using the dative-genitive on ai (from stems on a- and -), see for instance agnihotryah (II. 7), dvāryāyāḥ (XIII. 8), where Ap. (XV. 6. 4) has dväryāyai. Only twice we meet with the form on -ai, and here the influence of Ap. is apparent: dakṣiņāyai śroneḥ (XVIII. 16), dakṣinata uttaravedyai (X. 5). Noteworthy are the genitives in the following passage: mahartvigbhyo dakṣinā manovakprāṇacakṣuṣām anudisati and further on: śrotrātmāngalomṇām (XVI. 7). By comparing Ap. XII. 6. 4-6 and Hir. X. 15 we may guess that a dative as niṣkrāyāya must be supplied, but the syntactical use of the genitive remains unexplained. The genitive asya pradasyanPREFACE.

(XVIII. 9) is used as against the older dative (as Baudh. uses it here).-Cases dependent on verbs; krudhyati with accusative occurs XII. 11; śrīnāti with acc. and loc.: kvalasaktün äsvine śrīņāti (XI. 4); yajate with acc. instead of instr.: tāni (so. cāturmāsyāni) yakṣyamāṇaḥ vasante vaiśvadevena yajate (VIII. 3); upavisati with acc.: cașălam upavišet (XX. 36) as against Baudh.: casala upa°. 
7. Syntax of sentence. Asyndetic construction, which seems to occur only in later Sanskrit (Speyer, Sanskrit Syntax $487) occurs often: somena yakṣyamāņa ādadhīta nartum..sūrkṣet (I. 1): "should he establish his fires with the intention to perform a sacrifice of soma, he should not mind the season similarly XII. 11; XV. 15 (rathantarasāmā syat), XX. 14, XX. 21, 23, 24, 25, 34; XXI. 15.

8. The particles ca and vă are very often inserted in the wrong place: pārjanyam carum ca (VIII. 3); pāśukīm uttara- vedim ca (VIII. 9); yajamānaḥ patnyañjalau ca patnî duhituḥ... añjalau samasyati (IX. 11), correct would be: patni ca instead of ca patni; vāruṇam dasakapālam ca (XI. 4); dvitiyam kharam ca (XI. 2); suklām úrṇāstukām ca (XII. 19); pascād dhavirbhyas ca (XX. 30).-anyaya vaisnavyā vā (XIV. 7); ghṛte carum vă (XII. 5); prathamān mahartvijo caturo vā (XII. 1); vṛṣno asvasya vā (XVIII. 1); sadbhir harati va (XIX. 6); ajasya pade vã (I. 13); uttaram samasyed vā (I. 16); svenāngena 1% (L. 19, beg.); angậm ahtya vã (ILL. 9); prog udayad và (II. 1); purastāt svistakṛto vā (VIII. 2); caitryām paurṇamāsyām vā (VIII. 3); punye nakṣatre va (X. 1; XVIII. 1); punye 'hani va (XIII. 1).

9. Place of other enclitics. In the correct language of the older Sütras the enclitics follow immediately after the first (accented) word of the sentence. This rule is in our text very often violated. 
(a) Enclitic pronouns at the beginning of the sentence: enam in: enam yajamānaḥ praty apornute (XII. 19); enam carmani nidadhāti (XV. 18); enam..bahirañjanam sādayati (XIII. 13); enam..purayati (XIII. 16); eṣām in: eṣām duivatāny abhighārayati (XV. 25); asya in: yady aparudhyetäsyä-

PREFACE. 
gnir anugacchet (I. 18); asmai in: asmai dandam dadyät (X. 11, beg.); asmai vratam pradāsyan (XVIII. 9, beg.), as against Baudh. athasmai, etc. 
(b) Enclitic pronouns not in their right place: yadi pürro bhrātṛvyo mātikrantaḥ (XVIII. 17), cp. Ap. XVI. 23. 7: yuli manyeta yajamānaḥ pūrvo mātikrāntó bhrātṛvya iti; yam vā prasyandinyām bhūmyām asya rāṣṭram jānukam syād iti (XVIII. 7). By inserting bhữmyäm, which does not belong to the original quotation (see Ap. XVI. 9. 8), the Sūtrakāra violates the law of the enclitics; dasarātram ajasrā asyāgnayaḥ (I. 16); tad etad antarāle 'syägnihotram bhavati (II. 9); trimŝanmänam hiranyam asya dakṣiṇā (1. 16); pūrvasamjātam aparādham asya tad ahar nivedayeyuḥ (II. 10); dikṣitavimitād anyatrainam süryo 'bhimrocet (XII. 11); prstham anyo 'syabhyanakti (XII. 7), cp. Baudh. VI. 2: 158. 2: anyo 'sya prstham abhyanakti: indrāya sutrāmne tveti (XI. 4) as against Hir.: indrāya tvä sutrāmņa iti; yajamāna ṛtvijas cainam abhivyäharanti (XII. 3)-Further, enam is used faulty instead of etam : enam mahā- viram (XIII. 9), enam agnim (XIX. 6). 
10. Pleonasm occurs in avasisṭam..anyatarat (X. 14); yāvān puruṣa ūrdhvabāhus tāvatā veṇunā puruṣamātreṇāgnim vimimite (XVIII. 14, cp. Ap. XVI. 17. 8). 
11. Omission of a word must be accepted in avasathe parisado hiranyam nidhaya (I. 14, end), where apparently madhye must be supplied; apām in apām adhitisthati (XXI. 24) we must take as dependant on an omitted antam. A verb seems to be missing in X. 6: ahavaniyam..anvādhāyedhmäbarhişi, probably understand aharati. 
12. Irregular constructions are not rare: the nomi- natives ardhapātram prokṣanīkumbha ikṣusalākā.,prayunakti (IX. 3); the nominative viśülaikasülā stands (X. 7) in the midst of accusatives. In IV. 1 we have: samyām colukhalam ca musalam ca drṣaccopalām ceti, here the brāhmaṇa (TS. I. 6. 8. 3) gives the explanation of the irregular nominative drsad. The singular of the verb in yadi rathapurusadayo 'ntarāgni viyāt (XX. 19) is simply due to a thoughtless taking over from Ap. (IX. 10. 15), where only rathaḥ is given as subject. Illogical 
PREFACE. 
xxi 
are: aindragnena..nirudhapasubandhena (X. 1) for nirudha- pasunā and yājñikair vṛkṣaiḥ (III. 5), which means yājñikāṇām vṛkṣāṇām idhmaiḥ. 
13. Traces of an older stratum of language are not rare, but we can be sure that these all rest on simply taking over. Thus vai (X. 18, XXI. 1) and u vai (XX. 10 med.) are met with, but all these passages are taken from a brāh- maņa. Only once a case of tmesis is found: ubhayam samasyet pra ca kramed upatistheta (XVIII. 9), but it is probable that the Sūtrakāra did not comprehend even his source, otherwise he would not have omitted the second ca; the source is the Maitr. samhita (ep. Ap. XVI. 11. 9: pra ca krāmed upa ca tistheta). 
14. General remarks. That the Vaikhanasas are devout worshippers of Viṣņu Nārāyaṇa comes to light very often in their sutra. The performer should fix during certain acts his thoughts on Nārāyaṇa (nārāyaṇam dhyāyan I. 4, I. 14, III. 1); being absorbed in Nārāyaṇa (nārāyaṇaparāyaṇaḥ) he should sit silently (XII. 10); see also XVIII. 20, XX. 1, XXI. 18. During the churning of the fire he should think himself as the mantha, and the fire as Visnu (I. 10). Whilst stepping on the cart he should think himself to be Visnu (IV. 4), see also II. 5. In the intervals of the sacrifice he should, in order to cover them up, fix his thoughts on Visnu as the Lord of the sacrifice (XVII. 6). In connection with this, attention may be drawn to the pundra or (sectarian) mark which is mentioned in our text (II. 6, and op. note 15 on the translation of Smartasūtra I. 3): "Brilliantly shaped the Atman is standing, flaming upward, in the heart, in the middle (as) a crest of fire; in the middle of this crest is the Atman, according to sacred lore. Therefore, at the end of a sacrifice, the performer (the Yaja- mäna) should, after having sprinkled himself wholly (with water) and after having taken ashes from the garhapatya-fire, make on his forehead, on his heart, on his belly, on his arms and on his neck a quadrangular mark in the shape of that flame, as a lamp, upwards pointed. Thereby he gets happiness (during his earthly existence) and finally reaches the unity with the 
xxii 
PREFACE. 
Atman." We may remark that this sectarian remark is post- Vedic our text seems to be one of the oldest where it is a fervent Vaikh nasa mentioned. That the Sutrakāra was appears from the fact that certain bricks are designated (XIX. 3, end), by him only, as vaikhanasiḥ. This is not found in any other source.

F. Interrelation of the Smärta- and the Śrautasutra. 
Now that the Śrautasūtra lays before us, we are better qualified to reconsider the question of priority: whether the Smärtasūtra or the Śrautasutra comes first in the sacred hooks of the Vaikhanasas, cp. §3 in the Introduction to the Translation of the Smartasūtra and the remarks of Prof. B. Keith, who does not agree with my view, in Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, Vol. V, pages 923 ff. 
1. Arguments in favour of the priority of the Smārtasūtra : (a) The words of the Smartasutra (III. 6): udakyāśucyādi- samsarge ca vidhānam yajñaprāyaścitte vaksyāmaḥ refer to Srautasūtra XX. 4. 
PREFACE. 
xxiii 
(b) The pindapitṛyajña is described in full in the Smarta- sūtra (IV. 5-6) and only mentioned in the Śrs. (III. 6). 
(c) The Śrautasūtra presupposes the existence of the Smärta, as in XX. 22 it is said: api vākṛtidahanam kuryus, tad vyakhyātam. The cremation of the effigy is described in Smartasūtra V. 12. 
2. Arguments which to the letter of the text seem to plead in favour of the priority of the Śrautasūtra : 
(a) The Smartasūtra says (I. 8): pātrasruvādayo yajñ, proktaḥ, which refers to Srautasutra IX. 7-11. Here the Bhasya quotes Pāņini (III. 3. 132): āśamsāyām bhūtavac ca | iti nisthaprayogah, which seems to indicate that according to the Bhāṣyakāra the participle on -ta refers to the future. 
(b) In the Dharmasutra II. 3 (=Smärta IX. 3): yathoktam ugnikunḍāni kuryat, which according to the Bhasya refers to Śrautasūtra I. 2 ff. The Bhasya explains: vakṣyamäṇaśrautokta - prakāreṇāgniṣālām tatrāgnikunḍāni gärhapatyādīni kuryāt. 
The arguments in favour of the priority of the Smartasūtra strongly prevail, so the two arguments which seem to plead against it, must not be taken too literally. The author of the Smärtasūtra probably had, when he mentioned the passages quoted under No. 2, in his mind the passages of the Śrauta- sutra, although they were contained in a later part of the work, just as in the description of the avabhṛtha at the end of the Varuṇapraghāsa (VIII. 14) the author of the Śrautasutra refers to the avabhṛtha of the later described sacrifice of soma ; likewise in the same sacrifice he refers (VIII. 8, beg.) to the description of the animal sacrifice, which follows later, in praśna X. 
These internal arguments in favour of the priority of the Smärtasūtra, now, are corroborated by some other facts. In the first place there is the tradition of the Mss. In the Mss. MT the numbers of the prasnas of the Śrautasūtra are, not 1-21, but 12-32, considering thus the Smarta (together with the pravaraprasna) and the Śrauta as one continuous text. Moreover, the Mss. T and V design the text as mūlagṛhya, which can only mean: "based on, or following after the 
xxiv 
PREFACE. 
Grhyasutra". Now, with this fact agrees the tradition of the Vaikhānasas themselves. In their Anandasamhitä (XVII. 38) we read (cp. my paper "On the sacred books of the Vaikhäna. sas", page 4): vaikhānasena muninā dvātrimsatprašnusamkhya- yā | niṣekādiśmaśānāntam mānuṣam karma sücitam. So the rites which relate to man from his birth to his death (including the śrauta-rites!) are contained in 32 prasnas, and that in these praśnas the Smärtasūtra precedes, is distinctly stated by another text (the commentary on Sūtratatparyacintamani, page 20): vaikhānasasya vikhanasā praṇītasya sütrasya dvātrim- satpraśnātmakasya kṛtsnasya sütraratnasya tac ca sūtram smärta- bahudhā pratipadya visaya- 
dharmasrautaṣulbädināmabhir 
bhedena vibhaktam sad vyavahriyate. 
One more argument may be adduced to confirm my thesis about the sequence. It has been remarked (above, page xv) that the Mantrasamhita which belongs to the Śrautasūtra, presupposes the Mantrasamhita which belongs to the Smarta- sutra. So this lastly mentioned Samhita was composed earlier than that which belongs to the Śrautasutra, just as the Smartasūtra preceded the Śrautasūtra. 
we, 
* 
* 
Now comes the question whether the two Sutras were composed by one and the same author. The term vaksyämaḥ in Smärtasūtra III. 6 is no definite proof, because we" might equally well mean: Vaikhānasas so that for instance a pupil of the author of the Smärtasūtra could be meant. It is a fact that the two Sutras are in harmony with each other as to the disposition of the material: the Śrautasutra follows in its arrangement the sequence laid down in the Smärtasūtra I. 1, only the agnicayana and the yajñaprayaścittas are added, the cayana being not a separate samsthā but combinable with any sacrifice of soma. The style of the Śrautasutra is very simple and its contents are for the greatest part directly taken from Baudhayana, Apastamba, or Hiranyakeśin. Nevertheless, as may be seen from the grammatical and stylistic features of the Śrautasutra, the knowledge of his Sanskrit is not that of a good old Sutrakara; in this respect the Śrautasūtra often stands on one line with the Smartasutra, note the placing of 
PREFACE. 
XXV 
the enclitics, the use of the genitive on -āyāḥ and -yāḥ (not °āyai and oyai) of the nouns on - and -7, the forms ädadāti and adadyat as compared with the Smartasutra, see the Translation of the Smartasūtra pages 236, 237. So we may conclude with some degree of certainty that the two sutras were composed by one and the same author. 
1 
We may also state that the work is complete 1, although, to make it a true Śrautasutra, much is missing. It is true that once in the Śrauta the aśvamedha is referred to: yāśva- medhe prāyaścittis tām kṛtvā (XX. 35), but it is rather probable that the Sutrakara has thoughtlessly taken this passage un- altered from Baudhayana (śrs. XXVIII, 6: 354. 11; note also the word prayascitti whilst everywhere else the Vaikh. śrs, uses prāyascitta )2. The whole Sutra should, according to the colophon of Ms. V, contain 359 khandas; but I number 378: this difference of 19 I cannot explain. 
G. The position of the Vaikhanasasūtra amongst the texts of the Black Yajurveda. 
Although in the Introduction to the Translation of the Smärtasūtra some remarks have been made on this material, it may be useful to reconsider it now. For the sake of complete- ness some statements that formerly have been made, will be repeated here. 
One of the introductory verses of the Vyakhyā on the Śrautasutra runs : 
yena vedärtham vijñāya3 lokānugrahakāmyayā | 
pranītam sūtram aukheyam tasmai vikhanase namaḥ || 
1 It is a curious difference between the Smarta- and the Srautasūtra that the last word of each prasna in the Śrs, is put double to indicate the end of the praśna, whilst this is not found in the Smärtasūtra. 
2 In the commentary on Hir. árs. Part V (1927), page 241 a quotation, apparently from an asvamedhaprašna is given, ending iti vaikhānasaḥ. This is suspect. 
s This is the better reading, presented by the Akulamannāḍu copy of the Vyakhyā. 
xxvi 
PREFACE. 
Here, then, the Śrautasūtra is designated as "aukheyasûtra” Now, there is a sloka (13) in the VIIIth chapter of the Ananda samhita: 
aukheyānām garbhacakram nyāsacakram vanaukasām | vaikhānasān vinānyeṣām taptacakram prakīrtitam || 
and ib. (śl. 28): 
aukheyanam garbhacakradikṣa proktā mahātmanām || 
The commentary on the first passage declares the Aukheyas, to be identical with the Vaikhānasas, and this must be right, as precisely for the Vaikhanasas this ceremony of garbha- cakra, and not the imprinting of the disc on the two arms by means of a heated metal (the taptacakra), is required.--To these passages where the Aukheyas are mentioned come the colophons of the two Mss. T and V: iti śrīmadaukheyaśākhāyām vikhanasä prokte śrīvaikḥānasasütre (such and such) prašnaḥ, and; śrīmad- aukheyaśākhāyām vikhanasā ṛṣiņā prokte, etc. The colophon of a Ms. described in the Triennial Catalogue of Madras, vol. IV, No. 3469 presents the variant: śrimadaukheyarṣiprokte, etc., with which cp. the colophon at the end of the 7th prašna in the MS. V srimadaukheyaviracitakalpasütre, etc. According to these colophons the Śrautasutra is either directly composed by Aukheya, or it belongs to the Aukheyaśākhā and is proclaimed by Vikhanas. Now, when we look through the Caraṇavyuha in its various recensions, through Ramakṛṣṇa's Samskāragaṇa- pati and the Puranas (see R. Simon, Beiträge Zur Kenntnis der Vedischen Schulen), the fact strikes us, that nowhere any mention is made of the Vaikhanasas. On the other hand, the Aukheyas are mentioned in these texts. The Caraṇavyuha (ed. of Benares, Samvat 1959, page 28) has: 
+ 
tatra taittiriyakā nāma dvibheda bhavanty: aukheyāḥ khāndikeyās ceti; tatra khānḍikeyā nāma pañca bhedĩ bhavanti : kāletā sātyāyanî hairanyakesi bhāradvājy āpastambīti. 
If this first splitting up of the Taittiriyakas into Aukheyas and Khaṇḍikeyas were right, we might infer that the Aukheyas or Vaikhānasas were not a caraṇa, but a sākhä, possessing a Samhita, Brāhmaṇa, and Sutras of their own. This would fit in well with the remark made above. But it is known that 
PREFACE. 
xxvii 
the text of the Caraṇavyuha is unreliable: it presents too many variants, see Simon in his treatise on the Vedic Schools, pages 18 and 19. There is another tradition according to which the Aukheyas (variants Audheyas, Augheyas) are reckoned as the last of the Khaṇḍikeyas, coming after Hiranyakesin. This agrees more with the tradition as handed down in the Vaija- yanti, the Bhasya of Hiranyakeśiśrautasutra. It is to be hoped that future research will throw light on this important question. As matters stand now, it is impossible to decide. We do not even know whether the name aukheya was intended for the whole ritualistic Sutra of the Vaikhanasas (Smarta- and Śrauta- sutra) or for the Śrautasutra alone. In this context attention may be drawn to the fact, that, whilst in the Smartasutra the 
sage 
Vikhanas is mentioned a few times, this is not the case with the Śrautasutra, for the only passage where he is mentioned (at the end of the whole Sutra) is clearly a later addition: it follows after the repetition of the two words which obviously mark the end of the prasna. 
H. The relation of the Vaikhānasaśrautasūtra to the (other) 
Taittiriyasutras. 
The Śrautasutra of the Vaikhanasas has relatively little original matter: the author draws largely on the work of his predecessors: Baudhayana, Apastamba, Hiranyakesin. The sequence of the material is somewhat different, as he maintains anxiously the order as given in the first prasna of the Smartasutra. In two respects he is individual: in insert- ing in its due place each act of the " Sacrificer" (to which Baudhayana, Apastamba and Hiranyakeśin devote a separate chapter: the yājamāna), and in inserting the pravargya into the agnistoma, whereas the other Sutras reserve this matter for a separate chapter. Original work of the author himself is the detailed description of the fire-drill in I. 1, although he here made use of a Kathaka-text; the precise description of the places (the kundas) for the sacrificial fires in I. 1-2; the des- cription of the sacrificial utensils in XI. 7-10. Nearly all the rest has been taken from older sources, though many details 
are new.

PREFACE. 
In order to thoroughly comprehend our text, strictly speaking the knowledge of the Mantrasambitā is a desideratum. However, But only a small part of it is, as yet, known to us. the diligent leader will soon perceive that nearly all the mantras, which are not found in the books of the Taittiriyas, can be traced in Apastamba or Hiranyakesin. So the lack of the Mantrasamhita is not so very great. 
Although, then, after all, the Vaikhānasasrautasūtra does not leave us much that was, up to now, unknown to us, it need not be said that the publication of this late vedic text is superfluous. Of the Veda so much has gone lost, that we must be thankful for every contribution to the knowledge of it. And, apart from the question how much we learn from the text itself, its publication has a special interest, as it enables us to fix some doubtful points, although, it is true, it gives us new riddles to solve. 
1. On the Vaikhānasas and their sacred books in general. 
What, up to the present time, is known to Western Scholars about the Vaikhānasas, rests on very scanty information. As far as I know, all our knowledge about this Vaisnava sect is based on H. H. Wilson's paper: "Religious sects of the Hindus" from the year 1832, reprinted in: "Essays on the Religion of the Hindus," Vol. I, page 16: "The Vaikhanasas appear to have been but little different from the Vaisnavas especially so called; at least Anandagiri has not particularised the difference; they worshipped Nārāyaṇa as supreme God and wore his marks". It is therefore with pleasure that I here sent to may publish "a short note on the Vaikhanasasütra me by one of their prominent leaders Pandit Parthasarathi Iyangar of Akulamannäḍu, a note which contains useful information about this sect, which in Europe is nearly unknown. The "note" of the Pandit runs as follows:

"This Vaikhanasasutram is one of the many kalpasutrams and treats of smarta-, dharma- and śrautakarmas and does not require to be amplified from any other sutram for any informa- tion. It is especially important and noteworthy in that itPRETACE.

treats of no other deity except Sri Vishnu, while all other sutras treat of many deities. The book known as grhyaparisishta is in appendix to this text and this is a supplement and must be read along with the text to get the full amount of information on the above subject1. 
The ascetics of the Visishta dvaita 2 philosophy are en- joined by their sutram to wear the tridandam, tuft of hair, and yajñopavītam, which is not laid down in any other sutram. 
Further their sutram ordains that the God should be worshipped in temples in his form of Vigraha *. 
The four- 
This sutram is the oldest of all the sutrams. faced Brahma, desirous of learning the visishtadvaita, came down to this world in the form of a man named Vaikhanasa, and performed penance in the Naimisaranya. Śrī Vishnu was much pleased with him and made him understand the Vaishnavasutram". The dharmasastras written by Manu and other sages are done after this sutram and have their origin in this sutram. The sutram treats of the duties and obliga- tions of the ascetics: the Vanaprasthas, and it is on this account that the third stage of man's life, known as Vana- prasthasramam came to be named Vaikhanasasramam. 
Vikhanas, the founder of this sutram, is only an incarna- tion of Brahma, as stated above. Besides this he has com- posed a book known as devikasutram, which treats of the method of worship of the God in temples, the performance of puja and also the rules governing the construction, up-keep and maintenance of temples. This book was so voluminous and big, that four of his trusted disciples, as Bhrgu, Marichi, Atri and Kasyapa summarized the same. But even these so

PREFACE. 
called summaries amount to over four lakshas of granthams, known as Bhagavacchastram as exposed by Vikhanas. All the mantras required for the karmas have been separately compiled into a separate book known as the Vaikhanasamantra- praśnam, in the order as in the sutrams themselves. This collection should be read along with the sutram to understand the karma and its corresponding mantra. 
All who follow the sutram in their daily life are followers and worshippers of Sri Vishnu alone at all times and in all places, and no other deity, either publicly or privately. As directed in their sutram these Vaikhanasas officiate in temples as archakas. None of the demerits attached to people of other sutrams and who officiate in temples as archakas, are attached to these Vaikhanasas. These Vaikhanasas officiate in famous temples in Tirupati, one of the most prominent of the well- known places of pilgrimage in India. 
This sutram accepts the principle of Tattvatraya, i.e., the principle of the jiva, Isvara and prakṛti, and lays down the principle of archanam of Sri Mahavishnu Divyamangalavigraha coupled with Bhakti throughout life. Lakshmivisishṭādvaitabhashyam of Śrinivasamakhivedanta- desika, author of Śrivaikhanasasutratatparyachintamani and 
other similar works. 
This is clear from 
Unlike the followers of other sutrams, the Vaikhanasas do not accept the principle of interdining, etc., but unlike these sutrajnas these Vaikhanasas teach each other alike whatever their customs and habits be, which are peculiar to different places. 
These Vaikhanasas have not taptachakrankanam1 unlike the other Vaishnavas who consider this as the essential mark, requisite for one to be called a Vaishnava. 
Further, these Vaikhanasas do not worship in their houses the Alwars and Acharyas of the other Śrī Vaishnavites, nor do they recite their prabandhams at home and do not worship in

Mathadhipatis as acharyas. They do not worship the Matha- dhipatis of either the Advaita or Dvaita schools of philosophy likewise. Thus they form a separate independant minority within the Vaishnava community, as the followers of their Acharya and Bhashyakara Srinivasa Dikshita. 
The existence of Vaikhanasas, their mode of life and form of worship is spoken of at odd places in the Śrutis and old scripture as Mahabharatam and later dated kavyas as Kalidasa's Šakuntala, etc. 
These Vaikhanasas are in large numbers in the Andhra districts of Kistna, Guntur and Godavari, but in Ganjam, Vizagapatam, Vellore, Cuduppah, Cochin, Bellary, Ananta- puram and Kurnool districts they are few in number. In the Tamil districts of Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Chingleput and Chittoor districts they are fairly large in number, but small in the districts of Tinnevelly, Ramnad, Salem, Coimbatore, North Arcot and South Arcot. They are sparingly found on the west coast in Cochin, Coorg and Malabar and also in Mysore. In the Nizam's dominions, in places close to Andhra- desa are found many Vaikhanasas. In Karuppur village in the Tanjore district there is a fairly large number of these Vaikhanasas. There are practically no Vaikhanasas in Northern India as far as is known. 
There is evidence both oral and documentary of these people having officiated and officiating in big temples under the management of well-known persons and well-to-do people. But at present they mostly follow this profession alone. The reason for this is not quite clear. Perhaps it will be owing to their not being able to find time for their business, having once undertaken this profession, or they have thought them- selves destined for this job alone. Yet most of the Vaikha- nasas at present are only archakas." 
So far the Pandit, who finally draws my attention on the Mythic Journal of Bangalore, 1919, where an article is pub- lished by T. V. Seshagiri Aiyer of Madras: "a little-known Vaishnava sect". I regret, not to have been able to consult this Journal.

PREFACE. 
Of the sacred books belonging to the school of the Vaikha. nasas now lay before us: 
1. The Smartasutra with English translation and the Mantrasamhita belonging to the same. 
2. The Srautasutra (its Mantrasamhita, unpublished, is only partly known). 
These are the rites for man. On the books (ägamas), describing the rites of the God, which are said to be composed by Marici, Bhrgu, Atri and Kasyapa, see my paper "On the sacred books of the Vaikhanasas, page 4. 
Of these are now published. 
1. The Anandasamhitä by Mariei, in four parts (1924-25) edited in the collection Vaikhinasagranthamil of Akula- mannādu. 
2. The Vimänärchanakalpa attributed to the same Sage, published in one Volume in the same series (1927). 
3. The Prakirṇadhikara, one of the agamas attributed to Bhrgu, edited by M. Rimakṛṣṇa Kavi at Madras (1929). 
4. The Yajñādhikära, attributed to Bhrgu, edited by Ranga - charya as vol. 21 of the Vaikhanasagranthamälä (1931). 
Of the Arcanikäṇḍa ascribed to Kasyapa (I myself possess the text with commentary, a copy made at Madras) an edition is forthcoming, as I am informed by the often men- tioned Pandit. Meanwhile a commentary on this text, the Arcananavanīta has been printed in the series Vaikhanasa - granthamala (1929). Of the other agamas many seem to be lost, but complete Mss. of some of these exist. It is to be hoped that once also these may be made accessible. 
K. Tabular Concordance of the Vaikhanasukrautasütra with the corresponding Chapters of Apastamba and Baudhāyana. 
In order not only to comprehend the text of the Vaikhanasa- śrautasutra, but also to test its originality, it may be useful to place at the side of each chapter of the Vaikhanasa-text the corresponding one of Apastamba (Hiranyakesin being for the greater part identical with Apastamba) or Baudhayana. The comparison of the scattered parts of the yājamāna has been neglected, because this would bring in too many details.

L. Acknowledgment of thanks. 
At the end of this Preface I have to acknowledge my heartiest thanks, for putting manuscript material at my disposition, to the Anglo-dayanand College at Lahore, to the Librarian of the University of Lahore, to the Director of the Adyar Library at Madras, but above all to Pandit Parthasarathi Iyangar of Akulamannadu, who most kindly and disinterestedly allowed me the use of his valuable manuscripts.

4. The Vāyavya-pots[^1] are (each) one a span in height with their heads pointing upwards, with their spouts in the upper parts, and compressed in the middle.  

[^1]: These are in all sixteen pots enumerated in XII.1.6-2.4. Soma is scooped in them for different deities. Still they are called Vāyavya (connected with Vāyu). For the details see TS VI.7.2.

14. According to the opinion of some (ritualists) these animals should be killed not separately in the various sacrifices but rather in addition (to the preceding one) in each successive sacrifice. Thus in the Agniṣṭoma they seize (a he-goat) for Agni; in the Ukthya (a he-goat) for Indra-and Agni as the second; in the Ṣodaśin a ram for Indra as the third; in the Atirātra a ewe for Sarasvatī as the fourth.[^1]

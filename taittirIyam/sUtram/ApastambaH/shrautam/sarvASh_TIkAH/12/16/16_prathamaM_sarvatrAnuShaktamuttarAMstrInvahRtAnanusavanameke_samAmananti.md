16. According to the opinion of some (ritualists) the first (formula viz. drapsaścaskanda...) should be connected everywhere (=with all the three pressings); the latter three be used severally in accordance with the pressing, respectively.[^1]   

[^1]: Thus with the first verse the first libation should be offered in every pressing. Each of the remaining verses is to be used for the second libation in every pressing respectively.

19. If (the Adhvaryu) desires, “May I make him (the sacrificer) equal in valour with his enemy,” having taken the cups in an even line the libation should be offered by (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātr̥) standing in an even line. Having offered the libation in an even line, the two should deposit the cups in an even line.[^1]

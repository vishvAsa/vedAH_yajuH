13. Then (the Adhvaryu) orders: “Let the goblet of the Hotr̥ go forth to (the Sadas); forth (the one) of the Brahman; forth (the one) of the Udgātr̥; forth (the one) of the sacrificer" According to the opinion of some (he should say) “forth (the one) of the Udgātr̥s"—"forth (the one) of the Sadasya"[^1] -Or “Let (the goblet) of the Sadasyas[^2] go forth”.   

[^1]: For this see X.1.10.   

[^2]: The plural word Sadasyas should be understood in the sense of the R̥tvijs found in the Sadas viz. Āgnīdhra etc. For this expression cf. ŚB IV.2.1.29.

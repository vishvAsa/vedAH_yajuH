14. Then they[^1] cause the Hotras to be offered.  

[^1]: Every time the Adhvaryu causes the Āgnīdhra to say astu śrauṣaṭ and then each one of the Hotrakas recites the offering verse and the Adhvaryu offers the libation. Therefore the plural is used.  

[^2]: The word hotra is equivalent to the Hotrakas here. Cf. ŚB IV.2.1.29.  

[^3]: Cf. ŚB IV.2.1.32; KB XIII.6.

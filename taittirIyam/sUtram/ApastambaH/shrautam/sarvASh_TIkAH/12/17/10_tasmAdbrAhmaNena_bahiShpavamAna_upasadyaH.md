10. “Therefore the act of sitting near (at the time of the chanting of) the Bahiṣapavamāna (-laud) should be done by a Brāhmaṇa. For it is purifying. He should remove him away from the Bahiṣpavamāna whom he hates”—Thus is known from a Brāhmaṇa-text.[^2]  

[^1]: Since Aśvins who were doing the work of medical treatment of diseased men and thereby had become impure, became purified by means of the Bahiṣpavamāna.  

[^2]: TS VI.4.9.2; KS XXVII.4.

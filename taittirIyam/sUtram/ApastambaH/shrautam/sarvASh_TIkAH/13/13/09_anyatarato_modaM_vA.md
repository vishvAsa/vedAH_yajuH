9. Or with (the word) moda (only) in one part: madā moda iva (at the end of each half-verse) and othāmo daiva at the end of each verse).   

[^1]: Cp. ŚB IV.3.2.13. Here in the printed text of Garbe we read othā moda iva. Caland's translation reads the same. But in that case the condition that the word moda be only on one side cannot be fulfilled. In ŚB IV.3.2.13 the expression othāmo daiva vāk is mentioned as a response according to some ritualists. KātyāŚS IX.13.29 mentions the expression othāmo daiva as the responsse. It is better to amend the text of the ĀpŚS in the light of the above mentioned details and translate it accordingly as has been done
by me.

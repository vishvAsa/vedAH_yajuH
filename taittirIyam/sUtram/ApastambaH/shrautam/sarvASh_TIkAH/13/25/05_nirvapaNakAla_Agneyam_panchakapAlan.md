At the time of pouring out (of the oblation-material) he pours out (the oblation-material viz. the unhusked-rice grains) for the sacrificial bread to be prepared on five[^1] potsherds for Agni; or .... on eight[^2] potsherds...... If the sacrificial bread is prepared on five potsherds then the Saṁyājyās[^3] should be in Gāyatri metre. If ... on eight potsherds.... in Paṅkti metre.

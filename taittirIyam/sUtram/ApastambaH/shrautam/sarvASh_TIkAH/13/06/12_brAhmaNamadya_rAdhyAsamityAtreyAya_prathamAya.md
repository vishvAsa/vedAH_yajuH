12. In the first place! (the sacrificer) gives a piece of gold to (a brāhmin) belonging to the Atri-(family) with brāhmaṇa madya rādhyāsam... Or (he may give it to him) in the second or third place.  

[^1]: This is in contrast to XIII.6.1. According to ŚB IV.3.4.21, first a gift is to be given to Āgnīdhra. Then to one belonging to Atri family. According to Rudradatta a gift should be given to one belonging to Atri-family in the first place and then to Āgnīdhra etc. If the second alternative is accepted then first to Āgnīdhra and then the person belonging to Atri-family. If the third alternative is accepted then first to Āgnīdhra then to the Hotr̥ and then to one
belonging Atri-family.

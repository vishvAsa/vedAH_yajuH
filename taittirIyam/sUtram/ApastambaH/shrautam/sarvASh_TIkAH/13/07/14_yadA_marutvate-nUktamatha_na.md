14. After the invitatory verse in connection with (the offering of the scoop to Indra) Marutvat[^1] has been recited, no gift should be given (and) no one be accepted.  

[^1]: This scoop is offered immediately after the ritual of giving of gifts is over. The Sūtra is based on KS XXVIII.3; cp. also MS VI.6.8.

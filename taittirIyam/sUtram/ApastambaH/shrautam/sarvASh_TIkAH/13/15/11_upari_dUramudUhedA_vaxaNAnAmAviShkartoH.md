11. It is known from (the Brāhmaṇa-texts) "She should lift her (lower garment) far away until her crotch becomes manifest.[^1] Thereby her progeny is born with unashamed face.”[^2]   

[^1]: Rudradatia's commentary has exactly reverse. According to him yathorusandhir nāviṣkr̥taḥ syāttathoddhared vāsaḥ. “She should lift her garment in such a way that the crotch will not be manifest.” 
It is not clear from where he gets the word na.  

[^2]: Cf. KS XXVI.1; TMB VIII.7.11.

10. According to the opinion (of the ritualists belonging to the) R̥gveda (there should be) a milk-mess for Mitrāvaruṇa instead of the Anūbandhyā(cow). Sitting in front of the Havirdhāna(-shed), and without breathing, the Hotr̥ recites the offering-verse for it. (This rite) beginning with the oblation and ending with the Iḍā stands completely established (i.e. is concluded thereby); or it may be beginning either with the Prayāja(fore-offering)s, or with the (offering of) ghee portions.[^2] According to the opinion of some (ritualsits it) ends with the Iḍā.

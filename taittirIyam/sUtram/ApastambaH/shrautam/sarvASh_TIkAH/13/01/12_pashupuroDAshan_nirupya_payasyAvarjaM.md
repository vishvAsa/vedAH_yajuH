12. After (the Adhvaryu) has taken out (the grains for) the animal-sacrificial-bread,[^1] the oblations connected with the pressing (should be pepared) except the milk-mess.[^2]  

[^1]: This is conneted with XII.18.15 and continued in XIII. 11.3. At the morning pressing the omentum of the animal is offered; at the midday-pressing animal-sacrificial-bread is offered and at the third pressing the limbs of the animal are offered. In this way animal sacrifice is linked with the three pressings.

11. Then (the Adhvaryu) orders, “O Āgnīdhra do you sit upon the lap of the Neṣṭr̥. O Neṣṭr̥ do you bring the wife of the Sacrificer (towards the Udgātr̥).[^1] O Unnetr̥ do you fill the goblets after the Hotr̥'s goblet has been filled, do you leave some space for the Dhruva in the Hotr̥'s goblet. (O Neṣṭr̥), cause the wife of the sacrificer be seen by the Udgātr̥; (O sacrificer's wife), do you make the water flow down."[^2]

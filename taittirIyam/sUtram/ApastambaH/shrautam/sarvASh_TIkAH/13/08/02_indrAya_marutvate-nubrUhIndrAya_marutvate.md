2. The orders (for reciting the invitatory verse and the offering verse should be) indrāya marutvate'nubrūhi[^1] (to the Hotr̥) and indrāya marutvate preṣya (to the Maitrāvaruṇa) respectively. (The two scoops) should have the second Vaṣaṭ call[^2] or not;[^3] or only one of them should be with a second vaṣaṭ-call. After the two have poured the remnants into each other's cup in the same manner as in the case of the offering to the dual divinities, the Adhvaryu takes the third Marutvatīya (scoop) by means of the cup the Soma in which has not been drunk.[^4] The formulae for filling and depositing should be marutvān indra... (and eṣa te yoniḥ)[^5] (respectively). The Pratiprasthātr̥ carries (the remnant of the Soma for) the drinking. The two Adhvaryus drink from their own sides.[^6]

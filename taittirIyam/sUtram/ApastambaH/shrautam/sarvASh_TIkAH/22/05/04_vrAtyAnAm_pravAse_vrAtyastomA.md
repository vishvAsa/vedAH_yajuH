4. In (Order to lead the ) life of the Vratyas, Vrātyastomas are to be performed; they are to be performed as Ukthyas with (the Rathantara as the first Pr̥ṣṭhastotra. The second Vrātyastoma can be optionally performed as an Agniṣṭoma (also).[^1]  

[^1]: Thus the Vrātyastomas are to be performed by those Āhitāgni sacrificers who intend to become Vrātyas. Vrātyastomas are Soma sacrifices and can be performed only by Āhitāgnis and not by Vrātyas. This is quite in contranst with Kātyāyanaśrautasūtra XXII.4.27-28 according to which Vrātyas have to perform the Vrātyastomas and after these sacrifices are performed, they should stop leading the life of Vrātyas and then they became socially acceptable. It seems that Āpastamba represents the original tradition because only an Āhitāgni can perform any Soma-sacrifice. A Vrātya who is an out-caste even according to Kātyāyana is really speaking unable to perform any Śrauta ritual. So there is a contradition in Kātyāyana's view. There is none in that of Āpastamba. The modern scholars have not paid attention to this Sūtra of Āpastamba.

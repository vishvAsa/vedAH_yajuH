26. (If the sacrifice) desires (that the enemy) should be killed (then) he should use the Rathantara-sāman as the Pavamāna-laud (at the time of the midday-pressing) and should use the Br̥hat-sāman as the first Pr̥ṣṭha-stotra; if he desires (that the enemy) should be conquered, (then) he should do the reverse[^1].

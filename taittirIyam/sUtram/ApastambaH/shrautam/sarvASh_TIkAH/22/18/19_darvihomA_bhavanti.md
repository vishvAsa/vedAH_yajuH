19. There should be libations with ladles[^1].  

[^1]: For the manner in which Darvihomas are to be offered see XXIV.3.9. Thus while offering these the Adhvaryu should be sitting to the west of the fire-altar with his right knee bent or not bent. According to Rudradatta on XV.6.57 in the Darvihomas the details of purification mentioned in the Gr̥hya-ritual are to be followed. For these details see Āpastambagr̥hya-Sutra I.22.

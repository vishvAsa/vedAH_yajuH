15. (In this sacrifice) everything in the Rājasūya except the ritual connected with the Uttaravedi takes place.[^1]  

[^1]: Cf. TB II.7.5.2. Thus in this sacrifice all the Soma-sacrifices, animal-sacrifices and the Cāturmāsya-sacrifices which are included in the Rājasūya and are connected with the Uttaravedi are dropped. Only the Iṣṭis in the Rājasūya take place here.

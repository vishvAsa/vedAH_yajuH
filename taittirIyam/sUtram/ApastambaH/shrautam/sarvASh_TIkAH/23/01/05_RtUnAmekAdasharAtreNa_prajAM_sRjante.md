5. By means of the Eleven-day-sacrifificial-session[^1] of the R̥tus (seasons), the performers produce progeny, get progeny, obtain progeny, become possessors of progeny.[^2]  

[^1]: According to what has been said in XXII. 14.1 this sacrifice should be considered as an Ahīna. But this sacrifice seems to be an exception. The support for this sacrifice being considered as an exception is provided by TS VII.2.6.2. where the expression “āsate (sit)" is used which is generally used in connection with sacrificial session. Moreover this sacrifice has an Atirātra on both the sides. This peculiarity makes it a Sattra.  

[^2]: For this sacrificial-session see in general TS VII.2.6.1-3.

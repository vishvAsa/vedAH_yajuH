8. (The days in it are as follows): an Agniṣṭut with nine versed Stoma, the three-day-period of Jyotis, Go, Āyus, the ten days of the Dvādaśāha, and an Atirātra.[^1]  

[^1]: The first day in this session is not an Atirātra. This is an exception to the rule mentioned in XXII.1.3; cf. TMB XXXII.8.1-4. In TMB XXIII.8.3-4 it is said that because there is an Atirātra only on one side (only at the end) therefore this sacrifice is as good as an Ahīna; and because there are the ten days of the Dvādaśāha included here therefore it is as good as a sacrificial-session. Thereby one obtains the results of an Ahīna as well as those of a sacrificial session.

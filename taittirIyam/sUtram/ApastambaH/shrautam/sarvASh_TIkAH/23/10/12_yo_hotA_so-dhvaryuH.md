12. In this sacrificial-session the Hotr̥ is also the Adhvaryu; he is (also) the Potr̥. The Udgātr̥ is (also) the Neṣṭr̥, he is (also) the Acchāvāka. The Maitrāvaruṇa is (also) the Brahman, he is (also) the Pratihartr̥. The Prostotr̥ is (also) the Brāhmaṇā chaṁsin, he is (also) the Grāvastut. The Pratiprasthātr̥ is (also) the Agnīdh, he is (also) the Unnetr̥. The Subrahmaṇya is the same as Subrahmaṇya.[^1]   

[^1]: Cf. TMB XXV.4.5. Thus except Subrahmaṇya each one of the other priests have to carry out the duties of three priests. Thus each one of these must be expert in three Vedas.

7. In the second (Sārasvata sacrificial session there should be a day with nine-versed-stoma, the Br̥haspatisava, the Go, and the Āyus as the bellies of Indra (Indrakukṣī).[^1]  

[^1]: Cp. TMB XXV. 11.1. In the place of a day with fifteen-versed stoma, Āpastamba has mentioned Br̥haspatisava. In every month in the first fortnight every day a sacrifice with nine-versed-stoma is to be performed; in the second fortnight every day Br̥haspatisava is to be performed. Then on every Full-moon-day the Go and on every New-moon-day the Āyus is to be performed. The Go and 
Āyus appear to be metaphoridly described as the bellies of Indra.

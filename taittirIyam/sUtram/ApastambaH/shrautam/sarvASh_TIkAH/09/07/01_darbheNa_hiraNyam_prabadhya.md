1. Having tied gold by means of a Darbha-blade one should carry it to the east. A much knowing,[^1] Brāhmaṇa from a (good family of a) sage should lift up the fire (and) follow one. (The Adhvaryu) should follow one (carrying) with (him) the Agnihotra-(milk). Having placed the fire on gold in the place (of the fire), after the Agnihotra-(milk) is deposited (near the fire), having sat without breathing as long as one can hold the breath, having then breathed, then having offered the Agnihotra (in the usual manner), having stood near (the fire while praising it) with bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, one should offer rice-pap to Varuṇa.[^2]

4. Now according to some (ritualists): "The sacrifice of him is indeed cut in whose sacrifice after it has been continued (started to be performed) they perform this offering in between. Whatever this sacrificial bread on eight potsherds for Agni is, the same should be made the one for Agni Pathikr̥t either on the Full-moon-day or New moon-day. By means of it one indeed finds out the path again, (and) does not cut the sacrifice." This is known (from a Vedic text).[^1]

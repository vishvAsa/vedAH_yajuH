17. If a cart or a chariot passes between the two fires, in that case having caused the Āhavanīya to be extinguished one should lift up fire from the Gārhapatya with these (verses) beginning with yadagne pūrvaṁ prabhr̥taṁ and tvamagne saprathā asi.[^1] Then one should perform an offering to Agni Pathikr̥t as described earlier.[^2]

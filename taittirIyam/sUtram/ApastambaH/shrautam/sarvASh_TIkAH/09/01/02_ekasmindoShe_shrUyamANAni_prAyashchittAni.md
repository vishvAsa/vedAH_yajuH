2. The expiations being heard (in the Veda) in connection with one and the same defect should be combined together (i.e. only one (and not all) should be performed) because the purpose is different.[^1]  


[^1]: A sacrificer who has omitted either of the new and full moon offerings should perform either an offering to Agni Pathikr̥t (15 II.2.2.1) or the one for Vaiśvānara (TS II.2.5.4.). The purpose of the offering to Agni Pathikr̥t is to return to the correct path and that of the one for Vaiśvārara is to obtain heaven. Since the purpose is different both these offerings should not be performed together but only one of them be performed.

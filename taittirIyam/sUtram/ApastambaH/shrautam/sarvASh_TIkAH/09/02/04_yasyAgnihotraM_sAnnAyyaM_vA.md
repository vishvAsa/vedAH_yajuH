He whose Agnihotra-milk or the Sāṁnāyya-milk may spill (at the time of being cooked), should, after having turned to the north, having taken up a fossilised ant-hill, having poured (the Agnihotra/Sāṁnāyya-milk) on the fossilized ant-hill with a verse addressed to Prajāpati beginning with prajāpate na tvadetānī, having stood near (the fossilized ant-hill) while praising it with bhuḥ, having milked another (cow), offer the libation once again.[^1] If it is Sāṁnāyya (that is spilled) he should cause another Sāṁnāyya to be prepared.

21. If the sacrificer dies while the offering is not completely established (i.e. not yet completed), then in that case having taken the portion from all the sides (of the oblation-material) and having put them collectively (in the ladle), having recited the names of (all) the deities, he should offer (them) with the expression svāhā.[^1]

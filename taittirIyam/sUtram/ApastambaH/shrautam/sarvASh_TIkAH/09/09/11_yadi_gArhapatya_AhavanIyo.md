11. If the Gārhapatya or Āhavanīya gets extinguished one should churn out fire out of the same extinguished fuel pieces. If there are no such extinguished fuel-pieces, having besmeared the churning sticks with ashes one should churn out fire. It is known (from a Brāhmaṇa-text): "One produces it (the fire) from its (of the fire) own womb."[^1]

6. After the evening-Agnihotra has been offered, if the fire in the east is extinguished, in that case, having kept the Agnihotra-milk on the fire or having taken the milk (into ladle) one should run towards the east (i.e. towards the Āhavanīya) along with the Agnihotra-milk. A much-knowing Brāhmaṇa should lift up the fire (from the Gārhapatya to the Āhavanīya). One should give that thing which one would not have given previously to a Brāhmaṇa as a gift. It is known from a Brāhmaṇa-text that one causes him to fall by means of something which is not fallen.[^1]

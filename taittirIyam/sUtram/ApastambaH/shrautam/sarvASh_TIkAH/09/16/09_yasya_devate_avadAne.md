The sacrificer in whose sacrifice the deities, portions of the offering-material, offering-materials or invitatory and offering verses are exchanged or the offering-material taken for a particular deity but not yet offered spills out, or a deity is omitted, should give something which is abundant in his house (to the Adhvaryu as a gift).

8. A sacrificer whose offering-material (rice etc.) when taken spills out, should give an animal (like a cow or sheep) which cuts (grass with its teeth and eats) (to the Adhvaryu). If (the offering-material) which has been purified (spills out) then a shining thing should be given; according to some, in this case, a gift chosen (by the Adhvaryu) should be given.[^1]

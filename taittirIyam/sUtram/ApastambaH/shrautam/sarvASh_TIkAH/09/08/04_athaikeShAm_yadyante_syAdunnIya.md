4. Now according to some (ritualists) if (the cause of expiation) happens near (the time of Agnihotra-performance then having taken (milk into ladle)[^1] one should run towards the east i.e. towards the Āhavanīya. Having sat down one should remain seated as long as one can control one's breath. When one will be exhausted and will breathe then one should make the libation with bhūḥ svāhā. It is known (from a Brāhmaṇa text) "Prajāpati indeed is bhūḥ. One should approach him; he (Prajāpati) causes him to take (milk into the ladle) the sacrificer does not get pain".[^2]

7. Now according to some: Nirr̥ti takes possession of him whose offering-material gets burnt. He should perform the ritual with whatever remains. He should give the same gift and remnants of the offering-material to his enemy. He indeed makes him to be possessed by Nirr̥ti—This is known from a Brāhmaṇa-text.[^1]  


[^1]: For Sūtras 6-7 cp. MS 1.4.13.

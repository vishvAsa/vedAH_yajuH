9. One who has not reached prosperity should not perform a sacrifice in honour of Mahendra. There are three Gataśrīs (those who have reached prosperities[^1] )—thus has been said in a Brāhmaṇa-text.[^2]  

[^1]: viz. one who is a scholar of Veda, one who is the leader of a village and one who is going to become a king are described to be Gataśrīs. See the next note.

8. With adṛirasi vānaspatyaḥ[^1] having taken the pestle (in his hand) with haviṣkṛdehi[^2] he strikes three times (the grains with the pestle). Or without striking he calls the preparer of the oblation.[^3]  

[^1]: TS I.1.5.m-n.  

[^2]: TB III.2.5.8.  

[^3]: Thus he does not call simultaneously with the act of striking but rather before the act of striking.

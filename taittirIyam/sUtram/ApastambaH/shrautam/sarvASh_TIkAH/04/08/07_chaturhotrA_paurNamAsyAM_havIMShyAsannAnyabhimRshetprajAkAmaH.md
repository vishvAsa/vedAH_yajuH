7. A (sacrificer) desirous of progeny should touch the oblation-materials, which have been placed, with Cāturhotr̥ formula[^1] on the Full-moon-day; a (sacrificer) desirous to get heaven (should touch the oblation-materials which have been placed) with Pañcahotr̥ formula.[^2] In the opinion of some (ritualists) this is as good as obligatory.

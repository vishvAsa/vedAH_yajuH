1. Sautrāmaṇī offering and[^1] an offering of milk-mess (Āmikṣā) for Mitra and Varuṇa, the Sākaṁprasthāyīya[^2] offering, a five-holed[^3] rice-pap and the Pañcaśāradīya[^4] offering.[^5]  

[^1]: The text reads 'ca'. Caland suggests va and compares XVIII.7.15. This suggestion appears to be plausible.  

[^2]: See III.16. 11-17.3.  

[^3]: For the details see the next Sūtra.  

[^4]: For this see XXII.20.9-21.11.  

[^5]: For this Sūtra cp. ŚB XIII.6.2.20. While translating these two Sūtras Caland says that one should enter into the village after having performed Traidhātavīya-offering, This does not appear to be correct. The text reads grāmaṁ vā praviśya i.e. after having entered in the village.

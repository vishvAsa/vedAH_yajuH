18. “If a (sacrificer who is) not rich establishes fies, he may at will give only one cow (as a gift). That (cow) becomes the representative of (all) the cows"—thus is known from a Brāhmaṇa-text.[^1]  


[^1]: This is the view of Paiṅgaka Brāhmaṇa (cf. Jamini-śrautasūtra XXII; cf. also Baudhāśs II.7) which is not available.

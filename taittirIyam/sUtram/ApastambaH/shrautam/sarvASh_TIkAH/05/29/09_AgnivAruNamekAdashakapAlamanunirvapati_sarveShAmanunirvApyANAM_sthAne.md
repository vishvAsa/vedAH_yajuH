9. In the place of all the offerings which follow the Tanūhavis or of those connected with two deities he offers (a sacrificial bread) on eleven potsherds for Agni-and-Varuṇa[^1].  


[^1]: Thus after the sacrificial bread for Agni the Tanūhavis offerings (V.21.1-11) are performed; then only one bread for Agni and Varuṇa is to be offered and the offerings mentioned in V.22.1-9 are not to be performed.

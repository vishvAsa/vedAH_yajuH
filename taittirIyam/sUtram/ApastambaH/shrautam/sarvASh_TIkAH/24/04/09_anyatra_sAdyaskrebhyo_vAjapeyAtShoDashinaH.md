This does not apply to the Sādyaskras, the Vājapeya, the Ṣoḍaśin, and the Sārasvata Sattra.

#####  Commentary

With regard to the Ṣoḍaśin and its vikāra, the Vājapeya, the laying of the fire is not mentioned. In the case of the Sādyaskras, it becomes impossible, because they have to be quickly finished. In the case of the Sārasvata Sattra, there is the same difficulty on account of not remaining in the same place (anavasthāpān nāgniś cīyate).

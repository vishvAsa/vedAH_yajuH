The Prakṛti stops from three causes, from a corollary, from a prohibition, and from loss of purpose.

#####  Commentary

A corollary (pratyāmnāna) occurs, when it is said, 'instead of Kuśa grass, let him make a barhis of reeds.' A prohibition (pratishedha) occurs, when it is said, 'he does not choose an Ārsheya.' Loss of purpose (arthalopa) occurs, when peṣaṇa, pounding, would refer to caru, a pulse, that cannot be pounded, while grains can be.

2. The basic paradigm stops (i.e. not followed) on account of three reasons: when there is a counter-sacred-text,[^1] when it is prohibited,[^2] or when the purpose will not be served.[^3]   

[^1]: See e.g. XXII.4.19ff.  

[^2]: See e.g. VII.14.21.  

[^3]: While cooking rice-pap one should not use flour because the grains are expected to remain distinct even when they are cooked and this purpose will not be served when flour is used.

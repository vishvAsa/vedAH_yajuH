If there are fewer Mantras and more (sacrificial) acts, then after dividing them into equal parts, let him perform the former with the former, the latter with the latter.

#####  Commentary

It happens, for instance, in certain iṣṭis that a pair of Yājyā and Anuvākyā mantras is given, but six acts. In that case one half of the mantras is used for one half of the acts, and the other half of the mantras for the other half of the acts.

12. When there are less formulae and more acts one should divide the formulae equally and use the first formula for the first act, the next formula for the next act.[^1]  

[^1]: Thus TS II.2.1 sacrificial breads are mentioned and TS 1.1.14. a-d there are four formulae. Then for the sake of first three sacrificial breads TS 1.1.14 a and b and for the last three TS 1.1.14.c-d are to be used.

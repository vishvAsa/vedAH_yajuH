If there are fewer Mantras and more (sacrificial) acts, then after dividing them into equal parts, let him perform the former with the former, the latter with the latter.

#####  Commentary

It happens, for instance, in certain iṣṭis that a pair of Yājyā and Anuvākyā mantras is given, but six acts. In that case one half of the mantras is used for one half of the acts, and the other half of the mantras for the other half of the acts.

From the end there takes place omission or addition.

#####  Commentary

This refers again to the same subject, namely what has to be done if there are either more or less mantras than there are acts which they are to accompany. In that case it is here allowed to use as many mantras as there are acts, and to drop the rest of the mantras. Or, if there are less mantras than there are acts, then, after the mantras have been equally divided, the last verse is to be multiplied. For instance, in the Dvikapāla sacrifice for the two Aśvins, the placing of the two kapālas is accompanied by two mantras. The rest of the mantras enjoined in the prakṛti is left out. But if there are, for instance, twelve or more iṣṭakās, bricks, to be placed, while there are only ten mantras, then the mantras are equally divided, and the fifth and tenth to be repeated, as many times as is necessary to equal the number of the iṣṭakās.

14. At the end there should be exclusion[^1] or addition.[^2]  

[^1]: In the case of sacrificial bread prepared on five potsherds for Agni (e.g. XIII.25.5) while placing the potsherds there are eight formulae available in the basic paradigm (1.22.3-23.1). Here the last three are to be excluded.  

[^2]: In the case of the sacrificial bread prepared on nine potsherds for Viṣṇu (see e.g. X.30.12). The last formula out of the eight in the basic paradigm is to be used twice.

As the Prakṛti has been told before, anything that has not been told before, should be at the end.

#####  Commentary

This seems to mean that anything new, peculiar to a Vikṛti, and not mentioned in the Prakṛti, should come in at the end, that is, after those portions of the sacrifice which are enjoined in the Prakṛti.

[^1]: Thus e.g. in connection with the Nakṣetraṣṭi BaudhāśS XVIII.3. 4 the Upahomas (additional libations) are to be made at the end of the offering i.e. before the Samiṣṭayajus. (ApSS III. 13.2) According to BaudhāŚS XXVIII.3 they should be performed before the Sviṣṭakr̥t. Cp. ĀpŚS II.21.2.

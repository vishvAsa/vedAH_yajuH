Or (according to others) the Anvārambhaṇīyā should take place (in the Vikṛtis also), because the time (of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa) does not form an essential part.

#####  Commentary

This Sūtra is not quite clear. It shows clearly enough that, according to some authorities, the Anvārambhaṇīyā or initiatory ceremony of the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa sacrifice should take place in the Vikṛtis also; but why? Because the time has not the character of a śeṣa, which is said to be a synonym of aṅga, an essential part of a sacrifice.

When it is said that the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa should be performed during life, this is not meant as determining the time of the sacrifice. It only means that so long as there is life a man should perform these sacrifices, and that their non-performance would constitute a sin. The former argument, therefore, that the time of the Vikṛti sacrifices would fall within the time of the Prakṛti sacrifice is not tenable.

20. Or (the Anvārambhaniyā-offering) may be (performed in the modificatory rites) because the time (of the New and Full-moon-sacrifices) does not form an integral part (of the ritual).

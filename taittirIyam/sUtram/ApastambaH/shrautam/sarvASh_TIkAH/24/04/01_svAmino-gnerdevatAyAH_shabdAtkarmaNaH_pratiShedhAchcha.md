Substitution does not apply to the master, the altar-fire, the deity, the word, the act, and a prohibition.

#####  Commentary

The master is meant for the sacrificer himself and his wife. Their place cannot, of course, be taken by anybody else. The altar-fire is supposed to have a supernatural power, and cannot be replaced by any other fire. Nothing can take the place of the invoked deities, nor of the words used in the mantras addressed to them, nor can the sacrifice itself be replaced by any other act. Lastly, when it is said that māṣas, varakas, kodravas are not fit for sacrifice, or that a man ought not to sacrifice with what should not be eaten by Āryas, nothing else can be substituted for what is thus prohibited.

1. The substitute is stopped (i.e. not allowed) for the owner (i,e. the sacrificer), the fire, the word (i.e. the formula), the action, and for the prohibited.[^1]  

[^1]: Thus for example when it is said that the beans should not be offered, this prohibition remains always valid.

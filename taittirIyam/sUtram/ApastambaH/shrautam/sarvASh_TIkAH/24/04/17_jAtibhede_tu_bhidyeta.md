But if there is a different kind of animal, there is difference (in pots and spits), owing to the diversity of cooking.

#####  Commentary

If different animals are to be cooked, then there must be different pots for each (pratipaśum), because each requires a different kind of cooking. The commentary adds that, as the reason for using different pots is given, that reason applies also to young and old animals of the same kind (jāti), i, e. the young and small animal would require a different pot and a different kind of cooking.

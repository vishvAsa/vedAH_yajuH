Of the Nikāyi sacrifices the first serves as Prakṛti.

#####  Commentary

Among the Nikāyi sacrifices, lit. those which consist of a number, all having the same name, but different rewards, the first is the prakṛti of the subsequent ones. The commentator calls them sādyaskra &c., and mentions as the first the Agniṣṭoma. See Sūtra CXLVI, and Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 218.

6. For sacrifices which form groups the first (one is the paradigm for the remaining ones).[^1]  

[^1]: Cp. XXII.1.2. Thus the sacrifices like the four Sāhasras XXII.2.4. the four Sādyaskras (XXII.2.6.ff), the four Dvirātras XXII.14.16ff are the sacrifices forming groups.

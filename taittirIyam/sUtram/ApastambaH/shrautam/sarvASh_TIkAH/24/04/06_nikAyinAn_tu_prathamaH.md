Of the Nikāyi sacrifices the first serves as Prakṛti.

#####  Commentary

Among the Nikāyi sacrifices, lit. those which consist of a number, all having the same name, but different rewards, the first is the prakṛti of the subsequent ones. The commentator calls them sādyaskra &c., and mentions as the first the Agniṣṭoma. See Sūtra CXLVI, and Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 218.

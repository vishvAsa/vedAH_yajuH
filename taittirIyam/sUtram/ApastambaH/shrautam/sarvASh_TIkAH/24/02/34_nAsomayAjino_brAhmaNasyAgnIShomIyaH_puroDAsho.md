In the case of a Brāhmaṇa, who does not sacrifice with Soma, the Agnīṣomīya cake is omitted.

#####  Commentary

This rule does not seem to be accepted by all schools. It is not found in Kātyāyana, and Hiraṇyakeśin observes: Nāsomayājino brāhmaṇasyāgnīṣomīyaḥ puroḍāśo vidyata ity ekeṣām. See Hillebrandt, l.c. p. iii.

34. In the case of a Brahmin sacrificer who has not performed a Soma-sacrifice, there should not be a sacrificial bread for Agni-soma in the Full-moon-sacrifice.

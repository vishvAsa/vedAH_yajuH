The Pitṛ-yajña, the sacrifice to the fathers, is not Aṅga (auxiliary) because its own time is prescribed.

#####  Commentary

The text should be pitṛyajñaḥ svakālavidhānād anaṅgaḥ syāt. This sacrifice for the Manes, called also the Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña, falls under the new-moon sacrifice, but is to be considered as a pradhāna, a primary sacrifice, not as an aṅga, a member of the Darśa.

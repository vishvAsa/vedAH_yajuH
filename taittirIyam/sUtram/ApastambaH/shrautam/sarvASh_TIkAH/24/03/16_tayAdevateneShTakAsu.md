When there is a number of Puroḍāśas, one should slice off one after another, saying for each portion vyāvartadhvam (separate)!

#####  Commentary

Puroḍāśa is a cake made of meal (pakvaḥ piṣṭapiṇḍaḥ), different from karu, which is more of a pulse consisting of grains of rice or barley, and clarified butter (ghṛtataṇḍulobhayātmakam). This puroḍāśa cake has to be divided for presentation to different deities. If there are more than two deities, the plural vyāvartadhvam, separate, has to be used.

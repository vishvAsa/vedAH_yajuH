Offerings for two deities are vikāras of the Agnīṣomīya.

#####  Commentary

They must, however, be vegetable offerings, because the puroḍāśa for Agnī-Shomau is a vegetable offering. As an instance, the Āgnāvaiṣṇava Ekādaśakapāla is quoted. Agnīṣomīya has a short a, but the first a in āgnavaiṣṇava is long.

With the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayāma.

#####  Commentary

Grahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which the Soma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words upayāma-gṛhīto’si, and while these words are being uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhārāṃ srāvayet).

14. While making the offerings (the act of pouring the offering material) should be done either after the Vaṣaṭ has been uttered or one should make it simultaneous with the Vaṣaṭ-call.

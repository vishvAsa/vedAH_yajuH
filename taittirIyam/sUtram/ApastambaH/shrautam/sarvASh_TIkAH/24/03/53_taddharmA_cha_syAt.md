The substitute should take the nature of that for which it is substituted.

#####  Commentary

Taddharma, having the same qualities. If, for instance, nīvāra has been substituted for vrīhi, it should be treated as if it were vrīhi. The name vrīhi should remain, and should not be replaced by nīvāra, just as Soma, if replaced by pūtikā, is still called Soma. Thus, when in the course of a sacrifice vrīhi has once been replaced by nīvāra, and vrīhi can be procured afterwards, yet nīvāra is then to be retained to the end. If, however, the substituted nīvāra also come to an end, and afterwards both nīvāra and vrīhi are forthcoming, then vrīhi has the preference. If neither be forthcoming, then some substitute is to be taken that approaches nearest to the substitute, the nīvāra, not to the original vrīhi. Further, if a choice has been allowed between vrīhi, rice, and yava, barley, and vrīhi has been chosen, and afterwards, as substitute for vrīhi, nīvāra, then, if nīvāra come to an end, and in the absence of vrīhi, when a new supply of both nīvāra, and yava has been obtained, the yava is to be avoided, and the original substitute for vrīhi, the nīvāra, must be retained. In most of these cases, however, a certain penance also (prāyaścitta) is required.

Offerings for one deity are vikāras of the Āgneya.

#####  Commentary

In the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, which is the prakṛti of the iṣṭis, the puroḍāśa for Agni is meant for one deity. Hence all offerings to one deity in the vikṛtis follow the general rules of the Āgneya puroḍāśa, as described in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, for instance, the karu for Sūrya, the Dvādaśa-kapāla for Sāvitrī.

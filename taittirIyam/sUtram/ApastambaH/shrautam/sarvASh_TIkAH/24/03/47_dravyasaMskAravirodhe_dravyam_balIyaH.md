If there is contradiction with regard to the substance, the object prevails.

#####  Commentary

An example makes the meaning of this Sūtra quite clear. Generally the yūpa or sacrificial post for fastening sacrificial animals is made of Khadira wood. But if a post made of wood is not strong enough to hold the animal, then an iron post is to be used, the object being the fastening of the animal, while the material is of less consequence.

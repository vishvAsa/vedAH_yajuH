When we hear words referring to something else, that is arthavāda.

#####  Commentary

Arthavāda is generally explained as anything occurring in the Brāhmaṇas which is not vidhi or command. Here, however, it refers to Mantras or passages recited at the sacrifice. We saw how such passages, if they referred to some part of the sacrifice, had to be modified under certain circumstances according to the sense. Here we are told that passages which do not refer to anything special in the sacrifice, are arthavāda and remain unmodified. All this is expressed by the words paravākyaśravaṇāt. Vākya stands for padāni, words, such as are used in the nivāpamantra, &c. Some of these words are called samavetārthāni, because they tell of something connected with the performance of the sacrifice, as, for instance, Agnaye juṣṭaṃ nirvapāmi, I offer what is acceptable to Agni; others are asamavetārthāni, as, for instance, Devasya tvā Savituḥ prasave. When such passages which are not connected with some sacrificial act occur (śravaṇāt), they naturally remain unaltered.

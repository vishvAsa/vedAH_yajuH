And the Aikādaśinas are the norm for the Paśugaṇas.

#####  Commentary

The rules for the Paśugaṇas are therefore to be taken over from the Aikādaśinas, the Savanīya, the Agnīṣomīya-paśu, and the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa, so far as they have been modified in each particular case, and are finally determined by the rules of each Paśugaṇa, as, for instance, the Āditya-paśu.

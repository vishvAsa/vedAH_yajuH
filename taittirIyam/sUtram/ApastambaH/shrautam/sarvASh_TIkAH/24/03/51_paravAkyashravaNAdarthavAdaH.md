If what is prescribed is absent, a substitute is to be taken according to similarity.

#####  Commentary

Here we have no longer modification, but substitution (pratinidhi). In cases where anything special that has been prescribed is wanting, a substitute must be chosen, as similar as possible, and producing a similar effect.

According to Maṇḍana's Trikāṇḍa, the degrees of similarity are to be determined in the following order:

> Kāryai rūpais tathā parṇaiḥ kṣīraiḥ puṣpaiḥ phalair api,  
> Gandhai rasaiḥ sadṛg grāhyam pūrvālābhe paramparam. >
> 'What is similar by effect, by shape, by leaves, by milk, by flowers, > and by fruit, By smell, or by taste is to be taken one after the > other, if the former cannot be found.'

When there is a number of Carus and Puroḍāśas, one separates what belongs to the Carus and what belongs to the Puroḍāśas, before the strewing.

#####  Commentary

Prāg adhivapanāt, before the strewing, is explained by prāg adhivapanārthakṛṣṇājinādānāt, before one takes the black skin which is used for the strewing.

An exception must be made in the case of the gods of the prakṛti, as, for instance, the Aindra puroḍāśa, the Saumya caru.

#####  Commentary

The exception applies to cases where the offering in a vikṛti sacrifice is meant for the same principal deities as those of the prakṛti offering. For instance, in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsa Agni and Soma are the deities of the Agnīṣomīya, Indra and Agni of the Aindrāgna. If then in one of the secondary or vikṛti sacrifices there occurs an Aindra puroḍāśa, or a Saumya caru, then the Aindra puroḍāśa is treated as a vikāra of the Aindrāgna, the Saumya karu as a vikāra of the Agnīṣomīya. The Somendra caru also, as its principal deity is Soma, would follow the Agnīṣomīya, the Indrāsomīya puroḍāśa, as its principal deity is Indra, would follow the Aindrāgna.

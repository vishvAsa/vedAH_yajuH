5. In the case of whom (sacrificer) the Hotr̥ desires that he should die, he should utter Vaṣaṭ having loudly threatened, while pressing as it were. In the case of whom the Hour desires that he should be worse he should utter the Vaṣaṭ in the voice lower than that for the offering-verse. In the case of whom (the Hotr̥) desires that he should be better he should utter the Vaṣaṭ in a louder voice than that of the offering-verse. (In the case of whom the Hotr̥ desires that) he should neither be better nor worse, he should utter the Vaṣaṭ in the same voice as that for the offering verse. It is known from a sacred text: “He should utter the Vaṣaṭ loudly (and) in the manner similar to that of Krauñca in the case of (a sacrificer who is) desirous of heaven."[^1]

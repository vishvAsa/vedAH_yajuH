This applies also to sacrificial acts which have a number and are to be carried out by separate (repeated) acts.

#####  Commentary

If a rule is given, such as triḥ prokṣati, he sprinkles thrice, the mantra which accompanies the act, is recited once only. Again in the case of acts that require repetitions, such as rubbing, pounding, &c., the hymns are recited once only.

[^1]: Thus for example the preparation of Veda (grass-brush) (I. 6.4) may require more time than what is required for uttering the formula. Still the formula is to be uttered only once.

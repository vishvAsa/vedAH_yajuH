It is the same also with regard to acts which do not produce an immediate effect.

#####  Commentary

The commentators distinguish between acts which produce a visible effect, such as pounding or sprinkling, and acts which do not, such as addressing, approaching, looking. The latter are called asaṃnipātin. Thus when the stones used for the preparation of Soma are addressed, the hymn which is used for addressing them, is not repeated for each single stone, the same as in Sūtra XL. Sūtras XLI and XLII are sometimes joined.

[^1]: Thus for example the formula apāṁ kṣayāḥ (XII.3.2) is to be recited over all the pressing stones. Similarly at the time of the Agni Upasthāna the two formulae (V.20.4) are to be uttered only once.

If it is said, juhoti, 'he sacrifices,' it should be known that sarpir ājya, melted butter, is meant.

#####  Commentary

Sarpis is here taken as an adjective, running; yad asarpat tat sarpir abhavat. Ājya is explained as navanītavikāradravyajātīyavacanaḥ sabdaḥ, i.e. a word signifying any kind of substance made of fresh butter.

In the Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa I, 3, we read ājyaṃ vai devānāṃ surabhi, ghṛtam manuṣyāṇām, ayutam pitṝṇām, navanītaṃ garbhāṇām, 'Ājya is sweet or fragrant to the gods, ghṛta to men, ayuta to the manes, navanīta to children.' Here the commentator explains that ājya is butter, when melted (vilīnaṃ sarpis), ghṛta, when hardened. Ayuta, sometimes called astu, is butter, when slightly melted, niṣpakva, when thoroughly melted. According to Kātyāyana I, 8, 37, ājya is of different kinds. It may be simple ghṛta, which, as a rule, should be made of the milk of cows. But in the absence of ājya, the milk of buffaloes (māhiṣa), or oil (taila), or sesam-oil (jārtila), or linseed oil (atasīsneha), &c., may be taken.

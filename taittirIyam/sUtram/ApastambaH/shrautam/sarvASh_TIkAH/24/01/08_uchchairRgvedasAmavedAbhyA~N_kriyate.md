With the Ṛg-veda and Sāma-veda the performance takes place with a loud voice (uccaiḥ).

#####  Commentary

Even lines of the Yajur-veda, if they are contained in the Ṛg-veda and Sāma-veda, would have to be pronounced with a loud voice. Certain mantras, however, are excepted, viz. the japa, abhimantraṇa, and anumantraṇa-mantras.

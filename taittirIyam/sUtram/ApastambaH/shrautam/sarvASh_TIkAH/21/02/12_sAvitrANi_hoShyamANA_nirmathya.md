When they are about to make offerings to Savitr̥[^1] they should pour together (the fire into the Gārhaptya-fire) after having churned it out; and then (only the Gr̥hapati should perform these offerings in the Āhavanīya which has been taken out from the Gārhapatya); and then they should separate their fires.[^2]

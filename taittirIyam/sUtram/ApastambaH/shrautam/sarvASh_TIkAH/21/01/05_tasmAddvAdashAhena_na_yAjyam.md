5. “Therefore one should not perform a twelve-day sacrifice for any one else, in order to avoid evil”-So is known (from a Brāhmaṇa-text).[^1]  

[^1]: See TS VII.2.10.4. From this it is implied that one should not 
work as a priest for Dvādaśāha-sacrifice which is performed as an ahīna. On the other hand one may participate in Dvdaśāha provided it is Sattra in which case one will have to be one of the sacrificers only.

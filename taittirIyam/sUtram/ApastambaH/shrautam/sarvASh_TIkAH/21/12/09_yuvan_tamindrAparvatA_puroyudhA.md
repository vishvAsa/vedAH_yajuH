9a. (They creep while reciting) yuvaṁ tamindrāparvatā....[^1]  

[^1]: See ŚB IV.6.9.14.  

9b. After they have gone to the north of Havirdhāna (-shed) while their faces are turned to the east, while they touch[^2] the mat or the reed wicwork (of the Havirdhāna), they utter the five expressions vāk, vāgaitu.[^3]  

[^2] Cf. Tālavr̥tavāsin's commentary: avalambamānāḥ. According to Caland the word niṣevamāṇaḥ here is of doubtful meaning. He translates it to mean ‘loosen' (lockern).  

[^3]: These formulae occur only here.

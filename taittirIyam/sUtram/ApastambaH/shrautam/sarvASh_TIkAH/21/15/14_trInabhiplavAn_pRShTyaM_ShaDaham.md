14. Three Abhiplava-six-day-rites; one Pr̥ṣṭhya-six-day rite, Abhijit-Agniṣṭoma, three Ukthyas or Agniṣṭomas[^1] of Paraḥsāman-type;[^2] (then) the two days which remain reserved.[^3]  

[^1]: Cf. TMB IV.5.17-2.1; TB I.2.2.1-2.  

[^2]: In TS VII.3.10 all the Svara-sāman-days are called Paraḥsāman; 
cp. KS XXXIII.4. Āpastamba uses this word paraḥsāman in contrast to the arvāksāman (see Sūtra 20); See also TB 1.2.2.1.  

[^3]: See Sūtra 9 above.

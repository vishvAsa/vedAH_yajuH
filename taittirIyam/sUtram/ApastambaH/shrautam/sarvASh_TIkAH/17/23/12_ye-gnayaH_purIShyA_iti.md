12. When about to go away the sacrificer stands near (the fire-altar-building), praising it with the (formulae called) Āpti (obtainments)[^1] beginning with ye agnayaḥ purīṣyāḥ.[^2]   

[^1]: After the entire ceremony is over.   

[^2]: Really speaking the formulae apāṁ tvā... (TS V.5.7.5) are meant here. But actually Āpastamba follows here KS XXII. 10.

9. It has been said in a Brāhmaṇa-text: “In the case of a sacrificer about whom he desires: ‘May I cut his breath; his food', (he should offer ghee) separately (after) every (formula) and (not in a continuous stream). (In the case of a sacrificer about whom he desires, “May I hold his breath, his food continous" he should offer the ghee in a continuous line)."[^1]

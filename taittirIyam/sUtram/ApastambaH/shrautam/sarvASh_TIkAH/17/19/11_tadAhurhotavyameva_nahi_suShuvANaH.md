11. Some (ritualists) say “Only the act of offering should be done; for one who has a undrgone Sava (consecration for a high rank) does not come down (from the chariot or seat) before anyone"[^1].   

[^1]: MS III.4.3. The implication of this Sūtra is not clear. Perhaps it is implied here with that the act of Agnicayana is as good as Sava. Therefore here only the act offering is to be done (1-3) and the act of sprinkling (4-10) need not be done. Cp. in general XVII.7.16.

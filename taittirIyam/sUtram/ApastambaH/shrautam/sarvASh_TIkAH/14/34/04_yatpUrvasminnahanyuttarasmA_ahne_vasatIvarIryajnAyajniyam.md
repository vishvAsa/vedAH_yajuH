4. Whatever Vasatīvarī-water one brings on the previous day for the sake of Yajñāyajñiya (-stotra) on the next day,[^1] one connects the day (to the next day) by means of it; one makes the sacrifice continous by means of it. Whatever one orders on the previous day about the milks[^2] for the sake of the next day, one connects the day (to the next) by means of it; one makes the sacrifice continuous thereby. Whatever one orders further,[^3] one connects the day (to the next) thereby; one makes the sacrifice continuous thereby.  


[^1]: Really speaking, it is not the Vasatīvarī-water but the Pānnejanī water which is poured at the time of the Yajñāyajñiya-stotra (see XIII.15.9).   

[^2]: See XI.21.8.  

[^3]: See e.g. XXI.26.7.

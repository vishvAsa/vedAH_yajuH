1. "If they may take away him who has been selected for the office of a priest, he (the Adhvaryu) should offer a four times scooped ghee, in the Āgnīdhra (fire) while standing in front of it, with his face to the west by means of Daśahotr̥ formulae uttering these formulae in the reverse order, taking halt after every part of it. He (thereby) indeed causes his[^1] breaths to go away. If they invite him again, he should offer four times scooped ghee in the Āgnīdhra(fire) itself while sitting to the west of it with his face to the west, by means of the Daśahotr̥ ( formula) in the straight order without taking halt after every part of it. He thereby arranges his very breaths”-thus is known (from a Brāhmaṇa-text).[^2]   

[^1]: viz. one who has taken him out.

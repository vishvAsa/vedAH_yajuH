7. The order (to be uttered by the Adhvaryu is as follows): “O Āgnīdhra; do you sit upon the lap of the Neṣṭr̥. O Neṣṭr̥, do you bring the wife of the sacrificer (towards the Udgātr̥). O Unnetr̥, do you fill the goblets after the Hotr̥'s goblet has been filled, do you leave some space for the Dhruva in the Hotr̥'s goblet. (O Neṣṭr̥) cause the wife of the sacrificer to be seen by the Udgātr̥; O sacrificer's wife, do you make the water flow down.”[^1]   

[^1]: All these words have been repeated from XIII. 14.11.

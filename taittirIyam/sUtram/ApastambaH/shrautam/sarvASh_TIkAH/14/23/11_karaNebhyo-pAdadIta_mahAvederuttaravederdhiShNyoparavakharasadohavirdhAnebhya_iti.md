11. One should take the portion[^1] from the different instruments viz. the great altar, Uttaravedi, fire-hearths, Uparavas, Sadas and Havirdhāna. And one should mix (those portions) in the other (i.e. his own instruments which are to be done without any formulae).  

[^1]: i.e. one who wants to discontinue the performance of a sacrificial session after the great altar, Uttaravedi etc. have been prepared. In that case these things are not be performed again. But some portion like a clod etc. is to be taken from these.

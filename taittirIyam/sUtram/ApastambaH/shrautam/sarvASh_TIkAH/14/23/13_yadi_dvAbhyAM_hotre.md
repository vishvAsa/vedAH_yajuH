13. If (it dawns while the praise-singing) with the last two night-rounds (is not yet over), they should sing (the stotra) (corresponding the recitation of the Hotr̥ and Maitrāvaruṇa in the first[^1] round; and (the Stotra corresponding the recitation) of the Brāhmaṇācchaṁsin and Acchāvāka in the next (round).[^2]  

[^1]: One expects here “middle” (see Rudradatta's commentary).  

[^2]: Thus the last two Stotra-śastras of the 2nd round and the first two of the last Stotra-śastra are omitted. For this Sūtra cf. JB I.348.

3. Having reached the Āgnīdhrīya-(fire-hearth) having handed over the king (Soma) to the Pratiprasthātr̥, having stepped towards the south, he sits down (to the south of it). He places the Soma on his lap as (he has done) earlier.[^1] After a libation of ghee is offered,[^2] having stepped out first, having brought the king (Soma) by the western door towards the Havirdhāna-shed, having handed over (the Soma) to the Adhvaryu, having gone to the Havirdhāna-shed, having stepped towards the south of the Uttaravedi by the west, he sits down. He remains seated there upto the offering of the omentum of the animal to Agni and Soma.[^3] After (the omentum) has been offered, he sprinkles water on himself.[^4] While the Vasativari waters are being carried,[^5] he sits towards the south. At the very early morning when others are waking,[^6] he wakes. After the morning litany is being bespoken,[^7] he restrains his speech, upto the Paridhānīyā (concluding)[^8] verse. While the waters to be used at the time of Soma-pressing are being brought,[^9] having entered the Havirdhāna-shed by the eastern door, having stepped towards the east of the Khara (mound) by the south, he sits down there.

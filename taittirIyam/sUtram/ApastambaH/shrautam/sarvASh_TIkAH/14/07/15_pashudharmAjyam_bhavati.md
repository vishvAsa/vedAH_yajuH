15. The ghee possesses all the characteristics of the animal.[^1]   

[^1]: Cp. XXIV.3.53. The meaning of this Sūtra is as follows: In the orders uttered by the Adhvaryu the words referring to the animal are not to be substituted by word meaning ghee. Thus e.g. VII.2.1. there is an order which when used in this context would be tvaṣṭre chāgasya vapāyā medaso 'nubrūhi. Here the words chāgasya vapāyā medasaḥ are not to be substituted by ghr̥tasya although actually ghee is to be offered.

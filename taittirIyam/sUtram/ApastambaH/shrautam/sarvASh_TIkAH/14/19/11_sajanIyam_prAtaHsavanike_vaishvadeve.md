11. One should insert the Sajanīya in the Vaiśvadeva (-recitation)[^1] of the morning-pressing; the Vihavya in the Marutvatiya (recitation) of the midday(-pressing); (and) Kayāśubhīya of Agastya as the Niṣkevalya (-recitation) in the Vaiśvadeva (-recitation) of the Third-pressing.[^2]   

[^1]: Thereby the Prauga-Śastra is meant.   

[^2]: Neither the Sūtras of the R̥gveda nor those of the Sāmaveda are in agreement with Āpastamba in connection with these recitations.

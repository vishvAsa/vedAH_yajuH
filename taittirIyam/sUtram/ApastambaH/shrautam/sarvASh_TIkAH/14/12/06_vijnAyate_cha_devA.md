6. And it is known (from a Brāhmaṇa-text):[^1] “The gods indeed, caused Varuṇa to perform a sacrifice. To whichever deity he brought the gift; that deity did stifle”. They said, "Turning away form her (gift) may we accept (the gift) so that the gift will not stifle.” They having turned away accepted her. Then the gift did not stifle for them. For him who knowing thus accepts the gift after having turned, the gift does not stifle.” This statement pertains only to (those gifts) which refer to the sacrificial peocedure.

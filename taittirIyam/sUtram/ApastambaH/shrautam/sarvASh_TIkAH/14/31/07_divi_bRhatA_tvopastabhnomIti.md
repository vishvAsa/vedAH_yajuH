7. (The formula) divi br̥hatā tvopastabhnomi is to be used in order to support (the fallen shed) in the same for all (the cases).   

[^1]: The formulae given in Sūtras 3-7 are divided in an incorrect manner by Āpastamba 1. The first formula should be rathantare śrayasva pr̥thivyām... 2. The second should be vāmadeve śrayasva antarikṣe... 3. The third should be br̥hati śrayasva divi.... The last should be br̥hatā tvopastabhnomi.

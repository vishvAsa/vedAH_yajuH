8. If (the Adhvaryu) desires, “May his (sacrificer's) sons should be prosperous seniority-wise,' then he should scoop full, first and then less and less; if juniority-wise[^2] then the other way round; if “all should be of equal power”, then equally".[^3]  


[^1]: i.e. more the senior more the prosperous.  

[^2]: i.e. more the junior more the prosperous.

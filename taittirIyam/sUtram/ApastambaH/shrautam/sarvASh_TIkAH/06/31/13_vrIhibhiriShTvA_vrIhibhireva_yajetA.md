13. Having offered (the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi) with the rice-grains one should offer (the sacrificial bread of) rice-grains only in the New-and-Full-moon-sacrifices[^1] upto the (availability of) Barley; in the same manner, having offered the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi with the barley-grains one should offer the New-and-Full-moon sacrifices upto the availability of rice-grains. Or rather in both the cases (one should use) rice-grains only. They are the most convenient for using—this has been said in a Brāhmaṇa-text of the R̥gveda.[^2]

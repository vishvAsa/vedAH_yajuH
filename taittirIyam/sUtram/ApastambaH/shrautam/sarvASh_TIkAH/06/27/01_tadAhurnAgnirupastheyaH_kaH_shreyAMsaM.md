1. Now some say, "One should not stand near the fire praising it (after having returned form the journey). Who will awaken the sleeping superior?”.[^1] One should only say, “O safety creator! create safety for me; let there be bliss for me; let there be safety for me”. This is the opinion of the Vājasaneyians in connection with the standing near (the fires while praising them) by one who is about to stay away and the standing near (the fires) while praising them by one who has returned.[^2]   


[^1]: Cf. MS III.4.5; KS XXII.2.  

[^2]: In the available texts of the white YV this opinion is not found. Cp. however ŚB II.4.1.10; AB VII. 12.

16. “Or a Vedic student may offer the Agnihotra-libation on behalf of the sacrificer, because he is purchased by means of the Brahman (i.e. the Veda); or a milk-offerer[^1] may offer because he is purchased by means of money” — This is said by a Brāhmaṇa-text of the R̥gveda.[^2]   


[^1]: A person employed to offer milk, i.e., to perform the Agnihotra
ritual on behalf of the sacrificer. The word kṣīrahotr̥ occurs, besides this place, only in ŚB II.3.3.15. and Kātyāśs IV.14.31. The hotr̥ part of this word is used in the sense of “offerer". It has nothing do with the priest Hotr̥.   

[^2]: Not known.

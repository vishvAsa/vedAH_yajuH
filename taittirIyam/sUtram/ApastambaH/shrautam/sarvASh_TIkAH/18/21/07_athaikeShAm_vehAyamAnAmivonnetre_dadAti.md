7. According to some, he gives a cow which is aborting[^1] as it were to the Unnetr̥, (and) a bull to the Grāyastut, a he-goat to the Subrahmaṇya; a cart-ox is to be given to the Neṣṭr̥; another one to the Āgnīdhra; a one-horsed vehicle loaded with barley is to be given to the Acchāvāka.  

[^1]: The exact meaning of the word Vehāyamāna is uncertain. The word appears to be a denominative present participle from the word vehat which means an abortive cow. For this Sūtra cf. MS IV.4.8; TMB XVIII.9.19.

11. On the Sutyā day priests carry out the duties while having golden chain (around their necks).[^1]   


[^1]: Cf TMB XVIII.7.6. According to Caland (foot-note on his translation of Āpśs XVII.2.11) this chain is to be worm on the head. But it is logical to assume that is is to be worn around neck. See the commentary of Vidyādhara on KātyāŚS XVI.1.23.

17. Having gone to a region in the south-western direction, then having placed (the burning fire-brand) on a naturally formed pit[^1] or cleft, he offers the complete (sacrificial bread)[^2] for Nirr̥ti with eṣa te nirr̥te bhāgaḥ...[^3] by means of both the thumbs or the two Visraṁsikā (index-finger) joints.[^4]  

[^1]: Iriṇa has been interpreted by Caland as “salty place”. See, however, ŚB V.2.3.2, and the translation of it by Eggeling.  

[^2]: Cf. TB 1.6.1.3.  

[^3]: TS 1.8.1.1.  

[^4]: Cf. MS II.6.1; KS XV.1 Caland suggests the meaning of the the word Visraṁsikā as the uprooted upgrowth of plants etc. on a place. He also quotes and discards the view of Tālavr̥ntavāsin who says that Visraṁsikā means the index-fingers I, however, support Tālavr̥ntavāsin.

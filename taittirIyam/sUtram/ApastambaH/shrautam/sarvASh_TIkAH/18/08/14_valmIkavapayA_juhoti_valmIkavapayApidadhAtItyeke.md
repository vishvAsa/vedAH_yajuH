14. According to some (ritualists) he offers by means of the fossilized ant-hill[^1] and covers (the offered portion) by means of the fossilized ant-hill.  

[^1]: Caland doubts the practicability of this action. Perhaps he has not clearly understood the difference between valmīka (ant-hill) and valmīkavapā (fossilized ant-hill). He understands the word valmīkavapā simply in the sense of “ameisenhaufen” (ant-hill) and therefore he doubts the practicability. Here the word valmīkavapā is used and not the word valmīka (ant-hill).

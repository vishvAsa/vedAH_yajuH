19. According to some[^1] (ritualists) a black cloth with torn end[^2] (is to be given as sacrificial gift).  

[^1]: Cf. KS XV.1; MS II 6.1.  

[^2]: bhinnānta. According to Caland this word means almost the same as “with black fringes”. But if it were the same there was no need of mentioning it as a view of “some" ritualists.

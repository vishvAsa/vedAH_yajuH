8. “(The sacrificer) prays for bliss for those which belong to the Parivatsara” -the Hotr̥ adds these words in the benedictions of the Sūktavāka before the words “(the Sacrificer) prays for divine place”. In the correspondent manner the sacrificer mutters. He modifies the formula with the word āśāse (I pray) instead of āsāste (He prays).[^1]  


[^1]: See and cp. VIII.3.4-5.

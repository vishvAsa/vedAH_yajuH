1. "The sacrificer prays for bliss for those which belong to the Anuvatsara;" the Hotr̥ adds these words to the blessings of the Sūktavāka; he also adds the words "(the sacrificer) prays for divine place." The sacrificer mutters in the correspondent manner. He modifies the formula with the word āśāse (I pray) instead of āśāste(= He prays). The offering stands completely established in the usual manner.[^1] The Cāturmāsya-sacrifices stand completely established. At this stage having performed the Full-moon-offering, the act of trimming the hair beginning with moistening the head should be done in the same manner as earlier or he should get all the hair shaved.[^2] The beginning of the formula is to be modified as follows: ekaṁ māsamudasr̥jat parameṣṭhi[^3]... (The formula) agnistigmena... is the same as above.[^4]

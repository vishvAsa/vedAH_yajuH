15. (The Adhvaryu) keeps down the pot (in which the rice-pap for the Maruts was cooked) (on a marked place) without having removed the scrappings.[^1]  


[^1]: Thus the remnants of the rice-pap sticking to the pot are let remain; cf. TB 1.6.7.3. The scrappings are to be used afterwards. For their use see the 19th sūtra.

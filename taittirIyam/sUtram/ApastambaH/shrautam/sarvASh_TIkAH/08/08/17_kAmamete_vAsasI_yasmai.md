17. “They may at will, give these garments (i.e. the garments they are wearing at the time of the Avabhr̥tha-bathi to whomsoever they may like. For, they are not the garments of the consecrated"-this has been said in the Brāhmaṇa-text of the Vājasaneyins.  


[^1]: See ŚB II.5.2.47. In the Avabhr̥tha-bath in a Soma-sacrifice the garments are to be thrown away in water, see XIII.20.14.

1. Then after four months,[^1] on the full-moon-day of Āṣāḍhā or Śrāvaṇā month, having gone out,[^2] the sacrificer performs the Varuṇapraghāsas.  


[^1]: Cp. VIII.1.2.  

[^2]: This ritual is not to be done in the residence of the sacrificer but rather at some other place. For that, fires are to be taken mystically in the churning sticks and then produced out of them by means of churning. For this Sūtra cf. ŚB II.5.2.48.

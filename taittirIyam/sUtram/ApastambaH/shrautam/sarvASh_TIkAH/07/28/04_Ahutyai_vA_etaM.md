4. For the sake of offering indeed they cause this (viz. the sacrificial post) to fall down from the trees. After having performed (the animal-sacrifice) people go away. To the sacrificial post every mistake in the performance is attached. If (the sacrificer or a priest) would touch the sacrificial post the mistake would be attached (to him). The Adhvaryu should address them (who has or have unknowingly touched the sacrificial post) with vāyaveṣa te vāyo... if he is one (who has touched), with vayavetau te vāyo... if they are two (who have touched), or with vāyavete te vāyo if they are many.[^1]  


[^1]: Cf. MS III.9.4.

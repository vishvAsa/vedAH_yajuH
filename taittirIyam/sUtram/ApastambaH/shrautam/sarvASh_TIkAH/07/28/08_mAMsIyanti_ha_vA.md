8. “The fires of the sacrificer who does not perform sacrifice desire flesh indeed; they think of the sacrificer; they plan (to eat) the sacrificer; on other fires people indeed cook profane flesh. But for these (sacred) fires there is no other hope of flesh; of him who has these (sacred fires) him without performing an animal-sacrifice no year should pass: (The animal sacrifice) is helpful for him to get long life; it is a kind of self-redemption" this is the view of the Vājasaneyins.[^1]

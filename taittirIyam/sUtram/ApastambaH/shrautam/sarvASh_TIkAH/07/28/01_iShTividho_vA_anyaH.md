1. There is an Animal-sacrifice of the type of an Iṣṭ[^1]' and another of the type of a Soma-sacrifice.[^1] There where (the Adhvaryu) carries forward water,[^3] pours a pot-full water[^4] and the sacrificer takes Viṣṇu-srides,[^5] that is of the type of an Iṣṭi, that which is different from this is of Soma-type. This is the view of Vājasaneyins.[^6]

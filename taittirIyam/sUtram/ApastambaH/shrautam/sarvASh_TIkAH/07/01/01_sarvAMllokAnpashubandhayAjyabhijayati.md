1. The performer of an animal-sacrifice[^1] wins all the worlds.  

[^1]: This animal-sacrifice is called Nirūḍhapaśubandha (an animal sacrifice which has been "taken out” from the Soma-sacrifice). Animal-sacrifice is basically a part of a Soma-sacrifice. But here it is described as an independent rite.

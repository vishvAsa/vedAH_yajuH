8. He does not perform (the rite of) the selection of the Hotr̥ along with the mention of) the r̥ṣi-ancestors, nor does he select the Hotr̥ (by mentioning his name.)[^1] Having called for (Āgnīdhra to say) astu śrauṣaṭ, he says, “Sit, O Hotr̥" This much is the Pravara (selection of the Hotr̥).[^1]  


[^1]: Thus the ritual mentioned in 11.16.5-14 is not to be performed.  


[^2]: The ritual mentioned in II.15.1-4 is done, but instead of the words mentioned in II. 16.5 the Adhvaryu should simply say, “Sit, O Hotr̥." For this Sūtra cf. MS III.8.2; ŚB III.4.4.10.

10. The Śālāmukhīya (-fire), the Dhiṣṇya (-fire) of the Hotr̥, and (fire) on the Uttaravedi should be visible simultaneously.[^1]  


[^1]: Cf. MS III.8.9. The door of the Havirdhāna and that of the Sadas (see XI.9.10) should be made in such a way that a person standing either in front of or behind the old Gārhapatya should be able to see the Dhiṣṇya of the Hotr̥ (see XI.14.4) and the Uttaravedi-fire simultaneously.

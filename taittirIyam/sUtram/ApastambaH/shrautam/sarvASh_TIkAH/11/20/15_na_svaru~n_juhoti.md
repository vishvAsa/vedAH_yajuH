15. (The Adhvaryu) does not offer the Svaru.[^1] He does not dispose of the heart-spit[^2] thus (also) in the Savanīya (=the animal-sacrifice on the Soma-pressing-day).[^3]   

[^1]: Cp. VII.27.4.  

[^2]: Cp. VII.27.15.  

[^3]: These activities which are prohibited here are to be done at the end of the Anubandhyā-cow-sacrifice. Thereby a kind of continuity is created in all the three animal-sacrifices. For this Sūtra cf. ŚB III.8.5.11.

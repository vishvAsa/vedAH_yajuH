1. The sacrificer who desires to get heaven should perform the Jyotiṣṭoma-sacrifice.[^1] One who has one desire or all the desires should perform this sacrifice.[^2] If one has all the desires one should proclaim them either simultaneously or separately at different performances.[^3]  


[^1]: i.e. the Agniṣṭoma Jyotiṣṭoma. Thus it is a sacrifice in which there are four jyotis (lights) viz. Trivr̥t-stoma, Pañcadaśa-stoma, Saptadśastoma, and Ekaviṁśa-stoma.

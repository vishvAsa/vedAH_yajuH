3. (One who has been invited to work as a priest) asks him, "Who are the priests? Who make the sacrificer perform the Soma-sacrifice? Is it by any chance a sacrifice abandoned by other pirests[^1] Is the priest-hood by any chance denied by other priests? Are the gifts (the cows) auspicious?"—this is said in Brāhmaṇa-text of the Sāmaveda.[^2]  


[^1]: nāhīnaḥ is to be read as na hīnaḥ. The a in na seems to have been lengthened stylistically. Therefore I read kaccina hīnaḥ.  

[^2]: Not known.

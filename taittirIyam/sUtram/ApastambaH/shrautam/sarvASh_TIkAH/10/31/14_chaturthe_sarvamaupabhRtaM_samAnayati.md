14. At the time of the fourth (Prayāja) (the Adhvaryu) pours out the entire quantity (of ghee)[^1] from the Upabhr̥t (into the Juhū)[^2].  


[^1]: It is not necessary to have some remnant ghee (as is the case elsewhere: Cp. II.17.6; III.5.1) in the Upabhr̥t; for there are no after-offerings here.  

[^2]: ŚB III.4.2.22.

9. And it is known (from a sacred text): “When the consecrated (sacrificer) becomes lean, he becomes worthy or performing a sacrifice; when there is nothing in his inside, then he becomes worthy of performing a sacrifice; when his bone becomes stuck to his skin, then he becomes worthy of performing a sacrifice; when the black of his eye is lost, (i.e. when the pupil cannot be seen), then he becomes worthy of performing a sacrifice."[^1]  


[^1]: Cp. MS III.6.6.

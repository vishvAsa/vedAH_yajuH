7. It has been said in a Brāhmaṇ-text[^1]: “(For) one who is a Gataśrī[^2] (the fire should be obtained) by means of churning (and not by means of the method mentioned above) and should be kept in the fire-pan.... For one who wants firm foundation the fire should be the one produced out of the fire-pan... In the case of a sacrificer about whom (the Adhvaryu) desires that he should create an enemy for him, he should bring fire from somewhere and keep it in the fire-pan....)”

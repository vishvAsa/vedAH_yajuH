7. (In the Brāhmaṇa-text beginning with) “vāyavyāmālabheta bhūtikāmaḥ (one who wants to get prosperity should seize (a barren she-goat) for Vāyu)”[^1] the deities are mentioned (and to them the respective offering should be made).   


[^1]: TS III.4.3.2-4. Thus one who desires prosperity should seize a barren she-goat for Vāyu. A peasant who desires firm foundation should seize the same for Heaven and Earth. One who wants to be a possessor and eater of food should offer the same for Agni and Soma. One who being able to speak cannot speak should offer the same for Sarasvatī and one who wants to conquer the unconquered should offer the same fūr Prajāpati.

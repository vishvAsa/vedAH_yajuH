9. For (the sacrificer) who is very dear and very elite[^1] for him (the Adhvaryu), (should build) the Vaiśvasr̥ja (-fire-altar). Or rather (only) at the third round[^2].   

[^1]: For these words See XII.8.14.  

[^2]: According to Caland the last words are not clear. He suggests that following appears to be the meaning: the formulae mentioned XIX.15.3 are perhaps meant here. He asks: Whether the Adhvaryu has in this case only to recite all the formulae and only after the third round to place the bricks. I think that the last part is an exception to the rule mentioned in the first part. Thus the Vaisvasr̥ja fire-attar can be built in the case the sacrificer is very dear etc. to the Adhvaryu or when it is the third sacrifice of a sacrifier then this altar can be built even in the case of sacrificer who is not very dear etc. to him.

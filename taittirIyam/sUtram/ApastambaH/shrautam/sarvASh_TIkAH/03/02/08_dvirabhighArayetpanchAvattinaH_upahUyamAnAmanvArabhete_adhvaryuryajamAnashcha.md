8. In the case of a sacrificer for whom (offerings are of fered in) five portions, (the Adhvaryu) should pour ghee (on the portions in the Hotr̥'s hand) twice. While (the Iḍā) is being invoked,[^1] the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer together touch (the Iḍā-pot). Having known i.e. heard that the Hotr̥ is uttering daivyā adhvaryava upahūtāḥ, the Adhvaryu mutters upahūtaḥ Paśumānasāni. Having known (i.e. having heard that the Hotr̥ is uttering) upahūtoyaṁ yajamānah the sacrificer (mutters) the same formula.

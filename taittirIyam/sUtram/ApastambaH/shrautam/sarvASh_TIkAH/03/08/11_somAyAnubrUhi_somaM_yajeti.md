11. The orders to be uttered by the Adhvaryu are as fallows: “Do you recite the invitatory verse for Soma (O Hotr̥)” and “Do you recite the offering verse for Soma (O Hotr̥).” The Adhvaryu makes the libation in the northern part of the Gārhapatya-fire.  

[^1]: The verses to be recited by the Hors are found in TB III.5.12.

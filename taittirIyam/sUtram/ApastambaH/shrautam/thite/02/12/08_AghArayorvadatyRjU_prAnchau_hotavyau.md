8. In connection with the Āghāra libations (a Brāhmaṇa text)[^1] says: “They should be poured in straight lines either towards the east or cross-wise and either inter-linked or non-interlinkd."[^2]  


[^1]: Cp. TS II.5.11.7.   

[^2]: Thus the Āghāras may be offered in the following three alternative
ways: (1) From the south-west to the south-east and from the north-west upto the north-east. (2) From the middle of the western boundary of the fire place to the middle of the eastern boundary and from the middle of the southern boundary upto the middle of the northern boundary. (3) From the southwest upto the north west, and from the south-east upto the north-east. The fourth alternative is mentioned in II. 12.7 and II. 14.1.

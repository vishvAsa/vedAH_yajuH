After the Adhvaryu has said āśrāvaya, the Āgnīdhra should not utter anything other than his response viz. astu śrauṣaṭ. After the Āgnidhra has uttered his response the Ādhvaryu should not say anything except the utterance yaja; after the Adhvaryu has uttered yaja, the Hotr̥ should not utter anything except the Vaṣaṭ-call.[^1]

1. For (the sacrificer who is) the eldest son, born out of the eldest wife of his father or for one who is a Gataśrī, he (the Adhravyu) should milk the two front teats of the cow; for (the sacrificer) who is the youngest son, born out the youngest wife of his father or for one who is a posthumos son, or for one who wants to progress, he should milk the two rear teats."  


[^1]: Cf. TB II.1.8.1. There is no reference to the “posthumous son”
here. Cp. also II.19.3-4.

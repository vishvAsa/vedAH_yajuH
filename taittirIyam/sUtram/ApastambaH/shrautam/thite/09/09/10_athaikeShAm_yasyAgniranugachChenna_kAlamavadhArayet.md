10. Now according to some, one whose Gārhapatya fire gets extinguished,[^1] should not pay attention to the time. One should, in that case cause the Āhavanīya to be extinguished, then having churned out the Gārhapatya in the same manner as described earlier, having then lifted out (the Āhavanīya from the Gārhapatya), one should offer the Agnihotra. Then one should offer the sacrificial bread on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvānara or a sacrificial bread of barley to Varuṇa.[^1]  


[^1]: After the Āhavanīya has been lifted.  

[^2]: See MS I.8.8.

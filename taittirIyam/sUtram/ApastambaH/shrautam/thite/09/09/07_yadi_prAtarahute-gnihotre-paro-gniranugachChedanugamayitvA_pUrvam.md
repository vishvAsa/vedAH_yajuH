After the morning-Agnihotra is offered if the fire in the west (Gārhapatya) is extinguished, having caused the fire in the east (Āhavanīya) to be extinguished, having churned out the Gārhapatya-fire in the same manner as described earlier, then having lifted the Āhavanīya (from the Gārhapatya) in the same manner as described earlier, one should offer the Agnihotra-offering.[^1]

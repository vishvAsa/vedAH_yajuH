18. It is known from a Brāhmaṇa-text:-_When a sacrificial bread is badly baked then this becomes an offering material having Yama as its deity; it goes to Yama only. Having caused it to stand completely established (i.e. having completed the ritual connected with it), then having cooked rice-pap of four Śarāva (-full rice-grains) one should feed four Brāhmaṇas with it.

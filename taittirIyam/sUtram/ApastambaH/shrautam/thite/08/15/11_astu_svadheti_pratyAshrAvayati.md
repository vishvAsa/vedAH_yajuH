11. The Āgnīdhra[^1] responds with the words astu svadhā.[^2] The Adhvaryu orders the Hotr̥ to recite the offering verse with somaṁ pitr̥mantaṁ svadhā.[^3] The Hotr̥ recites the offering verse adding the words ye svadhāmahe[^4] (in the beginning). (The Hotr̥) utters the words svadhā namaḥ[^5] at the end of the verse.  


[^1]: The Āgnidhrā stands here to the south of the altar with his face to
the north. Cf. VIII.15.1. Contrast II.15.4.  

[^2]: Instead of astu śrauṣaṭ.  

[^3]: Instead of the word yaja (see II.18.3).  

[^4]: Instead of ye yajāmahe. 5. Instead of vaṣat (vauṣaṭ).

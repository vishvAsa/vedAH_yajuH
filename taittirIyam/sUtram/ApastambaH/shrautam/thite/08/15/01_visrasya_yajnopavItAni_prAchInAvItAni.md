1. Having loosened their sacred threads (which were upto now on the left shoulder and under the right arm-pit) the performers put them on the right shoulder and under the left arm-pit. The priests (and also the sacrificer) exchange (their places).[^1] They transfer the places of ladles,[^2] oblations and the enclosures (curtains).[^3]  


[^1]: Thus the Brahman and sacrificer who were so far to the south of the altar, should sit to the north of it and the Hotr̥, the Adhvaryu, and the Āgnīdhra should now go to the south (cp. VIII.16.15).   

[^2]: The ladles Juhū, Upbhr̥t, Dhruva were upto now (see II. 10.2). behind the fire on the altar, should now be kept as follows: the Juhū, to the north of the Upabhr̥t, and to the north of it the Dhruvā. The three oblations (sacrificial bread, fried grains, and stirred flour) are placed to the west of the ladles (II. 11.7) in the north. See for details the next two Sūtras.   

[^3]: viz. the four mats which are to be used for enclosing the altar VII.13.15. should also undergo the change in their places. Thus the one which was so far in the west should be now in the east, the one in the south, in the north and vice versa.

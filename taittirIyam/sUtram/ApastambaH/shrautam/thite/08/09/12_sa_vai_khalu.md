12. According to some (ritualists)[^1] having removed the calves by means of a branch of Parṇa-tree (butea Frondosa) having caused the milker to milk (the cows) in a pot on which a strainer is kept, in the manner in which it is done at the time of a New-moon-sacrifice, he cooks the rice-pap (in that milk).

Or rather after the Adhvaryu has put down the breads into two baskets and has tied them up by means of a stick to a wooden pole and then has placed them on a dried out tree or on an ant-hill,[^1] all the performers should recite thrice avatatadhanvā pinākahastaḥ... holding the breath as long as they can.

23. "The Varuṇapraghāsas are a (soma-)sacrifice indeed; it is not proper that (the sacrificer) should perform his Agnihotra on the Uttara-vedi"-this is the view of Vājasaneyins.[^1]  


[^1]: Cp. ŚB II.5.2.48. If the procedure mentioned in VIII.8.19 would be followed then the full-moon-offering and the Agnihotra connected thereby would be performed in the fire on the Uttaravedi.

1. On the next day, after having performed the full-moon offering, having moistened the head by means of water with prasūtā devena savitrā...[^1] (the sacrificer) causes to trim his hair (on the head) and shave the hair on the face by means of a quill of a porcupine having three white straps on it,[^2] a part or section of sugar-cane, red copper razor and Udumbara(-fruit bunch).[^3]  


[^1]: Cp. Kaṇvasaṁhitā ed. Weber, p. 90.  

[^2]: Cf. TB 1.5.6.5. TB mentions only the thorn and the copper razor.  

[^3]: audumbareṇa. According Rudradatta this means red copper. In Sīmantonnayana however there is a reference to the thorn of porcupine and Udumbara. It is possible that the word Audumbara here may be used in the same sense.

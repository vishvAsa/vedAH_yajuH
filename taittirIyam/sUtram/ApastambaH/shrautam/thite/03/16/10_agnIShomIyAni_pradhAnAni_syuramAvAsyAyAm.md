10. In the case of a (sacrificer) having enemies or practicing sorcery the oblations for Agni and Soma should be the main on the New-moon-day as well as on Full-moon-day.[^1]  

[^1]: This is in contrast to the normal practice according to which only
on the Full-moon-day the second sacrificial bread is to be offered to Agni and Soma.

9. This is valid (only) in connection with (the sacrificer who) establishes (fires) on the New-moon-day. (In the case of him who establishes fires) on the Full-moon-day, however, after he has completed the establishment-rite along with the offering (viz. Tanūhavis) and the Anvārambhaṇīyā(-beginning offering)[^1]  


[^1]: The file-establishment can be done on the New or Full-moon day see V.3.17. If it is done on the New-moon-day, (as is described here) following rites will have to be performed: Ādhāna, Tanūhavis on the day of establishment and Anvārambhaṇīyā on the first coming full-moon-day. If the Ādhāna is done on the Full-moon day, these rituals will have to be done on the day preceding the Full-moon-day. In the sūtra no. 8 the sentence is incomplete. See the next sūtra.

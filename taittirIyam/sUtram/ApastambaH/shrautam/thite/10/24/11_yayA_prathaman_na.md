11. (He does) not (measure) at the fifth (measuring) by means of that (finger by means of which he has measured) at the first (measuring). (He measures) with the same (little finger) at the last (i.e. the tenth measuring).[^1]  


[^1]: At the time of the fifth grip he thus uses the thumb and the middle finger and avoids the little finger being continuously used again. For the contents of the Sūtras 8-11, cf. TS VI.1.9.4-5.

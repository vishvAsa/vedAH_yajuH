10. For pleasure is obtained (by eating or using the forbidden substances). [^5] 


[^5]:  'What is that (reason)? [Sūtra 10] For to eat pungent condiments, salt, &c. gives pleasure to the eater, and therefore according to the maxim, I, 4, 12, 11, "That in case a custom has pleasure for its motive, there is no text of the holy law to authorise it," no text restricting (the prohibition of forbidden substances to the case in which a Brahmacārin does not receive them as leavings from his teacher) can be inferred (from the practice of eating such leavings).'--Haradatta.

[^3]:  According to I, 1, 2, 39-I, 1, 3, 10, the rule of dress for students is the following:--According to Āpastamba, a student shall wear a piece of cloth to cover his nakedness (langoṭī), and a skin as upper garment. Other teachers allow, besides, an upper dress of cloth, coloured differently for the different castes, with or without the addition of a deer-skin.

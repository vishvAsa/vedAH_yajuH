[^10]:  'But which is that one fire? Certainly not the Gṛhya-fire, because he must remain chaste. Therefore the meaning intended is, "He shall offer a Samidh morn and evening in the common fire, just as formerly, (during his studentship)." Another commentator says, "Gautama declares that he shall kindle a fire according to the rule of the Śrāmanaka Sūtra. The Śrāmanaka Sūtra is the Vaikhānasa Sūtra. Having kindled a fire in the manner prescribed there, he shall sacrifice in it every morning and every evening."'--Haradatta. See also Manu VI, 4; Yājñ. III, 45.

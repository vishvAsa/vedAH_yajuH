24. It is declared in the Smṛtis that a Brāhmaṇa alone should be chosen as teacher (or spiritual guide). [^16] 


[^16]:  Manu II, 241, 242. From here down to II, 3, 6, 2, Āpastamba again treats of the duties of students and teachers, a subject which appears to have in his eyes a greater importance than any other. The rules given now apply chiefly to householders. It would seem that they have been inserted in this particular place, because the reception of a former teacher is to be described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a 'learned guest' II, 3, 6, 3 seq.

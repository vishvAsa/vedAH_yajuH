- alpha Orinionis = Betelgeuse इति केचित्। sirius [इति](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/01/a-note-on-the-asterisms-forming-the-nak%E1%B9%A3atra-s/) मानसतरङ्गिणीकारः।
- The hands of rudra were associated with the other forward stars like beta.
- "ārdrayā rudraḥ prathamānam eti । This means that he original Ārdrā was likely seen as a bright star. Now, while both α Ori and α Canis Majoris are bright stars, α Ori is too close to Mṛgaśiras making α Can Ma more likely, and is also closer to the position of the later yogatāra (γ Geminorum) when projected on to the ecliptic."
- "In the brāhmaṇa on the nakṣatra ritual in TB 1.5.1.1 the name Ārdrā is replaced by Mṛgayu which is always understood as Sirius: rudrasya bāhū mṛgayavaḥ".
- Further, this is supported by the evidence of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa on the famed āgnimāruta-śastra recitation:  प्रजापतिबाणो हि orion belt इति। स बाणो रोहिणीम् अनुसरते प्रजापतये। पूर्णकथा [ऽत्र](/kalpe_svamatam/brAhmaNam/aitareya/tattvam/pashupati-prajApati-rohiNI/)।
- "Further, the name Ārdrā means moist indicating a link with the wet season. The Iranian equivalent of Sirius, Tishtrya is also associated with rain suggesting that Ārdrā inherits this ancestral association."
- "Another rich part of the sky with the open cluster M41 below Sirius. "
- "A good challenge in this constellation is to see the companion star of Sirius . It was predicted by great mathematician Friedrich Bessel through the wobble of Sirius and seen only later by others. It is a small star about the size of the Earth but with the mass of the sun. IA good challenge in this constellation is to see the companion star of Sirius .

8हेती रुद्रस्येति ॥ रुद्रायुधं नः परितो वृणक्तु वर्जयतु । नः हविर्जुषतां सेवताम् । अथ तौ रुद्र आर्द्रा च उभौ विश्वानि दुरितानि प्रमुञ्चमानौ । अघशंसं पापरुचिम् । यद्वा - मम पापशंसिनमरातिं अपनुदतां विशेषेण नाशयताम् ॥

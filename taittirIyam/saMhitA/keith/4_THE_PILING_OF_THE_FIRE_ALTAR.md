## 1 The Placing of the Fire in the Fire-pan
### 01
#### a
Yoking mind first,  
Extending his thoughts, Savitr  
Discerning the light,  
Hath brought Agni from the earth.
#### b
Yoking with mind the gods,  
Going to the heaven, the sky, with thought,  
Those that are to make great light,  
Savitr instigates.
#### c
With mind well yoked are we  
In the instigation of god Savitr,  
For strength to go to the heaven.
#### d
They yoke their minds, they yoke their thoughts,  
The priests of the mighty wise priest,  
He alone, who knoweth the way, appointeth their functions [1]  
Great is the praise of the god Savitr.
#### e
I yoke with honour your ancient prayer;  
The praises go like Suras on their way;  
All the sons of immortality hear (it),  
Who have achieved dwellings divine.
#### f
He whose advance others followed,  
Gods, of the god praising might,  
He who meted out the regions of earth,  
He is the brilliant god Savitr in greatness.
#### g
O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice [2] to good luck; may the divine Gandharva, who purifieth thoughts purify our thought; may the lord of speech to-day make sweet our utterance.
#### h
This sacrifice for us, O god Savitr  
Do thou instigate, serving the gods,  
Finding comrades, ever victorious,  
Winning booty, winning heaven.
#### i
By the Rc make the Stoma to prosper,  
By the Gayatra the Rathantara,  
The Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.
#### k
On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pusan, with the Gayatri metre, I take thee, in the manner of Angiras.
#### l
Thou art the spade, thou art the woman [3], from the abode of the earth I bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras; with the Tristubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.
#### m
Thou art the bearer, thou art the woman; through thee may we be strong to dig Agni of the dust in his place; with the Jagati metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.
#### n
Grasping in thy hand, Savitr,  
Bearing the spade of gold,  
Therewith digging Agni

Do thou bring for us light unperishing.  
With the Anustubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.
### 2

#### a
This bond of order they grasped  
At their assemblies in ages gone by, the sages;  
Therewith the gods mastered the pressed (juice)--  
In the Saman of order proclaiming the stream.
#### b
Swiftly run hither, O steed,  
Along the most extended space;  
In the sky is thy highest birth,  
In the atmosphere thy navel, on the earth thy birthplace.
#### c
Yoke ye two the ass,  
In this course, O ye of mighty wealth,  
Which beareth Agni, serving us.
#### d
In each need more strong,  
In each contest, we invoke,  
As friends, Indra to aid us.
#### e
Hastening [1] come hither, trampling the enemy,  
Come with wondrous skill from the leadership of Rudra; Fare along the broad atmosphere,  
With happy pastures, bestowing security.
#### f
With Pusan as fellow, from the abode of the earth do thou approach Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### g
We approach Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### h
We will bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### i
We bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### k
Agni gazed along the forefront of the dawns,  
Along the days first, the all-knower,  
And in many ways along the rays of the sun [2],  
He hath extended along sky and earth.  
I The steed coming from the way  
Driveth every foe;  
He is fain to gaze with his eye  
On Agni in his great abode.
#### m
Coming to earth, O steed,  
Do thou seek Agni with thy radiance;  
Turning from earth I tell us  
Whence we shall dig him up.
#### n
Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth,  
Thy breath the atmosphere, thy birthplace the ocean; Discerning with thine eye,  
Do thou overcome [3] the enemy.
#### o
Arise for great prosperity  
From this abode, giving wealth, O steed;  
May we enjoy the loving favour of earth,  
That are about to dig fire in her lap.
#### p
The strong steed hath stepped forward, giving wealth; He hath made the place of earth well wrought;  
Thence let us dig Agni of fair aspect,  
Mounting the heaven on the top of the vault.
#### q
The water divine do thou pour, full of sweetness  
To avert diseases for men,  
From their place let arise

#### r
I touch [4] Agni with mind, with ghee,  
Who lordeth it over all the worlds,  
Broad, vast, with pervading vital power,  
Most extensive, impetuous, winning, food.
#### s
I touch thee with speech, with ghee,  
With friendly mind accept it;  
With mortal glory, with engaging colour,  
Agni, with body full of life may not be touched.
#### t
Round the offerings hath Agni gone,  
The sage, the lord of strength,  
Bestowing jewels on the donor.
#### u
May we set thee around us, O Agni,  
The sage, O strong one, as a fort,  
Of daring due, day by day,  
Destroyer of that which may be broken.
#### v
Thou, O Agni, with days, fain to shine towards us,  
Thou from the waters, thou from the rock,  
Thou from the woods, thou from the plants,  
Thou, O lord of men, art born pure.
### 03
#### a
On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pusan, in the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### b
Full of light, thou, O Agni; of fair aspect,  
Shining with unaging radiance,  
Auspicious and harmless to offspring,  
In the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
#### c
Thou art the back of the waters, expansive, wide,  
About to bear Agni, least to be laid aside;  
Growing to might as the lotus-flower,  
Do thou extend in width with the measure of heaven.
#### d
Ye two are protectors [1] and a help,  
Unbroken, both expansive;  
Do ye expanding be united;  
Bear Agni of the dust.
#### e
Be ye united, that win the heaven,  
In union of heart and self;  
Who shall bear within Agni  
Full of light and unaging.
#### f
Thou art of the dust, all-supporting; Atharvan first pressed out thee, O Agni.
#### g
Thee, O Agni, from the lotus  
Atharvan pressed out,  
From the head of every priest.
#### h
Thee the sage, Dadhyañc,  
Son [2] of Atharvan, doth kindle,  
Slayer of Vrtra, destroyer of foes.
#### i
Thee Pathya Vrsan doth kindle,  
Best slayer of foes,  
Winner of booty in every conflict.
#### k
Sit thou, O Hotr, in thine own world, wise,  
Place thou the sacrifice in the birthplace of good deeds,  
Eager for the gods, do thou sacrifice to them with oblation;  
O Agni, bestow great strength on the sacrificer.

#### l
The Hotr hath sat him down in the place of the Hoty, wise, Glittering, shining, skilful,  
With vows and foresight undeceived, most wealthy, Bearing a thousand, pure-tongued Agni.
#### m
Sit thou down, thou art great,  
Burn [3] best servant of the gods;  
O Agni, pure one, send forth the ruddy smoke, O famous one, that can be seen afar.
#### n
Be born noble in the forefront of the days,  
Kind to the kindly, red in the woods;  
Bestowing seven jewels in every home  
Hath Agni sat him down as Hotr.
### 04
#### a
May I Vayu, Matariśvan, unite  
The broken heart of thee that art outstretched  
To him who moveth with the expiration of the gods, With thee, O goddess, be Vasat.
#### b
Wellborn, with light,  
Guard and protector, thou hast sat on the heaven; O Agni, thy garment of many hues,  
Put on, O thou that dost abound in light.
#### c
Arise, thou of fair sacrifice,  
Aid us with thy divine radiance;  
Brilliant to behold, with mighty blaze,  
Do thou come hither, O Agni, in response to our prayers [1].
#### d
Arise erect to aid us,  
Like Savitr, the god;  
Erect to win the booty,  
When in contest we call on thee with the shining praisers.
#### e
Born, thou art the child of the two worlds,  
O Agni; a brilliant child distributed among the plants; A beauteous babe beyond the darkness outspread, Thou didst come thundering from thy mothers.
#### f
Be firm, of strong limbs,  
Swift, a mighty steed;  
Be broad, of kindly seat,  
Thou art the carrier of dust for Agni.
#### g
Be auspicious [2], for offspring  
Of men, O Angiras;  
Scorch not sky and earth,  
Nor the atmosphere, nor the trees.
#### h
Let the steed advance, thundering  
And resounding, the ass, the flier;  
Bearing Agni of the dust  
May he fall not before his day.
#### i
The ass, well yoked to your chariot,  
O ye strong ones, that thundereth,  
May he as swift envoy  
Bear hence Agni of the dust.
#### k
The strong, bearing the strong Agni,  
Germ of the waters, him of the ocean,  
O Agni, come hither, for enjoyment [3],  
As holy order and truth.

#### l
O plants, do ye accept Agni here  
Who cometh auspicious towards you;  
Casting aside all hostilities, all evil imaginings,  
Sitting down, may he smite away from us misfortune.
#### m
O plants, do ye rejoice in him,  
O ye that are rich in flowers, and have fair berries;  
This germ of yours, of due season,  
Hath sat him in his ancient seat.
### 05
#### a
Radiant with extending blaze,  
Do thou repel the enemy, the Raksas's hostility;  
May I enjoy the protection of the great protector,  
May I enjoy the leadership of Agni, easy to invoke.
#### b
Ye, waters, are healing;  
Further us to strength,  
To see great joy.
#### c
The most auspicious flavour that is yours,  
Accord to us here,  
Like eager mothers.
#### d
To him may we come with satisfaction,  
To whose dwelling ye quicken us,  
O waters, and propagate us.
#### e
Mitra [1], having united the earth  
And the ground with light,  
Agni well-born, all-knower,  
Common to all men, the wide extending.
#### f
For health I unite thee, for offspring; may the All-gods, common to all men, unite thee with the Anustubh metre, in the manner of Angiras.
#### g
The Rudras, having gathered together the earth,  
Kindled a great light;  
Their ray undying  
Shineth clear among the gods.
#### h
United by the Vasus, the cunning Rudras,  
The mud fit for the rite,  
Making it smooth with her hands,  
May Sinivali fashion [2] this (pan).
#### i
Sinivali, of fair braids,  
Of fair head-dress, with fair locks,  
May she, O Aditi, O great one,  
Place within thy hands the pan.

Let Aditi fashion the pan with might,  
With her arms , with wisdom,  
Let her bear Agni in her womb  
As a mother a child in her lap.

#### o
Thou art the girdle of Aditi.

#### p
Let Aditi seize thy hole with the Pankti metre, in the manner of Angiras.
#### q
Having made the great pan,  
Wrought of clay, as a birthplace for Agni,

#### g
Mitra, extending, compasseth  
This sky in greatness [2],  
And the earth with his fame.
#### h
The fame of Mitra, supporter of the people,  
Of the god is eternal,  
True, and most varied in fame.

With fair hands, fair fingers,

#### a
Let the half-years, the seasons, increase thee, O Agni,  
The years, the Rsis, and what truths there are;  
Shine with thy heavenly lustre,  
Illuminate all the quarters of the earth.
#### b
Be kindled, O Agni, and awake him;  
Arise for great good fortune;  
May he that waiteth on thee, O Agni, be not harmed;  
May thy priests be famous, not the others.
#### c
These Brahmans, O Agni, choose thee;  
Be thou propitious, O Agni [1], to us in the sanctuary;
  
Slaying our rivals, conquering the foes,  
Do thou watch unfailing in thine own home.
#### d
Here, O Agni, do thou grant wealth;  
May not the overcomers, anticipating (us); overcome thee; May the lordly power be easily wielded by thee, O Agni Let him who waiteth on thee prosper, unassailed.
#### e
With good life, O Agni, unite thee with the lordly power; O Agni, vie with Mitra in friendlihood;  
Be thou the midmost of thine equals;  
O Agni, shine forth here to be invoked by kings.

Unwisdom, niggardliness, O Agni,  
All obstacles do thou overcome,  
And bestow upon us wealth with heroes.
#### g
Unassailable, all-knower, unoverpowered,  
Ruling, O Agni, supporting the lordly power, do thou shine here; Through all the regions, freeing men from fear,  
Do thou this day guard us for increase with kindliness.
#### h
O Brhaspati, instigator, awake him;  
The sharp do thou more thoroughly sharpen;  
Increase him to great prosperity [3]  
Let the All-gods rejoice in him.
#### i
What time, O Brhaspati, thou didst free  
From life yonder, from Yama's enmity,  
The Aśvins removed death from him,  
O Agni, the physicians of the gods with their powers.
#### k
We from the darkness,  
Gazing on the higher light,  
Surya a god among the gods,  
Have come to the highest light.
### 08
#### a
Uplifted are his kindling-sticks,  
Uplifted and pure are the rays of Agni,  
Most brilliant (are they) of the son of fair countenance.
#### b
The son of self, the Asura, all-knower,  
God, god among gods,  
Anointeth the ways with mead and ghee.
#### c
With mead thou attainest the sacrifice,  
Delighting, as Naraśansa, O Agni,  
The kindly god Savitr, with every boon.
#### d
Hither he cometh, with might, with ghee,  
The priest implored with adoration;  
To Agni the ladles (move) when the rites proceed.
#### e
Worship let him pay to the greatness of him, of Agni; He [1] indeed is pre-eminent among the delightful, The wealthy, the wisest, best bestower of wealth.
#### f
The divine doors--all--preserve  
The rules of him, of Agni,  
Of wide expanse, lording it with dominion.
#### g
May day and night  
Like heavenly maidens in his birthplace  
Protect this our sacrifice and offering.
#### h
O ye divine Hotrs, sing ye
  
To our uplifted sacrifice, to Agni's tongue,  
Make for us good offering.
#### i
May the three goddesses sit on this strew,  
Ida, Sarasvati [2], Bharati, the great, being sung.
#### k
That seminal fluid of ours, wondrous,  
Abundant, may Tvastr release  
As increase of wealth with good heroes, as offspring to us.
#### l
O tree, let free,  
Bestowing with thyself among the gods;  
Let Agni as queller make ready the oblation.
#### m
O Agni, utter 'Hail!' O all-knower, over the oblation for Indra;  
May all the gods rejoice in this offering.
#### n
The golden germ first arose;  
Born he was the only lord of creation;  
He supporteth the earth and the sky [3]  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### o
He that alone by his might is king  
Of the breathing, the winking world,  
Who is lord of these bipeds and quadrupeds;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### p
He who is giver of breath, giver of strength,  
Upon whose bidding all, even the gods, wait,  
Whose shadow is immortality and death;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?  
He whose are these snowy mountains through his might,  
Whose they call the ocean with the Rasa [4],  
Whose two arms are these quarters;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### r
To whom the armies stablished  
Through his aid gazed with minds disturbed,  
Over whom on the rising of the sun it goeth;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### s
He by whom the dread earth and the sky were made firm,  
By whom the heaven was established, by whom the vault,  
Who is the measure of the region in the atmosphere;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### t
When the waters, the great ones, went  
Bearing all [5] strength, begetting Agni,  
Then one breath of the gods arose;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
#### u
He who in his might beheld the waters  
Bearing strength, begetting Agni,  
Who was the god alone over the gods;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
### 09
#### a
Purpose, Agni, impulse, hail! Mind, intellect, Agni, impulse, hail! Thought, knowledge, Agni, impulse, hail! Discrimination of speech, Agni, impulse, hail! To Manu, lord of creatures, hail! To Agni Vaiśvanara hail!
#### b
Let every man choose the companionship  
Of the god who leadeth;  
Every man prayeth for wealth;  
Let him choose glory that he may prosper; hail!
#### e
Be not broken, nor come to harm;
  
Be firm and enduring;  
O mother, daringly show thy heroism [1];  
With Agni wilt thou do this deed.
#### d
Be firm, O goddess earth, for prosperity;  
Thou art the wile of the Asura, made with power; Let this oblation be pleasing to the gods;  
Do thou emerge uninjured at this our sacrifice.
#### e
O Mitra, heat this pan; may it not break.
#### f
This I place around thee, to prevent breaking.
#### g
Feeding on wood, sipping clarified butter,  
The ancient desirable Hotr,  
Son of strength, the wondrous.
#### h
From a far region  
Come hither to these lower ones [2]  
Favour those in the region where I am.
#### i
From a far distance  
Do thou of ruddy steeds come hither;  
Of the dust, dear to many,  
O Agni, do thou overcome obstructions.
#### k
Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother,  
O Agni, knowing all the ways;  
Consume her not with light nor with heat,  
Within her shine with pure radiance.
#### l
O Agni, with glow  
Within thine own seat of the pan,  
Heating with her blaze,  
Be thou, O all-knower, auspicious.
#### m
Becoming auspicious to me, O Agni,  
Do thou sit down auspicious;  
Having made all the quarters auspicious  
Sit here on thine own birthplace.
### 10
#### a
Whatever logs we place  
In thee, O Agni,  
Be that ghee for thee;  
Accept it, O youngest one.
#### b
What the insect eateth,  
What the ant climbeth over,  
All that be ghee for thee;  
Accept it, O youngest one.
#### c
Mighty by night, unfailingly bearing (food)  
For him as fodder to a stalled horse,  
May we, O Agni, thy neighbours, be not harmed, Rejoicing in increase of wealth, in food.
#### d
Kindled on earth's navel [1], Agni  
We invoke for great increase of wealth,  
Delighting in drink, recipient of great praise, worthy of offering, The victor, Agni, sustainer in battles.
#### e
The hosts that attack,  
That pierce, the trooping,  
The thieves and the robbers,  
Them, O Agni, do I place in thy mouth.
#### f
With thy tusks the burglars,
  
With thy teeth the robbers,  
With thy jaws the thieves, O blessed one,  
Do thou chew, well chewed.
#### g
The burglars among men,  
The thieves and robbers in the forest,  
The [2] mischief-workers in the thickets,  
Them I place within thy jaws.
#### h
The man who is hostile to us,  
And him who hateth us,  
Him who revileth us, and him who seeketh to hurt,  
Every one of them do thou crush to atoms.
#### i
Sharpened is my holy power,  
Sharpened the strength and might,  
Sharpened the conquering lordly power of him  
Whose domestic priest I am.
#### k
Their arms have I uplifted,  
Their radiance, their might;  
With holy power I waste the foes,  
I support [3] my own.  
I Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,  
For glory shining with immortal life;  
Agni became immortal in his strength  
What time prolific Dyaus begat him.
#### m
The sage showeth all forms;  
He hath produced bliss for biped and quadruped;  
Savitr, the desirable, hath discerned the vault;  
After the moving forward of the dawn he shineth.
#### n
Night and the dawn, one-minded but of various form,  
United suckle one child;  
The radiant one shineth between sky and earth [4]  
The gods, granters of wealth, support Agni.
#### o
Thou art the bird of fair feathers; thy head the Trivrt (Stoma), thy eye the Gayatra, thy breath the Stoma, thy body the Vamadevya Saman, thy wings the Brhat and the Rathantara, thy tail the Yajñayajñiya, thy limbs the metres, thy hoofs the altars, thy name the Yajus formulae.
#### p
Thou art the bird of fair feathers; go to the sky, fly to the heaven.
### 11
#### a
O Agni, that sacrifice, that offering,  
Which on all sides thou dost encircle,  
It of a truth goeth to the gods.
#### b
O Soma, the wondrous aids  
That there are of thine for the generous man,  
With these be thou our helper.
#### c
Agni the, head.
#### d
Be.
#### e
Thou, O Soma.
#### f
These abodes of thine.
#### g
That excellent glory of Savitr,  
The god, we meditate,  
That he may stimulate our prayers.
#### h
What we have done in thoughtlessness against the host divine,  
With feeble insight, with violence as is man's way [1],  
Among gods and men, do thou, O Savitr,  
There instigate us to sinlessness.

#### i
Impeller of righteousness,  
Instigator of devotions,  
Sarasvati hath established the sacrifice.
#### k
May the maiden of the lightning, the one of varied life,  
Sarasvati, wife of a hero, inspire our devotion;  
In accord with the ladies, may she accord to the singer  
Protection uninjured, and guardianship unsurpassable.  
I May Pusan follow the cows for us,  
May he guard our horses;  
May Pusan win booty for us.
#### m
Bright is part of thee, worthy of offering another [2],  
Like day and night of various hue, like the sky art thou;  
All magic thou dost further, O powerful one;  
Propitious here, O Pusan, be thy bounty.
#### n
They grew in might with their own power;  
They mounted the vault, they made a broad seat;  
When Visnu helped the strong one who causeth gladness,  
Like birds they sat on the dear strew.
#### o
Bear ye variegated praise to the strong singer,  
The host of the Maruts, which hath strength;  
Who with might endure might [3],  
For the jocund ones, O Agni, the earth shakes.
#### p
The All-gods.
#### q
O All-gods.
#### r
May sky and earth this day  
Place among the gods this sacrifice,  
Successful, touching the sky.
#### s
Bring forward the parents born of old with now songs,  
In the seat of holy order,  
Come to us, O sky and earth, with the host divine;  
Great is your protection.
#### t
Awaken Agni with the praise,  
Kindling the immortal;  
May he place our oblations among the gods.
#### u
Bearing the oblation, immortal,  
The eager messenger, well-inclined,  
Agni uniteth with our prayer.
#### v
Health be they.
#### w
For each prize.

O Agni, returner, to us return  
With life, with radiance, with gain, with wisdom, with offspring, with wealth.

Bring back to us wealth.

In the breast of the sky, O Agni, he who gazeth on men;

Booty a thousandfold, like a swift steed.

Loosen ye this bond made of iron;
  
Do thou in accord with Yama and Yami  
Mount this highest vault.

Bound on thy neck, not to be loosened,  
This I loosen for thee as from the middle of life; Then living, let loose, do thou eat the food.

Thee in whose cruel mouth here I make offering, For the loosening of these bonds,  
As 'earth' men know thee,  
As 'Nirrti' [3], I know thee on every side.

Seek the man who poureth not offering nor sacrifices; The road of the thief and robber thou followest; Seek another than us, that is thy road;  
Homage be to thee, O Nirrti, O goddess.

Praising Nirrti, the goddess,  
Like a father his son, I weary her with my words; She who knoweth all that is born,  
Discerneth, the lady, every head.

Abode and collector of riches,  
Every form she discerneth with might [4], Like the god Savitr of true laws,  
Like Indra, she standeth at the meeting of the ways.
#### n
Make firm the straps,  
Fasten the buckets;  
We shall drain the well full of water,  
That never is exhausted, never faileth.

Propitious, with well-polished handle,  
Plougheth up a cow, a sheep,  
And a fat blooming maid,  
A chariot support with a platform.

The plants born  
Three generations before the gods, Of the brown ones I celebrate  
The seven and a hundred abodes.

A hundred, O mother, are your abodes, A thousand too your shoots,  
Therefore do ye, with a hundred powers, Make him whole for me.
#### c
With flowers, with shoots,  
Fruit-bearing and without fruit,  
Like steeds victorious  
The plants are strong to help.

'Plants', O ye mothers,  
I hail you, O goddesses;  
Go bearing away defilement,  
Defilement [1] destroying.

In the Aśvattha is your seat,  
In the Parna is your dwelling made; Cows shall in truth be your share  
If ye shall gain this man.
#### f
In that in strength I seize  
These plants in my hand,  
The soul of the disease perisheth,  
As before one that taketh alive.

When the plants come together  
Like princes at the assembly,  
Sage is the physician called,  
Slayer of Raksases, overpowerer of diseases.

Remover is your mother by name, And ye are helpers;  
Ye are winged streams [2];  
Remove whatever is unwell.

Let one of you aid another,  
Let one be of assistance to another; All the plants in unison  
Do ye further this speech of mine.

The strength of the plants hath arisen Like cows from the pasturage,  
Of them that are fain to win gain,  
To the self of thee, O man.  
I Beyond all obstacles,  
Like the thief the pen, they have strode, The plants have shaken away  
Every defilement in the body.
#### m
Those [3] that have mounted thy self, That have entered every limb,  
May they repel thy disease,  
Like a dread intercessor.
#### n
O disease, do thou fly forth  
With the eagle, the blue jay (kikidivi) With the rush of the wind,  
With the whirlwind do thou disappear.

Rich in steeds, rich in Soma,  
Full of strength, full of power,  
I have found all the plants  
For his safety.

The fruitful, the fruitless,  
The flowering, the flowerless,  
Impelled by Brhaspati,  
May they free us from tribulation.

The [4] plants whose king is Soma,  
And which have entered the earth,  
Of them thou art the highest,  
Impel us to long life.

Falling from the sky  
The plants said,  
'He, whom we reach while in life,  
Shall not come to ill.'

Those that hear now  
And those that are gone far away,  
Coming all together here  
Give ye him healing.

May the digger of you come to no ill,  
Nor he for whom I dig you;  
May all our bipeds and quadrupeds  
Be free from disease.

The plants hold converse  
With Soma, the king,  
'The man for whom the Brahman prepares (us),  
We, O king, bring to safety.'
### 07
#### a
May I be harm us not who is father of earth  
Or who, of true law, created the sky,  
And he who created the great bright waters;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation?

Turn towards (us), O earth,  
With the sacrifice, with milk;  
Over thy caul let Agni, aroused, creep.
#### c
O Agni, that of thee which is pure, which is bright, Which is cleansed, which is fit for offering,  
That we bear to the gods.
#### d
Food and strength do I take hence [1],  
From the abode of holy order, from the birthplace of immortality. May it enter us, in cattle and in plants;  
I abandon decline, lack of food, and ill-health.

O Agni, strength and fame are thine,  
Thy rays shine mightily, O rich in light;  
O thou of broad radiance, with thy might, strength worthy of laud, Thou bestowest on the worshipper, O sage.

Do thou extend over men, O Agni,  
Ruling over wealth for us, O immortal one;  
Thou art the master of a glorious form,  
Thou fillest glorious wealth.

Rejoice in our fair praises [2], being adored in our prayers;
  
In thee have they placed food, rich in seed,  
Of wondrous aid, of prosperous birth.

With undiminished radiance, thou comest forth with thy light; Visiting thy parents thou aidest them;

The righteous, the bull, common to all men,  
Agni, men place before them for favour,  
Thee with their speech, that art ready to hear and most extending, The divine, the generations of men.

Preparer of the sacrifice, the wise,  
Who ruleth for great gain,  
The giver of the Bhrgus, the eager, skilled in the sacrifice Thou fillest glorious wealth.

Swell up, let thy strength be gathered  
From all sides, O Soma.  
Be strong in the gathering of might.

Let thy milk draughts, thy strength be united,  
The mightinesses of him who overcometh the foe;  
Swelling for immortality, O Soma,  
Place in the sky the highest glories,

He hath overcome every foe, every enemy;  
That Agni saith, that saith Soma too;  
Brhaspati, Savitr, say this of me,  
Pusan hath placed me in the world of good action.

When first thou didst cry on birth,  
Arising from the ocean or the dust,  
The wings of the eagle, the limbs of the gazelle,  
That is thy famed birth, O steed.

Thou art the back of the waters, the birthplace of Agni, The ocean swelling on either side;  
Growing to might [1] as the lotus flower,  
Do thou extend in width with the measure of heaven.

The holy power born first in the east  
Vena hath disclosed from the shining boundary,  
He hath revealed its fundamental nearest forms,  
The womb of being and of not being.

The golden germ first rose;  
Born he was the only lord of creation;  
He supporteth the earth and the sky;  
To what god shall we offer with oblation.
#### f
The drop hath fallen on the earth [2], the sky,  
On this seat, and on the one which was aforetime;  
The drop that wandereth over the third seat  
I offer in the seven Hotras.

Homage to the serpents  
Which are on the earth,

Or those that are among the trees,  
Or those that lie in the wells,  
To those serpents honour.

Thou art firm, supporting, unoverpowered,  
Well wrought by Viśvakarman;  
Let not the ocean smite thee, nor the eagle;  
Unshaking do thou make firm the earth.

May Prajapati seat thee on the back of earth, capacious, extending; thou art extent, thou art earth, thou art the world, thou art the earth, thou art Aditi all-sustaining, sustainer of all the world; sustain the earth, make firm the earth, harm not the earth, for all expiration, cross-breathing, up-breathing,  
for support [1], for motion; may Agni protect thee with great prosperity, with most auspicious covering; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm.

Arising from every stem,  
From every joint,

To thee, O goddess, O brick,  
Let us sacrifice with oblation.

That highest step of Visnu [3]  
The singers ever gaze upon  
Like an eye stretched in the sky.

Those beams of thine, O Agni, which rising  
In the sun with rays envelop the sky,  
With all of them bring us to brilliance, to men.

Those flames of yours in the sun,  
O gods, in cattle, in horses,

Assigning honey to the deities,  
On its brink sit seven tawny ones,  
Milking at will the stream of ambrosia.

Smite down another than us.
#### m
A thousandfold in thousands  
Are the missiles in thine arms;
  
O adorable one, do thou turn away  
The points of those which thou dost rule.
### 11
#### a
The Rudras that are over the earth  
In thousands by thousands,  
Their bows we unstring  
At a thousand leagues.
#### b
The Bhavas in this great ocean,  
The atmosphere--
#### c
The Çarvas of black necks, and white throats,  
Who wander below on the earth--
#### d
The Rudras who abide in the sky,  
Of black necks and white throats--
#### e
Those who of black necks and ruddy,  
Grass green, are in the trees--
#### f
The overlords of creatures,  
Without top-knot, with braided hair--
#### g
Those that assault men in their food  
And in their cups as they drink--
#### h
Those that guard the paths,  
Bearing food, warriors--
#### i
Those that resort to fords [1],  
With spears and quivers--
#### k
The Rudras that so many and yet more  
Occupy the quarters, their bows we unstring  
At a thousand leagues.
#### l,m,n
Homage to the Rudras on the earth, in the atmosphere, in the sky, whose arrows are food, wind, and rain, to them ten eastwards, ten to the south, ten to the west, ten to the north, ten upwards; to them homage, be they merciful to us, him whom we hate and him who hateth us, I place him within your jaws.

## 6 The Preparation of the Fire
### 01
#### a
The strength resting on the stone, the bill,  
On the wind, on Parjanya, on the breath of Varuna,  
Brought together from the waters, from the plants, from the trees;  
That food and strength do ye, O Maruts, bounteously bestow upon us.
#### b
In the stone is thy hunger; let thy pain reach N. N., whom we hate.
#### c
With the wind of the ocean  
We envelop thee, O Agni;  
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
#### d
With the caul of winter  
We envelop thee, O Agni;  
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
#### e
Down upon earth [1], upon the reed,  
Upon the waters lower (do thou descend);  
Thou, O Agni, art the bile of the waters,
#### f
O female frog, with these come hither;  
Do thou make this sacrifice of ours

#### g
Pure, with radiance wonderful,  
On earth he hath shone as with the light of dawn.
#### h
Who (cometh) to battle,  
Moving with strength as on Etaśa's course,  
In the heat unathirst, immortal.
#### i
O Agni, the purifying, with thy light,  
O god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods [2], and sacrifice.
#### k
Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
1 This is the meeting of the waters,  
The abode of the ocean;  
May thy bolts afflict another than us;  
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
#### m
Homage to thy heat, thy blaze  
Homage be to thy light;  
May thy bolts afflict another than us;  
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
#### n
To him that sitteth in man, hail! [3] To him that sitteth in the waters, hail! To him that sitteth in the wood, hail! To him that sitteth on the strew, hail! To him that findeth the heaven, hail!
#### o
Those gods among gods, worshipful among the worshipful,  
Who await their yearly portion,  
Who eat not oblations, in this sacrifice  
Do ye delight yourselves with honey and ghee.
#### p
The gods who above the gods attained godhead,  
Who lead the way to this holy power,  
Without whom no place whatever is pure,  
Neither on the heights of sky or earth are they.
#### q
Giver of expiration art thou [4], of inspiration, of cross-breathing,  
Giver of eyesight, giver of splendour, giver of wide room;  
May thy bolts afflict another than us;  
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
#### r
May Agni with his piercing blaze  
Cast down every foe;  
May Agni win for us wealth.
#### s
With his countenance the kindly one  
Will sacrifice to the gods for us, most skilled to win prosperity by sacrifice; Guardian undeceived and protector of us,  
O Agni, shine forth with radiance and with wealth.
### 02
#### a
He who sat down, offering all these beings,  
As Hotr, the seer, our father,  
He seeking wealth with prayer,  
Hath entered into the boon of the first of coverers.
#### b
Since Viśvakarman is mighty in mind,  
Disposer, ordainer, and highest seer,  
Their offerings rejoice in food,  
Where say they is one beyond the seven Rsis.
#### c
He who is our father, our begetter, the ordainer,  
Who begot us from being unto being [1],  
Who alone assigneth their names to the gods,

Him other beings approach for knowledge.
#### d
Wealth they won by offering to him  
The seers of old like singers in abundance,  
They who fashioned these beings illumined and unillumined In the expanse of space.
#### e
Ye shall not find him who produced this world; Another thing shall be betwixt you;  
Enveloped in mist and with stammering  
The singers of hymns move enjoying life.
#### f
Beyond the sky, beyond this [2] earth,  
Beyond the gods, what is secret from the Asuras, What germ first did the waters bear,  
When all the gods came together?
#### g
This germ the waters first bore,  
When all the gods came together;  
On the navel of the unborn is set the one  
On which doth rest all this world.
#### h
Viśvakarman, the god, was born;  
Then second the Gandharva;  
Third the father, begetter of plants [31  
In many a place did he deposit the germ of the waters.
#### i
Father of the eye, the sage with his mind,  
Produced these two worlds rich in ghee,  
When the fore ends were made firm,  
Then did sky and earth extend.
#### k
With eyes on every side, with a face on every side, With hands on every side, with feet on every side, The one god producing sky and earth  
Welds them together with arms, with wings.
#### l
What was the basis?  
Which and what his support?  
When producing earth [4] Viśvakarman, all-seeing, Disclosed the sky with his might.
#### m
What was the wood, and what the tree,  
Whence they formed sky and earth?  
O ye wise ones, inquire with your minds  
On what he stood as he supported the worlds.
#### n
Thy highest, lowest,  
Midmost abodes here, O Viśvakarman,  
In the offering do thou teach thy comrades, O faithful one; Do thou thyself sacrifice to thyself, rejoicing.
#### o
The lord of speech, Viśvakarman,  
Let us invoke this day to aid us [5], thought yoked for strength, May he delight in our nearest offerings,  
He with all healing, to aid (us), the doer of good deeds.
#### p
O Viśvakarman, waxing great with the oblation, Do thou thyself sacrifice to thyself rejoicing;  
May the others around, our foes, be confused;  
May our patrons here be rich.
#### q
O Viśvakarman, with the oblation as strengthening, Thou didst make Indra, the protector, free from scathe, To him the clans of old bowed in homage,  
That he might be dread, to be severally invoked.
#### r
To the ocean, the moving,
  
The lord of streams, homage!  
To the lord of all the streams  
Do ye offer, to Viśvakarman,  
Through all the days the immortal offering.
### 03
#### a
O Agni, to whom ghee is offered,  
Do thou lead him forward;  
Unite him with increase of wealth,  
With offspring and with wealth.
#### b
O Indra, bring him to the fore,  
That he may be lord over his fellows;  
Unite him with splendour,  
That he may assign their shares to the gods.
#### c
Him, O Agni, do thou exalt  
In whose house we make the offering;  
To him may the gods lend aid,  
And he the lord of holy power.
#### d
May the All-gods thee [1],  
O Agni, bear up with their thoughts;  
Be thou to us most propitious,  
With kindly face, abounding in light.
#### e
May the five regions divine aid the sacrifice,  
The goddesses driving away poverty and hostility,  
And giving to the lord of the sacrifice increase of wealth.  
In increase of wealth the sacrifice hath been established,  
Waxing great on the kindled fire,  
Grasped with hymns as wings, to be adored;  
They sacrificed embracing the heated cauldron.
#### g
When with strength the gods laboured at the sacrifice  
For the divine supporter, the enjoyer,  
Serving the gods, benign, with a hundred drinks (was it);  
The gods kept embracing the sacrifice [2].
#### h
With the rays of the sun, with tawny hair,  
Savitr hath raised before (us) his unending light;  
On his instigation fareth Pusan the god,  
The guardian, gazing on all things.
#### i
The gods stand serving as priests for the gods;  
Ready (is it) for the immolator, let the immolator sacrifice;  
Where the fourth offering goeth to the oblation,  
Thence let our pure invocations be accepted.
#### k
As measurer he standeth in the midst of the sky,  
Filling the two worlds and the atmosphere;  
The all-reaching [3], the butter-reaching, he discerneth,  
Between the eastern and the western mark.
#### l
Bull, ocean, ruddy bird,  
He hath entered the birthplace of his ancient sire;  
In the middle of the sky is the dappled stone set down  
He hath stepped apart, he guardeth the two ends of space.
#### m
All songs have caused Indra to wax  
To encompass the ocean,  
Best charioteer of charioteers,  
True lord and lord of strength.
#### n
Let the sacrifice invite favour, and bring (to us) the gods; let the god, Agni, offer and bring (to us)
  
the gods.
#### o
With the impulse of strength,  
With elevation he hath seized me;  
Then Indra hath made my enemies  
Humble by depression.
#### p
The gods have increased my prayer,  
Which is elevation and depression;  
Then do ye, O Indra and Agni,  
Scatter my foes on every side.
### 04
#### a
Swift, like a bull sharpening his horns, the warrior  
Fond of slaughter, disturber of the people,  
Bellowing, unwinking, sole hero,  
Indra at once conquered a hundred hosts.
#### b
With the bellowing, unwinking, conquering,  
Fighter, hard to overthrow, and daring Indra,  
With Indra do ye conquer, do ye withstand  
The foe, O heroes, with the strong one who holdeth the arrow in his hands.
#### c
He is mighty with those who have arrows in their hands and quivers, Indra who joineth hosts with his band,  
Conquering in combat, drinker of Soma, with many a band,  
With bow uplifted, and shooter with well-drawn arrows.
#### d
O Brhaspati, fly round with thy chariot [1],  
Slaying the foe, driving away the enemy;  
Defeating hosts, destroyer, victor in battle,  
Be thou protector of our chariots.
#### e
The cleaver of the cowstalls, finder of the cows, with the thunderbolt on his arm, Victorious, crushing in might a host,  
Be heroes, O my fellows, like him;  
O comrades, follow in Indra's footsteps.
#### f
Conspicuous by might, strong, heroic,  
Enduring, mighty, steadfast, dread,  
Surpassing heroes and warriors born of strength,  
Do thou, winning kine, mount, O Indra, thy victorious car.
#### g
In might penetrating the cowstalls,  
Impetuous [2], the hero, Indra, with wrath a hundredfold,  
Hard to resist, enduring in battle, unovercomable,  
May he aid our armies in the battles.
#### h
Indra (be) their leader, and let Brhaspati,  
The sacrificial fee, the sacrifice and Soma go before;  
Let the Maruts precede the hosts divine,  
That overthrow and conquer.
#### i
Of Indra, the strong, of Varuna, the king,  
Of the Adityas, of the Maruts the mighty host--  
The voice hath ascended of the gods  
Great-hearted that shake the worlds as they conquer.
#### k
Ours (be) Indra, when the standards meet;  
Ours be the arrows that conquer [3];  
Ours be the heroes who are victors,  
And us do ye aid, O gods, at our invocations.
#### l
Exalt our weapons, O bounteous one,  
Exalt the might of my warriors;  
Exalt the strength of the steed, O slayer of Vrtra,

Let the sound of the conquering chariots arise.
#### m
Go ye forward, O heroes; conquer;  
Be your arms strong;  
May Indra accord you protection  
That ye may be unassailable.
#### n
Let loose, fly forward,  
O arrow, expelled with holy power;  
Go to our foes, and enter [4] them;  
Not one of them do thou spare.
#### o
Thy vital parts I clothe with armour;  
May Soma, the king, cover thee with immortality,  
Space broader than broad be thine;  
May the gods take delight in thy victory.
#### p
When the arrows fly together  
Like boys unshorn,  
Then may Indra, slayer of foes,  
Accord us protection for ever.
### 05
#### a
Along the eastern quarter do thou advance, wise one;  
Be thou, O Agni, of Agni the harbinger here;  
Illumine with thy radiance all the regions;  
Confer strength on our bipeds and quadrupeds.
#### b
Mount ye, with Agni, to the vault,  
Bearing him of the pan in your hands;  
Having gone to the ridge of the sky, to the heaven,  
Do ye eat, mingled with the gods.
#### c
From earth have I mounted to the atmosphere;  
From the atmosphere have I mounted to the sky;  
From the ridge of the vault of the sky  
Have I attained the heaven, the light [1].
#### d
Going to the heaven, they look not away;  
They mount the sky, the two worlds,  
They who extended, wisely,  
The sacrifice, streaming on every side.
#### e
O Agni, advance, first of worshippers,  
Eye of gods and mortals;  
Pressing on in unison with the Bhrgus,  
Let the sacrificers go to heaven, to prosperity.
#### f
Night and the dawn, one-minded, but of various form,  
United suckle one child;  
The radiant one shineth between sky and earth;  
The gods, granters of wealth, support Agni.
#### g
O Agni, of a thousand eyes [2], of a hundred heads,  
A hundred are thy expirations, a thousand thine inspirations;  
Thou art lord of wealth a thousandfold;  
To thee as such let us pay homage for strength, hail!
#### h
Thou art the winged bird, sit on the earth; sit on the ridge of earth; with thy blaze fill the atmosphere, with thy light establish the sky, with thy brilliance make firm the quarters.
#### i
Receiving offering, fair of face, O Agni;  
Sit down in front in thine own birthplace, in due order;  
In this higher place,  
O All-gods [3], do ye sit with the sacrificer.
#### k
Enkindled, O Agni, shine before us,
  
O most youthful, with unfailing beam;  
Ever upon thee strength awaiteth.  
I Let us pay homage to thee in thy highest birth, O Agni;  
Let us pay homage with praises in thy lower abode;  
The place of birth whence thou didst come, to that I offer;  
In thee when kindled they offered the oblations.
#### m
That various lovingkindness given to all men,  
Of Savitr the adorable, I choose,  
That mighty fat cow of his which Kanva milked,  
Streaming with a thousand (draughts) of milk [4].
#### n
Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues,  
Seven seers, seven dear abodes;  
Seven Hotras sevenfold sacrifice to thee  
Seven birthplaces with ghee do thou fill.
#### o
Such like, other like, thus like, similar, measured, commensurate, harmonious;
#### p
Of pure radiance, of varied radiance, of true radiance, the radiant, true, protector of holy order, beyond distress [5];
#### q
Winning holy order, winning truth, host-conquering, having a good host, with foes within, with foes afar, the troop;
#### r
Holy order, true, secure, supporting, supporter, upholder, upholding;
#### s
Such like, thus like, do ye come to us, similar and equal.
#### t
Measured and commensurate, to aid us, harmonious, at this sacrifice, O Maruts.
#### u
On Indra attend the divine folk, the Maruts; even as the divine folk, the Maruts, attend on Indra, so may the folk divine and human, attend on this sacrificer.  
The Horse Sacrifice
### 06
#### a
As of a thunder-cloud is the face of the warrior  
As he advanceth to the lap of the battles;  
Be victorious with unpierced body;  
Let the might of thine armour protect thee.
#### b
By the bow cows, by the bow the contest may we win,  
By the bow dread battles may we win;  
The bow doth work displeasure to the foe;  
By the bow let us win in all the quarters.
#### c
As if about to speak it approacheth the ear,  
Embracing its dear comrade,  
Like a woman this bowstring twangeth stretched over the bow [1],  
Saving in the battle.
#### d
They coming together as a maiden to the assembly,  
As a mother her child, shall bear (the arrow) in their lap;  
In unison shall they pierce the foes,  
These two ends springing asunder, the enemies.
#### e
Father of many (daughters), many his sons,  
He whizzeth as he goeth to battle,  
The quiver, slung on the back, yielding its content,  
Doth conquer every band and army.
#### f
Standing on the chariot be guideth his steeds before him  
Wheresoever he desireth, good charioteer;  
The might of the reins [2] do ye admire;  
The reins behind obey the mind (of the driver).
#### g
Shrilly the strong-hooved horses neigh,  
As with the cars they show their strength;
  
Trampling with their forefeet the enemy  
They unflinchingly destroy the foe.
#### h
The chariot-bearer is his oblation by name,  
Where is deposited his armour and his weapon;  
Then may we sit on the strong car,  
All the days, with friendly hearts.
#### i
The fathers with pleasant seats, granting strength, A support in trouble mighty and profound,  
With varied hosts, with arrows to strengthen them, free, With real heroes, broad conquerors of hosts.
#### k
The Brahmans [3], the fathers worthy of the Soma, And sky and earth, unequalled be propitious to us; May Pusan guard us from misfortune, us that prosper holy order Do thou guard; may no foe overpower us.  
I A feather her garment, a deer her tooth,  
Tied with cowhide she flieth shot forth;  
Where men run together and apart,  
There may the arrows accord us protection.
#### m
O thou of straight path, avoid us;  
Be our body as of stone  
May Soma favour us,  
And Aditi [4] grant protection!
#### n
Their backs it smites,  
Their thighs it belabours;  
O horse-whip, do ye stimulate  
The skilled horses in the battles.
#### o
Like a snake with its coils it encircleth his arm, Fending off the friction of the bowstring,  
Let the hand-guard, knowing all cunning,  
Manfully guard the man on all sides.
#### p
O lord of the forest, be strong of limb,  
Our comrade, efficacious, of great strength;  
Thou art tied with cowhide, be thou strong;  
Let him that mounteth thee conquer what is to be conquered.
#### q
From sky, from earth [5] is might collected,  
From trees is strength gathered;  
The might of the waters surrounded with the kine, Indra's thunderbolt, the chariot, do thou adore with oblation.
#### r
The thunderbolt of Indra, the face of the Maruts, The embryo of Mitra, the navel of Varuna,  
Do thou, accepting this our sacrifice,  
O chariot divine, take to thyself the oblations.
#### s
Roar to earth and sky;  
Let the scattered world be ware of thee in many places; Do thou, O drum, in unison with Indra and the gods [6], Drive away the foe further than far.
#### t
Roar thou! Grant us force and might.  
Thunder, overthrowing obstacles;  
Snort away, O drum, misfortune hence;  
Indra's fist art thou; show thy strength.
#### u
Drive to us those, and these make to come to us; The drum speaketh aloud for a signal (of battle)  
Our heroes winged with steeds meet together;  
Be our chariotmen victorious, O Indra.

### 07
#### a
When first thou didst cry on birth,  
Arising from the ocean or the dust,  
The wings of the eagle, the limbs of the gazelle, That is thy famed birth, O steed.
#### b
The steed given by Yama hath Trita yoked, It Indra first mounted,  
The bridle of it the Gandharva grasped;  
O Vasus, from the sun ye fashioned the steed.
#### c
Thou art Yama, O steed, thou art Aditya; Thou art Trita by secret ordinance;  
Thou art entirely separated from Soma [1]; Three, they say, are thy bonds in the sky.
#### d
Three, they say, are thy bonds in the sky, Three in the waters, three within the ocean And like Varuna to me thou appearest, O steed, Where, say they, is thy highest birthplace.
#### e
These, O swift one, are thy cleansings,  
These the placings down of thy hooves in victory; Here I have seen thy fair ropes,  
Which the guards of holy order guard.
#### f
The self of thee with my mind I perceived from afar, Flying with wings from below through the sky [2]; Thy head I saw speeding with wings  
On paths fair and dustless.
#### g
Here I saw thy highest form,  
Eager to win food in the footstep of the cow; When a mortal man pleaseth thy taste,  
Then most greedily dost thou consume the plants.
#### h
Thee follows the chariot, thee the lover, O steed, Thee the kine, thee the portion of maidens; Thy friendship the companies have sought; The gods have imitated thy strength [3].
#### i
Golden his horns, iron his feet;  
Swift as thought, Indra was his inferior;  
The gods came to eat his oblation  
Who first did master the steed.
#### k
Full haunched, of slender middle,  
The heroic divine steeds,  
Vie together like cranes in rows,  
When the horses reach the divine coursing-place 1 Thy body is fain to fly, O steed;  
Thy thought is like the blowing wind;  
Thy horns are scattered in many places,  
They wander busy in the woods.
#### m
To [4] the slaughter the swift steed hath come, Pondering with pious mind;  
The goat, his kin, is led before,  
Behind him come the sages to sing.
#### n
To his highest abode hath the steed come, To his father and his mother;  
To-day do thou go, most welcome, to the gods; Then boons shall he assign to the generous.

### 08
#### a
Let not Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Ayu,  
Indra, Rbhuksan, the Maruts disregard us,  
When we shall proclaim before the assembly  
The might of the strong god-born steed.
#### b
When they bear before him, covered with a garment and with wealth The gift they have seized,  
The goat, all-formed, bleating,  
Goeth straight to the dear stronghold of Indra and Pusan.
#### c
This goat is led before the strong steed  
As share of Pusan, connected with the All-gods,  
When Tvastr impels him as an acceptable sacrifice  
Together with the steed for fair renown [1].
#### d
When men thrice lead round in due season  
The steed going to the gods as an acceptable offering Then first goeth Pusan's share,  
The goat announcing the sacrifice to the gods.
#### e
Hotr Adhvaryu, atoner, fire kindler,  
Holder of the stone, and skilled reciter,  
With this well-prepared sacrifice  
Well offered do ye fill the channels.
#### f
The cutters of the stake, the bearers of the stake,  
And they that fashion the top piece for the stake for the horse, And they that collect the cooking-pot for the steed [2], May their approval quicken us.
#### g
He hath come forth--efficacious hath been my prayer-- To the regions of the gods, straight backed;  
In him the sages, the seers, rejoice,  
For the prosperity of the gods a good friend have we made.
#### h
The bond of the strong one, the tie of the steed,  
The head stall, the rope of him,  
And the grass placed in his mouth,  
May all these of thine be with the gods.
#### i
Whatever of the horse's raw flesh [3] the fly eateth,  
Whatever on the chip or the axe hath stuck,  
Whatever is on the hands, the nails of the slayer,  
May all these of thine be with the gods.
#### k
The refuse that bloweth forth from the belly,  
The smell of raw flesh,  
Let the slayers see that in order  
Let them cook the fat to a turn.  
I Whatever flieth away from thy limb  
As it is cooked by the fire when thou art spitted,  
Let it fall not on earth, nor on the grass;  
Be that given to the eager gods.
### 09
#### a
Those who watch for the cooking of the strong one, And call out, 'It is fragrant; take it out,'  
And who wait to beg for the meat of the steed,  
May their approval quicken us.
#### b
The trial spoon of the meat-cooking pot,  
The vessels to hold the juice,
  
The coverings of the dishes for warming,  
The hooks, the crates, attend the steed.
#### c
The starting-place, the sitting down, the turning,  
The hobbles of the steed,  
What it hath drunk, what it hath eaten as fodder [1],  
May all these of thine be with the gods.
#### d
May Agni, smoke smelling, not make thee crackle;  
May not the radiant pot be broken, smelling;  
Offered, delighted in, approved, offered with the Vasat cry,  
The gods accept the horse.
#### e
The garment they spread for the horse,  
The upper garment, the golden (trappings),  
The bond of the steed, the hobble,  
As dear to the gods they offer.
#### f
If one hath smitten thee, riding thee driven with force,  
With heel or with whip [2],  
As with the ladle the parts of the oblation in the sacrifice,  
So with holy power all these of thine I put in order.
#### g
The four and thirty ribs of the strong steed,  
Kin of the gods, the axe meeteth;  
Skilfully do ye make the joints faultless;  
Declaring each part, do ye cut it asunder.
#### h
One carver is there of the steed of Tvastr  
Two restrainers are there, so is the use;  
Those parts of thy limbs that I place in order,  
Those in balls I offer in the fire.
#### i
Let not thy dear self distress thee [3] as thou comest;  
Let not the axe stay in thy body;  
May no greedy skilless carver,  
Missing the joints, mangle thy limbs with the knife.
#### k
Thou dost not die, indeed, thou art not injured,  
On easy paths thou goest to the gods;  
The bays, the dappled ones, have become thy yoke-fellows;  
The steed bath stood under the yoke of the ass.  
I Wealth of kine for us, may the strong one (grant), wealth in horses,  
Men and sons, and every form of prosperity;  
May Aditi confer on us sinlessness;  
Kingship for us may the horse rich in offering gain.

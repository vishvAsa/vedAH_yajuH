## 01
The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless, with the desire, 'May horns be born to us.' For ten months they performed it, and then horns were born, and they ceased (the rite), (saying), 'We have obtained (our desire).' Then those whose horns were not born ceased (the rite) after making up the year, (saying), 'We have obtained (our desire).' Both those which obtained horns and those which  
did not ceased, (saying),'We have obtained (our desire).' The year is the cows' Sattra [1], and those
  
who knowing thus perform the year (sacrifice) are prosperous. Therefore a hornless cow has pleasure during the two months of the rainy season, for that is won for it by the Sattra. Therefore whatever is done in the house of one who performs for a year (a Sattra), that is done completely, successfully, and adequately. Those who perform the year (Sattra) are swimming on the ocean. He who does not see the further bank of the ocean cannot get out from it. The ocean is the year [2]. Its further banks are the two Atiratras. Those who knowing thus perform the year (Sattra) reach the end without injury. The former Atiratra is this (earth), the latter is yonder (sky); the former is mind, the latter speech; the former expiration, the latter inspiration; the former the commencement, the latter the end. The Atiratra is a Jyotistoma, of Vaiśvanara; verily they put light before them, to reveal the world of heaven. There is a fore offering, accompanied by the Caturvinśa Stoma. The year has twenty-four half-months [3]; verily as they go on they find support in the year. There are three hundred and sixty Stotriyas; so many are the nights of the year; verily they attain both forms of the year.  
They perform (the rites of) the next days for rest, for safety. There are six-day periods. The year has six seasons; verily they find support in the seasons, the year. The Go and the Ayus (Stomas) are the Stomas in the middle; verily they place a pair in the middle of the year [4] for procreation. On either  
side there is the Jyotistoma. It is the releasing; verily the metres are released; verily also they go to the world of heaven with the six-day (rite) which has a Jyotistoma on either side. The theologians say, 'They sit; by what path do they go?' One should reply,' By the path that leads to the gods. The  
path that leads to the gods is the metres, the Gayatri, Tristubh, and Jagati. The Gayatri is the Jyotistoma, the Tristubh, the Gostoma, the Jagati the Ayustoma. In that there are these Stomas, so do they go by the path that leads to the gods [5]. There is used the same Saman. The Saman is the world of the gods; verily they leave not the world of the gods. There are used various verses. The verses are the world of man; verily they keep mounting one world of gods after another from the world of men. There is the Brahman's Saman as the Abhivarta to win the world of heaven. There is the Abhijit (day) for the gaining of the world of heaven. There is the Viśvajit (day) for the gaining of all. Month by month they perform the Prsthas, month by month the Atigrahyas are drawn; verily in each month they place strength, for the support of the months. They perform the Prsthas in the latter part of the month. Therefore it is on the top that the plants bear fruit.
## 02
The cows performed that Sattra, being hornless and desiring to obtain horns. For ten months they performed it, and then horns appeared. They said, 'We have gained (them), let us cease (the rite), for we have attained the desire for the sake of which we began (the rite).' But others said, either half of them or as many as might be the case, 'Let us perform (the rite) for these months, the eleventh and the twelfth, and when we have made up the year, let us cease' [1]. In their case their horns grew in the twelfth month. Whether by faith, or by lack of faith-that is, those which have no horns-both indeed were prosperous, those which gained horns and those which won strength. He who ceases after ten months is prosperous, and he who ceases after twelve also, if he knows thus. They go by their feet, and he who goes by his foot attains (what he seeks). The Ayana is successful, and therefore is it productive of cows.
## 03
They perform the Prahas in the first month, they perform them in the middle month, they perform them in the last month. They say, 'In the case of a cow which they milk thrice a day, she yields sparingly at the latter two milkings; how then can she be milked who is twelve times milked?' Having made up the year, they should perform the Prsthas once in the last month; verily the sacrificers win the sacrifice and cattle. It is an ocean [1] without a near or a further shore that they enter upon who perform the year (rite). If they employ the Brhat and the Rathantara Samans, it would be as if they were to provide a boat in the middle of the ocean. Going continuously with the Brhat and the Rathantara they obtain support. The union is milked for all desires; thus the sacrificers obtain all desires.

## 04
The Rcs are the same. The Rcs are the world of men; verily they leave not the world of man. There are different Samans; the Saman is the world of the gods; verily they descend from the world of the gods to one world after another of men. They first use the Jagati, and the metres descend from the Jagati, the cups from the Agrayana, the Prsthas from the Brhat, the Stomas from the Trayastrinśa. Therefore the younger descends before an elder. The Viśvakarman cup is drawn; verily by it the sacrificers win all rites. The cup for Aditi [1] is drawn. Aditi is this (earth); verily they rest on this (earth). The one and the other are drawn, for pairing, for propagation. Of old Prajapati created offspring by means of the ten-night (rite); in that the ten-night rite is performed, the sacrificers create offspring. Udanka Çaulbayana has declared the ten-night rite to be the prosperity of the Sattra, and the ten-night rite serves for the prosperity of the Sattra. Verily also whatever is done wrongly in the earlier days, this serves to atone for it.
## 05
If two libations are offered simultaneously, then one should perform the early litany in the advanced part of the night. He who does it first wins the speech, the gods, and the metres (of the others). The strophe should contain the word 'strong (vrsan)'; verily he takes Indra away from their morning pressing. Or rather they say, 'The strophe at the beginning of each pressing should be of this kind'; verily he takes Indra away from each of their pressings.  
For entry, for rest, for the overcoming, of the Gayatri, of the Tristubh, of the Jagati, of the Anustubh, of the Pankti, hail!  
Entry and rest are the metres; verily by the metres [1], he takes away their metres. One should recite the Sajaniya hymn; one should recite the Vihavya hymn; one should recite the Kayaśubhiya hymn of Agastya. This indeed is so much as that, verily he takes away so much as is theirs. If at the early pressing the bowl is broken, they should sing verses addressed to Visnu and containing the epithet Çipivista. Whatever in the sacrifice is redundant, is redundant with regard to Visnu Çipivista; verily Visnu Çipivista places the redundant in the redundant. Verily having obtained the redundant by the redundant, they win it. If it is broken at the midday pressing, they should make the Saman have the Vasatkara as its finale. The support of the sacrifice is the Vasatkara; verily they make the Saman obtain support. If it breaks at the third pressing, the same thing (should be done).
## 06
Having made up the month with the six-day periods they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the six-day periods. Having made up the months with the half-months, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the half-months. Having made up the months by the new moon night, they leave out a day, for they behold the months by the new moon night. Having made up the months by the full moon night, they leave out a day, for they behold the month by the full moon night. He who pours (liquid) into a full (vessel) wastes the liquid; he who pours out from a full (vessel) [1] places breath in it. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place breath in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe along it. If they did not leave out a day, then the year would fall asunder, as falls asunder a skin bag tied tight, and they would be ruined. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, they place out-breathing in the year, and the performers of the Sattra breathe out along it [2], and are not ruined. At the full moon (the Soma) of the gods is pressed. In that, having made up the months with the full moon night, they leave out a day, with the sacrifice to the gods they go to another sacrifice. They cleave asunder the sacrifice, in that (after performing it) as a series of six day rites they leave out a day. They offer an animal for Prajapati. Prajapati is all the gods; verily with the gods do they offer the sacrifice. They leave the pressing [3], who leave out the day. The Samnayya is the fourth pressing. Because there is the Samnayya, they do not leave the pressing. They partake of it after uttering the invocation, for they have this then as their Soma drink. The deities who share in the pressings of those who leave out the day go to their places; they offer the sacrificial cakes in each of the pressings; verily they win the deities who share in the pressing from
  
their several places. (They offer the cakes) on eight potsherds at the early pressing, on eleven potsherds at the midday pressing, and on twelve potsherds at the third pressing; verily they obtain and win the metres. They offer an oblation to the All-gods at the third pressing. The third pressing belongs to the All-gods; verily they leave not the third pressing.
## 07
The theologians consider, 'Should (a day) be left out, or should it not be left out?' They say, 'It should be left out.' They say, 'It should be left out at the new moon and at the full moon, for these two guide the sacrifice.' 'These two must not be left out,' they say, 'for these two determine the dependent sacrifice.' '(The day) should be left out on the first Vyastaka,' they say, 'for this is what rends the month.' They should not leave out a day which is appointed [1]. If they should leave out one which is appointed, they should leave it out on the seventh day after making up the months with six-day periods, whatever be the recur rent position which it occupies in the course of the six-day period. They should then offer to Agni, with the Vasus, a cake on eight potsherds, to Indra curds, to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven potsherds, to the All-gods a cake on twelve potsherds. The early pressing belongs to Agni with the Vasus; in that they offer to Agni with the Vasus a cake on eight potsherds, they make the god share in it [2], and they approach the pressing with eight. In that the curds belong to Indra, they do not shut out Indra from a share. The midday pressing belongs to Indra with the Maruts. In that they offer to Indra with the Maruts a cake on eleven potsherds, they make the god share in it, and they approach the pressing with eleven [3]. The third pressing belongs to the All-gods with the Rbhus. In that they offer to the All-gods a cake on twelve pot sherds, they make the gods share in it, and they approach the pressing with twelve. They offer a beast to Prajapati-Prajapati is the sacrifice that the sacrifice may not be abandoned. For six months (as they go) hence the Brahman's Saman should be the 'victorious'. The 'victorious' is the holy power (Brahman); verily they go winning the world of heaven by the holy power (Brahman); for the world of heaven is as it were opposite from hence. When they come thence the Brahman's Saman for six months should be 'O Indra, bear us strength, as a father to his sons. Guide us, O thou that art much invoked, on our path. Living, may we attain the light.' The light is this world, the light is offspring; verily they come, gazing on this world by repeating the verse.
## 08
When the gods had come to the end, their power and strength departed. They won them again by the Krośa (Saman), and that is why the Krośa has the name. In that they sing the Krośa at the end of the pit, they win power and strength at the end of the sacrifice. They sing the Sattra syarddhi (Saman) at the end of the Ahavaniya; verily, making Agni a witness, they advance to prosperity. They sing the  
Prajapater Hrdaya within the shed; verily they win his favour. They sing the Çloka (Saman) in front of the Sadas [1], the Anuśloka (Saman) behind; verily fame is their portion at the end of the sacrifice. The Adhvaryu sings nine (verses). Nine are the breaths in man; verily he places breaths in the sacrificers. All of them are addressed to Indra; verily he places power (indriya) in the breaths. He sings without the Pratihara. Therefore a man can contract all the other members (of the body) except the head, but the bead not. The Rathantara (Saman) has the Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily they win power. The Brhat has the Saptadaśa [2], for the winning of food; verily also they are propagated by it. The Bhadra (Saman) has the Ekavinśa (Stoma) with Dvipada verses, for support. The wives (of the sacrificers) sing, for offspring, for propagation. Prajapati created offspring; he desired, 'May I gain the kingship over them.' He obtained the kingship over them by the Rajana (Saman), and that is why the Rajana has the name. In that there is the Rajana, the sacrificers obtain the kingship over offspring. It has the Pañcavinśa (Stoma), to win Prajapati [3]. They sing five (verses) standing; verily they win the world of the gods; five sitting; verily they win the world of men. These come to ten; the Viraj is of ten syllables, the Viraj is food; verily they win food by the Viraj. In five places they sing sitting down; there are five quarters; verily they rest on the quarters. They come up each before one verse has been sung; verily they bear food from the quarters. The Udgatr sings these (verses); verily having borne food from the quarters [4] they place glory in themselves. Therefore one breath protects all the limbs. Therefore, just as a bird about to fly
  
upwards raises its head aloft, so the sacrificers are highest among people. The Udgatr mounts a throne; verily they attain rule. The Hotr (mounts) a swing; verily they mount the back of the firmament. The Adhvaryu (mounts) two mats; verily they reach the surface of the ruddy one. So many indeed are the worlds, and in them in order they find support. Then the sacrificers make thus a bridge to mount, for the gaining of the world of heaven.
## 09
By means of the Arkya (Saman) Prajapati created offspring in thousands. From them by means of the Ilamda (Saman) he took away the food they had gathered. In that there is the Arkya, the sacrificers create offspring; in that there is the Ilamda, they take away from the offspring which has been created the food they have gathered. Therefore, in whatever year the Sattra is performed, the offspring are hungry in that year, for they take their food and strength; in whatever year the Sattra is imperfect, the offspring are not hungry in that year [1]; for they take not their food and strength. They raise a loud noise. As men being freed from bonds cry aloud, so the sacrificers freed from the bonds of the gods cry aloud, placing food and strength in themselves. The lute has a hundred strings. Man is of a hundred (years) of age, and of a hundredfold strength; verily they find support in age and strength. They run a race, to win what has not yet been won. They beat drums; the voice of the drum is the highest (form of) speech; verily they win the highest (form of) speech. They beat the earth-drum; verily they win that speech which has entered this (earth); verily also they conquer the earth. All (forms of) speech they utter, to gain all (forms of speech). Two strive on a dry hide, to gain strength. One reviles, another extols. He who reviles purifies them, he who extols places food in them after they are purified. They win by the first months what is done by the Rsis and by the gods; in that the Bhutechad Samans are used, both are gained. Those who perform the year rite lose their virility. There are a pair united within the sacrificial ground; verily they lose not virility.
## 10
They pierce the hide; verily they remove the sin of the (sacrificers). 'Do not miss, do not pierce through', he says; verily they now remove their sin. Slave girls dance round the Marjaliya fire with water-pots on their heads, beating the ground with their feet, and singing 'This is honey.' Honey indeed is the chiefest food of the gods; verily they win the chiefest food. They beat the ground with their feet; verily they endow the (sacrificers) with might.

To Agni, of the Gayatri (metre), the Trivrt (Stoma), the Rathantara (Saman), the spring (season), (offering is made) on eight potsherds. To Indra, of the Tristubh (metre), the Pañcadaśa, (Stoma), the Brhat (Saman), the summer (season), (offering is made) on eleven potsherds. To the All-gods of the Jagati (metre), the Saptadaśa (Stoma), the Vairupa (Saman), the rainy (season), (offering is made) on twelve potsherds. To Mitra and Varuna, of the Anustubh (metre), the Ekavinśa (Stoma), the Vairaja (Saman), the autumn (season), curds. To Brhaspati, of the Pankti (metre), the Trinava (Stoma), the Çakvara (Saman), the winter (season), an oblation (is made). To Savitr, of the Atichandas (metre), the Trayastrinśa (Stoma), the Raivata (Saman), the cool (season), (offering is made) on twelve potsherds. To Aditi, as Visnu's consort, an oblation (is made). To Agni Vaiśvanara (offering is made) on twelve potsherds. To Anumati an oblation (is made). To Ka (offering is made) on one potsherd.
## 15

Now for the fire which is produced on the fire-altar and for Soma, the king, the beast for Agni and Soma is the guest-offering. Again the fire which is piled up is cruel, and if one were not to cast upon the fire which has been piled up these oblations, the cruel fire would spring up in wrath, and injure the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer. In that he casts the oblations on the fire which has been piled up, he appeases it with its own portion, and the cruel fire [1] does not spring up in wrath and injure his offspring and cattle. There are ten oblations. Nine are the breaths in man, and the navel is the tenth; verily he places breaths in the sacrificer. Again the Viraj is of ten syllables; the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj as food. 'It must be piled with the seasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the Prsthas', they say. In that he casts these oblations, he piles it with the seasons, the metres, the Stomas, and the Prsthas. 'The quarters can be won by one who has pressed the Soma' they say [2]. In that he casts these oblations, (it is) for the winning of the quarters. The gods made Indra sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Indra's pressing; men made Manu sacrifice with it, and therefore is it Manu's pressing. As Indra among the gods, as Manu among men, becomes he who knowing thus sacrifices with this sacrifice. The Puronuvakyas contain the word 'quarter', for the conquest of the quarters.

He who knows the head of the sacrificial horse becomes possessed of a head and fit for sacrifice. The head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn, the eye the sun, the breath the wind, the ear the moon, the feet the quarters, the ribs the intermediate quarters, the winking the day and night, the joints the half-months, the joinings the months, the limbs the seasons, the trunk the year, the hair the rays (of the gun), the form the Naksatras, the bones the stars, the flesh the mist, the hair the plants, the tail hairs the trees, the mouth Agni, the open (mouth) Vaiśvanara [1], the belly the sea, the anus the atmosphere, the testicles the sky and the earth, the membrum virile, the pressing-stone, the seed the Soma. When it chews, there is lightning; when it moves about, there is thundering; when it makes water, there is rain; its speech is speech. The Mahiman (cup) indeed is born before the birth of the horse as the day. The Mahiman (cup) is born after it as the night. These two Mahiman (cups) surround on either side the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Arvan (courser) the Asuras, as Vajin (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aśva (horse) men. The birthplace of the horse, indeed, is the sea, its kindred is the sea.

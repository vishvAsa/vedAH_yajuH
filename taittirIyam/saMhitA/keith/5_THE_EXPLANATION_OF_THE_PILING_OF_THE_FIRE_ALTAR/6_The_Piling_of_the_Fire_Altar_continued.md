### a
Golden of colour, pure, purifying,  
In which was born Kaśyapa, in which Indra,  
They have conceived Agni as a germ, of varied forms; May these waters be gentle and kindly to us.
### b
Those in whose midst Varuna doth go,  
Gazing on the truth and falsehood of men,  
Dripping honey, pure, purifying;  
May these waters be gentle and kindly to us.
### c
Those of which in the sky the gods make their food, Those that are in many places in the sky,  
Those that inundate the earth with their sap [1], the pure ones May these waters be gentle and kindly to us.
### d
With auspicious eye gaze on me, O waters;  
With auspicious body, do ye touch my skin;  
I invoke all you Agnis that sit in the waters;  
Do ye confer upon me radiance and might and force.
### e
When as ye went below  
Ye cried (ánadata) on the slaying of the serpent,  
Therefore are yo criers (nadyáh) by name;  
These are your names, O streams.  
When instigated by Varuna  
Ye wallowed speedily [2],  
Then Indra obtained (apnot) you as ye went  
Therefore ye are waters (ápah).
### g
As ye glided against his will,  
He stayed (ávivarata) your courses,  
Indra with his might, O goddesses;  
Therefore your name is water (váh).
### h
One god stepped upon them,  
As they glided, according to his will,  
(Saying) 'The great ones have breathed forth (úd)  
Therefore they are called water.
### i
The waters are kindly, the waters were ghee;  
These waters bear Agni and Soma;  
The bitter sap of those dispensing sweetness [3], the satisfying, Hath come to me with breath, with radiance.
### k
I behold, or I hear;  
The cry cometh to me, the voice of them to us;  
I consider that I have enjoyed the ambrosia then,  
When I delighted you, O ye of golden hue.
### l
Ye, waters, are healing;  
Further us to strength,  
To see great joy.
### m
The most auspicious flavour that is yours,  
Accord to us here,  
Like eager mothers.
### n
To him may we come with satisfaction,  
To whose dwelling ye quicken us,  
O waters, and propagate us.  
O Arise to the sky, aim at the atmosphere, be united with the earth; thou art splendour; for splendour thee!

He puts down the bricks of being; in every place is death born; wherever death is born, thence he removes it by sacrifice; therefore the piler of the fire lives all his life, for all deaths are removed by him; therefore the piler of the fire is not to be practised against; his witchcraft turns upon him (who does so) and lays him low. He who piles the fire is consecrated; these are the offerings of the divine consecrators; so many are the consecrations of the gods, and they [1] confer consecrations upon him; they consecrate him, the fire is consecration; the royal consecration is the consecration of Varuna; (the fire) to be piled is the consecration of holy power. 'On the instigation of the god Savitr, thee', he says; verily instigated by Savitr he consecrates him with holy power, with the deities. He pours down every sort of food, to win every sort of food. He pours down over him from the front face to face; for from the front face to face is food eaten. He pours down from the head, for from the head is food eaten; he causes (the water) to flow over up to the mouth [2]; verily on the mouth he bestows food-eating upon him. 'With the lordship of Agni I consecrate thee', he says; this is the consecration of Agni; verily he consecrates him with it. 'With the lordship of Brhaspati I consecrate thee', he says; Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods; verily with holy power he consecrates him. 'With the lordship of Indra I consecrate thee', he says; verily he confers power from above upon him. That [3] is the form of the royal consecration. He who knowing thus piles the fire conquers both the worlds, that of him who has offered the royal consecration and that of the piler of the fire. When Indra had been consecrated, his power and strength fell away in ten places; the gods brought it together with the Sautramani; he who piles the fire is consecrated; having piled the fire he should sacrifice with the Sautramani; verily collecting power and strength he places them in himself.

The year in unison with the Ayavans the dawn in unison with the  
ruddy (cows); Surya in unison with the steed; the Aśvins in unison
  
with the wondrous works. Agni Vaiśvanara in unison with the food  
offerings; with ghee; hail!  
The year is the year, the Ayavas are the months, the red one the dawn, the steed Surya, the Aśvins these two (worlds), Agni Vaiśvanara the year, the food offerings cattle, ghee cattle. With the year cattle are born; verily with the year he produces cattle for him. He offers on a blade of Darbha grass [1]; the Darbhas are the ambrosia, the strength of the (earth); he offers on it; verily he is propagated. An eater of food he becomes for whom they offer thus. These deities are the foremost portions of Agni; verily he delights them; verily too he places the eye of Agni in front; he becomes not blind who knows thus. Waters were the world at first, the Moving ocean; Prajapati, becoming wind, rocked about on a lotus leaf; he [2] could find no support; he saw that nest of the waters, on it he piled the fire, that became this (earth), then indeed did he find support. (The brick) which he put down in front became the head, that is the eastern quarter; (the brick) which he put down on the right became the right side, that is the southern quarter; (the brick) which he put down behind became the tail, that is the western quarter; (the brick) which he put down on the left [3] became the left side, that is the northern quarter; (the brick) which he put down above became the back, that is the zenith. Agni of the five bricks is this (earth); therefore when they dig in it they knock up against the brick, against gravel. Now all this (earth) in the eyes of the birds shines at night, therefore birds do not at night rest upon it. He who knowing this piles a fire finds support, and conquers all the quarters. The Brahman is connected with Agni, therefore the Brahman finds prosperity in all the quarters; verily every quarter he goes to is his own. The fire is the nest of the waters; therefore waters draw the fire; verily they enter their own birthplace.

Having kept the fire in the pan for a year in the second year he should offer on eight potsherds to Agni, to Indra on eleven potsherds, to the All-gods on twelve potsherds, to Brhaspati an oblation, to Visnu on three potsherds; in the third year he should sacrifice with the Abhijit (offering). In that there is (an offering) on eight potsherds, the Gayatri has eight syllables, and the morning pressing is connected with Agni and the Gayatri, verily he supports by it the morning pressing and the Gayatri metre. In that there is (an offering) on eleven potsherds, the Tristubh has eleven syllables, and the midday pressing is connected with Indra and the Tristubh, verily he supports by it the midday pressing and the Tristubh [1] metre. In that there is (an offering) on twelve potsherds, the Jagati has twelve syllables, and the third pressing is connected with the All-gods and the Jagati, verily he supports by it the third pressing and the Jagati metre. In that there is an oblation to Brhaspati, and Brhaspati is the holy power of the gods, verily he supports by it holy power. In that there is (an offering) to Visnu on three potsherds, and Visnu is the sacrifice, verily he supports by it the sacrifice. In that he sacrifices with the Abhijit in the third year, (it serves) for conquest. In that he keeps the fire in the pan for a year, he [2] saves this world by it; in that he piles the fire in the second year, he saves the atmosphere by it; in that he sacrifices in the third year, he saves yonder world by it. This (fire) Para Atnara, Kaksivant Auśija, Vitahavya Çrayasa, and Trasadasyu Paurukutsya piled, being desirous of offspring; then indeed did they win thousands each of children; he is extended with offspring, with cattle, that measure he attains which they attained, who knowing thus piles the fire.
## 06
### a
Prajapati piled the fire; it kept being razor-edged; the gods in terror did not approach it; they, clothing themselves in the metres, approached it, and that is why the metres have their name. The metres are holy power; the black antelope skin is the form of holy power; he puts on a pair of black antelope skin shoes; verily clothing himself with the metres he approaches the fire, to prevent injury to himself.
### b
The fire is put down as a treasure of the gods [1]. Now a treasure unguarded others find, or he cannot recollect where it is; he steps on the fire-pan; verily he makes himself its overlord, for guardianship. Or rather they say, 'It should not be stepped on'; the pan is connected with Nirrti; if he
  
were to step on it, he would hand himself over to Nirrti; therefore it should not be stepped on. He puts down the human head, for guardianship; and moreover this is just as if one should say, 'Guard that for me' [2].
### c
Atharvan is Prajapati; Dadhyañc Atharvana is the fire, his bones are the bricks; as to that the seer says, 'Indra with the bones of Dadhyañc'. In that he piles the fire with the bricks, he piles up the fire with itself; he has his own self in yonder world who knows thus.
### d
(The fire) to be piled is the body of Agni, Vaiśvanara is the self; in that he offers to Vaiśvanara after the piling, he prepares its [3] body and mounts it; the sacrificer thus prepares his body, in that he piles the fire; in that he offers to Vaiśvanara after the piling, verily having pre pared his body he mounts it with the self; therefore they do not cut off from it; verily living he goes to the gods.
### e
He puts on dust with a verse addressed to Vaiśvanara; Agni Vaiśvanara is this (earth), the dust is its piling; verily he piles Agni Vaiśvanara; Vaiśvanara is the form dear to Agni; verily he wins the form dear to him.
## 07
The gods obtained the brilliance (virájam) of Agni by means of the consecration; for three nights should he be consecrated; the Viraj has three feet, he obtains the Viraj. For six nights should be consecrated; the year consists of six seasons; the Viraj is the year, he obtains the Viraj. For ten nights should he be consecrated; the Viraj has ten syllables; he obtains the Viraj. For twelve nights should he be consecrated; the year has twelve months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. He should be consecrated for thirteen nights; the year has thirteen months [1]; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For fifteen nights should he be consecrated; the nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up by the half-months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For seventeen nights should he be consecrated; the year has twelve months and seven seasons; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For twenty-four nights should he be consecrated; the year has twenty-four half-months; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For thirty nights should he be consecrated [2]; the Viraj has thirty syllables; he obtains the Viraj. For a month should he be consecrated; the year is the month; the Viraj is the year; he obtains the Viraj. For four months should he be consecrated; for four months the Vasus bore him, they conquered the earth, the Gayatri metre; for eight the Rudras, they conquered the atmosphere, the Tristubh metre; for twelve the Adityas, they conquered the sky, the Jagati metre; then they attained distinction, supremacy over the gods. Therefore after keeping the fire for twelve months, should one pile it up; the year has twelve months, the fire to be piled is the year, the bricks are days and nights; he piles him with the bricks obtained; verily also he attains distinction, supremacy over his equals.
## 08
### a
Agni is piled for the world of heaven; if he were not to mount after him the sacrificer would be excluded from the world of heaven. 'I have mounted on the earth; let not breath forsake me'; 'I have mounted on the atmosphere; let not offspring forsake me'; 'I have mounted on the sky, we have attained the light', he says; this is the mounting after Agni verily by it he mounts after him, to attain the world of heaven.
### b
If he were to set up (the eleven posts) commensurate with the wings [1], he would make the sacrificial rite too small, his offspring would be worse off than himself. He sets (it) up commensurate with the altar; verily he makes the sacrificial rite larger, his offspring does not become worse than himself.
### e
He should pile (the fire) of a thousand (bricks) when first piling (it); this world is commensurate with a thousand; verily he conquers this world. He should pile (it) of two thousand when piling a second time; the atmosphere is commensurate with two thousand; verily be conquers the atmosphere. He should pile (it) of three thousand when piling for the third time [2]; yonder world is commensurate with three thousand; verily he conquers yonder world.
### d
Knee deep should he pile (it), when piling for the first time; verily with the Gayatri he mounts this world; navel deep should he pile (it) when piling for the second time; verily with the Tristubh he mounts the atmosphere; neck deep should he pile (it) when piling for the third time; verily with the
  
Jagati he mounts yonder world.
### e
After piling the fire he should not have intercourse with a woman of pleasure, thinking, 'I shall deposit seed in that which is no womb'; nor after piling for the second time should he have intercourse with the wife of another [3], nor after piling for a third time should he have intercourse with any woman whatever. In that he piles the fire, he deposits seed; if he were to have intercourse. he would be deprived of seed. Or rather they say, 'If he were not to have intercourse, there would be no offspring.' In that he puts down the two Retahsic (bricks), they support the seed of the sacrificer; therefore he should have intercourse, for the non-spilling of seed.'
### f
Three seeds are there, father, son, grandson [4]; if he were to put down two Retahsic (bricks), he would cleave his seed; three he puts down, for the continuity of seed; the first Retahsic is this (earth), this (earth) is speech, therefore they see this (earth), they see speech speaking; the second is the atmosphere, the atmosphere is breath, therefore they see not the atmosphere, nor breath; the third is yonder (sky), yonder (sky) is the eye, therefore they see yonder (sky), they see the eye. With a Yajus he sets down this one [5] and yonder one, but with mind only the middle, to arrange these worlds, and also the breaths.
### g
'The sacrifice offered by the Bhrgus, the Vasus, accord our desires; of thee thus offered, enjoyed, may I here enjoy wealth,' he says; verily he milks thereby the song and the recitation.
### h
'Father Matariśvan, bestow flawless abodes; the flawless abodes the Uśijs have made; let Soma, all knowing, the leader, be leader; let Brhaspati recite hymns and rejoicing,' he says; that is Agni's hymn, and with it he recites after him.
## 09
### a
That fire which is kept in the pan is consecrated of fires; if he were to put it down their embryos would be liable to abortion, and that would be like descending after consecration. He sets it on a throne, to support and prevent the falling of embryos, and he makes thus a consecration.
### b
(The fire) in the pan is an embryo, the sling is the womb; if he were to remove the pan from the sling, he would strike the embryo from the womb; the sling has six ropes; man is sixfold [1], the body, the head, four limbs; verily in himself he bears it.
### c
The fire is Prajapati, his breasts are the pan and the mortar; his offspring live on them; in that he puts down the pan and the mortar, with them the sacrificer milks the fire in yonder world.
### d
The fire is the year, its bricks are arranged threefold, those of Prajapati, of Visnu [2], of Viśvakarman; the Prajapati (bricks) are the days and nights; in that he keeps (the fire) in the pan, he puts down the Prajapati (bricks); in that he takes up the kindling-sticks, and the trees are Visnu's, verily he puts down the Visnu (bricks); in that he piles the fire with bricks, and Viśvakarman is this (earth), verily he puts down the Viśvakarman (bricks). Therefore they say, 'Threefold is Agni.'
### e
This thus should the sacrificer himself pile; if another pile his fire, if he should not prosper him with sacrificial gifts, he would appropriate his fire; him who piles his fire he should prosper with sacrificial gifts; verily thus he preserves his fire.
## 10
Prajapati piled the fire as the year by the seasons; by the spring he piled its front half, by the summer its right wing, by the rains its tail, by the autumn its left wing, by the winter its middle. By the Brahman class he piled its front half, by the lordly class its right wing, by cattle its tail, by the people its left wing, by hope its middle. He who knowing thus piles the fire piles it with the seasons; verily he wins all [1]; they hearken to him who has piled the fire, he eats food, he is resplendent. The first layer is this (earth), the mortar the plants and trees; the second is the atmosphere, the mortar the birds; the third is yonder (sky), the mortar the Naksatras; the fourth the sacrifice, the mortar the sacrificial fee; the fifth the sacrificer, the mortar offspring; if he were to pile it with three layers, he would obstruct the sacrifice, the fee, the self, offspring; therefore should it be piled with five layers; verily he preserves all. In that there [2] are three layers, (it is) since Agni is threefold; in that there are two (more), the sacrificer has two feet, (it is) for support; there are five layers, man is five fold; verily he preserves himself. There are five layers, he covers (them) with five (sets of) mortar, these make up ten, man has ten elements; he preserves man in his full extent.
  
Again the Viraj has ten elements, the Viraj is food; verily he finds support in the Viraj and the eating of food. The sixth layer is the year, mortar is the seasons; there are six layers, six (sets of) mortar, they make up twelve, the year has twelve months; verily he finds support in the year.

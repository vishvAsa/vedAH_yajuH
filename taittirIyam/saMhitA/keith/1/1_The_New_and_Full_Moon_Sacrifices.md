O god, knowing all the ways;

To accomplish that which we have power to do;

Sing aloud, O thou of brilliant radiance.  
From thee wealth, like a cow,

With thy favour over every trouble.

Health and wealth for our children and descendants. Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of law,  
Among the gods and mortals;  
Thou art to be invoked at the sacrifices.
### o
If laws of you wise ones, O gods,  
In our ignorance we transgress,  
May Agni make good all that,  
He that knoweth the seasons wherein he may satisfy the gods.

Hurling thy swift net thou shootest arrows;  
Pierce the Raksases with thy keenest (darts).
### b
Swiftly thy whirling flames descend;  
bring upward Follow them, glowing in thy fury;  
Thy heat, O Agni, thy winged (flames) with thy tongue, Unfettered, on all sides spread thy firebrands.

Be an unfailing guardian to this folk,  
From him who afar plans evil [1], from him who near; O Agni let no trouble from thee overwhelm us.

Burn up our foes, O thou of keen dart;  
Him who hath wrought evil for us, O blazing one,  
Do thou consume utterly like dry stubble.
### e
Arise; drive from us (our foes);  
Reveal thy heavenly strength, O Agni,  
Slacken the strung (weapon) of the demon-driven;  
Crush our foes, kin or not kin.

He knows thy [2] loving kindliness, O most youthful one, Who hath given furtherance to this devotion;  
All happy days for him, glory, and wealth  
--Opening the doors of the miser--he hath revealed.'
### g
Let him, O Agni, be fortunate and munificent,  
Who with constant oblation, who with praise,  
Seeks to delight thee in his life in his house;  
May all days be happy for him; be that the will.
### h
I praise thy loving kindness; loud sounding (thou singest) a reply; Let this song of mine, beloved of thee, sing with thee [3] With good steeds and fair chariots may we adorn thee; Maintain for us the lordly power as the days go by.
### i
Here let each serve thee readily,  
That shinest in the darkness, as the days go by;  
Happy and joyous may we attend thee  
That dost surpass the glories of men.'
### k
He who with good steeds and rich in gold  
Approacheth thee, O Agni, with a rich chariot,  
His protector thou art, the comrade of him  
Who duly offereth thee glad reception.
### l
The great I overcome [4] through kinship and my songs; That hath descended to me from Gotama, my sire;  
Pay heed to this song of ours,

### m
Sleepless, speedy, propitious,  
Unwearied, never hostile, unexhausted,  
May thy guardians, O Agni, taking their places here united,  
Protect us, O wise one.
### n
In Thy guardians, O Agni, who seeing,  
Guarded from ill the blind Mamateya,  
He of all wisdom guarded these kindly ones;  
The foes that were fain to deceive could not [5] deceive.
### o
In unison with thee, aided by thee,  
Under thy leadership, let us gain strength;  
Fulfil both our desires, O truthful one;  
Perform it forthwith, O fearless one.
### p
With this fuel, O Agni, will we serve thee;  
Accept the song of praise recited for thee;  
Burn those that revile, the Raksases; guard us,  
From the foe, the reviler, O rich in friends, from blame.  
I touch the steed that slayeth the Raksases;  
I go for shelter to the friend most spreading;  
May Agni, enkindled with our offerings, sharpening (his dart)  
Guard us by day, [6] from harm and by night.
### r
With great radiance Agni shineth;  
All things doth he reveal by his might;  
He overcometh godless and malign enchantments  
He sharpeneth his horns to pierce the Raksas.
### s
Let the roarings of Agni rise to the heaven,  
Sharp weapons to slay the Raksas;  
In the carouse his radiance bursteth forth  
The godless assailers cannot restrain him.

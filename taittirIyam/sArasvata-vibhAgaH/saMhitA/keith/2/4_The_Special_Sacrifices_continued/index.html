<p>The gods, men, and the Pitrs were on one side, the Asuras, Raksases, and Piśacas on the other. Of the gods the little blood they drew the Raksases smothered by the nights and dawn dawned on them smothered and dead. The gods understood, &lsquo;Him who of us dies, it is the Raksases who kill.&rsquo; They invited the Raksases; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; what [1] we win from the Asuras, let that be shared between us.&rsquo; Then indeed did the gods conquer the Asuras, and having conquered the Asuras, they drove away the Raksases. The Raksases (saying), &lsquo;Ye have done falsely&rsquo;, surrounded the gods on all sides. The gods found a protector in Agni; they offered to Agni, the forward, a cake on eight potsherds, to Agni, the overcomer, to Agni with the face. In that they offered to Agni, the forward, the Raksases in front [2] they repelled thereby; in that (they offered) to Agni, the overcomer, the Raksases that were around they repelled thereby; in that (they offered) to Agni with the face, the Raksases behind were repelled thereby. That the gods prospered, the Raksases were defeated. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering; he should offer to Agni, the forward, a cake on eight potsherds, to Agni, the overcomer [3], to Agni with the face. In that he offers to Agni, the forward, he repels thereby the foe who is superior to him; in that (he offers) to Agni, the overcomer, he repels thereby (the foe) who is equal to him; in that (he offers) to Agni with the face, he repels thereby the foe which is inferior to him. He repels the foe who is superior,</p>
<p>he surpasses him who is like, the inferior does not equal him who knowing thus sacrifices with this offering.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the gods said, &lsquo;Let us hold on to the strongest of us&rsquo;; they said to Indra, &lsquo;Thou art the strongest of us; let us hold on to thee.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Three are these forms of my own that have strength; satiate them, and then shall ye overcome the Asuras.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Name (them).&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;This is that which frees from tribulation; this is that which drives away the foe;<br>
this is that which has power&rsquo; [1]. They offered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, a cake on eleven potsherds, to Indra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the powerful. In that they offered to Indra, the freer from tribulation, thereby they were freed from tribulation; in that they offered to Indra, the driver away of foes, thereby they drove away foes; in that they offered to Indra, the powerful, thereby they bestowed power upon themselves. They offered a cake on thirty-three potsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily Indra takes hold of them in himself, for prosperity [2]. That was the highest victory that the gods won over the Asuras. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering; to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he should offer a cake on eleven potsherds, to Indra, the driver away of the foe, to Indra, the powerful; by tribulation is he seized whose foe is superior to him; in that he offers to Indra, the freer from tribulation, he is freed thereby from tribulation; by foes is he beset, to whom one of his equals is superior, even [3] if no foe; in that (he offers) to Indra, the driver away of the foe, he smites away thereby his foes; in that (he offers) to Indra, the powerful, he bestows thereby power upon himself; he offers a cake on thirty-three potsherds; the gods are thirty-three; verily the sacrificer takes hold of them in himself, for prosperity, Thus is the sacrifice called &rsquo;the victorious&rsquo;; he who knowing thus sacrifices with this offering wins thus the highest victory over his foe.</p>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Gayatri, grasping and taking their force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle, remained away; they reflected, I Whomsoever of us she shall resort to, they shall become this (world)&rsquo;; they hailed her in rivalry, &lsquo;O All worker&rsquo;, said the gods; &lsquo;O Deceiver&rsquo;, said the Asuras; neither did she resort to. The gods saw this formula, &lsquo;Thou art force, thou art strength, thou art might [1], thou are blazing, thou art by name the home of the gods, thou art all, of all life thou art everything, thou art of every life, the overcoming.&rsquo; (So saying) the gods appropriated the force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of the Asuras. Because the Gayatri remained away, therefore they style this offering the Gayatri; the Gayatri is the year, so the year remained away; because the gods thereby appropriated the force, might, power, strength [2], offspring, and cattle of the Asuras, therefore they style this offering the gatherer. He who has foes should in conflict sacrifice with this offering. To Agni, the gatherer, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds; this when cooked and put in place he should stroke with this formula; verily he appropriates the force, might, power, strength, offspring, and cattle of his foe; he prospers with himself, his foe is defeated.</p>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<p>Prajapati created offspring; they created went away from him; where they stayed, thence sprung the bean. Those he followed with Brhaspati; Brhaspati said, &lsquo;With this will I go before thee, then shall offspring have resort to thee.&rsquo; He went before him; then indeed did offspring resort to Prajapati. For him who desires offspring he should offer this oblation of beans to Prajapati verily he has recourse to Prajapati with his own share [1]; verily he produces offspring for him. Prajapati created cattle; they created went away from him; where they stayed, thence sprung the bean; those he followed with Pusan; Pusan said, &lsquo;With this do thou go before me; then shall cattle resort to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do thou go before me&rsquo;, said Soma, &lsquo;mine [2] is what grows on untilled (land).&rsquo; &lsquo;Both of you shall I go before&rsquo;, he said; he went before them both; then indeed did cattle resort to Prajapati. For him who desires cattle should he offer this oblation of beans to Soma and Pusan; verily he has recourse to Soma and Pusan</p>
<p>with their own share; verily they produce cattle for him. Soma is the impregnator of seed, Pusan the producer of cattle; verily Soma bestows seed upon him, Pusan produces cattle.</p>

<p>He who desires cattle should sacrifice with the Śitra (offering); Śitra is this (earth); in that in this (earth) all things are produced, thereby is this (earth) variegated (citra); he who knowing thus sacrifices with the Śitra desirous of cattle is propagated with offspring, with cattle, with pairings. With the offering to Agni he strews, with that to Soma he impregnates seed, the seed impregnated Tvastr develops into forms; there are (offerings) to Sarasvant and Sarasvati; that is the divine pair; verily in the midst he bestows upon him a divine [1] pair, for growth, for propagation. There is an oblation to Sinivali; Sinivali is speech, speech is growth; verily he approaches speech and growth. The last is to Indra, and thereby there is a pair. Seven are these offerings, the tame animals are seven, the wild seven; the metres are seven, for the winning of both. Then he offers these oblations; these gods are the lords of growth; verily they bestow growth upon him, he grows with offspring and cattle; moreover in that he offers these oblations, (they serve) for support.</p>

Full of light, full of darkness, flooding, with fair foam,<br>
Supporting friends, supporting the warrior caste,</p>
<p>With fair realms, do ye help me.</p>

<p>Thou art the fetter of the strong steed; for rain I yoke thee.</p>

<p>O gods granting protection, O Mitra and Varuna, Aryaman;<br>
O gods who drink together, O son of the waters, with swift onset,<br>
Give of the water, cleave the holder of the waters; from the sky, from Parjanya, from the atmosphere, from the earth, thence do ye help us with rain.</p>
<h3 id="b-2">b</h3>
<p>Even by day they make the darkness,<br>

<p>The treasure-house of sky which the heroes rich in dew<br>
Make to shake for the generous giver,<br>

<p>From the ocean, O Maruts, ye make (the rain) to start,<br>

<p>The gods whose portion is in the sky, the gods whose portion is in the atmosphere, the gods whose portion is on earth, may they aid this sacrifice, may they enter this place, may they inhabit this place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thou art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts on a black garment with a black fringe; that is the hue of rain; verily becoming of like hue he causes Parjanya to rain. &lsquo;Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon&rsquo;, (with these words) he pushes back the west wind; verily he produces the east wind, to win the rains. He makes offering to the names of the wind; the wind rules the rain; verily he has recourse to the wind with its own share; verily it makes Parjanya rain for him. Eight offerings [1] he makes; the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters are four; verily from the quarters he makes the rain to move. He unites (them) on a black antelope skin; verily he makes the offering; he unites within the Vedi, for accomplishment. When the Yatis were being eaten, their heads fell away; they became Kharjuras; their sap rose upwards, they became Kariras; the Kariras are connected with Soma; the offering connected with Soma makes rain to move from the sky; in that there are Kariras (in the sacrifice) [2], by means of an offering which is connected with Soma he wins the rain from the sky. With honey he unites (them); honey is the sap of the waters and the plants; verily it rains from the waters and the plants; verily also he brings down rain from the waters and the plants. &lsquo;Gladdening, obedient&rsquo;, (with these words) he unites (them); verily he approaches them by their names; just as one may say, &lsquo;Come hither, N. N.&rsquo;, so by their names [3] he makes them move forward. Thou art the fetter of the strong horse; for rain I yoke thee&rsquo;, he says the horse is strong, Parjanya is strong; becoming black as it were he rains; verily he unites him with his hue, to win the rains.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>&lsquo;O gods having wealth, O gods granting protection, O gods drinking together&rsquo;, (with these words) he ties on; verily by means of the gods he daily seeks rain. If it should rain, so much only should be offered; if it should not rain, on the next day he should offer an oblation. Mitra and Varuna are day and night, by day and night Parjanya rains, for by night or by day he rains; verily he has recourse to Mitra and Varuna with their own share; verily they [1] make Parjanya rain for him by day and night. To Agni, hiding his abode, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds, to the Maruts on seven potsherds, to Surya on one potsherd; Agni thence causes the rain to arise, the Maruts lead it out when produced; when yonder Sun Moves low with his rays, then he rains; becoming a hider of his abode, as it were, he rains; these deities are the lords of rain; them he has recourse to with their own share; they [2] make Parjanya rain for him; even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. &lsquo;Let free the rain from heaven; with waters fill the ocean&rsquo;, he says; verily these and yonder waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters). &lsquo;Thou art born of waters, first-born; thou art the might of the ocean&rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &lsquo;Flood the earth&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers in a Boerhavia procumbens; this of plants is that which wins rain, and thereby he causes rain to fall. &lsquo;The gods whose portion is in the sky&rsquo;, (with these words) he shakes the black antelope skin; verily to him these worlds become dear and desired.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All&rsquo; the metres are to be recited in this sacrifice&rsquo;, they say; the Kakubh is the strength of the Tristubh, the Usnih of the Jagati; in that he repeats the Usnih and the Kakubh, thereby he wins all the metres. The Usnih is the Gayatri; the four syllables over are fourfooted cattle; just as cake is over cake, so it is with the syllables which are over the verse; if he were to close with a Jagati [1], he would end the sacrifice; he closes with a Tristubh, the Tristubh is power and strength; verily he establishes the sacrifice on power and strength, he does not end it. &lsquo;O Agni, three are thy strengths, three thy abodes&rsquo;, with this (verse) containing the word &rsquo;three&rsquo; he closes, for similarity of form: that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; for every desire it is employed, for the sacrifice is employed for all desires. He who is practising witchcraft should sacrifice with that of three constituents; that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice [2]; verily with the whole of the sacrifice he bewitches him, and lays him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is practised against, that which has three constituents is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and he who practises witchcraft does not lay him low. With the same (offering) should he sacrifice who is going to sacrifice with a thousand; verily he produces and gives (it). He who has sacrificed with a thousand should sacrifice with the same (offering) he goes to the end of cattle [3] who sacrifices with a thousand; Prajapati created cattle; he created them with (the offering) of three constituents; he who knowing thus sacrifices, desirous of cattle, with (the offering) of three constituents, creates cattle from the very source whence Prajapati created them; and the thousand resorts to him. He becomes a prey to the gods who having said, &lsquo;I shall sacrifice&rsquo;, does not sacrifice; he should sacrifice with (the offering) of three constituents; (the offering) of three constituents [4] is the whole of the sacrifice; verily he sacrifices with the whole of the sacrifice, and does not become a prey to the gods. The cake is on twelve potsherds; these are three (sets of) four potsherds, to bring about the three. There are three cakes, these worlds are three; (verily they serve) to win these worlds. Each one above the other is larger, for so as it were are these worlds. The middle one is made of barley, that is the form of the atmosphere; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He cuts off from all (the cakes) as he sets them up without making a failure. He gives gold; verily he wins brilliance [5]; he gives the silken garment; verily he wins cattle; he gives a cow; verily he wins his prayers; gold is the colour of the Saman, the silken garment of the formulae, the cow of the praises and rejoicings; verily he wins all these colours.</p>

<p>Tvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), &lsquo;Thou hast slain my son.&rsquo; He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), saying, &lsquo;Hail! wax great, Indra&rsquo;s foe. While (the fire) was flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed;</p>
<p>whether so much was before [1], or so much was over the fire, be sprang up alive and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him, and Tvastr too; Tvastr dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain it. Visnu [2] was another god; he said, &lsquo;Visnu, come hither; we will grasp that by which he is this world. Visnu deposited himself in three places, a third on the earth, a third in the atmosphere, a third in the sky, for he was afraid of his growth. By means of the third on earth Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [3] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him, he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thou didst further me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power (indriya) in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the atmosphere Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; there is this [4] strength in me; I will give it to you.&rsquo; He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Twice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; By means of the third in the sky Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, &lsquo;Hurl it not at me; I will give to thee that by which I [5] am this world! He said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; (He replied), &lsquo;Let us make a compact; let me enter thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou dost enter me, in what way wilt thou enjoy me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will kindle thee; I will enter thee for thine enjoyment&rsquo;, he answered. Vrtra entered him. Vrtra is the belly; hunger is man&rsquo;s enemy; he who [6] knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), &lsquo;Thrice hast thou furthered me&rsquo;, gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), &lsquo;Let Indra place power in us.&rsquo; In that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu. Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rces, the Samans, the Yajuses. A thousand he gave to him; therefore there are a thousand gifts.</p>

<p>The gods were afraid of the warrior on his birth. While still within (the womb) they fettered him with a bond. The warrior thus is born fettered; if he were born not fettered he would continually slay his foes. If one desire of a warrior, &lsquo;May he be born not fettered, may he continually slay his foes&rsquo;, one should offer for him the offering for Indra and Brhaspati, for the warrior is connected with Indra, Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman); verily by the holy power (Brahman) he frees him from the bond that fetters him. The sacrificial present is a golden bond; verily manifestly he frees him from the bond that fetters him.</p>

<p>In the eastern quarter thou art king, O Indra<br>

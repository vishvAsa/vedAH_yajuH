The Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice


## 10
The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the sacrifice. They spoke to Śamyu Barhaspatya, 'Perform the Svaga call at this sacrifice for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon; if a faithless man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.' Therefore if a faithless man sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of such a sacrifice goes to Śamyu Barhaspatya. 'That is mine', he said, 'What is to belong to my offspring? [1].' 'Him, who reviles him, he shall fine with a hundred; him, who strikes him, he shall fine with a thousand; he, who draws blood from him, shall not behold the world of the Pitrs for as many years as are the grains of dust which the blood in its fall seizes upon', (they replied). Therefore one should not revile a Brahman, nor strike him, nor draw blood from him; for so great is his sin. 'That health and wealth we choose', he says; verily he utters the call Svaga, over the sacrifice. 'That [2] health and wealth we choose', he says; verily he gives Śamyu Barhaspatya his portion. 'Success to the sacrifice, success to the sacrificer', he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He sacrifices to Soma; verily he places seed; he sacrifices to Tvastr; seed is placed and Tvastr moulds forms; he sacrifices to the wives of the gods, to make a pair; he sacrifices to Agni, lord of the house, for support. There is sameness in the sacrifice [3] in that the fore-sacrifices are offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an end.

a. Yoke like a charioteer, Agni,  
The steeds that best invite the gods  
Set down as ancient Hotr.
### b
And, O god, for us do thou the gods,  
Most wise one, call hither;  
Make all our wishes true;
### c
Since thou, O most young,  
O son of strength, who art sacrificed to,  
Art righteous and worthy of sacrifice.

### d
This Agni is lord of a thousandfold,.  
A hundredfold, strength;  
The sage, the head of wealth.
### e
Bring him hither with common call  
Lower to our sacrifice, O Angiras.  
As the Rbhus bend the felly (of the chariot) [I]
### f
To him, the heavenly,  
Now with constant voice, O Virupa,  
To the strong one urge the hymn of praise.
### g
What Pani shall we lay low among the kine With the missile of this Agni  
Who seeth from afar?
### h
May not the clans of the gods forsake us,  
Like the dawns entering the waters,  
As cows a poor man.
### i
Let not the assault  
Of any ill-minded foe smite us,  
As a wave a ship.
### k
Homage to thee, O Agni, for might,  
The people sing, O god;  
With strength [2] trouble thou the foe.
### l
Wilt thou not, O Agni,  
Bring us wealth for our quest for cattle?  
O room maker, make room for us.
### m
Cast us not aside in this great contest,  
Like a bearer his burden;  
Gather wealth and conquer it.
### n
May this terror, this misfortune,  
O Agni, fasten on another than us;  
Increase our impetuous strength.
### o
The reverent or generous man  
In whose offering he hath delighted,  
Agni aideth indeed with furtherance.
### p
From a far [3] region  
Come hither to these lower ones,  
Favour those in the region where I am.
### q
Since we have known of old  
Of thy help, O Agni, as a father's,  
Now we seek thy favour.
### r
Thou, who art like a mighty man who slayeth with the dart Or a sharp-horned bull,  
O Agni, hast rent the forts.
### s
O friends, together (offer) fit  
Food and praise to Agni,  
Highest over the folk,  
The son of strength, the mighty.
### t
Thou gatherest, O strong one,  
All that belongeth, O Agni, to the niggard;  
Thou art kindled in the place of offering;  
Do thou bear us good things.
### u
O Prajapati.
### v
He knoweth.
### w
O Soma and Pusan.
### x
These gods.

### a
Eagerly we hail thee,  
Eagerly would we kindle thee;  
Eager bring the eager,  
The fathers, to eat the offering.
### b
Thou, O Soma, art pre-eminent in wisdom;  
Thou movest along the straightest path;  
Through thy guidance, O drop, our fathers wisely divided  
The treasure among the gods.  
By thee, O Soma Pavamana, our ancient fathers  
Wisely ordained the offerings;  
Conquering, untroubled, do thou open the barriers;  
Be generous to us in heroes and horses [1].
### d
Thou, O Soma, in accord with the fathers,  
Hast stretched over sky and earth;  
To thee, O drop, let us make sacrifice with offering;  
Let us be lords of wealth.
### e
O fathers, made ready by Agni, come hither;  
With good leadership sit ye on each seat;  
Eat ye the offerings set out on the strew;  
And give us wealth with many heroes.
### f
O fathers that sit on the sacrificial strew, come hither with your aid; We have made these offerings for you; accept them,  
And then come to us with your most healing aid,  
Give us [2] health, wealth, and safety!
### g
I have found the kindly fathers,  
The scion and the step of Visnu;  
They that sit on the sacrificial strew and enjoy the drink  
That is pressed for them with the Svadha call are most eager to come hither.
### h
Invoked are the fathers who love the Soma  
To their dear homes on the sacrificial strew;  
May they come hither; may they hear us here  
May they speak for us; and may they aid us.
### i
Let them arise, the lower and the higher  
And the middle fathers who love the Soma;  
They who lived their lives [3] in goodness and without sin;  
May these fathers help us when we call.
### k
Be this homage to-day to the fathers,  
Who went before and who went after;  
Who are seated in the earthly region  
Or who are now in abodes with fair dwellings.
### l
As our fathers before,  
Of old, O Agni, furthering right,  
Sought the pure, the devotion, singing hymns  
Cleaving the earth they disclosed the red ones.
### m
When, O Agni [4], bearer of oblations,  
Thou sacrificest to the righteous fathers,  
Thou shalt bear the oblations  
To the gods and to the fathers.
### n
Thou, O Agni, praised, all-knower,  
Didst carry the offerings making them fragrant;  
Thou didst give them to the fathers who ate them at the Svadha call;  
Eat thou, O god, the offerings set before thee.

### o
Matali with the Kavyas, Yama with the Angirases, Brhaspati rejoicing with the Rkvans,  
Those whom the gods magnified and those who magnified the gods; Some in the Svaha call, some in the Svadha rejoice [5].
### p
Sit on this strew, O Yama,  
In accordance with the Angirases, the fathers  
Let the verses made by the poets bring thee hither  
Rejoice, O king, in this offering.  
Come with the Angirases who deserve the sacrifice Yama, rejoice here with the Vairupas;  
I summon Virasvant who is thy father,  
Sitting down on the strew at this sacrifice.
### r
The Angirases, our fathers, the Navagvas,  
Atharvans, Bhrgus, who love the Soma;  
May we be in the favour of those ones worthy of sacrifice, May we have their kindly good will.

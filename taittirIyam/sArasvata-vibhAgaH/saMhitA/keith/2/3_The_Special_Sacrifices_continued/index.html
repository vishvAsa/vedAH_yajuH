<p>Prajapati had thirty-three daughters; he gave them to Soma, the king; of them he associated with Rohini; they returned in anger; then he followed and asked for them back; them he would not return; he said, &lsquo;Swear on oath that thou wilt equally associate (with them): then will I return them to you.&rsquo; He took the oath, and he returned them. He associated with Rohini alone [1]. Illness seized him; &lsquo;Illness has seized the king&rsquo;, that (saying) is the origin of the &lsquo;king&rsquo;s evil&rsquo;; in that he became</p>
<p>worse, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;bad illness&rsquo;; because he got it from his wives, that is (the origin) of the &lsquo;wife&rsquo;s disease&rsquo; (Jayenya); him who knows thus the origin of these illnesses, these illnesses do not visit. He approached them respectfully; they said, &lsquo;Let us choose a boon; do thou associate equally with us.&rsquo; For him [2] they offered this oblation to the Adityas; they freed him from his evil case. For him who is seized by the bad illness he should offer this oblation to the Adityas; verily he has recourse to the Adityas with their own share; verily they free him from his evil case.

For him of whom he desires, &lsquo;May he be an eater of food&rsquo;, let him offer this (offering) of three elements, to Indra, the king, a cake [1] on eleven potsherds, to Indra, the overlord, to Indra, the sovereign.

<p>The gods and the Asuras were in conflict: the Asuras conquered the gods, the gods being defeated became the servants of the Asuras; from them power and strength departed; Indra perceived this; he departed in pursuit of it; he could not win it. Then he departed from it, he had recourse to Prajapati; he made him sacrifice with this (offering) with all the Prstha (Stotras); verily with it he bestowed upon him power and strength. Him who desires power [1], desires strength, he should make him sacrifice with this (offering) with all the Prsthas; verily he has recourse to these deities with their own share; verily they bestow upon him power and strength. In that he offers to Indra of the Rathantara, verily he wins the brilliance of Agni; in that (he offers) to Indra of the Brhat, verily he wins the brilliance of Indra; in that (he offers) to Indra of the Vairupa, verily he wins the brilliance of Savitr [2]; in that (he offers) to Indra of the Vairaja, verily he wins the brilliance of the creator; in that (he offers) to Indra of the Śakvara, verily he wins the brilliance of the Maruts; in that (he offers) to Indra of the Raivata, verily he wins the brilliance of Brhaspati. So many are the brilliances, verily he wins them; he places (the cakes) on potsherds face upwards, for variety; the cake is on twelve potsherds [3], to secure the All-gods. He cuts off all around; verily all around he bestows on the sacrificer power and strength; he recites (the verses) alternating, to prevent burning. A horse, a bull, a ram, a goat, these are the sacrificial fee; for manliness. With this he should sacrifice who is being practised against; if these deities eat his food, men eat his also.</p>

The Yajya, and the Anuvakya, are alike, for the eye is alike; (verily it serves) for prosperity. &lsquo;Up that god that knoweth all&rsquo;, &lsquo;Seven bays in thy chariot&rsquo;, &lsquo;The radiant countenance of the gods hath arisen&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers lumps; verily he gives sight to him; what was his, that (is his again).</p>

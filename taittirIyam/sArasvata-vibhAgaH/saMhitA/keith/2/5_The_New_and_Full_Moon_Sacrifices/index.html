07 The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they rest. He makes the noise ‘Him’; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise ‘Him’; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise ‘Him’; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise ‘Him’; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the end of the sacrifice [1] so that it may not slip. He repeats (it) continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food, and for the smiting away of the Raksases. The first he repeats is connected with the Rathantara (Saman), this world is connected with the Rathantara; verily he conquers this world. He divides it thrice; these worlds are three; verily he conquers these worlds. The last he repeats is connected with the Brhat (Saman); yonder world is connected with the Brhat; verily he conquers yonder world. ‘Forward [2] your viands’, he repeats, a verse which has not any indication (of its deity) and (therefore) is addressed to Prajapati. Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he grasps the sacrifice as Prajapati. ‘Forward your viands’, he repeats; viands are food; verily he wins food. ‘Forward your viands’, he repeats; therefore seed is deposited in front. ‘O Agni, come hither for the feast’, he repeats; therefore offspring are born at the back. ‘Forward your viands’, he repeats [3]; ‘viands’ are the months, ‘heavenwards’ are the half-months, ‘rich in the oblation’ are the gods, ‘full of butter’ is the cow, ‘he goes to the gods’ (that is) the sacrifice, ‘desirous of favour ’ is the sacrificer. ‘Thou art this, thou art this’, (with these words) he wins the dear abode of the sacrifice. If he desire for a man, ‘May he live all his days’, he should repeat for him ‘Forward your viands’, and then continuously the next half-verse of ‘Agni, come hither to the feast’ [4]. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer’s offspring">

  <p>The Part of the Hotr at the New and Full Moon Sacrifices</p>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<p>The gods could not rest on the Rc or the Yajus. On the Saman only could they rest. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; verily he makes the Saman. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; where the gods rested, there he sets them in motion. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; this is the yoking of speech. He makes the noise &lsquo;Him&rsquo;; thus the sacrificers produce offspring. He repeats the first (verse) thrice, the last thrice; verily he ties the end of the sacrifice [1] so that it may not slip. He repeats (it) continuously, for the continuity of the breaths and of food, and for the smiting away of the Raksases. The first he repeats is connected with the Rathantara (Saman), this world is connected with the Rathantara; verily he conquers this world. He divides it thrice; these worlds are three; verily he conquers these worlds. The last he repeats is connected with the Brhat (Saman); yonder world is connected with the Brhat; verily he conquers yonder world. &lsquo;Forward [2] your viands&rsquo;, he repeats, a verse which has not any indication (of its deity) and (therefore) is addressed to Prajapati. Prajapati is the sacrifice; verily he grasps the sacrifice as Prajapati. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; viands are food; verily he wins food. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore seed is deposited in front. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he repeats; therefore offspring are born at the back. &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, he repeats [3]; &lsquo;viands&rsquo; are the months, &lsquo;heavenwards&rsquo; are the half-months, &lsquo;rich in the oblation&rsquo; are the gods, &lsquo;full of butter&rsquo; is the cow, &lsquo;he goes to the gods&rsquo; (that is) the sacrifice, &lsquo;desirous of favour &rsquo; is the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art this, thou art this&rsquo;, (with these words) he wins the dear abode of the sacrifice. If he desire for a man, &lsquo;May he live all his days&rsquo;, he should repeat for him &lsquo;Forward your viands&rsquo;, and then continuously the next half-verse of &lsquo;Agni, come hither to the feast&rsquo; [4]. Verily by expiration does he make steadfast his inspiration, and he lives all his days. He, who knows the elbow of the Samidhenis, puts his enemy in his elbow. He joins the half-verses; this is the elbow of the Samidhenis; he who knows thus puts his foe in his elbow. The Samidhenis were brought out by Rsi after Rsi; if they were not connected together, they would go away from the sacrificer&rsquo;s offspring</p>
<p>and cattle. He unites the half-verses; verily he connects them together, and being so connected and secured they yield him all his desires.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>Without a Saman there is no sacrifice. &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Rathantara. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling-sticks, O Angiras&rsquo;, he says; this is the character of the Vamadevya. &lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, he says. This is the character of the Brhat. In that he repeats this Trca, he makes the sacrifice have Samans. Agni was in yonder world, the sun in this; these worlds were disturbed [1]. The gods said, &lsquo;Let us change them about.&rsquo; (Saying), &lsquo;O Agni, come hither for the feast&rsquo;, they placed Agni in this world, and (saying),&lsquo;The great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;, they placed the sun in yonder world. Then indeed these worlds became calm. In that he repeats (it) thus, (it serves) for the calming of these worlds; these worlds become calm for him who knows thus. He repeats fifteen Samidhenis [2]. The nights of the half-month are fifteen; the year is made up of half-months. There are three hundred and sixty syllables in the Samidhenis; there are as many nights in the year; verily by syllables he obtains the year. Nrmedha and Paruchepa had a theological dispute (and said), &lsquo;Let us generate fire in the dry wood (to see) which of us two is the more of a theologian.&rsquo; Nrmedha spoke; he generated smoke. Paruchepa spoke; he generated fire. &lsquo;O Rsi&rsquo;, he said, [3], &lsquo;seeing that our knowledge is equal, how didst thou generate fire and not I?&rsquo; &lsquo;I know the character of the Samidhenis&rsquo;, he replied. The character of the Samidhenis is the quarter-verse which is repeated with the word &lsquo;ghee&rsquo; in it. &lsquo;Thee with the kindling sticks, Angiras&rsquo;, he says; verily he generates light in the Samidhenis. They are feminine in that they are Rc (verses), they are feminine in that they are Gayatri (verses), they are feminine in that they are Samidhenis. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;Male&rsquo; in it [4]. By it he gives them a husband, makes them possess Indra, and mates them. Agni was the messenger of the gods, Uśanas Kavya of the Asuras. They went to question Prajapati; he turned away (from Uśanas) (with the words). &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose.&rsquo; Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. The man for whom, knowing thus, he repeats, &lsquo;Agni as messenger we choose, prospers himself, his enemy is defeated. He repeats a verse with the word &lsquo;imperishable&rsquo;; verily by it he causes his enemy to perish [5]. &lsquo;The flaming locked, him we adore&rsquo;, he says; that is purifying; verily with it he makes pure the sacrificer. &lsquo;Thou art lit, O Agni, worshipped&rsquo;, he says; verily he places around a barrier that may not be climbed. If he were to add anything further, it would be just as when (a libation) falls outside the barriers. There are three Agnis, the oblation bearer of the gods, the bearer of the offering of the Pitrs, the guardian of the Asuras. They repeat, &lsquo;Me will he choose, me&rsquo; [6]. &lsquo;Choose ye the bearer of the oblation&rsquo;, he says; &rsquo;let him choose him who is of the gods. He chooses one of a Rsi&rsquo;s family; verily he departs not from the connexion, (and so it serves) for continuity. He chooses, beginning at the further end, in order of descent; therefore the Pitrs drink after men in order of descent, beginning at the further end.</p>

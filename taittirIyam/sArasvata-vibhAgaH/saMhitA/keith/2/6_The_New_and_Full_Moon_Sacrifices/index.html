The Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice
07 Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He said, ‘Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?’ Mitra and Varuna said, ‘We are able to produce the cow.’ Then they set the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. ‘The Rathantara is invoked with the earth’, he says [1]. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he invokes her with food. ‘The Vamadevya is invoked with the atmosphere’, he says. The Vamadevya, is cattle; verily he invokes cattle with the atmosphere. ‘The Brhat is invoked with the sky’, he says. The Brhat is connected with food; verily he invokes food with the sky. ’ The seven Hotras are invoked’, he says; verily he invokes the Hotras. ‘The cow is invoked with the bull’, he says [2]; verily he invokes a pair. ‘The friend food is invoked’, he says; verily he invokes the Soma drink. ‘It is invoked; ho!’ he says; verily he invokes the self, for the self is the best of those invoked. He invokes food, food is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. He invokes four, for cattle are four-footed. ‘Offspring of Manu’, he says, for Manu first saw her [3]. ‘Ghee footed’, he says. Because ghee was pressed out of her foot, therefore be says thus. ‘Of Mitra and Varuna’, he says, for Mitra and Varuna set her in motion. ‘The Brahman, god made, is invoked’, he says; verily he invokes the Brahman. ‘The divine Adhvaryus are invoked, the human are invoked’, he says; verily he invokes the gods and men. ‘Who shall help this sacrifice and make the lord of the sacrifice prosper’, he says [4]; verily he invokes a blessing for the sacrifice and the sacrificer. ‘Sky and earth are invoked’, he says; verily he invokes sky and earth. ‘Born of yore, the righteous’, he says, for they were born of yore and are righteous. ‘Divine, with gods for children’, he says, for they are divine and have gods for children. ‘Invoked is this sacrificer’, he says; verily he invokes the sacrificer. ‘Invoked in the highest sacrifice, invoked in the greater offering, invoked in the divine abode’ [5], he says. The highest sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine abode">

<p>The Part of the Hotr in the New and Full Moon Sacrifice</p>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<p>Manu desired what of earth was sacrificial. He found the poured out ghee. He said, &lsquo;Who is able to produce this also at the sacrifice?&rsquo; Mitra and Varuna said, &lsquo;We are able to produce the cow.&rsquo; Then they set the cow in motion. Wherever she stepped, there ghee was pressed out; therefore she is called ghee-footed; that is her origin. &lsquo;The Rathantara is invoked with the earth&rsquo;, he says [1]. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he invokes her with food. &lsquo;The Vamadevya is invoked with the atmosphere&rsquo;, he says. The Vamadevya, is cattle; verily he invokes cattle with the atmosphere. &lsquo;The Brhat is invoked with the sky&rsquo;, he says. The Brhat is connected with food; verily he invokes food with the sky. &rsquo; The seven Hotras are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Hotras. &lsquo;The cow is invoked with the bull&rsquo;, he says [2]; verily he invokes a pair. &lsquo;The friend food is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Soma drink. &lsquo;It is invoked; ho!&rsquo; he says; verily he invokes the self, for the self is the best of those invoked. He invokes food, food is cattle; verily he invokes cattle. He invokes four, for cattle are four-footed. &lsquo;Offspring of Manu&rsquo;, he says, for Manu first saw her [3]. &lsquo;Ghee footed&rsquo;, he says. Because ghee was pressed out of her foot, therefore be says thus. &lsquo;Of Mitra and Varuna&rsquo;, he says, for Mitra and Varuna set her in motion. &lsquo;The Brahman, god made, is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the Brahman. &lsquo;The divine Adhvaryus are invoked, the human are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the gods and men. &lsquo;Who shall help this sacrifice and make the lord of the sacrifice prosper&rsquo;, he says [4]; verily he invokes a blessing for the sacrifice and the sacrificer. &lsquo;Sky and earth are invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes sky and earth. &lsquo;Born of yore, the righteous&rsquo;, he says, for they were born of yore and are righteous. &lsquo;Divine, with gods for children&rsquo;, he says, for they are divine and have gods for children. &lsquo;Invoked is this sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes the sacrificer. &lsquo;Invoked in the highest sacrifice, invoked in the greater offering, invoked in the divine abode&rsquo; [5], he says. The highest sacrifice is offspring, the greater offering is cattle, the divine abode</p>
<p>is the world of heaven. (With the words), &lsquo;Thou art this; thou art this&rsquo;, he invokes the dear abode of the sacrifice. &lsquo;All that is dear to it is invoked&rsquo;, he says; verily not vainly does he invoke.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>Food is cattle, he takes it himself; verily by himself he fills his desires of cattle, for no one else can grant him his desire of cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily he delights speech with a share. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas I eat&rsquo;, he says, for completion.&rsquo; (The food) is divided. in four; what is divided in four is the offering, what is divided in four is cattle; if the Hotr were to eat it, the Hotr would [1] experience misfortune; if he were to offer it in the fire, he would give the cattle to Rudra, and the sacrificer would be without cattle. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of speech I eat&rsquo;, he says; verily secretly does he offer it. &lsquo;Thee offered to the lord of the Sadas&rsquo;, he says, for completion. They eat; they eat at a suitable moment; he gives a sacrificial gift; at a suitable moment be gives a gift. They cleave the sacrifice [2], if they eat in the middle. They purify it with water; all the gods are the waters; verily they connect the sacrifice with the gods. The gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice; he pierced the sacrifice, the gods gathered round it (saying), &lsquo;May it be right for us.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Well offered will this be for us, if we propitiate him.&rsquo; That is why Agni is called the &lsquo;well offerer&rsquo; (svistakrt). When it was pierced (by him) [3] they cut off (a piece) of the size of a barleycorn; therefore one should cut off (a piece) the size of a barleycorn. If one were to cut off more, he would confuse that part of the sacrifice. If he were to make a layer and then to sprinkle, lie would make it swell on both sides. He cuts it off and sprinkles it; there are two operations; the sacrificer has two feet, for support. If he were to transfer it (to the Brahman) crosswise, he would pierce the unwounded part of the sacrifice; lie transfers it in front; verily he transfers it in the proper way. They transferred it for Pusan [4]. Pusan having eaten it lost his teeth; therefore Pusan has pounded food for his share, for he has no teeth. The gods said of him, &lsquo;He has lost (his teeth), he is not fit for the offering.&rsquo; They transferred it to Brhaspati. Brhaspati was afraid, &lsquo;Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.&rsquo; He saw this Mantra; &lsquo;With the eye of the sun I gaze on thee&rsquo;, he said, for the eye of the sun harms no one [5]. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I take it.&rsquo; &lsquo;On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pusan I take thee&rsquo;, he says; verily, impelled by Savitr, he took it with the holy power (Brahman) and with the gods. He was afraid, &lsquo;It will harm me as I eat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thee with the mouth of Agni I eat&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the mouth of Agni. He was afraid [6], &lsquo;It will harm me when I have eaten.&rsquo; &lsquo;With the belly of the Brahman&rsquo;, he said, for nothing harms the belly of the Brahman. &lsquo;With the holy power (Brahman) of Brhaspati&rsquo;, (he said), for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). The breaths indeed depart from him who eats this offering; by purifying it with water he grasps the breaths; the breaths are ambrosia, the waters ambrosia; verily he summons the breaths according to their places.</p>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<p>He takes a portion for the Agnidh; verily he delights the seasons whose mouth is Agni. He takes a kindling-stick, for the support of the subsequent offerings; verily he pours on that which has a kindling stick. He rubs the enclosing-sticks; verily he purifies them. He rubs each once, for the sacrifice there is as it were turned away. It makes up four, cattle are four-footed; verily he wins cattle. &lsquo;O Brahman, will we set out?&rsquo; he says; there indeed is the sacrifice placed [1], where the Brahman is; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he commence it. If he were to instigate him with his hand, he would shiver; if with his head, he would have a headache; if he were to sit in silence, the sacrifice would not proceed; he should say, &lsquo;Set out! In speech the sacrifice is placed; where the sacrifice is placed, thence does he bestow it. &lsquo;O god Savitr, that he [2] hath proclaimed to thee&rsquo;, he says, for impelling. &lsquo;Brhaspati is the (priest) Brahman&rsquo;, he says, for he is fullest of the holy power (Brahman). &lsquo;Do thou guard the sacrifice, guard the lord of the sacrifice, guard me&rsquo;, he says; for the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and himself, for these he thus invokes a blessing, to prevent misfortune, Having caused (him) to call out, he says, &lsquo;Utter the verse for sacrifice to the gods.&rsquo; The theologians say, &lsquo;The gods have been sacrificed to; what gods are they?&rsquo; &lsquo;The metres&rsquo;, he should reply, &lsquo;Gayatri Tristubh [3], and Jagati.&rsquo; Then they say, &lsquo;The metres are the Brahmans&rsquo;; verily he sacrifices to them. The deities were sacrificed to by the gods; then Agni did not burn forth; the gods</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>The gods could not find any one to utter the call Svaga at the sacrifice. They spoke to Śamyu Barhaspatya, &lsquo;Perform the Svaga call at this sacrifice for us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Let me choose a boon; if a faithless man sacrifice, or a man sacrifices without prescription, let the blessing of such a sacrificer be mine.&rsquo; Therefore if a faithless man sacrifices, or a man sacrifices without prescription, the blessing of such a sacrifice goes to Śamyu Barhaspatya. &lsquo;That is mine&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;What is to belong to my offspring? [1].&rsquo; &lsquo;Him, who reviles him, he shall fine with a hundred; him, who strikes him, he shall fine with a thousand; he, who draws blood from him, shall not behold the world of the Pitrs for as many years as are the grains of dust which the blood in its fall seizes upon&rsquo;, (they replied). Therefore one should not revile a Brahman, nor strike him, nor draw blood from him; for so great is his sin. &lsquo;That health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he utters the call Svaga, over the sacrifice. &lsquo;That [2] health and wealth we choose&rsquo;, he says; verily he gives Śamyu Barhaspatya his portion. &lsquo;Success to the sacrifice, success to the sacrificer&rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing. He sacrifices to Soma; verily he places seed; he sacrifices to Tvastr; seed is placed and Tvastr moulds forms; he sacrifices to the wives of the gods, to make a pair; he sacrifices to Agni, lord of the house, for support. There is sameness in the sacrifice [3] in that the fore-sacrifices are offered with butter, and the sacrifices to the wives (are offered) with butter. Having repeated the Rc, of the sacrifices to the wives he offers with a Rc, to prevent sameness, and to make a pairing. The sacrifice has a fivefold prelude and a fivefold end; there are offered five fore-sacrifices; there are four sacrifices to the wives, the fifth is the Samistayajus by they make up five as a prelude, and five as an end.</p>

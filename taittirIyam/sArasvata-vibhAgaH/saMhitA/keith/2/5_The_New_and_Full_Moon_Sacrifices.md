### p
The child of the waters hath mounted the lap  
Of the devious ones, rising up and clothed in the lightning;  
Bearing his highest greatness  
The golden-coloured young ones go about.
### q
Some [1] meet, some go up,  
The streams fill their common stall;  
Round the pure shining son of the waters

The pure waters stand.
### r
The austere maidens, go around the youth;  
The waters, making him clean;  
Agni shineth forth with pure radiance with wealth,  
Unkindled, butter-clad in the waters.

Of Mitra and Varuna, joint kings;  
May they be gracious to such as I.

To us, O Mitra and Varuna.

Best sacrificer, best of bearers, radiant,  
Free us from every foe.
### x
Do thou, O Agni, be nearest to us,  
Closest to help, at the dawning of this dawn;  
Appease for us by sacrifice Varuna [3], bestowing (on him); Show thy mercy and be ready to hear our call.
### y
Far-famed is this Agni of Bharata,  
Since his great light shineth like the sun;  
He who overcame Puru in battle,  
Hath shone forth, the heavenly guest, propitious for us.
### z
I sacrifice to thee, I cast forward my prayer to thee,  
That thou mayst be invoked at our invocation;  
Thou art like a well in the desert,  
Thou, O Agni, to the man eager to worship, O ancient king [4]. aa With his lustre.  
bb With light.  
cc Agni, with thy front,  
Burn the sorceresses,  
Shining in the broad dwellings.  
dd Thee of fair face, of fair look, the rapid one,  
The wiser, let us ignorant people follow;  
Let him sacrifice who knoweth all the ways,  
Let him proclaim the oblation among the immortals.  
ee To the freer from trouble.  
ff Which hath entered me.  
gg Away for us, O Indra.  
hh O Indra, might.  
ii Powers, O Śatakratu.  
kk To thee hath been given.

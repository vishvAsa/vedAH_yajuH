The younger son of an Edinburgh lawyer, and brother of the administrator in Burma Sir William John Keith, Arthur Berriedale Keith was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh before going on to study at Balliol College, Oxford. He was called to the English bar and served in the Colonial Office for fourteen years before being appointed to the Regius Chair of Sanskrit in 1914. He made great contributions to Vedic and classical Sanskrit scholarship, and was called in to advise the Government during the abdication crisis in 1936.

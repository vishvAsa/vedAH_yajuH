      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;01&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prajapati desired, &amp;lsquo;May I create offspring.&amp;rsquo; He did penance, he created serpents. He desired, &amp;lsquo;May I create offspring.&amp;rsquo; He did penance a second time, he created birds. He desired, &amp;lsquo;May I create offspring.&amp;rsquo; He did penance a third time, he saw this speech of the consecrated, he spoke it. Then indeed did he create offspring. In that after undergoing penance he speaks the speech of the consecrated, the sacrificer thus [1] creates offspring. If one who is consecrated sees anything impure, the consecration departs from him; his dark colour, his beauty goes away. &amp;lsquo;Mind unbound; eye weak; sun best of lights; O consecration, forsake me not&amp;rsquo;, he says, and consecration departs not from him, his dark colour and his beauty go not away. If rain falls on one who is consecrated, the heavenly waters if unappeased destroy his force, might, consecration [2], and penance. &amp;lsquo;Do ye flowing waters place might (in me), place force, place might; do not destroy my consecration, nor my penance&amp;rsquo;, he says; verily he places all that in himself; they do not destroy his force, might, consecration, or penance. Agni is the divinity of the consecrated man, and he is concealed as it were from him, when he goes (out), and the Raksases are able to hurt him [3]. &amp;lsquo;From good to better do thou advance; may Brhaspati be thy forerunner&amp;rsquo;, he says. Brhaspati is the holy power (Brahman) of the gods; verily he grasps hold of him, and he brings him safely through. &amp;lsquo;Here we have come (a idam) to the place on earth for sacrifice to the gods&amp;rsquo;, he says, for he comes to the place on earth for sacrifice, who sacrifices. &amp;lsquo;Wherein aforetime all the gods rejoiced&amp;rsquo;, he says, for all the gods delight in it, in that the Brahmans so do. &amp;lsquo;Accomplishing (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus&amp;rsquo;, he says, for he who sacrifices accomplishes (the rite) with Rc, Saman, and Yajus. &amp;lsquo;Let us rejoice in fullness of wealth, in sustenance&amp;rsquo;, he says; verily he invokes this blessing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;iii. 2. 1. He who sacrifices knowing the &amp;lsquo;ascent&amp;rsquo; verses of the Pavamana (Stotras) mounts on the Pavamanas and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. &amp;lsquo;Thou art the hawk, with the Gayatri for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the Jagati for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety&amp;rsquo;, he says. These [1] are the ascents of the Pavamanas; he who knowing thus these sacrifices mounts on the Pavamanas, and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. He who knows the continuity of the Pavamana lives all his days; he does not die before his time; be becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring. The Pavamana cups are drawn off, but these are not drawn off by him, the wooden vessel, the stirring-vessel, and the vessel which holds the purified Soma. If he were to begin (the Stotra) without drawing them off, he would split the Pavamana [2], and with its being split the breath of the Adhvaryu would be split. &amp;lsquo;Thou art taken with a support; to Prajapati thee!&amp;rsquo;, (with these words) he should rub the wooden vessel; &amp;rsquo;to Indra thee!&amp;rsquo;, (with these words) the stirring-vessel; &amp;rsquo;to the All-gods thee!&amp;rsquo;, (with these words) the vessel which holds the purified Soma verily he renders continuous the Pavamana, he lives all his days; he does not die before his time; he becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;01&#34;&gt;01&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sacrifice of him whose offering is too large is unsuccessful; &amp;lsquo;Surya, the god, for those that sit in the sky&amp;rsquo;, he says; verily with the aid of Brhaspati and Prajapati he makes good the deficiency in the sacrifice. Now the Raksases infest the victim if it being offered to one deity is greater (than normal); &amp;lsquo;Thou who hast a tawny embryo&amp;rsquo;, he says; verily he sends it to the gods, to smite away the Raksases. &amp;lsquo;Bring near, O bringer&amp;rsquo;, he says [1]; verily with the holy power he brings it. &amp;lsquo;I split apart thy urinator&amp;rsquo;, he says; that is according to the text. &amp;lsquo;The drop, far extending, of all forms&amp;rsquo;, he says; the drop is offspring and cattle; verily with offspring and cattle he unites him. To the sky the deficiency&lt;/p&gt;</description>

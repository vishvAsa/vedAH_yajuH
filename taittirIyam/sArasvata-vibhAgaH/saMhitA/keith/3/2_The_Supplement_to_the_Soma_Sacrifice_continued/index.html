  <p>iii. 2. 1. He who sacrifices knowing the &lsquo;ascent&rsquo; verses of the Pavamana (Stotras) mounts on the Pavamanas and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. &lsquo;Thou art the hawk, with the Gayatri for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the eagle, with the Tristubh for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety. Thou art the vulture, with the Jagati for thy metre; I grasp thee; bring me over in safety&rsquo;, he says. These [1] are the ascents of the Pavamanas; he who knowing thus these sacrifices mounts on the Pavamanas, and is not cut off from the Pavamanas. He who knows the continuity of the Pavamana lives all his days; he does not die before his time; be becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring. The Pavamana cups are drawn off, but these are not drawn off by him, the wooden vessel, the stirring-vessel, and the vessel which holds the purified Soma. If he were to begin (the Stotra) without drawing them off, he would split the Pavamana [2], and with its being split the breath of the Adhvaryu would be split. &lsquo;Thou art taken with a support; to Prajapati thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) he should rub the wooden vessel; &rsquo;to Indra thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) the stirring-vessel; &rsquo;to the All-gods thee!&rsquo;, (with these words) the vessel which holds the purified Soma verily he renders continuous the Pavamana, he lives all his days; he does not die before his time; he becomes rich in cattle; he obtains offspring.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p>In that he makes it swell, it has a stalk (of the Soma); in that he presses it out, it has the lees (of the Soma); verily he makes all the pressings have stalks and pure Soma, and be of equal strength.<br>
Two oceans are there extended, unperishing;<br>
They revolve in turns like the waves in the bosom of the sea;<br>
Seeing they pass over one of them,<br>
Seeing not [1] they pass over the other with a bridge.<br>
Two garments continuous one weareth;<br>
With locks, knowing all the worlds;<br>
He goeth in secret clad in the dark;<br>
He putteth on his bright robe abandoning that of the worn-out one.<br>
Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice the Asuras did. The gods saw this great sacrifice, they extended it, they performed the Agnihotra as the vow; therefore one should perform the vow twice, for twice they offer the Agnihotra. They performed the full moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni and Soma [2]. They performed the new moon rite, as the animal sacrifice to Agni. They performed the sacrifice to the All-gods as the morning pressing. They performed the Varunapraghasas, as the midday pressing. They performed the Sakamedhas, the sacrifice to the fathers, and the offering to Tryambaka, as the third pressing. The Asuras sought to follow their</p>
<p>sacrifice, but could not get on its tracks. They said, &lsquo;These gods have become inviolable (adhvartavyah). That is why the sacrifice (adhvara) is inviolable. Then the gods prospered, the Asuras were defeated. He who knowing thus offers the Soma, prospers himself, the enemy is defeated.</p>

<p>When he creeps forward to the seat [4], the fathers creep along after him; they have power to injure him; having crept to the seat he should look along the south side (saying), &lsquo;Come, O ye fathers; through you may I possess the fathers; may ye have good offspring in me&rsquo;; verily paying reverence to them he creeps to the Sadas, for his own safety.</p>

<p>Thou art the milk of the great ones, the body of the All-gods; may I to-day accomplish the cup of the speckled ones; thou art the cup of the speckled ones; thou art the heart of Visnu, once hath Visnu stepped apart along thee, O vigorous one; with curds and ghee may prosperity be increased; may wealth come to me from this which is offered and enjoyed thou art the light for all men, milked from the dappled one.</p>
<h3 id="b-2">b</h3>
<p>As great as are sky and earth in mightiness,<br>
As great as the expense of the seven rivers,<br>
So great is the cup of thee, O Indra [1],<br>
Which unvanquished I draw off with strength.<br>
If a black bird touch the speckled butter, his slaves would be likely to die; if a dog touch it, his fourfooted cattle would be likely to die; if it were to be spilt, the sacrificer would be likely to die. The speckled butter is the cattle; his cattle fall, if his speckled butter falls; in that he takes again the speckled butter, he takes again cattle for him. The speckled butter is the breath; his breath [2] falls, if his speckled butter falls; in that he takes again the speckled butter, he takes again breath for him. He takes it after placing gold (in the ladle), gold is immortality, the speckled butter is the breath; verily he places immortality in his breath. It is of a hundred measures, man has a hundred years of life, a hundred powers; verily on life and power he rests. He makes a horse sniff it, the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily from his own place of origin he fashions offspring for him. His sacrifice is broken whose speckled butter is spilt. He takes it again with a Rc addressed to Visnu; Visnu is the sacrifice; verily he unites the sacrifice by the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Either the sacrifice [2] milks the lord of the sacrifice, or the lord of the sacrifice milks the sacrifice. Him, who sacrifices not knowing the milking of the Stotra and the Śastra, the sacrifice milks, he after sacrificing becomes worse; he, who knowing the milking of these two sacrifices, milks the sacrifice; he after sacrificing becomes better. &lsquo;The praised of the praised art thou, may the praised milk strength for me, may the praised of the praised come to me. The Śastra, of the Śastra thou art, may the Śastra milk strength for me, may the Śastra of the Śastra come to me&rsquo;, he says; this is the milking of the Stotra and the Śastra; he who sacrifices knowing thus milks the sacrifice, and by sacrificing becomes better.</p>

<p>In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunder bolt advance towards him; &lsquo;O reciter of hymns&rsquo;, he says in response at the morning pressing; the syllables herein are three, the Gayatri has three Padas, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily with the Gayatri he places the thunderbolt within the morning pressing. &lsquo;The hymn hath been uttered&rsquo;, he says in response at the midday pressing; the syllables herein are four, the Tristubh has four Padas, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh; verily with the Tristubh he places the thunderbolt within the midday pressing [1]. &lsquo;The hymn hath been uttered to Indra&rsquo;, he says in response at the third pressing; the syllables herein are seven, the Śakvari has seven Padas, the thunder bolt is connected with the Śakvari; verily with the thunderbolt he places the thunderbolt within the third pressing. The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would be an Adhvaryu who should produce the metres in</p>
<p>the responses according to the pressings; he would bestow brilliance upon himself at the morning pressing, power at the midday pressing, and cattle at the third pressing.&rsquo; &lsquo;O reciter of hymns&rsquo;, he says in response at the morning pressing; the syllables herein are three, [2], the Gayatri has three Padas, the morning pressing is connected with the Gayatri; verily at the morning pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Gayatri is brilliance, the morning pressing is brilliance; verily at the morning pressing he bestows brilliance upon himself. &lsquo;The hymn hath been uttered&rsquo;, he says in response at the midday pressing; the syllables herein are four, the Tristubh has four Padas, the midday pressing is connected with the Tristubh; verily at the midday pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Tristubh is power, the midday pressing is power [3]; verily at the midday pressing he bestows power upon himself. &lsquo;The hymn hath been uttered to Indra&rsquo;, he says in response at the third pressing; the syllables herein are seven, the Śakvari has seven Padas, cattle are connected with the Śakvari, the third pressing is connected with the Jagati; verily at the third pressing he produces the metres in the response; now the Jagati is cattle, the third pressing is cattle; verily at the third pressing he bestows cattle upon himself that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he puts fear in him; if be were not to smite it off [4], they would have fear in his house before the year (was over). &lsquo;Recite, let us two rejoice&rsquo;,&rsquo; he responds, and thereby he smites it off. Just as one looks for the exact interval, so the Adhvaryu looks for the response. If he were to respond in advance, that would be as when one goes to meets the exact interval. If the (response) were to be omitted after the half-verse, that would be as when one is left behind those that are running. The Udgithas are similar for the priests, the Udgitha for the Udgatrs, [5], the Rces and the Pranavas for the singers of hymns, the response for the Adhvaryus. He, who knowing thus responds, becomes an eater of food, a strong one is born among his offspring. The Hotr is this (earth), the Adhvaryu yonder (sky); in that he recites sitting, so the Hotr goes not away from the (earth), for this (earth) is seated as it were; verily thereby the sacrifice milks this (earth). In that he responds standing, so the Adhvaryu goes not away from yonder (sky) [6], for yonder (sky) stands as it were; verily thereby the sacrificer milks yonder (sky). In that he recites sitting, therefore the gods live on that which is given hence; in that he responds standing, therefore men live on what is given thence. In that he recites seated towards the east, and he responds standing towards the west, therefore seed is impregnated in front, offspring are born behind. In that the Hotr addresses the Adhvaryu, he makes the thunderbolt advance towards him; he turns towards the West; verily he overcomes the thunderbolt.</p>

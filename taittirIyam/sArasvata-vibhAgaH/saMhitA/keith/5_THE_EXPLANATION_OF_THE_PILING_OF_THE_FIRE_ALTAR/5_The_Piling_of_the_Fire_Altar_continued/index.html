<p>In that he completes (the sacrifice) with one animal, (it is) for the continuity of the sacrifice and to avoid cutting it in two. The male animals belong to Indra; in that being Indra&rsquo;s they are offered to the fires, he causes strife among the deities. He should use Tristubh verses, appertaining to Agni, for the Yajyas and Anuvakyas; in that they appertain to Agni, (the verses) are Agni&rsquo;s, in that they are Tristubhs (they are) Indra&rsquo;s; (verily they serve) for prosperity; he does not cause strife among the deities. To Vayu of the team he offers a hornless (animal); Vayu is the brilliance of Agni; it is offered to brilliance; therefore wheresoever the wind [1] blows, the fire burns; verily it follows its own brilliance. If he were not to offer to him of the team, the sacrificer would go mad; (an offering) is made to him of the team, to prevent the sacrificer going mad. The Yajya and the Anuvakya, contain (the words) &lsquo;wind&rsquo; and &lsquo;white&rsquo;, to secure brilliance. &lsquo;The golden germ first arose&rsquo;, (with these words) he pours out the butter portion; the golden germ is Prajapati; (verily it serves) for likeness to Prajapati. This (animal) is slain to make up all forms of animals; its hairs are [2] the form of man, its lack of horns that of horses, the possession of one set of incisors only that of cows, the sheep-like</p>
<p>hooves that of sheep, that it is a goat, that is the form of goats. The wind is the abode dear to cattle; in that it is offered to Vayu, in accord cattle wait upon him. &lsquo;Should an animal be offered to Vayu, or to Prajapati?&rsquo; they say; if he were to offer it to Vayu, he would depart from Prajapati; if he were<br>
to offer it to Prajapati, he would depart from Vayu [3]; in that the animal is offered to Vayu, therefore he does not depart; in that a cake is offered to Prajapati, therefore he does not depart from Prajapati; in that it is offered on twelve potsherds, therefore he does not depart from Vaiśvanara. When about to consecrate himself, he offers to Agni and Visnu on eleven potsherds; all the deities are Agni; the sacrifice is Visnu; verily he lays hold of the deities and the sacrifice; Agni is the lowest of the deities, Visnu the highest; in that he offers to Agni and Visnu on eleven potsherds, the sacrificer envelops the gods [4] on both sides and wins them. By the cake the gods prospered in yonder world, by the oblation in this; he who desires, &lsquo;May I prosper in yonder world&rsquo;, should offer a cake; verily he prospers in yonder world. In that it is offered on eight pot sherds, it is connected with Agni, in that it is offered on three potsherds, it is connected with Visnu; (verily it serves) for prosperity. He who desires, &lsquo;May I prosper in the world&rsquo;, should offer an oblation; the ghee belongs to Agni, the rice grains to Visnu, therefore [5] an oblation should be offered; verily he prospers in this world. It is (an offering) to Aditi; Aditi is this (earth); verily he finds support in this (earth); verily also be extends the sacrifice over this. He who piles the fire without keeping it in the pan for a year-(it is with him) as when an embryo is dropped prematurely would go to ruin; he should offer before (the others) on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvanara; Agni Vaiśvanara is the year; even as (an embryo) attaining a year&rsquo;s growth [61 is born when the due season&rsquo; is come, so he having obtained the year when the due season is come, piles the fire; he goes not to ruin. Vaiśvanara is the form dear to Agni; verily he wins the form dear to him. These offerings are three; these worlds are three; (verily they serve) for the mounting of these worlds.</p>

<p>Prajapati after creating creatures in affection entered into them; from them he could not emerge; he said, &lsquo;He shall prosper who shall pile me again hence.&rsquo; The gods piled him; then they prospered; in that they piled him, that is why the piling has its name. He who knowing thus piles the fire is prosperous. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I be possessed of the fire&rsquo; [1], (with this aim) is the fire piled; verily be becomes possessed of the fire. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May the gods know me&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; the gods know him. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I have a house&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; verily he becomes possessed of a house. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May I be rich in cattle&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire [2] piled; verily he becomes rich in cattle. &lsquo;For what good is the fire piled?&rsquo; they say. &lsquo;May the seven men live upon me&rsquo;, (with this hope) is the fire piled; three before, three behind, the self the seventh; so many live upon him in yonder world. Prajapati desired to pile the fire; to him spake earth; &lsquo;Thou shalt not pile the fire on me; thou wilt burn me excessively, and I being burned excessively will shake you apart [3]; thou wilt fall into a sorry state.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;So shall I act that it will not burn thee excessively.&rsquo; He stroked it, (saying), &lsquo;May Prajapati seat thee; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm&rsquo;; verily making this a brick he put it down, to prevent excessive burning. That on which he is to pile the fire he should stroke, (saying), &lsquo;May Prajapati seat thee; with that deity in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm&rsquo; [4]; verily making this a brick he sets it down to prevent excessive burning. Prajapati desired, &lsquo;Let me be propagated&rsquo;, he saw this (fire) in the pan, he bore it for a year, then was he propagated. Therefore for a year must it be borne, then is he propagated. To him the Vasus said, &lsquo;Thou hast been propagated; let us be propagated.&rsquo; He gave it to the Vasus, they bore it for three days, thereby [5] they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for three days; verily is he propagated. To them the Rudras said, &lsquo;Ye have been propagated, let us be propagated.&rsquo; They gave it to the Rudras; they bore it for six days, thereby they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for six days; verily is he propagated. To them the Adityas said, &lsquo;Ye have been propagated; let us [6] be propagated&rsquo;. They gave it to the Adityas, they bore it for twelve days, thereby they created three hundred, three and thirty; therefore should it be borne for twelve days; verily is he propagated. Thereby they created a thousand, the pan being the thousandth; he who knows thus the pan as the thousandth obtains a thousand cattle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;With a Yajus it is made, with a Yajus it is cooked, with a Yajus it is set loose, this pan; it is therefore exhausted, it cannot be used again&rsquo;, they say. &lsquo;O Agni, yoke thy (steeds)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yoke them that best invoke the gods&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers in the pan; verily he yokes it again and thereby is it not exhausted. He, who yokes Agni where the yoking is to be performed, yokes him (best) among those who are yoking. &lsquo;O Agni [1], yoke thy (steeds)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yoke them that best invoke the gods&rsquo;, he says;&rsquo; this is the yoking of Agni; verily he yokes him, and yokes him (best) among those who are yoking. The theologians say, &lsquo;Should the fire be piled up with face down, or face upwards?&rsquo; Now the fire is piled in the likeness of birds; if he were to pile it face downward, the libations would reach it behind; if upwards, it could not fly, it would not be heavenly for him; he puts down the human head towards the east, face upwards [2]; verily the libations reach it in the mouth; he does not pile it face upwards; verily it is heavenly for him. He offers with (a verse) addressed to Surya; verily he bestows sight upon it; twice he offers, for there are two eyes; he offers with the same verse, for sight is the same, for prosperity. The gods and the Asuras were in conflict, they deposited their desirable wealth; the gods appropriated it by means of the Vamabhrt (brick); that is why the Vamabhrt (supporting the desirable) has its name. In that he puts down the Vamabhrt, the sacrificer by it appropriates the desirable wealth of his foe. It has a head of gold; gold is light, the desirable is light; verily by light he appropriates the desirable which is light; there are two Yajuses, for support.</p>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<p>The waters were the wives of Varuna; Agni longed for them, he had union with them; his seed fell away, it became this (earth); what second fell away became yonder (sky); this is the Viraj, yonder the Svaraj; in that he puts down two Viraj (bricks) he puts down these two (worlds). Now the seed<br>
which yonder (sky) impregnates, finds support in this (earth), it is propagated, it becomes plants [1] and shoots; them the fire eats. He who knows thus is propagated, and becomes an eater of food. If a man be full of seed, one should put both down in the first layer for him; verily these in accord pour<br>
seed for him; if a man have poured his seed, he should put one in the first layer for him and one in the last; verily he encloses by the two (worlds) the seed he has impregnated. For a year to no man [2] should he descend in honour; for these two (worlds) descend in honour for no man; that is their rule. He who piles the fire without a head, becomes headless in yonder world, he who piles it with a head becomes possessed of a head in yonder world. &lsquo;To thought I offer with mind, with ghee, that the gods may come hither, delighting in the offerings, increasing holy order; on the path of the moving ocean I offer all the days to Viśvakarman the undying oblation&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the naturally perforated brick and offers [3]; that is the head of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its head. He becomes possessed of a head in yonder world who know thus. The fire is piled for the world of heaven; whatever is done out of order, that is not heavenly; the fire is heavenly; having put down the layer he should stroke it, (saying), &lsquo;May the wise discern wisdom and folly, like backs straight and crooked, like men; for wealth and good offspring, O god, grant us freedom, and keep bondage from us.&rsquo; Verily he puts it down in order. He piles (the fire) facing east; it becomes heavenly for him.</p>

<p>Viśvakarman, lord of the quarters, may he protect our cattle, may he protect us, to him homage! Prajapati; Rudra; Varuna; Agni; lord of the quarters; may he protect our cattle, may he protect us, to him homage!&rsquo;<br>
These are the deities, overlords of these animals; to them he is cut off who puts down the heads of the animals. He puts down the gold bricks; verily he pays honour to these deities. The theologians [1] say, &lsquo;In the fire he places the domesticated animals, with pain he afflicts the wild animals; what<br>
then does he leave?&rsquo; In that he puts down the golden bricks, and gold is immortality, by immortality he makes healing for the domesticated animals, he hurts them not. The first naturally perforated brick is expiration, the second cross -breathing, the third inspiration. Having put down the first naturally perforated brick he should breathe out along it; verily he unites expiration with expiration;</p>
<p>having put down the second [2] he should breathe across; verily he unites cross-breathing with cross-breathing; having put down the third, he should breathe in; verily he unites inspiration with inspiration; verily he kindles him with the breaths. &lsquo;Bhuh, Bhuvah, Suvar&rsquo;, (with these words) he puts down the naturally perforated bricks; the naturally perforated bricks are these worlds; with these exclamations Prajapati was propagated; in that he puts down the naturally perforated bricks with these exclamations, he puts down these worlds, and over these [3] worlds he is propagated. For expiration, for cross-breathing, for inspiration; for speech thee; for sight thee; with that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm. By Agni the gods sought to go to the world of heaven, with him they could not fly; they saw these four naturally perforated bricks, they put them down in the quarters, with him with eyes on all sides they went to the world of heaven. In that he puts down four naturally perforated bricks in the quarters, the sacrificer with Agni with eyes on all sides goes to the world of heaven.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Agni, we exalt the praise&rsquo;, he says; verily he exalts him.<br>
These are the forms of the days [1]; verily each day he piles him, and wins the forms of the days. The theologians say, &lsquo;For what reason are other bricks exhausted, the space-filler not?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because it is connected with Indra and Agni and with Brhaspati&rsquo;, he should say, for Indra and Agni and Brhaspati are those among the gods who are not exhausted. It has a follower to avoid monotony. He follows it with an Anustubh; the space filler is the body, the Anustubh the breath; therefore breath comes through all the limbs. &lsquo;They of him, streaming with milk&rsquo; [2], he says; therefore there is sap in every joint; &rsquo;the dappled mix the Soma&rsquo;, he says; the dappled (cow) is food; verily he wins food; Agni is praise, food is praise; verily he wins food; &rsquo;the clans in the birthplace of the gods, in the three realms of sky&rsquo;, he says; verily he makes these worlds full of light for him. He who knows the support of the bricks finds support. &lsquo;With that deity, in the manner of Angiras, do thou sit firm,&rsquo; he says; this is the support of the bricks; he who knows thus finds support.</p>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<p>The fire is piled up for the world of heaven; the set of eleven stakes is a thunderbolt; if he were to set up eleven stakes in the fire, he would shut it off from the world of heaven with the thunderbolt; if he were not to set it up, he would sever the animals from the chips; one stake he sets up; verily he does not shut it off from the world of heaven, nor sever the animals from the chips. He who piling the fire steps down on it is deprived of power and strength; he should, with a verse addressed to Indra [1], put down a brick opposite his step; verily he is not deprived of power and strength. The fire is Rudra, his are three missiles, one that comes straight on, one that strikes transversely, and one that follows up. To them he is cut off who piles the fire; having piled the fire he should give (a bow) with three arrows to a Brahman, unasked; verily to them he pays homage, and also he ransoms himself from them.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, in the east [2], may the wind blow after it for thee, to thee, O Rudra, with the year I pay homage.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, on the south, may the wind blow after it for thee, to thee, O Rudra, with the full year I pay homage.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, on the west, may the wind blow after it for thee, to thee, O Rudra, with the Ida year I pay homage.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, on the north, may the wind blow after it for thee [3], to thee, O Rudra, with the Idu year I pay homage.<br>
The bow of thine, O Rudra, above, may the wind blow after it for thee, to thee, O Rudra, with the year I pay homage.</p>
<p>Agni is Rudra; just as a tiger stands in anger, so he also (stands); when piled with these he reverences him; verily with homage he soothes him.<br>
The fires [4] of the dust<br>
That have entered within the earth,<br>
Of them thou art the highest;<br>
Do thou instigate us to life.<br>
&lsquo;Thee, O Agni, with the mind have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the fervour have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the consecration have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the observances have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the pressing-day have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the sacrificial fees have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the concluding bath have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the barren cow have I obtained; thee, O Agni, with the cry of Godspeed I have I obtained&rsquo;, he says; I this is the obtaining of Agni verily therewith he obtains him.</p>

<p>He pays reverence in front with the Gayatra (Saman); verily he confers breath upon him. (He reverences) the wings with the Brhat and the Rathantara; verily he confers might upon him. (He reverences) the tail with the seasonal Yajñayajñiya; verily he finds support in the seasons. He pays reverence with the Prstha (Stotras); the Prsthas are brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon him. Prajapati created Agni; he, created, went away from him; him he checked (avarayata) by the Varavantiya, and that is why the Varavantiya has it name. By the Śyaita he congealed him, and that is why the Śyaita has its name [1]. In that he reverences, with the Varavantiya, he restrains him, and by the Śyaita he congeals him. At the joinings of the wings he reverences with the heart of Prajapati; verily he attains his affection.<br>
With the eastern quarter I place thee, with the Gayatri metre, with Agni as the deity; with the head of Agni I put down the head of Agni.<br>
With the southern quarter I place thee, with the Tristubh metre, with Indra as the deity; with the wing of Agni I put down the wing of Agni.<br>
With the western quarter I place thee [2], with the Jagati metre, with Savitr as the deity; with the tail of Agni I put down the tail of Agni.<br>
With the northern quarter I place thee, with the Anustubh metre, with Mitra and Varuna as the deity; with the wing of Agni I put down the wing of Agni.<br>
With the upright quarter I place thee, with the Pankti metre, with Brhaspati as the deity, with the back of Agni I put down the back of Agni.<br>
He who piles the fire without its body is without a body in yonder world; he who piles it with its body is with his body in yonder world. He puts down the body bricks; this is the body of the fire; verily he piles the fire with its body; he has his body in yonder world who knows thus.</p>

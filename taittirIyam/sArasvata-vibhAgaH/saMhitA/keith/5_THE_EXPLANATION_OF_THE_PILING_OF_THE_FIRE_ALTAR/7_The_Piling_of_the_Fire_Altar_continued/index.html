<p>&lsquo;He who piles the fire without regard to the deity falls a victim to the deities; he becomes poorer; he who (piles it) according to the deity does not fall a victim to the deities; he becomes richer. With a Gayatri (verse) addressed to Agni should he stroke the first layer; with a Tristubh the second; with a Jagati the third; with an Anustubh the fourth; with a Pankti the fifth; verily he piles the fire according to the deity. He falls not a victim to the deities; he becomes richer. This is the dividing of the sacrificial food; the food is cattle, and he piles it with cattle [1].</p>
<h3 id="b">b</h3>
<p>He who piles the fire after announcing to Prajapati does not go to ruin. The horses should stand on either side, on the left the black, on the right the white; having offered them he should put down the bricks; that is the form of Prajapati, the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily having announced to Prajapati in real presence he piles the fire, he does not go to ruin; the white horse is the form of day, the black of night; the bricks are the form of day [2], the mortar of night; when about to put down the bricks he should stroke the white horse, when about to put down the mortar he should</p>
<p>stroke the black; verily with the days and nights he piles it.</p>
<h3 id="c">c</h3>
<p>A golden vessel full of honey he gives, (saying), &lsquo;May I be possessed of honey&rsquo;; with (a verse) addressed to Surya, containing the word &lsquo;brilliant&rsquo;, he should gaze (on it); verily it becomes brilliant in the midday; he causes the horse to sniff it; Indra is yonder sun, Prajapati is he; the horse is connected with Prajapati; verily he wins him straightway.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<h3 id="a-1">a</h3>
<p>To thee, O Agni, the bull, the wise,<br>
I have come, generating thee ever new;<br>
Be our household rites not halting;<br>
With thy keen holy power sharpen us.<br>
The bricks are cattle, in each layer he puts down a bull (brick); verily in his sacrifice he makes a pairing for propagation; therefore in every herd there is a bull.</p>
<h3 id="b-1">b</h3>
<p>The image of the year<br>
Which men revere in thee, O night,<br>
Making his offspring rich in heroes,<br>
May he obtain all life.<br>
He puts down this Prajapati (brick) [1]; the sole eighth day is this (earth); in that food is made on the sole eighth day, he wins it thereby; this is the wish cow of Prajapati; verily by it the sacrificer in yonder world milks the fire.</p>
<h3 id="c-1">c</h3>
<p>With the light wherewith the gods went upward,<br>
Wherewith the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras,<br>
Wherewith the Angirases attained greatness,<br>
With that let the sacrificer go in prosperity.<br>
The fire is piled for the world of heaven [2]; (with the words) With the light wherewith the gods went upwards&rsquo;, he lights the fire in the pan; verily he puts down the bricks connected with the trees, to win the world of heaven.</p>
<h3 id="d">d</h3>
<p>(Homage) to the hundred-weaponed, him of a hundred powers,<br>
Him of a hundred aids, the overcomer of hostility,<br>
To Indra who shall lead us over all obstacles<br>
Through autumns without fail.</p>
<h3 id="e">e</h3>
<p>The four paths going to the gods<br>
Which stretch between sky and earth,<br>
To him, O gods, do ye all accord us<br>
Who brought to them unfailing power and untirelessness [3].</p>
<h3 id="f">f</h3>
<p>Summer, winter, and spring for us,<br>
Autumn, the rains be favourable for us;<br>
May we enjoy the favour and protection<br>
Of these seasons through a hundred autumns.</p>
<h3 id="g">g</h3>
<p>To the Idu year, the complete year, the year<br>
Pay ye honour great;<br>
In their lovingkindness that are worthy of sacrifice<br>
May we long be unfailing, unsmitten.</p>
<h3 id="h">h</h3>
<p>Better than good have the gods brought together;<br>
With thee as aid may we win thee;<br>
Do thou, wonder-working, O drop [4], enter us,<br>
Be propitious and kindly to our children, our descendants.</p>
<h3 id="i">i</h3>
<p>He puts down these unfailing (bricks), they are the gods unconquered; verily he enters them; he is not conquered.</p>
<h3 id="k">k</h3>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since the months, the half-months, the seasons, the years cook the plants, then why is the offering of first-fruits made to other deities?&rsquo; The gods conquered these (plants); if he were to offer to the seasons, he would cause strife with the gods; having offered the offering of first-fruits, he offers these libations; verily he delights the half-months, the months, the seasons, the year; he does not cause strife with the gods. &lsquo;Better than good have the gods brought together&rsquo;, he says, for the eating of the offering, to prevent the defeat of the sacrificer.</p>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<h3 id="a-2">a</h3>
<p>Thou art the thunderbolt of Indra, slaying foes;<br>
Guarding our bodies, lying in wait;<br>
He who in east, south, west,<br>
In the north, as a foe plots against us,<br>
May he strike on this rock.<br>
The gods and the Asuras were in conflict; the Asuras sought to force them from the quarters; the gods repelled them with arrow and thunder bolt; in that he puts down the thunderbolt (bricks), he repels his foes with arrow and thunderbolt; in the quarters [1] he puts down; verily he puts round him those citadels of the gods, which guard the body.</p>
<h3 id="b-2">b</h3>
<p>O Agni and Visnu,<br>
May these songs gladden you in unison;<br>
Come ye with radiance and strength.<br>
The theologians say, &lsquo;Since they do not offer to any deity, then what deity has the stream of wealth?&rsquo; Wealth is Agni, this stream is his; wealth is Visnu, this stream is his; with a verse addressed to Agni and Visnu he offers the stream of wealth; verily he unites them with their proper portions; verily also [2] he makes this libation to have an abode; he wins that for desire of which he makes this offering. The fire is Rudra; now two are his bodies, the dread the one, the auspicious the other; in that he offers the Śatarudriya, he soothes with it his dread form; in that he offers the stream of wealth, he delights with it his auspicious form. He, who knows the support of the stream of wealth [3], finds support. If there is any butter left over, in it he should cook a mess for the Brahmans, four Brahmans should eat it; the Brahman is Agni Vaiśvanara, Vaiśvanara, is the form dear to Agni; verily he establishes it in his dear form. He should give four cows; verily with them the sacrificer in yonder world milks the fire.</p>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<h3 id="a-3">a</h3>
<p>&lsquo;To thought I offer with mind, with ghee&rsquo;, he says; the oblation to Viśvakarman is called the undeceivable; the foe cannot deceive him who has piled; verily also he wins the gods.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Agni, to-day&rsquo;, (with these words) he offers with a Pankti verse, and by the Pankti and the libation he grasps the beginning of the sacrifice.<br>
C &lsquo;Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni; seven thy tongues&rsquo;, he says; verily he wins the Hotr&rsquo;s offices. Agni went away from the gods, desiring a portion [1]; to him they assigned this as a portion; that is the Agnihotra, of Agni; then is he born indeed when he is completely piled. Verily to him on birth he gives food; he delighted delights him, he becomes richer.</p>
<h3 id="d-1">d</h3>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since it is as the Garhapatya that (the fire) is piled, then where is its Ahavaniya?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yonder sun&rsquo;, he should reply, for in it they offer to all the gods [2]. He who knowing thus piles the fire straightway makes pleased the gods.</p>
<h3 id="e-1">e</h3>
<p>O Agni, the glorious, lead him to glory;<br>
Bring hither the fame that is Indra&rsquo;s;<br>
May he be head, overlord, resplendent,<br>
Most famed of his equals.<br>
With look auspicious first they underwent<br>
Fervour and consecration, the seers who found the heavenly light;</p>
<p>Thence was born the kingly power, might and force;<br>
May the gods in unison accord that to us.<br>
Disposer, ordainer, and highest [3] onlooker,<br>
Prajapati, supreme lord, the ruler;<br>
The Stomas, the metres, the Nivids, mine they call;<br>
To him may we secure the kingdom.<br>
Turn towards me, come to me;<br>
May he be your ruler, your overlord;<br>
On his discernment do ye depend;<br>
Upon him henceforth do ye all serve.<br>
He puts down these supporters of the realm; this is the realm supporting piling of the fire; verily with it he bestows on him the kingly power, he becomes the kingly power, the kingly power does not fall away from him.</p>

<p>Just as a son born dies, so dies he whose fire in the pan is extinguished. If he were to make it by friction, he would divide (the fire), he would produce a foe for him. It must again be kindled (with wood) around; verily he produces it from its own birthplace, he does not produce a foe for him. Darkness seizes on him whose fire in the pan is extinguished, darkness is death; a black garment, a black heifer are the sacrificial fees; verily with darkness [1] he smites away the darkness which is death. Gold he gives, gold is light; verily with the light he smites away the darkness; moreover gold is brilliance; verily he confers brilliance upon himself.</p>
<h3 id="b-4">b</h3>
<p>Like heavenly light, the heat; hail! Like heavenly light, the Arka hail! Like heavenly light, the bright; hail! Like heavenly light, the light; hail! Like heavenly light, the sun; hail!&rsquo;<br>
The fire is Arka, the horse sacrifice is yonder sun [2]; in that he offers these libations he unites the lights of the Arka and the horse sacrifice; he indeed is an offerer of the Arka and the horse sacrifice, for whom this is done in the fire.</p>

<p>The waters were first this world, the moving; Prajapati saw this first layer, it he put down, it became this (earth). To him Viśvakarman said, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered [3]. He saw this second layer, he put it down, it became the atmosphere. The sacrifice said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman, &lsquo;Let me come to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way wilt thou come to me? &rsquo; &lsquo;By the regional (bricks)&rsquo;, he replied. He came with the regional (bricks), he put them down, they became the regions [4]. The supreme lord said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman and the sacrifice, &lsquo;Let me come to you two&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, they answered. He saw this third layer, he put it down, it became yonder (world). Aditya said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let me come to thee&rsquo; [5]; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, he answered. He said to Viśvakarman and the sacrifice, &lsquo;Let me come to you two&rsquo;; &lsquo;There is no space here&rsquo;, they answered. He said to the supreme lord, &lsquo;Let me come to thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way wilt thou come to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;By the space-filler&rsquo;, he replied. He came to him by the space filler; therefore the space-filler is unexhausted, for yonder Aditya is unexhausted [6]. To them the seers said, &lsquo;Let us come to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;In what way will ye come?&rsquo; &lsquo;By greatness&rsquo;, they replied. To them they came with two (more) layers; (the fire) became one of five layers. He who knowing thus piles the fire becomes greater, he conquers these worlds, the gods know him; moreover he attains community with these deities.</p>

<p>The fire is a bird; if the piler of the fire were to eat of a bird, he would be eating the fire, he would go to ruin. For a year should he observe the vow, for a vow goes not beyond a year.</p>

<p>The fire is an animal; now an animal destroys him who moves up to it face to face; therefore he should go up to it from behind while it is looking towards the front, to prevent injury to himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Brilliance art thou, grant me brilliance, restrain earth [1], guard me from the earth. Light art thou, grant me light, restrain the atmosphere, guard me from the atmosphere. Heavenly light art thou, grant me heavenly light, restrain the heavenly light, guard me from the sky&rsquo;, he says; by these are these worlds supported; in that he puts them down, (it is) for the support of these worlds. Having put down the naturally perforated (bricks) he puts down the gold bricks; the naturally perforated are these worlds, gold is light; in that having put down the naturally perforated [2] he puts down the gold bricks; verily he makes these worlds full of light by means of them; verily also by them these worlds shine forth for him.</p>

<p>Those flames of thine, O Agni, which rising in the sun,<br>

Grant us brilliance [3] in our Brahmans,<br>

Brilliance in Viśyas and Śudras;<br>
With thy flame grant me brilliance.<br>
The glory and power of him who has piled the fire go apart twofold, or to the fire which he has piled or to the man who has sacrificed. In that he offers these libations, he places in himself power and fame.</p>
<h3 id="e-2">e</h3>
<p>He who having piled the fire steps on it is liable to go to ruin. &lsquo;To thee I come praising with holy power&rsquo;; with this verse addressed to Varuna [4] should he offer; that is the soothing of the fire and the protection of himself.</p>
<h3 id="f-1">f</h3>
<p>He who piles the fire is made into an offering; just as an offering spills, so he spills who having piled the fire approaches a woman; with clotted curds for Mitra and Varuna he should sacrifice; verily he approaches unity with Mitra and Varuna, to avoid his spilling.</p>
<h3 id="g-1">g</h3>
<p>He who knows the fire to rest on the seasons, for him the seasons go in order; he finds support. The fire resting on the seasons is the year [5]; the head is the spring, the right side summer, the tail the rains, the left side autumn, the middle winter, the layers the first half-months, the mortar the second half-months, the bricks the days and nights; this is the fire resting on the seasons; he who knows thus, for him the seasons go in order; he finds support.</p>

<p>Thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, thine abodes,<br>
Thy tongues, O all-knower, thy light,<br>
Thy cracklings, thy drops,<br>
With these pile thyself, well knowing.<br>
The fire is an extended sacrifice; what of it is performed, what not? What the Adhvaryu in piling the fire omits, that of himself he omits. &lsquo;Thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, thine [1] abodes&rsquo;, he says; this is the self piling of the fire; verily the fire piles the fire, the Adhvaryu omits nothing from himself.</p>

<p>To the four quarters let the fires advance;<br>
May he bear this sacrifice for us, well knowing;<br>
Making rich the ghee, immortal, full of heroes,<br>
The holy power is the kindling-stick of the libations.<br>
The tortoise is put down for the world of heaven; &lsquo;To the four quarters let the fires advance&rsquo;, he says [2]; verily by it he recognizes the quarters; &lsquo;May he bear this sacrifice for us, well knowing&rsquo;, he says, for guidance to the world of heaven; &lsquo;The holy power is the kindling-stick of the libations&rsquo;, he says. By means of the holy power the gods went to the world of heaven; in that he puts down (the tortoise) with (a verse) containing the word &lsquo;holy power&rsquo;, by the holy power the sacrificer goes to the world of heaven.</p>

<p>The fire is Prajapati here; cattle are the offspring; the form the metres; all colours of bricks should he make; verily by the form he wins offspring, cattle, the metres; verily also he piles it winning it for offspring, cattle, the metres.</p>

<p>The immortal Agni who hath entered<br>
Into us mortals within the heart, O fathers,<br>

May he not abandon us and go afar.<br>
If the Adhvaryu without taking the fire in himself were to pile it, he would pile his own fire also [1] for the sacrificer. Now cattle depend upon the fire; cattle would be likely to depart from him. &lsquo;In me I take first Agni&rsquo;, he says; verily in himself he supports his own fire, cattle depart not from him.</p>

<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since clay and water are not food for Agni, then why is he piled with clay and water?&rsquo; In that he joins with water [2] and all the deities are the waters, verily he unites him with the waters. In that he piles with clay and Agni Vaiśvanara is this earth, verily he piles Agni with Agni.</p>
<h3 id="c-6">c</h3>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;Since the fire is piled with clay and water, then why is it called the fire?&rsquo; In that he piles with the metres and the metres are fires, therefore is it called fire. Moreover Agni Vaiśvanara is this (earth); in that [3] he piles with clay, therefore is it called the fire.</p>

<p>He puts down golden bricks; gold is light; verily be confers light upon him; again gold is brilliance; verily he confers radiance upon himself. He, who piles (the fire) with faces on all sides, eats food in all his offspring, conquers all the quarters. In the east he puts down a Gayatri, a Tristubh on the south, a Jagati on the west, an Anustubh on the north, a Pankti in the middle; this is the fire with faces on all sides: he, who knowing thus piles it, eats food in all his offspring, conquers all the quarters; verily also he weaves quarter in quarter; therefore quarter is woven in quarter.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>Prajapati created the fire; it created ran away east from him; he cast the horse at it, it turned to the south; he cast the ram at it, it turned to the west; he cast the bull at it, it turned to the north; he cast the goat at it, it ran upwards. He cast the man at it. In that he puts down the heads of animals, he piles it [1], winning it on every side. The heads of animals are bricks, breath supporting, full of sight; in that he puts down the heads of animals, the sacrificer breathes with them in yonder world; verily also these worlds shine forth for him by them. He puts them down after smearing with mud, for purity. The fire is an animal, animals are food, the heads of animals are this fire; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May his food be less&rsquo; [2], he should put down for him the heads of animals more closely together; his food becomes less; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May his food be similar (to what he has now)&rsquo;, he should put them down for him at a mean distance; verily his food becomes the same; if he desire of a man, &lsquo;May his food become more&rsquo;, he should put them down separating them at the ends of the pile; verily at the ends also he wins food for him; his food becomes more.<br>

He who among men going swiftly falls in with a trackless way, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are left out. So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief, is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who pointed out (his error) is left out [1]. Therefore on the tenth day, the Avivakya, one should not point out (errors) to one who comes to grief. Or rather they say, ‘By that which was successful in the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, and overcame the Asuras by what was unsuccessful.’ What is successful in the sacrifice belongs to the sacrificer, what is unsuccessful to his enemy. Now he, who comes to grief on the tenth day, the Avivakya, produces overmuch. Those who are outside as spectators [2] should point out (his error). If there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within the Sadas. If there be none there, then it should be pointed out by the Grhapati. At any rate it should be pointed out. They sing the verses of the serpent queen on that day. The queen of what creeps is this (earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever they have praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now whatever they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter, (it is done thinking), ‘Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.’ They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he should declare to the one who responds. That is the response.">

<p>They go swiftly in that it is the tenth day. In that it is the tenth day they loosen their sins. He who among men going swiftly falls in with a trackless way, he who strikes a post, and he who stumbles, are left out. So he, who on this tenth day, the Avivakya, comes to grief, is left out. If one points out (an error) to one who comes to grief, he seizes hold of him and comes out successfully, and then the one who pointed out (his error) is left out [1]. Therefore on the tenth day, the Avivakya, one should not point out (errors) to one who comes to grief. Or rather they say, &lsquo;By that which was successful in the sacrifice the gods went to the world of heaven, and overcame the Asuras by what was unsuccessful.&rsquo; What is successful in the sacrifice belongs to the sacrificer, what is unsuccessful to his enemy. Now he, who comes to grief on the tenth day, the Avivakya, produces overmuch. Those who are outside as spectators [2] should point out (his error). If there be none there, then (the error) should be pointed out from within the Sadas. If there be none there, then it should be pointed out by the Grhapati. At any rate it should be pointed out. They sing the verses of the serpent queen on that day. The queen of what creeps is this (earth). Whatever on this (earth) they praise, whatever they have praised, through that is this (earth) the serpent queen. Now whatever they have praised with speech and what they will praise thereafter, (it is done thinking), &lsquo;Having won both and obtained them, let us stop.&rsquo; They sing these (verses) with the mind. Neither a horse chariot nor a mule chariot can in one moment encompass this (earth), but mind can in one moment encompass it, mind can overcome it. Then they repeat the Brahman. The Rc verses are limited, the Samans are limited, and the Yajuses are limited, but of the Brahman there is no end, and that he should declare to the one who responds. That is the response.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;By the first day of the twelve-day rite what is it that the sacrificer takes from the priests?&rsquo; &lsquo;Brilliance and power&rsquo; is (the answer). &lsquo;What by the second?&rsquo; &lsquo;The breaths and food.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the third?&rsquo; &lsquo;These three worlds.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the fourth?&rsquo; &lsquo;Four-footed cattle.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the fifth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Pankti with its elements.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the sixth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The six seasons.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the seventh?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Śakvari with its seven feet.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the eighth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Gayatri with its eight syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the ninth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Trivrt Stoma.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the tenth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Viraj with its ten syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the eleventh?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Tristubh with its eleven syllables.&rsquo; &lsquo;What by the twelfth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jagati with its twelve syllables.&rsquo; So much is there as that. So much as that he takes from them.</p>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<p>(The rite) of thirteen nights is a complete (rite of) twelve days, for the opening and concluding days are the same. There are three Atiratras, three are these worlds, for the obtaining of these worlds. The first Atiratra is the expiration, the second cross-breathing, the third inspiration; verily they find support in expiration, inspiration, out-breathing, and food, and reach their full life, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of thirteen nights. They say, &lsquo;(The rite) of twelve days is the sequence of speech. They would cleave it if they put an Atiratra in the middle, and the speech of the householder would be liable to fail.&rsquo; They perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas; verily they maintain the sequence of speech, and the speech of the householder is not likely to fail. The Chandomas are</p>
<p>cattle, the Mahavrata food; in that they perform the Mahavrata after the Chandomas, they find support in cattle and in food.</p>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<p>The Adityas desired, &lsquo;May we be prosperous in both worlds.&rsquo; They saw this (rite) of fourteen nights; they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed they prospered in both worlds, this and yonder. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, this and yonder. (The rite) is of fourteen nights, there are seven domesticated plants and seven wild; (verily it serves) to win both. In that the Prsthas are performed in succession [1], they conquer by them yonder world. In that the Prsthas are reversed, they conquer by them this world. There are two Trayastrinśa Stomas in the middle; verily they attain sovereignty. (These two) are overlords; verily they become overlords of their peers. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>
<h2 id="05">05</h2>
<p>Prajapati went to the world of heaven. The gods followed him, and the Adityas and the cattle followed them. The gods said, &lsquo;The cattle on which we have lived have followed us.&rsquo; They arranged this (rite) of fourteen nights away for them. The Adityas mounted the world of heaven with the Prsthas; they arranged the cattle in this world with the two Tryahas. By means of the Prsthas the Adityas prospered in yonder world, the cattle in this world by the Tryahas [1]. Those who, knowing thus, perform (the rite of) fourteen nights, prosper in both worlds, in this and in yonder; by the Prsthas they prosper in yonder world and by the Tryahas in this world. The three days are the Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the Prsthas were on one side, there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance [2]. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). The (nights) are fourteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for four, the quarters are four; verily they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on either side, for security.</p>

<p>Indra was on a level with the gods, he was not distinguished from them. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights. He grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became distinguished from the other gods. Those who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights attain distinction from the evil enemy. The three days are Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere [1], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they find support in these worlds. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there axe Chandomas, there is the Sattra. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the strength, and in cattle, they Chandomas cattle; verily in force and find support. (The rite) is of fifteen nights; the bolt is fifteenfold; verily they hurl the bolt at their enemies. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing power.</p>

<p>Indra was as it were loose and unfixed. He was afraid of the Asuras. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of fifteen nights as a bolt. With it he overcame and conquered the Asuras and attained prosperity. By the Agnistut he burned away the evil, by (the rite) of fifteen nights he placed force, might, power, and strength in himself. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of fifteen nights overcome and conquer their enemies and attain prosperity. By the Agnistut they burn away the evil</p>
<p>[1], by (the rite) of fifteen nights they place force, might, power, and strength in themselves. These (nights) are full of cattle. Fifteen indeed are the nights of the half-month, the year is made up of half-months, cattle are born throughout the year; therefore (these nights) are full of cattle. These (nights) are heavenly. Fifteen indeed are the nights of the half-month, the year is made up of half months, the world of heaven is the year; verily (these nights) are heavenly. There are the three days, Jyotis, Ayus, and Go. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere [2], the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. If the Prsthas were on one side, there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed; verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven [3]. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is reversed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). These (nights) are fifteen. As for ten of them, the Viraj is ten-syllabled, the Viraj is food; verily by the Viraj they win food. As for five, the quarters are five; verily they find support in the quarters. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing power, strength, offspring, and cattle.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I be an eater of food.&rsquo; He saw this (rite of) seventeen nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became an eater of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of seventeen nights, become eaters of food. There is a period of five days; the seasons are five in the year; verily in the seasons and the year they find sup port. Again the Pankti is of five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily they win the sacrifice. There can be no Sattra where there is no Chandoma; in that there are Chandomas, there is the sacrifice. The gods they win by the Prsthas, the cattle by the Chandomas. The Prsthas are force and strength, the Chandomas cattle; verily in force and strength, and in cattle, they find support. (The rite is) of seventeen nights; Prajapati is seventeenfold; (verily it serves) to obtain Prajapati. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing food.</p>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<p>The Viraj dividing itself stayed among the gods with the holy power (Brahman), among the Asuras with food. The gods desired, &lsquo;May we acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food! They saw (the rite of) these twenty nights. Then indeed they acquired both the holy power (Brahman) and food, and became resplendent and eaters of food. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite of) these nights, acquire both the holy power (Brahman) and food [1], and become resplendent and eaters of food. They (make up) two Virajs; verily separately in them they find support. Man is twentyfold, ten fingers and ten toes; verily obtaining the greatness of man they cease (the rite). There are Tryahas consisting of Jyotis, Go, and Ayus. The Jyotis is this (earth), the Go the atmosphere, the Ayus yonder (sky); verily they mount upon these worlds. The Tryahas go in order; verily in order they mount the world of heaven [2]. If the Prsthas were on one side there would be a lack of balance; the Prsthas are in the middle, for balance. The Prsthas are force and strength; verily they place force and strength in the middle. They proceed with the Brhat and the Rathantara (Samans). The Rathantara is this (earth), the Brhat yonder (sky); verily with them do they proceed, verily also in them they find support. These indeed are the quick paths of the sacrifice; verily by them do they proceed to the world of heaven. They mount the world of heaven turning away (from earth), who perform the Prsthas in succession. The Tryaha is re versed, for the return (from heaven), and for support. Having prospered in either world they cease (the rite). There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour and food.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>Yonder sun was in this world. The gods surrounded it with the Prsthas and removed it to the world of heaven. They surrounded it from below with the Para (Samans), and placed it with the Divakirtya (Saman) in the world of heaven. They surrounded it from above with the Para (Samans), and with the Prsthas they descended (from heaven). Yonder sun indeed in yonder world is surrounded by the Para (Samans) on both sides. In that there are Prsthas the sacrificers go by them to the world of heaven; they surround it from below with the Para (Samans), and by the Divakirtya (Saman) find support [1] in the world of heaven. They surround it from above with the Para (Samans), and descend with the Prsthas. If there were not Paras above, they would depart away from the world of heaven; if there were none below, they would. burn creatures. There are Parahsamans on both sides of the Divakirtya; verily they surround them on both sides in the world of heaven. The Divakirtya is the sacrificers, the Parahsamans the year; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the Divakirtya; verily on both sides [2] they find support in the year. The Divakirtya is the back, the Parahsamans the two sides; the Parahsamans are on both sides of the Divakirtya; therefore the sides are on both sides of the back. (In the rite) the greatest number of libations are made, the greatest number of Śastras recited; verily in the middle of the sacrifice they tie a knot not to slip. There are seven libations; seven are the breaths in the head; verily they place breaths in the sacrificers. In that the Prsthas are in succession, they mount upon yonder world with them. If they were not to descend to this world [3], the sacrificers would either go mad or perish. In that the Prsthas are reversed they descend to this world with them; verily also they find support in this world, for sanity. Indra was unsettled. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became settled. Those, who sacrifice much and are unsettled [41, should perform (the rite) of twenty-one nights. There are twelve months, five seasons, three worlds here, and yonder sun as the twenty-first. So many are the worlds of the gods; verily in them in order they find support. Yonder sun did not shine. He ran up to Prajapati; he gave him this (rite) of twenty-one nights; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then in deed did he shine. Those, who knowing thus perform (the rite) of twenty one nights, shine also. (The rite) is of twenty-one nights, the Ekavinśa (Stoma) is radiance; verily they attain radiance, and support also, for the Ekavinśa is support. There are Atiratras on either side, for securing splendour.<br>

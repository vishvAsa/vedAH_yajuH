The Viraj of speech ends in Agni; it is produced according to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two Stomas bear the morning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two the midday pressing, like eye and ear; two the third pressing, like speech and support. This sacrifice is commensurate with man, and is perfect [1]. Whatever desire a man has, he wins by it, for one wins all by that which is perfect. By means of the Agnistoma Prajapati created off spring; by means of the Agnistoma he grasped them. When he grasped them the mule escaped. Following it he took its seed, and placed it in the ass. Therefore the ass has double seed. They also say, ‘He placed it in the mare.’ Therefore the mare has double seed. They also say, ‘In the plants [2] he placed it.’ Therefore plants, though not anointed, glisten.’ They also say, ‘He placed it in offspring.’ Therefore twins are born. Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from him. Therefore he is not suitable for the sacrifice, but is suitable if there is a sacrifice when one gives (to the priests) all one’s goods or a thousand, for he escaped. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the Agnistoma begets unborn offspring and grasps those that are born. Therefore they say, ‘It is the best of sacrifices [3].’ Prajapati indeed is the best, for he sacrificed with it first. Prajapati desired, ‘May I have offspring.’ He meted out the Trivrt from his mouth. After it the god Agni was created, the Gayatri metre, the Rathantara Saman, of men the Brahman, of cattle the goat; therefore are they the chief, for they were produced from the mouth. From the breast and arms he meted out the Pañcadaśa Stoma. After it the god Indra was created, the Tristubh metre, the Brhat [4] Saman, of men the Rajanya, of cattle the sheep. There fore they are strong, for they were created from strength. From the middle he meted out the Saptadaśa Stoma. After it the All-gods as deities were created, the Jagati metre, the Vairupa Saman, of men the Vaiśya, of cattle cows. Therefore are they to be eaten, for they were created from the receptacle of food. Therefore are they more numerous than others, for they were created after the most numerous of the gods. From his feet he meted out the Ekavinśa Stoma. After it the Anustubh metre [5] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Śudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Śudra, are dependent on others. Therefore the Śudra is not fit for the sacrifice, for he was not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths; the Pañcadaśa the half-months; the Saptadaśa Prajapati; these worlds are three; the Ekavinśa is the sun yonder. In this they rest, in this they find support. He who knows thus rests on this, finds, support in this.">

<p>Production of offspring is light. Agni is the light of the gods; the Viraj is the light of the metres. The Viraj of speech ends in Agni; it is produced according to the Viraj. Therefore it is called light. Two Stomas bear the morning pressing, like expiration and inspiration; two the midday pressing, like eye and ear; two the third pressing, like speech and support. This sacrifice is commensurate with man, and is perfect [1]. Whatever desire a man has, he wins by it, for one wins all by that which is perfect. By means of the Agnistoma Prajapati created off spring; by means of the Agnistoma he grasped them. When he grasped them the mule escaped. Following it he took its seed, and placed it in the ass. Therefore the ass has double seed. They also say, &lsquo;He placed it in the mare.&rsquo; Therefore the mare has double seed. They also say, &lsquo;In the plants [2] he placed it.&rsquo; Therefore plants, though not anointed, glisten.&rsquo; They also say, &lsquo;He placed it in offspring.&rsquo; Therefore twins are born. Therefore the mule has no offspring, for his seed has been taken from him. Therefore he is not suitable for the sacrifice, but is suitable if there is a sacrifice when one gives (to the priests) all one&rsquo;s goods or a thousand, for he escaped. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the Agnistoma begets unborn offspring and grasps those that are born. Therefore they say, &lsquo;It is the best of sacrifices [3].&rsquo; Prajapati indeed is the best, for he sacrificed with it first. Prajapati desired, &lsquo;May I have offspring.&rsquo; He meted out the Trivrt from his mouth. After it the god Agni was created, the Gayatri metre, the Rathantara Saman, of men the Brahman, of cattle the goat; therefore are they the chief, for they were produced from the mouth. From the breast and arms he meted out the Pañcadaśa Stoma. After it the god Indra was created, the Tristubh metre, the Brhat [4] Saman, of men the Rajanya, of cattle the sheep. There fore they are strong, for they were created from strength. From the middle he meted out the Saptadaśa Stoma. After it the All-gods as deities were created, the Jagati metre, the Vairupa Saman, of men the Vaiśya, of cattle cows. Therefore are they to be eaten, for they were created from the receptacle of food. Therefore are they more numerous than others, for they were created after the most numerous of the gods. From his feet he meted out the Ekavinśa Stoma. After it the Anustubh metre [5] was created, the Vairaja Saman, of men the Śudra, of cattle the horse. Therefore the two, the horse and the Śudra, are dependent on others. Therefore the Śudra is not fit for the sacrifice, for he was not created after any gods. Therefore they depend on their feet, for they were created from the feet. The Trivrt is the breaths; the Pañcadaśa the half-months; the Saptadaśa Prajapati; these worlds are three; the Ekavinśa is the sun yonder. In this they rest, in this they find support. He who knows thus rests on this, finds, support in this.</p>
<h2 id="02">02</h2>
<p>At the morning pressing he keeps glorifying the Trivrt Stoma by the Gayatri metre; the Pañcadaśa Stoma by the Trivrt, which is splendour; the Saptadaśa by the Pañcadaśa which is force and strength; the Ekavinśa by the Saptadaśa which is connected with Prajapati and causes begetting. Verily thus Stoma glorifies Stoma; verily also Stoma leads Stoma forth. As many as are the Stomas, so many are desires, so many the worlds, so many the lights; verily so many Stomas, so many desires, so many worlds, so many lights does he win.</p>
<h2 id="03">03</h2>
<p>The theologians say, &lsquo;He indeed would really sacrifice, who having sacrificed with the Agnistoma should also sacrifice with the Sarvastoma.&rsquo; If they omit the Trivrt Stoma, then his vital airs are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my vital airs. If they omit the Pañcadaśa Stoma, his strength is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my strength.&rsquo; If they omit the Saptadaśa Stoma [1], his offspring is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my offspring.&rsquo; If they omit the Ekavinśa Stoma, his support is omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my support.&rsquo; If they omit the Trinava Stoma, his seasons and the strength of the Naksatras are omitted, but he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my seasons and the strength of the Naksatras&rsquo; [2]. If they omit the Trayastrinśa Stoma, his deities are omitted, and he who offers the sacrifice does so with the wish, &lsquo;May it be in my deities.&rsquo; He who knows the lowest of the Stomas attaining the first place, obtains him self the first place. The Trivrt is the lowest of Stomas, the Trivrt occupies the first place. He who know thus obtains the first place.<br>
THE EXPOSITION OF THE SATTRAS<br>
The Ahina Sacrifices</p>
<h2 id="04">04</h2>
<p>The Angirases performed a sacrificial session. They went to the world of heaven. Of them Havismant and Haviskrt were left behind. They desired, &lsquo;May we two go to the world of heaven.&rsquo; They two saw this two-night rite, they grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then they went to the world of heaven. He, who knowing thus offers the two-night sacrifice, goes to the world of heaven. They went with the first day and arrived with the second [1]. The first day is the Abhiplava, the second the complete (gati). The first day is the Jyotistoma form of the Agnistoma; with it he wins splendour. The second day is an Atiratra with all the Stomas, that he may obtain all and win all. On the first day the Saman is in the Gayatri (metre). The Gayatri is brilliance and splendour; verily he bestows brilliance and splendour on himself. On the second day (the Saman) is in the Tristubh metre. The Tristubh is force and strength; verily he bestows force and strength on himself. The Saman on the first day [2] is the Rathantara. The Rathantara is this (earth); verily he stands firm on this (earth). (The Saman) on the second is the Brhat. The Brhat is yonder (sky); verily he stands firm on yonder (sky). They say, &lsquo;Where are the Jagati and the Anustubh?&rsquo; On the first day the Saman is that of Vikhanas; verily he does not leave the Jagati. On the second it is the Sodaśin; verily he does not leave the Anustubh. Then they say, &lsquo;If the days fall in the same half month, then the strength of one day only will belong to the rite.&rsquo; The first day takes place on the night of new moon; the second on the next day, verily the days fall on separate half-months, and have the several strengths. The first day has Havismant, the second Haviskrt in the finale, for support.</p>

<p>This was in the beginning the waters, the ocean. In it Prajapati becoming the wind moved. He saw her, and becoming a boar he seized her. Her, becoming Viśvakarma, he wiped. She extended, she became the earth, and hence the earth is called the earth (lit. &rsquo;the extended&rsquo;). In her Prajapati made effort. He produced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. The gods said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Let us have<br>
offspring.&rsquo; He said [1], &lsquo;As I have created you by penance, so seek ye offspring in penance.&rsquo; He gave to them Agni as a support, saying, &lsquo;Strive with that support.&rsquo; They strove with Agni as a support. After a year they produced one cow. They gave it to the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas, saying &lsquo;Guard it.&rsquo; The Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas guarded it. It produced for the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas (each) three hundred and thirty-three [2]. Thus she became the thousandth. The gods said to Prajapati, &lsquo;Cause sacrifice to be made to us with a thousand.&rsquo; He caused sacrifice to be made by the Vasus with the Agnistoma. They won this world and gave (the thousandth). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Rudras with the Ukthya. They won the atmosphere and gave (the thousand). He caused sacrifice to be made by the Adityas with the Atiratra. They won yonder world, and gave (the thousand). Now the atmosphere [3] was broken. Therefore the Rudras are murderous, for they have no support. Therefore they say, &lsquo;The midmost day of the three-day night is not fixed; for it was</p>
<p>moved.&rsquo; The Ajya (Śastra) of the midmost day is in the Tristubh metre. He recites the Samyana hymns, then recites the Sodaśin, that the day may be made firm and be not loose. Therefore in the three-night rite, the first day should be an Agnistoma, then an Ukthya, then an Atiratra, for the separation of these worlds. On each day in succession he gives three hundred continuously [4], for the continuance of these worlds. He should not break the decades lest he should thus destroy the Viraj. Now for the thousandth Indra and Visnu strove. Indra reflects, &lsquo;By this Visnu will appropriate all the thousand.&rsquo; They made arrangement as to it, Indra got two-thirds, Visnu the remaining third; verily the fact is recorded in the verse, &lsquo;Ye twain have conquered.&rsquo; It is the Achavaka [5] who recites this verse. Now (some say), &lsquo;The thousandth is to be given to the Hotr&rsquo;; what is left over, is left over for the Hotr; the Hotr is the receiver of what has not been taken. Then others say, &lsquo;It is to be given to the Unnetr.&rsquo; This is left over of the thousand, and the Unnetr is the one of the priests who is left over. Then some say, &lsquo;It is to be given to all those who have a place in the Sadas.&rsquo; Then some say, &lsquo;It should be driven away and allowed to wander at will.&rsquo; Then some say, &lsquo;It is to be given to the Brahman and the Agnidh [6], two shares to the Brahman and the third to the Agnidh. For the Brahman is connected with Indra, the Agnidh with Visnu; (verily the division is) just as they two agreed upon. Then some say, &lsquo;The one which is beautiful and of varied colour is the one to be given.&rsquo; Then others say, &lsquo;The one which has two colours and on either side is spotted is the one to be given&rsquo;, for the gaining of a thousand. That indeed is the march of the thousand (sahásrasyáyana). There are a thousand Stotriyas, a thousand gifts (to the priests); the world of heaven is measured by a thousand; (verily it serves) for the winning of the heavenly world.</p>
<h2 id="06">06</h2>
<p>Soma found a thousand; Indra discovered it after him. Yama approached them and said to them, &lsquo;May I have a share too in it.&rsquo; They said to him, &lsquo;Be it so.&rsquo; Yama saw in one of the (cows) strength. He said to them, &lsquo;This one has the strength of the thousand, this be mine, the rest yours.&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We all see that in this one is strength [1]. Let us each have a portion.&rsquo; So they took shares in the one. They put her into the waters, saying, &lsquo;Come out for Soma.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of a red brown cow of one year old, together with three hundred and thirty three. Therefore let one buy the Soma with a red brown cow one year old. He, who knowing thus buys the Soma with a red brown cow one year old, buys the Soma with three hundred and thirty-three [2] and sacrifices with Soma for which he has paid a good price. They put her into the waters, saying, &lsquo;Come out for Indra.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, together with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should give a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes. He who knowing thus gives a red draught animal with good characteristics, destroying foes, gives her as three hundred and thirty-three [3]. They put her into the waters&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;Come out for Yama.&rsquo; She came out in the shape of an aged, stupid, utterly bad animal, together with three hundred and thirty-three. Therefore one should offer as the funeral cow one that is aged, stupid, utterly bad. If a man knowing thus offers a cow that is aged, stupid, utterly bad, as the funeral cow, she becomes for him in yonder world three hundred and thirty-three. Speech is the thousandth. Therefore [4] a boon must be given; for she is a boon, and when she is given she is a thousand. Therefore one must not accept a boon; for she is a boon; verily he would be accepting a thousand. Let him say, &lsquo;She is a boon&rsquo;, and of another, &lsquo;Let this be mine&rsquo;; verily he avoids accepting a thousand. She should be spotted on either side. They say, &lsquo;Let her be spotted on one side only; spotted is the thousand on the other side.&rsquo; The one for a boon [5] should be beautiful, perfect in form; for she is a boon; (verily it serves for) prosperity. Leading her round to the north of the Agnidh&rsquo;s place he makes her smell the wooden tub near the Ahavaniya fire, saying,<br>
&lsquo;Smell the tub, O great one, with broad stream rich in milk;<br>
Let the drops enter thee as the streams the ocean;<br>
Give me a share in a thousand, with offspring, with cattle;<br>
Let wealth again visit me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Verily he unites him with offspring, with cattle, with wealth [6]. He becomes rich in offspring, in cattle, in wealth, who knows thus. Having gone round the Agnidh&rsquo;s place with her, he should offer in front, while the cow stands facing (him), Saying,<br>
Ye twain have conquered; ye are not conquered;<br>
Neither of the two of them hath been defeated;<br>
Indra and Visnu when ye contended,<br>
Ye did divide the thousand into three.&rsquo;<br>
The thousand is divided into three parts at the three-night festival; verily he makes her possessed of a thousand, he makes her the measure of a thousand [7]. He offers to her forms; verily he unites her with her forms. Rising up he mutters in her ear,<br>
&lsquo;O Ida, Ranti, Aditi, Sarasvati, Priya, Preyasi, Mahi, Viśruti,<br>
These, O inviolable one, are thy names;<br>
Proclaim me among the gods as a doer of good deeds.&rsquo;<br>
Verily she proclaims him among the gods, and the gods take note of him.</p>
<h2 id="07">07</h2>
<p>By the thousandth the sacrifice goes to the world of heaven. She makes him go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to the world of heaven&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to the world of heaven. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to the world of light&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to the world of light. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to all holy worlds&rsquo;, he says; verily she makes him go to all holy worlds [1]. &lsquo;Do thou make me go to a secure place, with offspring and cattle, let wealth again visit me&rsquo;, (he says); verily she establishes him with offspring and cattle in wealth. Rich in offspring, cattle, and wealth he becomes who knows thus. He should give her to the Agnidh, or the Brahman, or the Hotr or the Udgatr, or the Adhvaryu. In giving her, he gives a thousand. A thousand he accepts who not knowing [2] accepts her. He should accept her, (saying), &lsquo;Thou art one, not a thousand. Thee as one I accept, not a thousand; come to me as one, not as a thousand&rsquo;; verily he who knows thus accepts her as one, not as a thousand. &lsquo;Thou art gentle, resting well, auspicious; come to me as gentle, well resting, auspicious,&rsquo; [3] he says; verily she becoming gentle, well resting, auspicious, comes to him, and harms him not. The theologians say, &lsquo;Does the thousandth follow the thousand? or the thou sand the thousandth?&rsquo; If he were to let her go to the east, the thousandth would follow the thousand; now the thousand has no understanding, and would not recognize the world of heaven. He lets her go to the west; the thousand follow after her. She knowing goes to the world of heaven. He lets her go towards the sacrificer. Quickly a thousand springs up. The (thousandth) is the last to be taken, but the first to go to the gods.</p>
<h2 id="08">08</h2>
<p>Atri gave offspring to Aurva who was desirous of children. She deemed herself empty, without strength, weak, worn out. He saw the four night rite; he grasped it, and sacrificed with it. Then indeed were four sons born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. He, who knowing thus offers the four-night rite, has four sons born for him, a good Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good Adhvaryu, a good councillor. The Pavamana (Stomas) which are twenty-fourfold are splendour [1]; the increasing Stomas are prosperity. Atri who had faith as his deity and offered sacrifices was not visited by the four strengths, brilliance, power, splendour, food. He saw these four Soma libations with the four Stomas; he grasped them and sacrificed with them. He won brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the third, food with the fourth. He, who knowing thus, grasps the four Soma libations with the four Stomas and sacrifices with them, wins brilliance with the first, power with the second, splendour with the third, food with the fourth. With the success which Atri had, the sacrificer prospers.</p>
<h2 id="09">09</h2>
<p>Jamadagni desiring prosperity, sacrificed with the four-night rite. He prospered therein, and accordingly the two descendants of Jamadagni are not seen as grey-haired. That prosperity is his who knowing thus offers the four-night rite. On the Upasads offerings of the sacrificial cake are made. The sacrificial cake is cattle; verily he wins cattle. The sacrificial cake is food; verily he wins food. An eater of food and owner of cattle he becomes who knowing thus offers the four-day rite.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>The year was alone in the world. He desired, &lsquo;May I create the seasons.&rsquo; He saw this five-night rite; he grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he created the seasons. He who- knowing thus offers the five-night rite gains offspring. The seasons being created were not distinguished. They saw this five-night rite. They grasped it and sacrificed with it. Then they were distinguished [1]. He who knowing thus offers the five-night rite is distinguished from the enemy that hates him. Sarvaseni Śauceya desired, &lsquo;May I be rich in cattle.&rsquo; He grasped this five-night rite and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he obtained a thousand cattle. He who knowing thus offers the five-night rite obtains a thousand cattle. Babara Pravahani desired, &lsquo;May I be a speaker of speech.&rsquo; He grasped the five-night rite [2] and sacrificed with it. Then indeed he became a speaker of speech. He, who knowing thus offers the five-night rite, becomes a speaker of speech, and men call him &rsquo;lord of speech&rsquo;. The four-night rite is incomplete; the six-night rite is redundant, the correct sacrifice is the five-night rite. He who knowing thus sacrifices with the five-night rite sacrifices with the correct sacrifice. The (sacrifices) last five nights; the year consists of five seasons [3]; verily he stands firm in the year with its five seasons. Again the Pankti has five elements, the sacrifice is fivefold; verily he wins the sacrifice. There is an Agnistoma characterized by the Trivrt (Stoma); verily he wins brilliance. There is a Pañcadaśa (Stoma); verily he wins power. There is a Saptadaśa (Stoma), for the obtainment of food; verily also he gains offspring by reason of it. There is an Agnistoma with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), for the gaining of Prajapati; (it has) the characteristics of the Mahavrata, for the gaining of food. There is a Viśvajit Atiratra, with all the Prstha (Stotras), for the winning of all.<br>

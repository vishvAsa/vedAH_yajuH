16. [^12]  After this second Upākaraṇa, until the (chief) Upākaraṇa (has been performed) again for the Vedic texts, an interruption of the study (of the Veda takes place), if clouds rise.


[^12]:  The most natural way of interpreting the text would be, in my opinion, to assume that the 'second Upākaraṇa' (pratyupākaraṇa) is identical with the Utsarga. The second Upākaraṇa thus would in the same time conclude the first term for studying the p. 80 Veda, and open a second term. The distinction of two such periods, which may be called two terms, is frequently met with in other texts, for instance, in Vasiṣṭha XIII, 5-7 (S.B.E. XIV, 63); Manu IV, 98. According to the commentary, on the other hand, the second Upākaraṇa is performed at the beginning of the northerly course of the sun (comp. Sūtras 10-12); it is stated that after that ceremony the Uttara (i.e. the Uttarārcika?) and the Rahasya texts are studied. It deserves to be noticed that Manu (IV, 96) prescribes the performing of the Utsarga either under the Nakṣatra Puṣya (i.e. Tiṣya), or on the first day of the bright fortnight of Māgha, which is considered as coinciding, at least approximately, with the beginning of the northerly course of the sun.

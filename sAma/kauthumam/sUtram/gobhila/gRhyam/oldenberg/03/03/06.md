The expression yathārtham used in Sūtra 5 ('yathārtham iti karmaṇaḥ parisamāptir ucyate,' Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12 note) clearly indicates the close of the ceremony; on the other hand the comparison of Pāraskara II, 10, 15 seq., Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 10 seq., Āśvalāyana III, 5, 10, seems to show that the acts stated in Sūtras 6-8 form part of the ceremony described before.

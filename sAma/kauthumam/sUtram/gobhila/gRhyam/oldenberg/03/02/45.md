45. [^9]  A bull, a brass vessel, a garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.


[^9]:  45, 46. The student is to give a fee to his teacher three times, after he has been taught each of the three Stotriya verses (Sūtras 31. 32). To these three occasions the four objects stated in Sūtra 45 correspond, so that the first time either the first or the second of those objects, the bull or the brass vessel, may be chosen; the second time he gives a garment, the third time a vara (or optional gift). Comp. the similar correspondence of four objects and three cases to which these objects refer, II, 10, 8. 52.

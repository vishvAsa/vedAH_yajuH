49. [^11]  This (he should do) at (all) the Anupravacanīya ceremonies.


[^11]:  Perhaps sarvatra ('everywhere') belongs to Sūtra 49, so that we should have to translate: This (should be done) everywhere at p. 76 the Anupravacanīya ceremonies, i.e. also at those Anupravacanīya ceremonies which are connected with the study of the other texts.

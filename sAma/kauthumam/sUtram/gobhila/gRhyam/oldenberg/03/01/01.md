1. [^1]  Now (follows) the Godāna ceremony (or cutting of the beard), in the sixteenth year.


[^1]:  1, 1. After the description of the regular Upanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2, statements regarding the special Vratas which the Vedic student has to undergo, or rather which he may undergo, in the time of his studentship. Comp. the corresponding statements on the Vratas of the Ṛgvedins, Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya II, 11 and 12. By the followers of the Sāma-veda the ceremony of the Godāna, or cutting of the beard (comp. Śāṅkhāyana I, 28, 19; Pāraskara II, 1, 7 seq.; Āśvalāyana I, 18), was put into connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of the Godānavrata enabled the student to study the Pūrvārcika of the Sāma-veda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following statements with regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas mentioned in Sūtra 28: 'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer to the study of the Sāvitrī (comp. Bloomfield's notes on Gṛhya-saṃgraha II, 42. 43); the Godāna-vrata, to the study of the collections of verses sacred to the gods Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavamāna (this is the Pūrvārcika of the Sāma-veda); the Vrātika-vrata, to the study of the Āraṇyaka, with the exclusion of the Śukriya sections; the Āditya-vrata, to the study of the Śukriya sections; the Aupaniṣada-vrata, to the study of the Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa; the Jyaiṣṭhasāmika-vrata, to the study of the Ājyadohas.' The Vratas were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (Sūtras 10 seq.) in the way stated in my note on Śāṅkhāyana II, 12, 1.Khādira-Gṛhya II, 5, 1 seq.

10. [^4]  Or (let him omit) three meals.


[^4]:  There are two meals a day. The words of this Sūtra, 'Or three meals,' are explained in the commentary in the following way. He should, if he does not entirely abstain from food through three days, take only three meals during that time, i.e. he should take one meal a day. The commentator adds that some read abhaktāni instead of bhaktāni ('or he should omit three meals'), in which case the result would be the same. I prefer the reading p. 116 bhaktāni, and propose to supply, not, 'he should eat,' but 'he should omit' ('abhojanam,' Sūtra 9). Possibly the meaning is that three successive meals should be omitted; thus also the compiler of the Khādira-Gṛhya seems to have understood this Sūtra.

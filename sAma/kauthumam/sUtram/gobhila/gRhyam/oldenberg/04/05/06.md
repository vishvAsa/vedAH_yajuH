6. [^2]  Before sacrifices the Virūpākṣa formula (MB. II, 4, 6) (should be recited).


[^2]:  6-8. Khādira-Gṛhya I, 2, 23; Gṛhya-saṃgraha I, 96. It is stated that the recitation of the Virūpākṣa and Prapada formulas and also the parisamūhana (Sūtra 5) should be omitted at the so-called Kṣiprahomas, i.e. at sacrifices performed without the assistance of a yajñavid. See Bloomfield's notes on Gṛhya-saṃgraha I, 92. 96. Regarding the way in which a prāṇāyāma ('suppression of breath') is performed, comp. Vasiṣṭha XXV, 13 (S.B.E. XIV, p. 126).

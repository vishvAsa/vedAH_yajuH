15. [^5]  Let him drink (of it) three times with (the formula which he repeats thrice), 'The glory's food art thou; the might's food art thou; the bliss's food art thou; bestow bliss on me' (MB. II, 8, 12);


[^5]:  I have adopted the reading śrībhakṣo, which is given in the Mantra-Brāhmaṇa, and have followed the opinion of the commentator p. 131 that the whole Mantra, and not its single parts, should be repeated each time that he drinks of the Madhuparka. In the Khādira-Gṛhya the text of the Mantra differs, and the rite is described differently (IV, 4, 15).

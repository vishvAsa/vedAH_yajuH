7. [^2]  If (the cow-stable) is damaged by fire (?), (he should offer) a monk's robe.


[^2]:  Perhaps we ought to follow the commentary and to translate, 'When (the cow-stable) becomes heated (by the fire on which he is going to sacrifice),' &c. ('goṣṭheऽgnim upasamādhāyaiva homo na kartavyaḥ, kin tv agnim upasamādhāyāpi tāvat pratīkṣaṇīyaṃ yāvad goṣṭham upatapyamānaṃ bhavati'). I have translated cīvaram according to the ordinary meaning of the word; in the commentary it is taken as equivalent to lauhacūrṇam (copper filings).

[^7]  At the evening twilight (of every day of that fortnight), having left the village in a westerly direction, and having put wood on the fire at a place where four roads meet, he should sacrifice the small grains (of that rice), turning his face towards the sun, with (the words), 'To Bhala Svāhā! To Bhala Svāhā!' (ibid. 17. 18).

26. [^16]  If a debt turns up (which he cannot pay), he should sacrifice with the middle leaf of Golakas, with (the verse), 'The debt which' (MB. II, 3, 18).


[^16]:  I am not sure about the translation of the words golakānāṃ madhyamaparṇena. The ordinary meaning of golaka is 'ball,' see, for instance, Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya IV, 19, 4. The commentary says, golakānāṃ palāśānaṃ madhyamaparṇena madhyamacchadena.

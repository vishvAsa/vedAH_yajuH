32. [^18]  To Indrāṇī a Sthālīpāka (is prepared).


[^18]:  32-34. Khādira-Gṛhya III, 5, 40. I understand that this sacrifice stands in connection with the rural festivals which are treated of in the preceding Sūtras. In the commentary, from the mantra the conclusion is drawn that the ceremony in question belongs to the day of the Ekāṣṭakā. But the Ekāṣṭakā is the Aṣṭakā of the dark fortnight of Māgha (see S.B.E. XXIX, 102), and the description of the rites belonging to that day has already been given above, Sūtras 17-21. It very frequently occurs in the Gṛhya ritual that Mantras are used at sacrifices standing in no connection with those for which they have originally been composed.

19. [^2]  And a back-door.


[^2]:  19-21. I have translated the words of these Sūtras without trying to express any meaning. According to the commentary the meaning is the following: 19. He should not build a house which has its door on the back-side, or which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The house-door should not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door should be so constructed that the householder cannot be seen by Cāṇḍālas, &c., when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house. Or, if instead of saṃlokī the reading saṃloki is accepted, the Sūtra means: the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &c., which are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.The commentary on Khādira-Gṛhya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dvāradvayaṃ (var. lectio, dvāraṃdvāraṃ) parasparam ṛju na syād iti kecit. This seems to me to lead to the right understanding of these Sūtras. I think we ought to read and to divide in this way: (19) anudvāraṃ ca. (20. 21) gṛhadvāraṃ yathā na saṃloki syāt. 'And (let him construct) a back-door, so that it does not face the (chief) house-door.' The Khādira MSS. have the readings, asallokī, asandraloke, saṃloka.

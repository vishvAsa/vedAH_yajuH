22. [^3]  'Let him avoid an Aśvattha tree on the east-side (of his house), and a Plakṣa on the south-side, a Nyagrodha on the west-side, and on the north-side an Udumbara.


[^3]:  22-24. These are Ślokas to which the commentary very appropriately, though not exactly in the sense in which it was originally set down, applies the dictum so frequently found in the Brāhmaṇa texts: na hy ekasmād akṣarād virādhayanti. Dr. Knauer's attempts to restore correct Ślokas are perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third verse ca after plakṣas, and in the second he changes the first brūyāt into ca, whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape 
, and receives instead of it the form 
.

1. [^1]  He takes as his yajñopavīta (i.e. sacrificial cord) a string, or a garment, or simply a rope of Kuśa grass.


[^1]:  2, 1-4. Rules regarding the Upavīta. Khādira-Gṛhya I, 1, 4-6. Compare the detailed description of the nine threads of which the Upavīta-string should consist, in the Gṛhya-saṃgraha II, 48 seqq. A string was evidently considered as the regular and preferable form of the Upavīta; with regard to the second kind of Upavīta mentioned in Sūtra 1, the commentary says, 'A garment (is used), p. 17 if the Upavīta has been lost, for instance, in a forest, and if it is impossible to get a string.' A similar remark is given with reference to the third kind of Upavīta, the rope of Kuśa grass.

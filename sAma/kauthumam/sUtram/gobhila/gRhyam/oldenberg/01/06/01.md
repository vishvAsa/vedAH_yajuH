1. [^1]  Thus has spoken Mānatantavya: 'Unoffered indeed becomes the offering of a man who does not eat fast-day food.


[^1]:  6, 1. The teacher's name is spelt elsewhere Mānutantavya, which seems to be the more correct spelling. The Khādira-Gṛhya (II, I, 5) has Mānadantavya. Dr. Knauer has called attention to several other blunders of the MSS., which are unusually frequent just in this passage. For I have no doubt that in spite of the unanimous agreement of the MSS. we are to change mānuṣyāhutir into mānuṣasyāhutir, and I think it very probable, to say the least, that in Sūtra 4 kāmayetaupavasathikam should be corrected into kāmayeyātām aupavasathikam, though here the singular could possibly be defended by very faithful believers in the authority of the MSS.

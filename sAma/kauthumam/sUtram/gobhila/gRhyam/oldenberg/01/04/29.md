29. [^7]  He himself, however, should offer the Āsasya Bali, from the barley(-harvest) till the rice(-harvest), and from the rice(-harvest) till the barley(-harvest). This is called the Āsasya Bali.


[^7]:  Khādira-Gṛhya I, 5, 37. The barley-harvest is in the hot season, the rice-harvest in autumn (see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 243). The sacrificer offers barley from the barley-harvest till the rice-harvest; and rice from the rice-harvest till the barley-harvest. [fp. 25

 This Bali is called ā-sasya, because it is offered until (ā) the next crop (sasya) is ripe. As to the regulation that the sacrificer has to offer it himself, compare above, Sūtras 15-19.

24. [^9]  These rules (which have been given with regard to the sacrifices of the full and new moon) are valid for the Havis oblations which will be stated hereafter.


[^9]:  Is Havis here used as opposed to Ājya (Sūtra 26), in the same way in which Kātyāyana says (Śraut. I, 9, 1. 20): 'vrīhīn yavān vā havishi; ubhayata ājyaṃ haviṣaḥ'? Comp. below, III, 8, 10; Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 10, 26.

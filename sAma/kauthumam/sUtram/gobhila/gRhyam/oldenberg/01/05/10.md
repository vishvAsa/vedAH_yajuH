10. [^6]  The time of full-moon is reckoned in three ways: (when the full moon rises at) the meeting (of day and night), or when it rises after sunset, or when it stands high (in the sky at sunset).


[^6]:  The first of the three times is that mentioned in Sūtra 2. It seems to me not very safe to interpret sandhyā in that modern sense, in which sandhi is used, for instance, in the verse quoted by Mādhava, Weber, Jyotiṣa 51, so that it designates the meeting-point of the bright and of the dark fortnight ('āvartane yadā sandhiḥ parvapratipador bhavet,' &c.). If sandhyā were that, we should expect that the same word would occupy a similar position in the definition of amāvāsyā. I prefer, therefore, with the commentary, to understand sandhyā in its ancient sense, as the time which divides day from night. Thus sandhyā paurṇamāsī, the full-moon day, on which the moon rises at the meeting of day and night, stands in opposition to uttarā paurṇamāsī (Sūtra 2), or to astamitoditā (scil. paurṇamāsī, Sūtra 10), exactly in the same way as in the Brāhmaṇa passages quoted above (note on § 3) pūrvā paurṇamāsī is opposed to uttarā paurṇamāsī. The second and third cases are those of the full moon rising (shortly) after sunset, and of the moon becoming full when standing high in the sky.

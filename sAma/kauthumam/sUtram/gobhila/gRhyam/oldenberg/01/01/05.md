5. [^2]  All (ceremonies) are accompanied by the Anvāhārya (Śrāddha).


[^2]:  I cannot give this translation of the words 'sarvāṇy evānvāhāryavanti' without expressing my doubts as to whether the commentator, whom I have followed, is right. He says: 'anu paścād āhriyate yasmāt prakṛtaṃ karma iti, anu paścād āhriyate yat prastutāt (prakṛtāt?) karmaṇa iti cānvāhāryaṃ nāndīmukhaśrāddhaṃ dakṣiṇā cocyate.' It is evident that the first explanation of anvāhārya as a ceremony after which the chief sacrifice follows, is inadmissible. Below, IV, 4, 3. 4, Gobhila himself defines the Anvāhārya Śrāddha as a monthly ceremony (comp. Manu III, 123; Max Müller, India, p. 240); it is, consequently, different from a Śrāddha accompanying each Gṛhya sacrifice. The Śloka which the commentary quotes from a 'gṛhyāntara' seems to me not to remove the doubt; I think rather that it contains a speculation based on this very passage of Gobhila, taken in the sense in p. 14 which the commentator takes it, and on the Sūtras IV, 4, 3. 4. Thus I rather believe that we ought to understand anvāhārya as a mess of food like that offered after the darśapūrṇamāsau sacrifices to the officiating priests (Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 133), and I propose to translate: All (sacrifices) are followed by (the offering of) the Anvāhārya food (to the priest).

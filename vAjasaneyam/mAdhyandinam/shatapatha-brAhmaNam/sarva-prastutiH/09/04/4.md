3. Having touched the middle enclosing-stick [^egg_435], he mutters this formula (Vāj. S. XVIII, 51), 'The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!'--might means strength: thus, 'The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with ghee;'--'the heavenly bird, great in vigour,'--for that (fire-altar) is indeed a heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke [^egg_436];--'Thereby we will go to the region of the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!'--The firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'Thereby we will go to the region, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly world, beyond the highest firmament.'

[^egg_435]: 250:2 That is, the one along the hind (or west) side of the Āhavanīya fire on the great altar, being the base of the triangle formed by the three enclosing-sticks. The order in which they are touched is the same as that in which they were laid down.

8. And when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire [^egg_439]. This, indeed, is that very rite of consecration (or pressing)--and by that he is now consecrated (or pressed)--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated [^egg_440]; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the fire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.

10. Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he yokes it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Yajñāyajñiya stotra [^egg_442],--for the Yajñāyajñiya is the heavenly world, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that he yokes it: thus (he unyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he yoked it.

[^egg_442]: 252:2 The Yajñāyajñiya (or Yajñāyajñīya) stotra is the last and characteristic chant of the Agnishṭoma mode of Soma-sacrifice, whence it is more properly called Agnishṭoma-sāman; the Yajñāyajñiya, properly speaking, being the verses, Sāma-v. II, 53, 54, chanted to a particular tune, and generally (though not always) used for the closing chant of the Agnishṭoma.

11. It is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:--were he to unyoke after the Stotra, he would pass beyond that world [^egg_443] and lose it; but when he unyokes prior to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.

[^egg_443]: 252:3 That is, because the Yajñāyajñiya marks, as it were, the end of the (Agnishṭoma) Soma-sacrifice, and anything performed thereafter is, so to speak, outside the sacrifice, or beyond it. Katy. Śr. XVIII, 6, 17 calls it Āgnimāruta stotra, i.e. the chant belonging to the Āgnimāruta-śastra (which has to be recited by the Hotr̥ after that chant); cf. part ii, p. 369 note.

Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Prāyaṇīya [^egg_446] Atirātra, and unyoke it at an Udayanīya, saying, 'The unyoking, surely, is a certain form of completion, and why should we perform a form of completion prior to the completion (of the sacrifice)?' But let him not do this, for day by day this sacrifice is performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day he yokes that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day he thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by day, and unyoke it day by day.

[^egg_446]: 254:1 For the Prāyaṇīya ishṭi (to five deities) of the ordinary Agnishṭoma, see part ii, pp. 47, 48, note. In the present case a special Soma-sacrifice of the Atirātra type would seem to take its place, just as the Pavitra, an Agnishṭoma Soma-sacrifice, at the Rājasūya, took the place of the ordinary Anvārambhaṇīyā ishṭi (or opening offering); see part iii, p. 42. In the same way there would apparently be a special Udayanīya Soma-sacrifice; whilst our author would have the ceremonies of yoking and unyoking of the fire-altar performed on the very day (or days) of the Soma-sacrifice, that is to say, he would have the ordinary Prāyaṇīyeshṭi and Udayanīyeshṭi performed as parts of the principal Soma-day (or days, if there are to be more than one).

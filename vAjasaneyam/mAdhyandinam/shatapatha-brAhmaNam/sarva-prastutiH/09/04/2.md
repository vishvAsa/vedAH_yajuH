[^egg_399]: 237:2 According to Kāty. Śr.

Let him, however, (not) assign it to him (till) the time of the offering-gifts.

[^egg_400]: 237:3 Sāyaṇa takes it to mean 'that horse'; and according to Kāty. Śr. XVIII, 6, 3-5, the carriage is to be carried to the Adhvaryu's house, and, at the time when the dakshiṇās are presented to the priests, it is to be given to that priest along with three horses.

2. They spake, 'Let us gather together food for him: therewith we will appease him!' They gathered for him that food, the Śāntadevatya [^egg_261], and thereby appeased him; and inasmuch as they thereby appeased (śam) the god (deva), it is called Śāntadevatya;--Śāntadevatya, doubtless, is here called mystically 'Śatarudriya [^egg_262],' for the gods love the mystic. And in like manner does this Sacrificer now bestow upon him that highest form, immortality. Flaming he there stands, longing for food. He gathers for him that food, the Śāntadevatya, and thereby appeases him.

3. He offers wild sesamum seeds. He (Agni) grows when he is being built up: he grows for (the consumption) of every kind of food. And wild sesamum seeds represent both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing: inasmuch as they are sesamum seeds they are a cultivated (kind of food), and inasmuch as they ripen on unploughed land they are wild-growing; he thus satisfies him with both kinds of food, the cultivated as well as the wild-growing.

6. And as to why he performs the Śatarudriya offering. When Prajāpati had become disjointed, the deities departed from him. Only one god did not leave him, to wit, Manyu (wrath): extended he remained within. He (Prajāpati) cried, and the tears of him that fell down settled on Manyu. He became the hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra. And the other drops that fell down, spread over these worlds in countless numbers, by thousands; and inasmuch as they originated from crying (rud), they were called Rudras (roarers). That hundred-headed, thousand-eyed, hundred-quivered Rudra, with his bow strung, and his arrow fitted to the string, was inspiring fear, being in quest of food. The gods were afraid of him.

[^egg_264]: 158:1 The site of the altar is enclosed within a continuous line of 261 pariśrits, about half a foot in width, running along its edge. Their height is indeterminate, with the exception of three of them, dug in at the back (west) corner of the left wing, of which one is to reach up to the knee, the second up to the navel, and the third up to the mouth; each of the latter two standing to the left (north) of the preceding one.

18. [Vāj. S.

And in that everything in this second chapter of formulas applies to one and the same deity, thereby he gratifies that (god Rudra), and makes the chief to have a share in the people (or the clan): hence whatever belongs to the people [^egg_271], in that the chieftain has a share. And those (Rudras) that spread over these worlds, countless, by thousands [^egg_272], they are the deities to whom he now offers.

[^egg_273]: 161:1 The calculation here, as so often in regard to metres, is rather a loose one. Anuvāka I, consisting of sixteen verses, is taken as amounting to the first fourscore formulas; anuvākas II and III, consisting of ten kaṇḍikās (each of which is calculated to consist of eight mantras), constitute the second fourscore; anuvākas IV and V again form the third fourscore; anuvākas VI-VIII (save the last four formulas, see parag. 22), the fourth fourscore; and from there to the 'unstringing'-formulas, that is, from within XVI, 46 to 53, the fifth fourscore.

[^egg_276]: 162:1 Thus ('Zerspalter') daridra is probably correctly interpreted (from root 'dar,' to split) by Prof. Weber; whilst the commentators take it in its ordinary sense of 'poor' (i.e. without an assistant, Mahīdh.); blue-red Rudra is called inasmuch as he is the 'nīlakaṇṭḥa' blue-necked, and red all over the rest of his body.

With 'Svāhā' (he makes offering), for the Svāhā is food: with food he thus gratifies them. Thrice (in three turns) he ascends from hence upwards,--that makes six: the significance of this has been explained [^egg_281].

[^egg_281]: 166:1 Of objects numbering six, the seasons commonly occur, e. g. VI, 7, 1, 16.

41. And as to why he descends in three turns,--it is because he ascends in three turns: thus in as many turns as he ascends, in so many turns does he descend.

42. He then throws that arka-leaf [^egg_282] into the pit; for it is therewith that he performs that sacrificial work sacred to Rudra, and that same (leaf) is inauspicious; he now puts it away, lest any one should tread on this inauspicious (leaf), and suffer injury thereby: hence (he throws it) into the pit. And, again, as to why (he throws it) into the pit,--the pit, doubtless, means the fire, and thus that fire consumes it. Now as to the (symbolic) correspondence.

[^egg_282]: 166:2 See paragraph 4. According to Kāty. Śrautas. 18, 1, 6 both offering-utensils (the arka-leaf and the arka-stick) are thrown into the pit.

43. As to this they say, 'How does this Śatarudriya of his attain to (conformity with) the year, and Agni? how does it correspond to the year, to

 Agni?' Well, this Śatarudriya includes three hundred and sixty (formulas); and (other) thirty, and thirty-five. Now, as to the three hundred and sixty which there are, so many are there days in the year: thereby it obtains the days of the year. And as to the thirty (formulas) which there are, they are the thirty nights of the month: thereby it obtains the nights of the month: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And as to the thirty-five (formulas) there are, they are the thirteenth month [^egg_283], (Agni's) self,--the body (consists of) thirty (limbs [^egg_284]), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and off-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year. And in this way this Śatarudriya of his attains to (conformity with) the year, Agni, and corresponds to the year, Agni. And, indeed, in the Śāṇḍila fire-altar as many bricks with formulas attached to them are placed in the middle, for these bricks are indeed the same as these different Agnis (invoked in the Śatarudriya); and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the Śatarudriya.

[^egg_283]: 167:1 As Prof. Weber, 'Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Nakshatra,' p. 298, points out, this passage points to a six years’ period of intercalation, since, in counting 360 days in the year, the remainder accumulates in six years to an intercalary month of thirty-five days (or thirty-six according to Sat. Br. X, 5, 4, 5); and accordingly in Vāj. S. XXX, 15, and Taitt. Ār. IV, 19, 1, the names of the six years of such a period of intercalation are mentioned; while a five years’ period and the names of the respective years are more frequently referred to.

44. As to this they say, 'How does this Śatarudriya of his attain to (conformity with) the Great

 Litany [^egg_285]?--how does it correspond to the Great Litany?' Well, those twenty-five formulas which there are on both sides of the eighties [^egg_286], they are the twenty-five-fold body [^egg_287]; and where the body (of the altar-bird) is, that (includes) the head, and the wings and tail. And what eighties (of formulas) there are (in the Śatarudriya), thereby indeed the (corresponding) eighties (of the Mahad uktham) are obtained, for by eighties the Great Litany is recited. And what there is (in the Śatarudriya) after the eighties that is for him the same as what there, in the Great Litany, is after the eighties [^egg_288]; and in this way this Śatarudriya

[^egg_285]: 168:1 For the mahad uktham, or Great Litany, recited on the Mahāvrata day, see p. 110, note 3. According to Sāyaṇa, however, this does not refer to the Mahad uktham, or Great Litany, itself, but to its Stotra, the Mahāvrata-sāman (cf. note on X, 1, 1, 5), by the chanting of which it is preceded, and which, like the Great Litany itself, is represented as being composed of the different parts of Agni-Prajāpati's bird-shaped body. Now, that part of the chant which corresponds to the god's trunk (ātman) is the only part of this Stotra which is chanted in the Pañcaviṁśastoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, which, indeed, is the characteristic Stoma of the Mahāvrata day, all other Stotras of that rite being chanted in that form. It is, however, doubtful to me whether it is not rather the opening part of the Great Litany itself representing the trunk that is here referred to, and which, indeed, consists of twenty-five verses; cf. F. Max Müller, Upanishads, I, p. 183. Besides, it has always to be borne in mind that the particular arrangement of the Great Litany which the authors of the Brāhmaṇa had before them, may have differed in some respects from those known to us.

[^egg_286]: 168:2 See p. 112, note 1.

[^egg_287]: 168:3 That is, the body with its twenty-four limbs, viz. the two arms, two legs, and the twenty fingers and toes.

[^egg_288]: 168:4 According to Sāyaṇa, the Pañcaviṁśa-stotra, chanted after the Mahad uktham, is here referred to. See p. 111, note 1. Sāyaṇa takes it to refer to the prose-formulas at the end of the Sastra, which, he says, represent the mind (buddhi) of Prajāpati.

of his attains to (conformity with) the Great Litany; in this way it corresponds to the Great Litany.

5. [He sprinkles the stone, with, Vāj. S. XVII, 1], 'The food that is lying in the rock, in the mountain,'--for that food, water, is indeed contained in the rock, in the mountains;--'the drink that is gathered from waters, plants and trees,'--for from all that that drink is indeed gathered;--'that sap and food bring ye unto us, O Maruts, as bountiful givers!'--for the Maruts are the rulers of the rain. With 'In the rock is thy hunger,' he (after watering the altar) sets down (the pitcher on the stone): he thus lays hunger into the stone, whence the stone is not fit for eating. But hard also is the stone, and hard is hunger: he thus puts the hard along with the hard. With, 'In me thy food!' he takes up (the pitcher): he thereby takes up the food into his own self. Thus (he does) a second and a third time.

He may say, 'Let thy pain enter so-and-so!' naming him whom he hates, and then he has no longer any hold upon him; but let him take no notice of this, for indicated of himself is he whom he who knows this hates. If it [^egg_293] should remain unbroken, let him bid (the Pratiprasthātr̥) to break it; for only when it is broken, the pain enters him whom he hates. They return (to the altar) without looking back: they thus leave pain and evil behind without looking back to them.

22. They (the waters) said to Prajāpati, 'Whatever moisture [^egg_298] we had, has gone down.' He said, 'This tree shall know it!'--he shall know (vettu), he shall taste it (saṁ vettu)--that one, indeed, they mystically call 'vetasa' (bamboo), for the gods love the mystic. And because they said, 'Down (avāk) has gone our moisture (ka),' they became avākkās;--'avākkās,' they mystically call 'avakās (lotuses),' for the gods love the mystic. These, then, are those three kinds of water, to wit, the frog, the lotus-flower, and the bamboo-shoot: by means of these three kinds of water he appeases him.

[^egg_298]: 175:1 Thus, or essence (raśa), according to Sāyaṇa; cf. X, 6, 5, 1. The word 'ka' has, however, also the meaning 'joy.'

On the body (of the altar) he sings, for the heart is in the body;--at the armpit [^egg_305], for the heart is in (the vicinity of) the armpit;--

[^egg_304]: 180:1 The Prajāpati-hr̥daya, or Prajāpater hr̥dayam, as figured for chanting, is given, Sāma-v. Calc. ed. vol. ii, p. 499. It consists of the words, imāḥ prajāḥ prajāpate(r) hr̥dayam prajārūpam ajījane, with inserted stobhas and modulations. It is followed by a simpler form, which is perhaps the one used on the present occasion.

[^egg_305]: 180:2 Viz. on the place where the right wing joins the body of the altar. According to other authorities, the Śyaita hymn-tune is likewise to be sung near the left arm-pit (or, according to Sāṇḍilya, at the place where the Adhvaryu mounts the altar). For other variations, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 276. I do not think that the ritual of the White Yajus, in omitting the left arm-pit, shows any gap or inconsistency, since the right arm-pit is marked out, not for any bodily parallelism, but for the simple reason that it is supposed to indicate the position of the heart. Whilst all the other places on which hymns are sung are essential parts of the bird Agni, the arm-pit is not an essential part, but is merely indicative of the central organ of the body. Lāṭy. I, 5, 11 seqq. supplies the following directions, apparently implying a somewhat different order of procedure from that followed in our text: He passes along the south, and whilst standing (east of the altar) with his face towards the west, he sings the Gāyatra at the head. Returning, he sings the Rathantara at the right wing. Going round behind, he sings the Br̥hat at the left wing. Going back, and standing behind the tail, with his face towards the east, he sings the Yajñāyajñiya. The Vāmadevya he sings at the right, and the Prajāpati-hr̥daya at the left, arm-pit. Then follow different views held by different teachers.--With this ceremony, by which homage is paid to the different parts of Agni-Prajāpati's body, compare the similar, but more elaborate, ceremony of the Parimādaḥ at the Mahāvrata, X, 1, 2, 9 with note.

at the right armpit, for the heart is nearer thereto [^egg_306]: he thus makes the sun his (Agni's) heart, and that heart of his he thus makes boneless and immortal.

[^egg_306]: 181:1 That is, by taking the auricles as parts of the heart.

41. He sings about offspring (prajā) and Prajāpati (the lord of creatures and procreation);--when he sings about offspring, he lays the heart into offspring; and when he sings about Prajāpati, he lays the heart into Agni.

42. And, again, as to why he sings about offspring and Prajāpati;--this Agni, doubtless, is both offspring and the lord of offspring, and hence, when he sings about Agni, he lays the heart both into the offspring and into the lord of offspring.

43. These (hymns) are the immortal bricks; he lays them down last (highest) of all:--he thereby makes immortality the highest thing of all this (universe), and hence immortality is the highest thing of all this (universe). Let none other but the Adhvaryu [^egg_307] sing; for these (hymns) are bricks, and he (Agni, the fire-altar) would be built up in the wrong way [^egg_308], were any other than the Adhvaryu to sing.

[^egg_307]: 181:2 According to Lāṭy. I, 5, 1 seq., it is the Prastotr̥ who sings these sāmans. A similar conflict of competence in this respect is referred to not only in regard to detached sāmans (cf. Kāty. IV, 9, 6-9), but even in regard to such solemn performances as the chanting of the Mahāvrata-sāman (cf. note on X, 1, 1, 5).

[^egg_308]: 181:3 Vi-cita, in this sense, appears to be a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Sāyaṇa seems to have read vijita (parābhūta, defeated) instead.

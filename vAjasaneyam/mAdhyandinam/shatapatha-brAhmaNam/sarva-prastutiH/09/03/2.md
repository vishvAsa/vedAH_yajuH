1. Thereupon [^egg_353] he (the Sacrificer [^egg_354]) offers the Vasor dhārā. That whole Agni has now been completed, and he is here the Vasu (good one): to that Vasu the gods offered this shower (dhārā), whence it is called 'Vasor dhārā [^egg_355];' and in like manner this (Sacrificer) offers to him this shower, and gratifies him thereby.

[^egg_353]: 213:1 That is, after offering all the seven Māruta cakes, the formulas of the last six of which (Vāj. S. XVII, 81-85; XXXIX, 7) are not given in the Brāhmaṇa. At the end the Adhvaryu mutters the verse XVII, 86, and thereupon he either makes the Sacrificer mutter (or mutters himself) verses 87-99 in praise of Agni. Kāty. Śr. XVIII, 4, 25; 26.

[^egg_354]: 213:2 Thus, according to Kāty. XVIII, 5, 1 (the Adhvaryu, according to Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 283).

[^egg_355]: 213:3 It would rather seem to mean 'stream, or shower, of wealth;' cf. paragraph 4.

2. And, again, as to why he offers the 'Vasor dhārā;'--this is his (Agni's) Abhisheka [^egg_356]; for the

[^egg_356]: 213:4 That is, the consecration ceremony, in which the king is sprinkled' with sacred water, or, so to speak, anointed. The 'Vasor dhārā,' or 'shower of wealth,' consisting of an uninterrupted series of 401 libations to Agni (through which all the powers of the god are to be secured to the Sacrificer), is intended as the  equivalent of that ceremony for the consecration of Agni as king; and, indeed, as a kind of superior consecration ceremony for the (royal) Sacrificer himself, more potent than the Rājasūya and Vājapeya. There is thus to be noticed here the same tendency as elsewhere of exalting the efficacy of the Agnicayana, and of making it take the place of the whole of the ordinary sacrificial ceremonial.

gods, having now completed him wholly and entirely, showered upon him those wishes (or, objects of desire), this 'Vasor dhārā;' and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has completed him wholly and entirely, shower upon him those wishes, this 'Vasor dhārā.' With ghee taken in five ladlings, and an offering-ladle of udumbara wood (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.

3. [He offers it] after offering the Vaiśvānara (cake)--for the Vaiśvānara is the head, and food is taken in from the head.

[^egg_357]: 214:1 When anointed, or consecrated, the king is first sprinkled from the front and then from behind, and finally rubbed all over, with the consecrated water; see V, 4, 2, 1 seq.

And everything here is wealth (vasu), for all these (cake-offerings) are (connected with special) wishes [^egg_359]; and in order that this shower, be it of milk or of ghee, (may be) fraught with wealth, this oblation of ghee is thus offered for the beginning; and inasmuch as this shower is fraught with wealth, it is called 'shower of wealth.'

Now the gods, having gratified him (Agni) by this food, or by these objects of desire [^egg_360], and having anointed him by this shower of wealth, solicited from him these objects of desire [^egg_361]; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he granted them these objects of desire; and in like manner this (Sacrificer), having gratified him by this food, and by these offerings of desire, and anointed him with this shower of wealth, now solicits from him these objects of desire; and having received offering, and being gratified and anointed, he (Agni) grants him these objects of desire. In order to avoid discontinuance, he each time embraces two wishes,--even as one would connect those living away from one another,--thinking, 'In this way shall they prosper by sacrifice!'

In twelve (things) he causes them to prosper [^egg_362], the year consists of twelve months, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies him, and by so much food he thus consecrates him. In fourteen he causes them to prosper; in eight he causes them to prosper; in ten he causes them to prosper; in thirteen he causes them to prosper.

1. He then offers the Vaiśvānara (cake). That Agni has now been completely restored; he now is that deity, (Agni) Vaiśvānara (belonging to all men): to him he offers this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him a deity, for whatever deity an oblation is prepared that is a deity, but not one for whom no (oblation) is prepared. It is one of twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and Vaiśvānara is the year.

2. And, again, as to why he offers the Vaiśvānara (cake),--it is as the Vaiśvānara that he is about to produce that Agni: on that former occasion, at the initiation-offering [^egg_347], he pours him out in the form of seed: and what the seed is like that is poured.

[^egg_347]: 207:1 Cp. VI, 6, 1, 6. Whilst the initiation-offering of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice consists only of a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vishṇu, that of the Agnicayana requires two further oblations, viz. a cake on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvānara, and a rice-pap with ghee to the Ādityas; cf. part iii, p. 247 note.

into the womb, such like (is the child that) is born; and inasmuch as there he pours out Vaiśvānara in the form of seed, therefore he now is born as Vaiśvānara. Silently [^egg_348] it is (performed) there, for there seed (is implied) in the sacrifice, and silently seed is infused; but distinctly on the present occasion, for distinct (manifest) is the seed when born.

[^egg_348]: 208:1 Or, rather, in a low voice, the name of the deity being pronounced in an undertone while the oblation is poured into the fire; see VI, 6, 1, 11. No special formula is, however, used on either occasion.

10. Now, the first two Māruta (oblations) he offers are these two vital airs (in the ears): he offers them in the middle [^egg_350] of the Vaiśvānara (oblations), for these two vital airs are in the middle of the head.

[^egg_350]: 209:2 In baking the cakes, the Vaiśvānara is placed on the centre of the fire, and the first two Māruta cakes are placed north and south of it, then the following pair of cakes behind the first, but more closely together, and behind these the third pair, still more closely together, and finally the last cake forming, as it were, the apex of a phalanx of Māruta cakes (or wind-deities) protecting (that of) Agni Vaiśvānara. In offering the cakes a similar method is to be followed; except that the first pair of Māruta cakes may be offered, not in the fire itself, but on the previously flattened out Vaiśvānara cake lying on the fire. Whilst the Kātīya-sūtra (XVIII, 4, 23) admits this as an alternative mode (though not very clearly expressed), our passage seems to require it as the only possible mode. Both the Vaiśvānara and the Māruta cakes are offered whole.

The one to be recited in the forest [^egg_351] is speech: it is to be recited in the forest, for by speech one gets into much terrible (trouble).

[^egg_351]: 210:1 'Araṇyenūcya' is the technical term applied to the odd, or seventh, Māruta oblation. According to Sāyaṇa it is so called after an anuvāka of the Saṁhitā, to be recited only in the forest. Possibly, however, it is to the particular formula (Vāj. S. XXXIX, 7), also called 'vimukha' (? to be pronounced 'with averted face'), and containing the names of the seven most terrible Maruts, that the name applies.

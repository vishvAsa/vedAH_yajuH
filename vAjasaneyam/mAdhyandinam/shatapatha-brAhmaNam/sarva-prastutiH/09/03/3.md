1. He then offers these Yajñakratus [^egg_366] (sacrificial rites), with,' May the Agni and the Gharma (prosper) for me!'--by these sacrificial rites he thus gratifies him, and by these sacrificial rites he thus consecrates him.

[^egg_366]: 217:1 These are two sets of libations in the formulas of which (XVIII, 22; 23) objects connected with 'special sacrifices' are enumerated. Thus, of the first pair, 'Agni and Gharma,' 'Agni,' according to Mahīdhara, represents either the Agnicayana or the Agnishṭoma (ordinary Soma-sacrifice); whilst the 'Gharma (cauldron)' stands for the Pravargya offering (part i, p. 44 note).

He then offers (the libations relating to) the Uneven Stomas [^egg_367];--for the gods, having now obtained their desires, by means of the uneven Stomas went up to heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, now that he has obtained all his desires, by means of the uneven Stomas go up to heaven.

[^egg_367]: 217:2 The formula of this set of libations (XVIII, 24) enumerates the seventeen uneven numbers (in the feminine gender) from 1 to 33, repeating the second number of each pair, so as to be the first number of the next pair (thus, 1 and 3, 3 and 5, &c.). These numbers are meant to represent the corresponding Stomas, consisting of an uneven number of verses, up to the Trayastriṁśa, or thirty-three-versed hymn-form.

[^egg_370]: 219:1 This set of thirteen libations (XVIII, 28) is offered to the months Vāja, Prasava, &c., here apparently considered as manifestations of Agni (the year).

[^egg_371]: 220:1 This final set of twelve (? sixteen) libations is called thus (kalpa), because, in the formulas used with them (Vāj. S.

esoterically the same as the Vashaṭ-call, and either with the Vashaṭ-call, or the Svāhā-call is food offered to the gods: he thus gratifies him by both the Vashaṭ and the Svāhā, and also consecrates him by both of them.

Well, this shower of wealth consists of three hundred and sixty (libations), and of (other) six, and of thirty-five. Now, the three hundred and sixty which there are,--so many being the days in the year,--thereby it obtains the days of the year. And what six there are,--the seasons being

six in number,--thereby it obtains the nights of the seasons: thus it obtains both the days and nights of the year. And what thirty-five there are, they are the (intercalary) thirteenth month [^egg_372], and that is the body,--the body (consists) of thirty (limbs), the feet of two, the breath of two (in-breathing and up-breathing), and the head is the thirty-fifth: so much is the year; and thus that shower of wealth of his obtains (conformity with) the year, and Agni; and thus it corresponds to the year, to Agni. And so many are the bricks with special formulas which are placed in the centre of a Śāṇḍila fire-altar; for these bricks indeed are the same as these different Agnis [^egg_373]; and thus these Agnis of his come to have oblations offered to them separately by means of the shower of wealth.

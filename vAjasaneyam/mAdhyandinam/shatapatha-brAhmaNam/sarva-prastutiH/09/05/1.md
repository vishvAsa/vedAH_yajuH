19. They prepared the Initiation-offering. But the Asuras became aware of it, and said, 'Having made up the sacrifice, the gods are now spreading out that truth: come, let us fetch hither what was ours!'

The gods, espying the Asuras, snatched up the sacrifice, and began doing something else [^egg_453]. They (the Asuras) went away again, thinking, 'It is something else they are doing.'

[^egg_452]: 258:3 See III, 1, 3, 6, where the injunction is given that no Samishṭayajus should be performed for the Dīkshaṇīyeshṭi, 'lest he who has put on the garment of initiation should reach the end of the sacrifice before its completion; for the Samishṭayajus is the end of the sacrifice.' It should be remembered that the initiation-offering, however essential, is merely a preliminary ceremony of the Soma-sacrifice, at the end of which latter sacrifice nine Samishṭayajus oblations are offered (IV, 4, 4, 1 seq.) instead of the single one offered at the ordinary haviryajña. The term signifies 'the formula (yajus) of the completed offering (samishṭa).'

[^egg_453]: 258:4 Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 429, makes this last clause part of the Asuras’ speech or  thoughts,--'one thing they have undertaken to do, and another they are doing.' This can hardly be right.

Whilst meditating, they saw these Samishṭayajus (oblations), and offered them, and thereby completed those sacrifices; and inasmuch as thereby they completed (saṁsthāpaya) them, they are 'saṁsthitayajus'; and inasmuch as thereby they sacrificed completely (saṁ-yaj [^egg_461]), they are 'samishṭayajus.'

[^egg_461]: 261:3 Cf. IV, 4, 4, 6. For whatever deities this sacrifice is performed, they all are thereby 'sacrificed-to together' (sam-ishṭa); and because, after all those (deities) have been 'sacrificed-to together,' he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called Samishṭayajus.

[^egg_484]: 267:4 Mahīdhara (and apparently Sāyaṇa) seems to supply 'yajamānam' to 'etam,' and construe thus: 'Unto thee, O heavenly sent, I commit this (Sacrificer), which treasure Jātavedas shall bring thither.'

[^egg_485]: 267:5 'O gods, honour ye him (the Sacrificer)!' Mahīdhara; but perhaps the R̥shis are addressed in this second line. Mahīdhara takes 'atra' ('here') along with 'parame vyoman'--'in this highest heaven.'

Having given a name to him, he reverently approaches him; for this (Sacrificer) builds him with his (own) whole self, and were he not to give utterance now to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) would now take away his (the Sacrificer's) self; but when he now gives utterance to this surrender of his own self, he (Agni) does not take away his self. [He approaches the fire] with the Anushṭubh verse (Vāj. S. XVIII, 67), 'What fires of the five races of men there are upon this earth,--thou art the chiefest of them: quicken us unto life!'--the Anushṭubh, doubtless, is speech, and all the metres are speech [^egg_489]: he thus makes amends to him (Agni) by all the metres. Having stood by the fire, and lifted [^egg_490] it, and churned it out, he offers the completing oblation [^egg_491].

[^egg_491]: 269:4 The Udavasānīyā-ishṭi, consisting of a cake on five potsherds for Agni (or a libation of ghee taken in five ladlings for Vishṇu), is the same as for the Soma-sacrifice, IV, 5, I, 13.

He need only lay down the Punaściti; for this is a repeated sacrifice (punar-yajña), it is a later (higher) worship of the gods: it is thus a repeated sacrifice and the higher worship of the gods he thereby arranges, and the repeated sacrifice inclines to him [^egg_498]!--so (they say), but let him not do this,

[^egg_498]: 271:5 Though there is nothing in the text to show where this quotation  begins, it would seem, from Kātyāyana's rules, that it runs from the beginning of paragraph 58,--XVIII, 6, 33. In case of inability (to perform a second) cityā, at a repeated Soma-sacrifice, (he may lay down) one or other kind of the Svayamātr̥ṇṇās, Viśvajyotishas, or R̥tavyās; 34. The Punaściti; 35. Or no building (at all a second time); 36. Because the (Agni) Citya has become the Āhavanīya.

for, indeed, whenever Agni is placed on the built (altar), this whole Agni passes into that very brick [^egg_499]: thus whenever he offers in the fire, then these oblations of his will be offered even as would be his oblations, when offered on a complete Śāṇḍila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.

[^egg_499]: 272:1 That is (as would seem from Sāyaṇa's interpretation), into the Āhavanīya fire, considered as the last brick of the altar; and hence the Sacrificer's offering-fire will for ever thereafter remain for him the Citya Agni.

68. And, indeed, let him by all means build who was born a year (after conception); for Agni is the breath; it is thus him (Agni) he holds. And, indeed, as the breath, he enters into the infused seed, and takes possession of it; and inasmuch as he takes possession (vid) of every one that is born (jāta), he is Jātavedas. Wherefore by all means let even one who knows this build him as one ever carried (within him). And, indeed, if one who knows this either drinks (Soma), or offers drink to any one else, these libations of his will be offered even as would be his libations, when offered on a complete Śāṇḍila fire-altar built up with wings and tail.

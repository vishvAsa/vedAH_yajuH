1. On the day of preparation, early in the morning, when the sun has risen, he releases his speech.

 Having released his speech, he takes clarified butter, in five ladlings, and throws five chips of gold thereon. Then these three (materials), sour curds, honey and ghee, are poured together, either into a dish, or a pot with a wide mouth; and he puts a handful of sacrificial grass thereon.

2. He then mounts the fire-altar, with (Vāj. S. XVII, II), 'Homage be to thy heat, thy fire [^egg_309]! homage be to thy flame!'--for that Agni has now been completely restored, and he now is equal to injuring whomever he might wish to injure; and whomever he injures, he injures either by his heat, or by his fire, or by his flame; in this way he does not injure him thereby (etaiḥ);--'Let thy darts burn others than us! unto us be thou bright and propitious!' as the text, so the sense.

[^egg_309]: 182:1 Or, 'Homage be to thy burning (consuming) fire!' as Mahīdhara takes 'harase śocishe,' and perhaps also the Brāhmaṇa, though 'etaiḥ,' used in reference to Agni's weapons, would rather seem to indicate a plurality of them.

thereby gratifies the fire which is in plants [^egg_314];--'To the wood-seated, veṭ!'--he thereby gratifies the fire which is in trees;--'To the heaven-winning, veṭ!'--the heaven-winning one is this Agni (citya): it is this Agni he thereby gratifies.

9. And as to why he says, 'To the man-seated, veṭ! To the water-seated, veṭ!' &c., these are names of this Agni: these names he thereby pleases.

1. Being about to build the Gārhapatya (fire-place), he sweeps (its site) with a Palāśa (butea frondosa) branch. For when he builds the Gārhapatya [^egg_554] he settles on that place; and whatsoever builders of fire-altars (there have been), they are indeed settled on this earth; and when he sweeps (that place) he thereby sweeps away those settled (there before hire), thinking, 'Lest I should settle on those already settled (here).'

[^egg_554]: 298:1 That is, 'the householder's fire,' which represents the Sacrificer's domestic hearth.

2. [He sweeps, with Vāj. S.

[^egg_555]: 298:2 This first pāda is taken from R̥k S. X, 14, 9. The four pādas of the verse are muttered by the Adhvaryu while sweeping the four sides of the site respectively, beginning in the east and ending in the north. On this place when swept the circular site of the Gārhapatya is then marked off by saline soil being scattered over it (cf. Taitt. S. V, 2, 3, 2-3).

7. And again why he scatters saline soil. Prajāpati created creatures; he created them with different kinds of amnions: they did not agree together. He desired, 'May they agree together!' He made them to be of the same (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they agree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, 'May I be (born) with the same (kind of) amnion as the gods!' and when he scatters saline salt (in the hearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.

[^egg_558]: 300:1 Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. IV, 2, 4, takes 'saṁjñānam' in the sense of 'knowledge, recognition;' explaining it from the fact that cattle by their smell recognise the places of saline soil and lick them.

11. [He scatters it, with Vāj. S. XII, 46] 'Agni's ashes thou art! Agni's soil thou art!' for Agni's ashes are useless, and the sand is not useless: he thus makes it (the Gārhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with it the whole Gārhapatya; for the

 Gārhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he thus fills the whole womb with seed.

13. And, again, why he encloses it with enclosing-stones;--the Gārhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are the waters: he thus surrounds this world with water,--it is with the ocean that he thus surrounds it on all sides, and hence the ocean flows round this world on all sides. (He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south) [^egg_561], whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;--by means of a dug out (hole, or moat) [^egg_562], whence the ocean flows round this world in a moat.

He does not settle them, for unsettled are the waters; nor does he pronounce the Sūdadohas (verse) on them [^egg_563].

[^egg_563]: 301:3 The two ceremonies here referred to, viz. the 'sādana' (settling, setting, steadying, viz. by means of the formula, XII, 53, 'with the help of that deity lie thou steady, like Aṅgiras,' see VII, 1, 1, 30) and the muttering of the Sūdadohas verse (Vāj.

It (the Gārhapatya hearth) measures a fathom (in diameter [^egg_587]), for man is a fathom high, and man is Prajāpati (the lord of generation), and Prajāpati is Agni: he thus makes the womb of equal size to his (Agni's) body. It is circular, for the womb is circular; and moreover the Gārhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and this world doubtless is circular.

[^egg_587]: 309:5 Or rather, it is a circle corresponding in area to a square of one fathom; which gives a diameter somewhat exceeding in length a fathom (that is, the space between the tips of the middle fingers when the arms are extended). The measurement is (at least theoretically) a relative one, being adapted to the Sacrificer's size; but practically the fathom (vyāma, or purusha, man) may be taken to be of about 6 feet, the vyāma being equal to 4 aratnis (cubits) of 2 prādeśas (spans of some 18 inches each).

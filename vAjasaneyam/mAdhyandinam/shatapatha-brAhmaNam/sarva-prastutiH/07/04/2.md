1. He puts a Svayam-ātr̥ṇṇā (naturally-perforated brick) on (the gold man);--the (first) naturally-perforated one being this earth, he thus puts this earth thereon. He puts it on so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one means food, and the naturally-perforated one means this earth, and this earth is food, since it is on her that all food ripens: he thus places food close to him (the man, Agni). Upon (the man he puts it): he thus places the food upon him [^egg_695].

[^egg_695]: 377:1 ? Viz. inasmuch as the food is introduced into the body from above. It might also mean, he makes the food superior to the body, inasmuch as the body cannot exist without it. Similarly as regards the breath in the next paragraph.

2. And, again, why he puts on a naturally-perforated one;--the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath (or vital air), for the breath thus bores itself (svayam ātr̥ntte) through the body: it is breath he thus bestows on it. He puts it so as not to be separate from the man; for the naturally-perforated one is the breath, and the naturally-perforated one is this earth, and this earth is the breath, since this earth bears everything that breathes: he thus puts the breath so as not to be separate from him. Upon (the man he places the brick): he thus puts the breath upon him [^egg_695].

4. Now that Prajāpati who became disjointed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and that resting-place (or, foundation) is this first

naturally-perforated (brick);--thus when he now puts it on, he thereby puts upon this (altar-site) that (foundation [^egg_696]) which there was for his body: that is why he now puts it on.

[^egg_696]: 378:1 The 'pratishṭḥā' (basis) of the bird-shaped Agni includes the parts on which the bird stands or sits, viz. the feet, and the hind-part of the body. Sāyaṇa, on the other hand, takes it to mean the 'puṁliṅga,' which seems very improbable.

5. He puts it on by means of Prajāpati, for Prajāpati thereby took back to himself (that foundation) of his body. [Vāj. S. XIII, 16] 'Steady thou art,' that is, 'Firm thou art, or established thou art;'--'supporting,' for that which supports is a foundation;--'laid down by Viśvakarman;' Viśvakarman is Prajāpati, thus, 'laid down by that one;'--'May the ocean, may the bird not injure thee!' the ocean doubtless is the gold plate, and the bird is the man: thus, 'May those two not injure thee!'--'Not shaking, steady thou the earth!' as the text, so the meaning.

20. Here now they say, 'How do those two bodies of his come to be connected together by the breath, and not severed?' Well, the naturally-perforated (brick) is the breath, and the dūrvā-brick is the breath, and the dviyajus (-brick) is the Sacrificer:

and inasmuch as he lays down the dūrvā-brick close to the naturally-perforated one, he thereby connects and joins breath with breath; and inasmuch as he lays down the dviyajus one close to the dūrvā-brick--the dūrvā-brick being the breath, and the dviyajus the Sacrificer--those two bodies of his (the human one and the divine one) thus become connected together by the breath, and not severed.

With two (verses) he lays it down: the significance of this has been explained.

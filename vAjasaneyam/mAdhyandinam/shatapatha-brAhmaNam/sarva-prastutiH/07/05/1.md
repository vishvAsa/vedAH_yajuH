1. He then puts down a (living) tortoise;--the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters [^egg_720]: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.

4. [He anoints it, with Vāj. S. XIII, 27-29; R̥k S. I, 90, 6-8] 'Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey may the plants be for us!--Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the region of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!--rich in honey may the tree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!' To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Yajus formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is [^egg_721]. This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gāyatrī verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

6. Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards the back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the east

looking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in the east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Ashāḍḥā (he places it), for the tortoise (kūrma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashāḍḥā a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;--at a cubit's distance [^egg_722], for at a cubit's distance the male lies by the female. That Ashāḍḥā is the consecrated queen (mahishī) of all the bricks, hence being on the right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all the bricks.

7. And, again, why he puts down a tortoise;--the tortoise (kūrma) is the breath, for the breath makes (kar) all these creatures: it is breath he thus puts into him (Agni). He puts it down in front looking towards the back: he thus puts in the breath in front tending towards the back; whence the breath is taken in from the front backwards. [He puts it down so as to be] turned towards the (gold) man: he thus puts breath into the Sacrificer. South of the Ashāḍḥā (he puts it), for the tortoise is breath, and the Ashāḍḥā speech; and the breath (prāṇa, masc.) is the male, the mate, of speech (vāc, fem.).

28. Thereupon, having pounded the remainder (of the clay), and having put the fire-pan in its place, he throws (the pounded clay) in front of the fire-pan; for this is the place of that (remainder [^egg_729]), and thus that (remainder) is not separated therefrom [^egg_730].

[^egg_729]: 397:2 ? Or, of it (the fire-pan). There is some uncertainty regarding this item of the ceremonial. Kātyāyana's rule (XVII, 5, 4)--'Having placed the Ukhā (pan) on the mortar, pounded the remainder of clay, and thrown it down in front, with the text "Dhruvā asi," (of) the Ukhā'--is evidently intentionally vague. Mahīdhara (on Vāj. S. XIII, 34) gives the following interpretation of it,--'Having first silently placed the Ukhā on the mortar, then pounded the remaining clay, and thrown it down on the ground in front of the Ukhā, let him place the Ukhā thereon with two formulas.' According to this, the Ukhā would only temporarily be placed on the mortar, its proper and permanent place (loka) being on the powdered clay in front (to the east) of the mortar. The text of the Brāhmaṇa, as it stands, however, cannot possibly be construed so as to accord with Mahīdhara's interpretation. This would require some such reading as,--athopaśayām pishṭvā, purastād ukhāyā upanivapya lokabhājam ukhām karoti. See, however, paragraph 38 below, which evidently applies to the permanent position of the pan.

[^egg_730]: 397:3 For the genitive 'asya' (viz. lokasya) with 'antarita'--instead  of the more usual ablative--see VI, 2, 2, 38, 'prāṇasya tad antariyāt.'

The St. Petersburg dictionary proposes the meaning, 'to do something with reference to (or, for the benefit of).' The proper German meaning would rather seem to be 'bearbeiten.'

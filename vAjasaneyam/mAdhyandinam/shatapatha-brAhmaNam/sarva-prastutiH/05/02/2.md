1. He now proceeds with the Bārhaspatya pap. Its svishṭakr̥t remains yet unoffered, when he (the Adhvaryu) brings [^egg_86] him (the Sacrificer) some food; for he who offers the Vājapeya wins food, vājapeya being the same as anna-peya: thus whatever food he (the Sacrificer) has thereby gained, that he (the Adhvaryu) now brings to him.

[^egg_86]: 36:2 He collects (sambharati), or provides food for him; this ceremony corresponding to that of equipping or provisioning the sacred fire with the so-called sambharas, at the Agny-ādhāna; see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.; part i, p. 276, note 1.

3. Now some bring seventeen kinds of food,

saying, 'Seventeenfold is Prajāpati.' But let him not do so: surely all the food is not appropriated to Prajāpati [^egg_87], and, compared to him, what is man that he should appropriate to himself all food? Hence, while bringing every kind of food that occurs to him, let him not bring of some one (particular) kind of food.

[^egg_87]: 37:1 Or 'from Prajāpati;' or perhaps, 'surely not all Prajāpati's food is appropriated.' The Kāṇva recension reads thus, VI, 2, 3, 3. He first brings water, then milk, then, as they occur to him (other) kinds of food. 'Let him bring those seventeen kinds of food,' they say, for Prajāpati is seventeenfold.' Nevertheless (tadu) let him bring whatever kinds of food he can either think of or obtain. 4. Of this his food that has been brought together, let him set aside (uddharet) one (particular kind of) food: let him forswear that (tad udbruvīta), and not eat of it as long as he lives (yāvaj jīvet). By that much also (or, even so long, tāvad api vai prājapateḥ sarvam annam anavaruddham) all the food of Prajāpati is not appropriated; and who is man (compared) to him, that he should appropriate to himself all food? Thus he does not go to the end, thus he lives long: that (food) is here left over for his offspring (or people).

See p. 2, note 1. In the Black Yajus ritual these oblations are called 'Annahomāḥ' or food-oblations. Taitt. Br. I, 3, 8, 1. The Sūtras seem, however, likewise to use the term 'Vājaprasavanīya' (or Vājaprasavīya).

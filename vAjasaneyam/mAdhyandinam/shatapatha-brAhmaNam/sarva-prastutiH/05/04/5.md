2. He stole after it with those deities [^egg_220],--with Savitr̥, the impeller (prasavitr̥); with Sarasvatī, speech; with Tvashṭr̥, the forms of being; with Pūshan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him [^egg_221] (the Sacrificer); with Br̥haspati, holiness; with Varuṇa, might; with Agni, fiery spirit; with Soma, the King;

[^egg_220]: 113:1 In the Black Yajus ritual the order of deities to whom the 'saṁsr̥pāṁ havīṁshi' are offered is as follows,--Agni, Sarasvatī, Savitr̥, Pūshan, Br̥haspati, Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Tvashṭr̥, Vishṇu. Cf. Taitt. S. I, 8, 17; Taitt. Br. I, 8, 1.

[^egg_221]: 113:2 Or, with Indra, for (the lost vigour) itself. Hardly, 'for us.' The Kāṇva text has 'indreṇāsmai,' and so Sāyaṇa (MS. I. O 657): asmai apasr̥tāya vīryāya tadadhīnakaraṇārtham indreṇa; yad vā vibhaktivyatyayaḥ, anena vīryeṇa vīryavatā indreṇa.

 --but only through Vishṇu [^egg_222], the tenth deity, he found it.

3. And because he there stole after (anu-sam-sr̥p) with those deities, hence the name Saṁsr̥paḥ. And because he becomes consecrated on the tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Daśapeya [^egg_223]. And because each time ten (men) steal along [^egg_224] after each cup, therefore also it is called Daśapeya.

[^egg_223]: 114:2 That is, daśa (ten) and peya (drink, beverage).

[^egg_224]: 114:3 For an explanation of the noiseless mode of moving with bent bodies, called sarpaṇam, 'creeping,' see part ii, pp. 299, 450. It is in this way they are to move when they betake themselves to the respective fire-places for performing the saṁsr̥p oblations; as they also do when betaking themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the Soma-feast on the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten cups (camasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten Brāhmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas--there being thus altogether one hundred Brāhmans taking part in these potations. The contents of the Sacrificer's cup, on the other hand, may be drunk by ten Rajanyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See Kāty. XV, 8, 18-20; Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 179.

At the Daśapeya, the ten Saṁsr̥p-oblations take as it were the place of the ordinary Upasads, the latter being performed on the last three preliminary days along with, and to the same deities as, the last three Saṁsr̥p-oblations; or, according to some authorities,  being substituted for them. There seems also some difference of opinion as to the exact time when the other preliminary ceremonies--the procession and entrance of king Soma, the guest-meal, &c.--are to take place, see paragraph 15.--According to Kāty. XV, 8,14, these ceremonies are to take place on the seventh day (which the commentator, however, takes to mean the seventh day of the light fortnight of Caitra; the first seven Saṁsr̥p-oblations being, according to him, performed on the day before). The Kāṇvas, however, perform these offerings on separate days.--The Taittirīya authorities seem also to be at variance with each other as to the exact relation of the Upasads and the last three Saṁsr̥p-oblations, the deities of the two being, according to their scheme, only partly identical. According to Āpastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Saṁsr̥ps are performed on so many days and, moreover, one Dīkshā on the seventh day. Then on the last three days the Saṁsr̥ps and Upasads are combined in this way, that the eighth day's Saṁsr̥p is performed previous to, the ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.--Each of the ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its performance, the first being laid down immediately north of the one used for the Abhishecanīya ceremony, the second immediately north of the first, &c.; the last Saṁsr̥p-oblation being performed in the fire-shed (śālā) of the Daśapeya proper.

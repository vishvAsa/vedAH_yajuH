1. He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vishṇu. Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within Vr̥tra, to wit, the R̥c, the Yajus, and the Sāman. Indra wished to hurl the thunderbolt at him.

2. He said to Vishṇu, 'I will hurl the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, stand thou by me!'--'So be it!' said Vishṇu, 'I will stand by thee: hurl it!' Indra aimed the thunderbolt at him. Vr̥tra was afraid of the raised thunderbolt.

9. He prepares it of both rice and barley. He first puts on (the fire) a ball of rice, that being a form (symbol) of the Yajus-formulas; then one of barley, that being a form of the R̥k-verses; then one of rice, that being a form of the Sāman-hymns. Thus this is made to be a form of the triple science: and this same (offering) becomes the Udavasānīyā-ishṭi (completing oblation) for the performer of the Rājasūya.

For, verily, he who performs the Rājasūya gains for himself (the benefit of) all sacrificial rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; for him the sacrifice becomes as it were exhausted, and he, as it were, turns away from it. Now the whole sacrifice is just as great as that triple Veda; and this (offering) now is made a form of that (Veda, or

sacrifice); this is its womb, its seat: thus he commences once more the sacrifice by means of that triple Veda; and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted, and he does not turn away from it.

16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mānas [^egg_277] each are the sacrificial fee for this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgātr̥), nor recites (like the Hotr̥), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing [^egg_278], and yet it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of a hundred mānas each.

[^egg_277]: 141:2 According to Sāyaṇa, these 'śatamānas' are similar to the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony; see p. 104, note 2. These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, VI, 7, 1, 2 seq.) were apparently used for ornament only, not as coins.

[^egg_278]: 141:3 Sāyaṇa explains this to mean that gold is not used for actual consumption, but only indirectly, as for vessels on which food is served, or in traffic, as a medium of barter;--the gold thus never losing its appearance, its 'glory.' See II, 2, 1, 5, 'Hence also one does not cleanse oneself with it (?), nor does one do anything else with it.'

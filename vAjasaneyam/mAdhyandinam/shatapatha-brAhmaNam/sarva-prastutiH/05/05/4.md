1. There is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the Aśvins [^egg_254], for the Aśvins are reddish-white. There is an ewe with teats in the dewlap [^egg_255] for Sarasvatī; and a bull he seizes for Indra Sutrāman (the good protector) [^egg_256]. Difficult to obtain are beasts with such perfections; if he cannot obtain any

[^egg_254]: 129:1 The last three Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony are not even alluded to by the author, their performance involving no features different from those of the normal Soma-sacrifice. The Vyushṭi-dvirātra, or 'two nights’ ceremony of the dawn,' consists of an Agnishṭoma and an Atirātra Soma-sacrifice, to be performed a month after the Keśavapanīya (or, according to Taitt. Br. I, 8, 10, a fortnight after, viz. on the new-moon, and the first day of the light fortnight respectively). Finally, the Kshatra-dhr̥ti, or 'wielding of the ruling-power,' an Agnishṭoma, is performed a month later, or on the full-moon of Śrāvaṇa (about 1 August). Some authorities, however, allow the Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony to conclude with the Keśavapanīya Atirātra (Kāty. Śr. XV, 9, 26), perhaps for the very reason that no mention is made in the Brāhmaṇa of the remaining three Soma-days. The final Soma-sacrifice is followed, in the succeeding fortnight of the waxing moon, by the performance of the Sautrāmaṇī, some peculiar features of which the author now proceeds to consider. This ceremony (one of the objects of which is the expiation of any excess committed in the consumption of Soma-juice) is considered in the sacrificial system as the last of the seven forms of Haviryajña; being a combination of the ishṭi with the animal sacrifice. As this ceremony is also performed after the Agnicayana, or construction of the fire-altar, it is more fully dealt with by the author later on (Kāṇḍa XII, 7 seq.).

[^egg_255]: 129:2 Prof. R. Wallace's 'India in 1887' (plate 39) contains a photographic representation of an Indian goat with pendicles like teats.

[^egg_256]: 129:3 In the case of the 'somātipavita,' not the 'somavāmin,' the Taittirīyas slaughter a fourth victim to Br̥haspati.

with such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are easier to cook. And if they seize only goats, that for the Aśvins is a red one. Then as to why he performs this sacrifice.

26. He prays (Vāj. S. X, 34; R̥k S. X, 131, 5), 'As the parents (stand by) their son, so the two Aśvins have stood by thee, O Indra, with wise plans and wonderful deeds; when thou quaffedst the cheering (Soma), Sarasvatī cured thee, O Lord, by her services.' Twice the Hotr̥ utters the Vashaṭ, twice the Adhvaryu offers and fetches drink. And if he draw three (cups of liquor), then after the offering of that one the other two are offered.

27. Now there is a pitcher perforated either with a hundred, or with nine, holes. If it is one with a hundred holes,--man lives up to a hundred (years), and has a hundred energies, and a hundred powers: therefore it is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine holes.

And as to why he thus stands by worshipping,--when Soma flowed through Indra, what part of it then went to the Fathers--there being three kinds of Fathers--therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole: therefore he thus stands by worshipping.

[^egg_268]: 136:1 These triplets to the Fathers are given Vāj. S. XIX, 49-51; 55-57; 58-60.--The Taitt. ritual here has a curious variation. After the remainder of the (pure) liquor has been offered to the Fathers, a Brāhman is to be bought over to drink the dregs; and if such an one cannot be found (willing to do it), they are to be poured away on an ant-hill. This is to be done for the sake of atonement.

[^egg_269]: 136:2 That is, according to Kātyāyana (XV, 10, 19) and Sāyaṇa, the paśu-puroḍāśa, or cakes of the animal offering. The performance of these is irregular, inasmuch as their deities are not the same as those of the animal sacrifice (the Aśvins, Sarasvatī, and Indra Sutrāman). Taitt. Br. I, 8, 6, 1, however, explains that in this case the animal sacrifices are without 'animal cakes,' the libations of liquor, which indeed are offered to the same deities, being in lieu of them.

33. And if by that (Sautrāmaṇī-offering) he would heal one purged by Soma [^egg_271], then--(after) the after-offering (of the animal sacrifice) has been performed, and the two spoons separated--he proceeds with those (three) oblations [^egg_272]. For it is towards the back part that Soma flows through, and at the back part (of the sacrifice) he thus closes him up by that sacrificial essence. Let him in that case prepare a cake on two potsherds for the Aśvins; and when he proceeds with the offering of the omenta, then he also proceeds with that two-kapāla cake for the Aśvins.

[^egg_271]: 137:1 That is to say, if it is performed, independently of the Rājasūya, as a special offering with a view to expiating any excess committed at a Soma-sacrifice.

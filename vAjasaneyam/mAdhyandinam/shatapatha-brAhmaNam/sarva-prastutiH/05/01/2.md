2, He then draws the Pr̥shṭḥyas [^egg_37]: and whatever the gods (Agni, Indra, and Sūrya) won by them, even that he wins by them.

[^egg_37]: 6:2 That is, the three Atigrāhyas (part ii, p. 402, note 2), required for the Pr̥shṭḥa-stotras at the midday feast, when performed in their proper 'pr̥shṭḥa' form, as they are at the Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha, and at a Viśvajit-ekāha with all the Pr̥shṭḥas. See IV, 5, 4, 24. The authorities of the Black Yajus adopt a somewhat different arrangement. The Vājapeya cups are likewise called by them Atigrāhyas (Taitt. S. I, 7, 22; T. B. I, 3, 9), and these are apparently drawn by them immediately after the second of the ordinary three Atigrāhyas, the one belonging to Indra (T. S. vol. i, p. 996,--but see ib. p. 1955, where it is stated that they are drawn immediately after the Āgrayaṇa,--that is, probably, if the ordinary Atigrāhyas are not required). Then follows (the third ordinary Atigrāhya?), then the Shoḍaśin, and thereupon the seventeen cups for Prajāpati.--Sāyaṇa remarks on our passage,--teshām (atigrāhyāṇām) prakr̥tigatā tritvasaṁkhyaiva śākhāntaravat saṁkhyāntarānupadeśāt.

11. Now as to why he draws seventeen cups of Soma;--Prajāpati is seventeenfold, Prajāpati is the sacrifice [^egg_39]: as great as the sacrifice is, as great as is

[^egg_39]: 8:1 See I, 5, 2, 17, where the principal formulas used in making oblations are computed as consisting together of seventeen syllables. Pañc. Br. 18, 6 insists especially on the symbolic identity of Prajāpati and the Vājapeya on the double ground that the Vājapeya consists of seventeen stotras, and has for its characteristic mode of chanting the Saptadaśa-stoma, or seventeen-versed hymn. That this is indeed so will appear from a glance at the chief chants. The Bahishpavamāna-stotra, which in the ordinary Agnishṭoma is chanted in the trivr̥t-stoma, consisting of three triplets, or nine verses (see part ii, p. 310), is at the Vājapeya made to consist of seventeen verses, by the insertion of eight verses (S.V. II, 180-82; 186-90) between the second and third triplets. Again, the Mādhyandina-pavamāna, ordinarily chanted in fifteen verses (part ii, p. 333), here consists of seventeen, viz. II, 105-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 663 (one verse); II, 663-4 (sung as triplet, in two tunes = six verses); II, 663, in a different tune again (one verse); II, 821-23  (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. Similarly, the Ārbhava-pavamāna (chanted at the Agnishṭoma also in the Saptadaśa-stoma, cf. part ii, p. 315; but here with modifications) consists of II, 165-7 (sung twice in two tunes = six verses); II, 42, 44 (two verses); II, 47-9 (in two tunes = six verses); II, 720-22 (three verses)--making together seventeen verses. For the similarly constructed Vājapeya hymn see page 11, note 1. See also Lāṭy. Śr. VIII, 11, 15 seq., where the number of officiating priests, as well as that of the various sacrificial fees, is fixed at seventeen. Similarly, Āśv. Śr. IX, 9, 2-3 says that there are either to be seventeen dikshās, or the whole ceremony is to be performed in seventeen days.

For a long-haired man is neither man nor woman; for, being a male, he is not a woman; and being long-haired (a eunuch), he is not a man. And that lead is neither iron nor gold; and the Parisrut-liquor is neither Soma nor Surā [^egg_40]: this is why he buys the Parisrut for a piece of lead from a long-haired man.

[^egg_40]: 9:1 According to Sāyaṇa, the difference between surā and parisrut would seem to be that the former beverage is prepared from mature shoots (of rice, &c.), and the latter from such as are not quite ripe.

[^egg_41]: 10:1 The mounds (khara) thrown up in the havirdhāna cart-shed, are used for placing the cups of Soma (and Surā) after they are drawn, until they are used for the libations. See the plan of the sacrificial ground at the end of part ii; only that on the present occasion there is to be a second mound, for the placing of the Surā-cups, under or just behind the axle of the southern Soma-cart (in the place where the Nārāśaṁsa cups to the Fathers were temporarily deposited at the Agnishṭoma; see III, 6, 2, 25 with note).

[^egg_661]: 265:1 Cf. III, 8, 5, 10, where the text varies slightly--'That they say, we swear by the Inviolable (cows, or waters), by Varuṇa, therefrom deliver us, O Varuṇa!'

 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along,'--the bath, indeed, is that whirlpool (now produced) in the water, and that indeed is either Varuṇa's son or brother: it is him he thereby praises;--'with the help of the gods have I expiated [^egg_662] the sin committed against gods,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against gods;--'with the help of mortals that committed against mortals,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against mortals;--'preserve me, O God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me against all inflictions!'

[^egg_662]: 266:1 Cf. II, 5, 2, 47; IV, 4, 5, 22, where the formula has 'ava ayāsisham' (correct,--'with the help of the gods have I wiped out the sin committed against the gods') instead of 'ava yakshi.'

He walks along without looking back, and approaches the Āhavanīya,--

[^egg_664]: 267:2 Mahīdhara takes 'svar' in the sense of 'svarga,' heaven; whilst the Brāhmaṇa seems rather to take it as referring to the earth or dry land on which the Sacrificer now steps.

[^egg_665]: 268:1 The text of the formula 'edhosy edhishīmahi' is evidently meant to suggest a connection (real or alliterative) between 'edha' (root 'indh') and the final verb (root 'edh').

11. Being about to offer a pap to Aditi [^egg_667], he prepares it: Aditi being this (earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this (earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The sacrificial fee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this (earth), he milks out from the latter all his desires. The calf he gives away at the former (pap-offering to Aditi [^egg_668]), and the mother-cow at the latter; for when a calf sucks the mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is given away, and from her, when given away, he thus milks all his desires.

[^egg_667]: 268:3 See p. 213, note 2.

[^egg_668]: 268:4 This offering takes place at the beginning of the performance of the Sautrāmaṇī, cf. Kāty. Śr. XIX, 1, 5-10. The dish of curds which according to this paragraph is to follow the second pap to Aditi, may, according to Kātyāyana, be offered before it.

12. As to this they say, 'Surely, he who goes down to the water for the purificatory bath falls away from this world!' Well, when he has come out from the bath, he offers a dish of curds to Mitra and Varuṇa; now Mitra is this (terrestrial) world,

 Varuṇa yonder world, and the dish of curds is what there is here between (those two): thus, when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varuṇa, he establishes himself in these worlds. And Mitra, indeed, is the in-breathing, Varuṇa the off-breathing, and the dish of curds the food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varuṇa, he finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.

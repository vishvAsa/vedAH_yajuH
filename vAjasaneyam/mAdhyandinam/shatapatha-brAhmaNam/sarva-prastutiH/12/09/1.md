1. Verily, from this sacrifice the man [^egg_655] is born

[^egg_655]: 259:5 That is, the Purusha, Agni-Prajāpati; and the Sacrificer.

and whatever food a man consumes in this world, that (food), in return, consumes him in yonder world. Now this sacrifice is performed by means of spirituous liquor, and spirituous liquor (parisrut) is not to be consumed by a Brāhmaṇa: he thus is born from that which is not (to be) consumed, and the food does not, in return, consume him in yonder world. Therefore this (sacrifice), the Sautrāmaṇī, is a Brāhmaṇa's sacrifice [^egg_656].

[^egg_656]: 260:1 That is, because to a man of another caste the spirituous liquor would not be 'anādyā,' but consumable, and hence it would consume him in the other world.

They are all of them invitatory formulas and all offering-formulas, whence all the vital airs pass onwards and all of them backwards. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the vital airs are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of the in (and out)-breathing and the up-breathing: it is the in-breathing and the up-breathing he thus secures for himself, and therefore all the vital airs are established on the in-breathing and the up-breathing.

1. Of old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one dedicated to Savitr̥, but now they seize it as one dedicated to Prajāpati, saying, 'Savitr̥, in truth, is the same as Prajāpati.' It is therefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they ought to perform this (animal) sacrifice on the Gr̥hapati's own fires, thinking, 'May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim) wherewith they are now making offering together to the wives

 (of the gods).' They then perform the initiation ceremony whenever they choose.

2. Here now they say, 'They ought to have separate hearths; and if one of the initiates were to be taken ill let him stay aside offering the Agnihotra. If he gets well again, they bring (the fires) together and invite him to join them; but if he dies they burn him by his own (three) fires [^egg_499] without an (ordinary) fire for (burning) a dead body; and the other sacrificers sit (through the sacrificial session);--such at least is the performance in the case of one who keeps up his sacrificial fires; but, indeed, they have their hearths in common: the theological explication of this is the same as in regard to the preparatory ceremonial [^egg_500].'

[^egg_499]: 175:1 This is the regular procedure in accordance with Gr̥hya rites, cf. Āśv. Gr̥hy. IV, 2, 11-13; whilst Pāraskara, III, 10, 11, merely says, 'with the domestic fire they burn him who has established his (sacred) fire.'

[^egg_500]: 175:2 For the 'puraścaraṇa,' see part iv, p. 337, note 2.

[^egg_501]: 176:1 Viz., by those rites which, during the time for which the Sacrificer is initiated, may be performed on his domestic (Āvasathya or Aupāsana) fire. Cf. Kāty. I, 1, 20. 21. Whether the domestic offerings to the Fathers (śrāddha) may be so performed seems doubtful.

IV, 6, 11 seq. the performance of a year's sattra is to mark the time at which the offering of first-fruits would otherwise have taken place by using new grain for his vrata-food, as well as for two Rauhiṇa cakes at the Upasads, and for the cakes offered in the animal sacrifice of the Soma days; and that a pap of new śyāmāka (millet) is to be offered to Soma at the proper season (during the rains, or autumn), and a pap of bamboo grain in summer.

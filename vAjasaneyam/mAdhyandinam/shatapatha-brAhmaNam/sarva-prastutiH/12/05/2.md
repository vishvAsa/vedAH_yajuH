1. Now, Nāka Maudgalya once said, 'If he believe the Sacrificer to be about to die, let him take

up the two fires in the churning-sticks, and, having churned out (a new fire), let him continue offering (the Agnihotra) at whatever place may have commended itself to him for the immolation [^egg_544]. And if the Sacrificer should then depart this world,--

[^egg_544]: 202:1 Literally, at any place at which the cutting up may have commended itself to him (to take place). Whether this 'cutting up' is here to be taken figuratively of the burning of the corpse (dāhasthāne, Harisvāmin), or of the sacrifice of a barren cow, which may be performed in such a case, or of both, is not quite clear.

2. Let him build a pile for him [^egg_545] in the midst of his fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires.' But let him not do this; for, verily, that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should make offering to it as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.

[^egg_545]: 202:2 The construction would rather seem to be,--let him build him (i.e. the dead body) up as a pile amidst his fires.

3. He should rather proceed thus:--let him bid them seek three pots, and, having put therein either (dried) cowdung or straw [^egg_546], let him place them separately on the (three) fires; and let them then burn him by means of the fires produced from that blaze: in this way he is indeed burned by (these) fires, though not visibly, so to speak.

[^egg_546]: 202:3 The real meaning of 'śumbala' is not known,--acc. to the St. Petersb. Dict., some material which readily takes fire, such as straw or oakum. Harisvāmin takes it in the former sense,--tr̥ṇāny alpasaṁsthitāni. Cf. Kāty. XXV, 7, 12 (?dried cotton fibre or pods).

5. Now, in the first place, he cleanses him of all foul matter, and causes the foul matter to settle on this (earth); for this (earth) is indeed foul matter: he thus consigns foul matter to foul matter. For, indeed, from that intestine of his, filled with foul matter, when it is burnt, a jackal is produced: (hence he removes it), 'lest a jackal should be produced.' But let him not do this, or his family will be liable to starve. Having washed him out inside, he anoints him with ghee, and thus makes it (the body) sacrificially pure.

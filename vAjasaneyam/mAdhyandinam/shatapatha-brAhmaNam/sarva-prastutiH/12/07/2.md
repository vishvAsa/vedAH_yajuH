As to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Brāhmaṇa's food; and, indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Brāhmaṇa vomits Soma; and he who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does not gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does not gain cattle [^egg_569], for Soma is cattle.'

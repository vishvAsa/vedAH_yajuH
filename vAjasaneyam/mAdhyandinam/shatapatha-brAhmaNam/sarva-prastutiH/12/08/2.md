1. Prajāpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it. When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautrāmaṇī, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him.

2. Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrāmaṇī: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrāmaṇī, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.

[^egg_611]: 240:2 That is to say, the observance of the fast--by which the Sacrificer during the four days of the performance of the Sautrāmaṇī, lives solely on the remains of the Agnihotra--takes the place of the ordinary initiation of the Soma-sacrifice, there being no Dīkshā at the Sautrāmaṇī.

35. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and relate to the same deities--

for the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons. They are all of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas [^egg_627], whence all the seasons pass onwards, and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of day and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for himself; whence both the seasons and the months are established on day and night.

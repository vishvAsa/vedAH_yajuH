1. Tvashṭr̥, seeing his son slain, brought Soma suitable for witchery, and withheld from Indra. Indra, committing a desecration of the sacrifice, by main force drank off his (Tvashṭr̥'s) Soma juice. He went asunder in every direction,--from his mouth and vital airs his excellence and fame passed

away, and entered the cattle, whence cattle are one's fame: and famous, indeed, is he who, knowing this, is consecrated [^egg_628] by the Sautrāmaṇī.

7. Concerning this, Gaurīviti Śāktya, knowing this, once said, 'Like rulers [^egg_631], assuredly, we shall be in yonder world!' Perhaps [^egg_632] it was Rishabha Yājñatura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.

[^egg_631]: 250:2 'A kind of Kshatriyas,' Delbrück, Altind. Synt., p. 494.

[^egg_632]: 250:3 For this or some such meaning ('probably'--German, 'wohl' or 'vielleicht') which seems to me to suit best the use of 'śaśvat' in the Brāhmaṇas, see part iii, p. 98, note 2.--Thus, at I, 2, 3, 2, I would now translate 'and perhaps it was Trita who slew him,--Indra at all events was exonerated from that (guilt), for he is a god.' Similarly, I, 8, 1, 4, 'perhaps it was a jḥasha, for that (fish) grows best (fastest);' II, 2, 1, 2, 'If, on the other hand, that oblation were not offered up in him, he would perhaps burn either the Adhvaryu, or the Sacrificer.' Somewhat peculiar is the passage, I, 6, 3, 10, where śaśvat occurs both in the relative and in the demonstrative clause, and where we can hardly translate otherwise than 'If, perchance, he had said, "Grow thou, the foe of Indra!" he (Vr̥tra) would perhaps have slain Indra.'--Hätte er vielleicht (etwa) gesagt: 'Wachse, du Feind Indras!' so würde er (Vr̥tra) vielleicht (? gewiss) Indra erschlagen haben.--If this be the right interpretation of these passages, they would have td be transferred, in the St. Petersb. Dict., from meaning b (?) to c, where 'vielleicht' would have to be added, as it certainly suits better than 'gewiss' (most likely) the last of the foregoing passages, at all events. The comm. explains 'śaśvat' by 'bahukr̥tvaḥ.'

23. He [^egg_644] then sings a Sāman (hymn-tune), for the Sāman means lordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus consecrates him; or the Sāman means imperial sway: by means of imperial sway he thus causes him to attain imperial sway. And, indeed, the Sāman is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus consecrates him with the essence of all the Vedas.

[^egg_644]: 255:1 According to the commentator on Kāty. XIX, 5, 1, the Brahman sings, whilst Lāṭy. V, 4, 16-19 gives directions from which the Udgātr̥ would seem to be expected to perform this duty. When the Sacrificer is being anointed, the Udgātr̥ is to step between the (northern and southern) fires and, as soon as he is called upon by the Adhvaryu, he is to commence the Sāman. It would probably depend on the Brahman's previous studies, whether or not he was sufficiently conversant with the complicated details of the hymnology.

At midday they then fixed him by means of the Br̥hatī, and for this reason the Br̥hatī metre is used for the Pavamāna-stotra at the midday service.'

26. And as to why (these hymns) are called 'bracers [^egg_647];' it is because by means of these Sāmans the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital power: in like manner do the officiating priests, by means of these Sāmans, brace the Sacrificer up to energy, or vital power. 'Saṁśravase, viśravase, satyaśravase, śravase [^egg_648]'--these are the Sāmans: they proclaim

[^egg_647]: 256:2 Literally, sharpeners or sharpenings (saṁśāna).

[^egg_648]: 256:3 These words--apparently meaning 'for fame all round, for fame far and wide, for true fame, for fame' (or, perhaps, for hearing, or, rather, being heard of all round,' &c.)--are used to form the fiṇaleś (nidhana) in which all the priests are to join; cf. Sāmav., Calc. ed., I, pp. 533-4, where the figured text is given. According to Katy. XIX, 5, 4-5; Lāṭy. V, 4, 19, the words, 'saṁjityai, vijityai, satyajityai, jityai' (for complete victory, victory far and wide, &c.), and 'sampushṭyai, vipushṭyai,' &c. (for complete prosperity, &c.), are to be used instead, in the case of a Kshatriya and Vaiśya respectively, either optionally or necessarily. Though these four words are here, and elsewhere, spoken of as so many different Sāmans, only 'the last of them ('śravase') forms the fiṇale of a Sāman in the ordinary sense of the word; the others being merely combined with certain musical ejaculations, or expletives (stobhas). All the four 'Sāmans' begin with the same phrase (varying only in the verb)--'saṁ tvā hinvanti (riṇanti,  tatakshur, śiśanti) dhītibhiḥ,' i, e. 'they make thee up (or urge thee on) with prayers,' serving as a kind of prelude (prastāva) the single words of which are given among the Stobhas (Sāmav„ Calc. ed., II, p. 522, last line), as, indeed, the words 'saṁśravase,' &c., themselves are (ib., p. 520). In the first three Sāmans this phrase is followed by the fiṇale consisting of the respective characteristic word preceded by the Stobha 'auhovā.' In the last Sāman, on the other hand, the introductory phrase is followed by the choral setting of the verse 'Br̥had indrāya gāyata' (see p. 255, n. 2), which, in its turn, is followed again by the first phrase, with a slightly modified modulation, ending with 'auhovā śravase.' Whilst joining in the fiṇale, the priests, according to Lāṭy. V, 4, 17, are to lay their hands on the head of the Sacrificer.

[^egg_652]: 259:2 The use of 'prayati' in this sense (here and Vāj. S. XVIII, 1) is peculiar; being apparently derived from 'pra-yam,' one would expect it to have some such meaning as 'offer, gift.' This and the other predicates, according to Mahīdhara, are to show the state of feeling of beings towards the (royal) Sacrificer. The repetition of 'ānati' (bowing, prostration, submission) is strange. A strong alliterative cadence is noticeable in the verse.

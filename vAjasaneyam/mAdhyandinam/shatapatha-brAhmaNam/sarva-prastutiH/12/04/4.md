1. And, in the morning, having taken out the ashes, and smeared (the fire-places) with cow-dung, he lifts the two fires on the churning-sticks, and returns (to the offering-ground). Having then churned out the Gārhapatya, taken out the Āhavanīya, and brought the Anvāhārya-pacana (to the southern hearth), he should prepare a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Pathikr̥t (the path-maker). The course of procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite those same seventeen kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vr̥tra [^egg_531]; the saṁyājyās are two Virāj verses [^egg_531]; and the invitatory and offering formulas are as follows:--(the anuvākyā, R̥g-veda VI, 16, 3), 'For thou, most wise Agni, divine disposer, readily knowest the ways and paths at sacrifices;' and the yājyā (R̥g-veda X, 2, 3), 'We have entered upon the path of the gods to carry on what we can do: the wise Agni shall sacrifice,

[^egg_531]: 191:3 See notes on XIII, 4, 1, 13.

he shall be the priest, he shall order the sacrifices and their seasons;' for Agni is the path-maker, the guide of paths: he, verily, guides him upon the path of sacrifice. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.

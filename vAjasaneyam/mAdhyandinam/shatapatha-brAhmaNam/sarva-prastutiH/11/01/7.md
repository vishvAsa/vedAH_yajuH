3. As to this they say, 'What course of procedure is there?' Well, let him, on those two nights (of full and new moon), himself offer the Agnihotra: inasmuch as, after offering, he takes food he does not become consecrated to the Fathers, for that (libation) is an offering; and inasmuch as he performs that offering in his own self he does not eat of those sacrificial essences.

the entrance on the fast, offering is always made by himself [^egg_119].

[^egg_119]: 22:1 That is to say, even though on other nights the Agnihotra were performed for him by a priest, it would always count as being performed by himself.

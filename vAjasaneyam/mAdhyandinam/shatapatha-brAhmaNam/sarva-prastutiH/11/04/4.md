2. He who offers with slightly burnt sacrificial food, enters through the fire-door [^egg_225] of the Brahman;

[^egg_225]: 66:4 In the text the two words are not compounded, but stand in apposition to each other (with the fire as the door of B.), with, however, much the same force as a compound word. Cf. XII, 2, 2, 2 gādham (eva) pratishṭḥā (a foothold consisting of a ford), and ib. 9 gādha-pratishṭḥa, 'ford-foothold.'

and, by entering through the fire-door of the Brahman, he wins his union with, and participation in the world of, the Brahman.

 (nyūna) that part of it is productive for him [^egg_226]; and what is redundant in it that is favourable to cattle; and what is broken (disconnected) [^egg_227] in it that makes for prosperity; and what is perfect in it that is conducive to heaven.

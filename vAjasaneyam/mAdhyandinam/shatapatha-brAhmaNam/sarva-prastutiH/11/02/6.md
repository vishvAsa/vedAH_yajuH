1. The Praṇītā water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice [^egg_151]; and when he leads forward the Praṇītā water, it is the head of the sacrifice he thereby forms, and he should know that it is that head of his own that is then being formed.

[^egg_151]: 35:1 Yajña, the sacrifice, is here, as so often, to be understood as the abstract representation of the victim (here the horse), as well as of the Purusha,--i.e. Prajāpati, and the Sacrificer.

Whilst after each verse a kindling-stick (samidh) is thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu, the Hotr̥ does not make any pause in his recitation at this point, but he does so after the second pāda of each verse, thus connecting the last pāda with the first two pādas of the next verse.

4. The five fore-offerings are these its five (outlets of the) vital airs in the head;--the first fore-offering is its mouth, the second the right nostril, the third the left nostril, the fourth the right ear, and the fifth the left ear. And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours together (the ghee [^egg_154]), therefore this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel (with the other).

[^egg_156]: 36:3 Instead of 'visham,' the MS. of Sāyaṇa's commentary reads 'dvishan' (hater, enemy), which is explained as meaning 'śatrubuddhi'; the cutting out' of the fore-portion being compared with the annihilation of enemies (śatrunirasanārtham),--all this is, however, manifestly fanciful. What is intended would seem to be the poison (real or figurative) caused by the enemies’ (or Rudra's, or Varuṇa's) shafts, in accordance with the myth regarding Prajāpati and his daughter, I, 7, 4, 1 seqq.

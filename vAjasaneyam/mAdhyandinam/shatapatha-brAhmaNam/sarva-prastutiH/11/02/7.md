30. The gods fortified the Patnīsaṁyājas by a mound from behind [^egg_172], and placed a couple thereon for the sake of procreation: thus when the Patnīsaṁyājas are performed, he places a couple thereon for the sake of procreation; for, indeed, after the procreation of the gods offspring is produced, and offspring is produced by pair after pair (of men and beasts) for him who knows this.

[^egg_172]: 44:1 The Patnīsaṁyājas (by which offering is made to Soma, Tvashṭr̥, and Agni, along with the wives of the gods) are performed on the Gārhapatya fire, and hence at the back (western) part of the sacrificial ground where the Sacrificer's wife is seated. For the symbolical import of the rite see I, 9, 2, 5.

32. The Sacrificer is the Year; and the Seasons officiate for him. The Āgnīdhra is the Spring,

whence forest-fires take place in spring, for that is a form of Agni. The Adhvaryu is the Summer, for summer is, as it were, scorched; and the Adhvaryu comes forth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched [^egg_173]. The Udgātr̥ is the Rainy season; whence, when it rains hard, a sound as that of a chant is produced. 'The Brahman is the Autumn; whence, when the corn ripens, they say, 'The creatures are rich in growth (brahmaṇvat).' The Hotr̥ is the Winter, whence in winter cattle waste away, having the Vashaṭ uttered over them. These, then, are the divinities that officiate for him; and even if Aishāvīrāḥ [^egg_174] were to officiate for him, let him think in his mind of those divinities, and those deities, indeed, officiate for him.

[^egg_173]: 45:1 Viz. from his constant attendance on the sacrificial fires.

[^egg_174]: 45:2 According to Sāyaṇa, Eshavīra is the name of a Brāhmaṇical family held in general contempt. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 228.

33. Now, as to that balance, the right (south) edge of the Vedi [^egg_175]. Whatever good deed man does that is inside the Vedi; and whatever evil deed he does that is outside the Vedi. Let him therefore sit down, touching the right edge of the Vedi; for, indeed, they place him on the balance in yonder world; and whichever of the two will rise [^egg_176] that he will follow, whether it be the good or the evil. And, verily, whosoever knows this, mounts the balance even in this world, and escapes being placed on the balance in yonder world; for his good deed rises, and not his evil deed.

[^egg_175]: 45:3 That is, the altar-ground covered with sacrificial grass, serving as a seat for the gods.

[^egg_176]: 45:4 Literally, will force down (the other). On this ordeal see E. Schlagintweit, Die Gottesurtheile der Indier, Nachträge; A. Weber, Ind. Streifen I, p. 21; II, p. 363.

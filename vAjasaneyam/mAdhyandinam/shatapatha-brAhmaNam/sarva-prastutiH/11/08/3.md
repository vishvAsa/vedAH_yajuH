1. Here, now, they say, 'To what deity should this victim belong?'--'It should belong to Prajāpati,' they say; 'for it was Prajāpati who first saw it: therefore it is to Prajāpati that this victim should belong.'

2. And they also say, 'To Sūrya (the sun) that victim should belong;'--whence it is that cattle are tied up when he (the sun) has set: some of them

they tie up [^egg_395] in their respective stables, and others just flock together:--'therefore,' they say, 'it is to Sūrya that this victim should belong.'

[^egg_395]: 128:1 Or, perhaps, cattle are shut up--some of them they shut up.

3. And they also say, 'To Indra and Agni that victim should belong; for behind these two deities are (all) the other gods;--if one who is afflicted sacrifices, those two (gods) sustain him; and if one sacrifices with (a desire for) abundance [^egg_396], they sustain him: therefore it is to Indra and Agni that this victim should belong.'

[^egg_396]: 128:2 ? Thus, apparently, Sāyaṇa:--Anye tv indrāgnyoḥ sarvadevatāprādhānyāt svoddeśena yāgaṁ kr̥tavatāṁ krameṇārtināśak(atv)ān mahataḥ (? mahaśaḥ) prāpakatvāc ca paśur aindrāgna iti.

5. Prajāpati said to Agni, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee (as a victim).'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto man!' He said to man, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the cattle!' He said to the cattle, 'I will perform sacrifice with you: I will lay hands upon you.'--'Nay,' said they, 'speak unto the moon!' He said to the moon, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee,'--'Nay,' said he, 'speak unto the sun!' He said to the sun, 'I will perform sacrifice with thee: I will lay hands upon thee.' 'So be it!' said he; 'but seeing that those liked it not (to be slaughtered), what, then, shall become mine that now is with these [^egg_397]?'--'Whatsoever

[^egg_397]: 128:3 Eteshāṁ svabhūtaṁ vastu kiṁ labdhaṁ bhavet, Sāy.

thou mayest desire,' he said.--'So be it,' he replied. He laid hands upon him, and this is that animal of his seized (for sacrifice). When slaughtered, it swelled, and by means of those Āprī-hymns, he appeased it [^egg_398]; and inasmuch as, by means of these Āprī-hymns, he appeased it, they are called Āprīs. And let him, for that reason, say of the slaughtered animal, 'Let it lie for a moment!' As great as the world is which he gains by performing the horse-sacrifice, so great a world does he gain by this (animal sacrifice).

[^egg_398]: 129:1 See III, 8, 1, 2 (with note), where 'ā-prī' is apparently taken by the Brāhmaṇa in the sense of 'to fill up.'

6. The (wind of the) eastern region breathed over that (dead victim), saying, 'Breathe forth!' and thereby laid the breath (of the mouth) into it; the southern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe through!' and thereby laid the through-breathing into it; the western region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe off!' and thereby laid the off-breathing into it; the northern region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe up!' and thereby laid the up-breathing (of the nostrils) into it; the upper region breathed over it, saying, 'Breathe all about!' and thereby laid the circulating breathing into it. Therefore, regarding a new-born son, let him say to five Brāhmaṇas, before the navel-string has been cut, 'Breathe over him in this way [^egg_399]!'

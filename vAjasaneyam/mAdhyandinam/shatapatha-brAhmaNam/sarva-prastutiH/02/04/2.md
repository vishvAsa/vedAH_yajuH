1. Now the living beings once approached Prajāpati--beings doubtless mean creatures--and said, 'Ordain unto us in what manner we are to live!' Thereupon the gods, being properly invested with the sacrificial cord [^egg_796] and bending the right knee, approached him. To them he said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your food; immortality your sap; and the sun your light!'

[^egg_796]: 361:1 Yajñopavītin, 'sacrificially invested,' i.e. wearing the sacrificial cord in the ordinary way, on the left shoulder and under the right arm. In any performance connected with the deceased ancestors, the cord has to be shifted from the left to the right shoulder and under the left arm (prācīnopavītin, lit. 'eastward invested').

6. Neither the gods, nor the fathers, nor beasts transgress (this ordinance); some of the men alone transgress it. Hence whatever man grows fat; he grows fat in unrighteousness, since he totters and is unable to walk because of his having grown fat by doing wrong. One should therefore eat only in the evening and morning; and whosoever, knowing this, eats only in the evening and morning, reaches the full measure of life; and whatever he speaks, that is (true); because he observes that divine truth. For, verily, that is Brāhmanic lustre (tejas), when one knows to keep His (Prajāpati's) law.

7. Now that (lustre) indeed belongs to him who presents (food) to the fathers once a month. When that (moon) is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he presents (food) to them; for that moon doubtless is king Soma, the food of the gods. Now during that night (of new moon) it fails them, and when it fails, he presents (food to them), and thereby establishes concord (between the gods and fathers). But were he to present (food) to them when it is not failing, he would indeed cause a quarrel between the gods and fathers: hence he presents

9. While seated behind the Gārhapatya, with his face turned toward the south [^egg_798], and the sacrificial cord on his right shoulder, he takes that (material for the offering from the cart) [^egg_799]. Thereupon he rises from thence and threshes (the rice) while standing north of the Dakshiṇa fire and facing the south. Only once he cleans (the rice) [^egg_800]; for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away, and therefore he cleans it only once.

[^egg_798]: 363:1 Dakshiṇāsīnaḥ; the Commentator interprets it by 'sitting south of the cart.'

[^egg_799]: 363:2 The Kāṇva text has,--etaṁ caruṁ gr̥hṇāti, 'he takes that pot, or potful, (of rice).' Doubtless, he is to take from the cart the quantity of rice sufficient for the offerings and put it in the pot (caru). According to Kāty. IV, I, 5-7 he is to take the but-partly-filled pot, or a spoonful (or, according to the Schol., rather less than a spoonful).

He then shifts the sacrificial cord to his left shoulder (as he is about to offer to gods), puts three sticks on the fire, and sitting down with his face towards the east offers some boiled rice with the pot-ladle (mekshaṇa).

According to the commentary, the author apparently means to say, that if he were to add, 'and those who come after thee (i.e. after his father),' he would include the sacrificer himself, and the latter would consequently offer the piṇḍa to himself. The form of the presentation-formula rejected by our author is the one adopted in Āśval. Śr. II, 6, 15, except that 'atra' is added there ('who here come after thee').  The Kāṇva text mentions and rejects the two alternative readings, 'ye ca tvām anvāñcaḥ' and 'yāṁś ca tvam anvaṅ asi' ('and those whom thou followest'). In Taitt. Br. I, 3, 10, no presentation-formula is mentioned at all.

22. He again turns round (to the right) and mutters (Vāj. S. II, 31 b), 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they have come each to his own share;' whereby he means to say, 'They have eaten each his own share [^egg_816].'

[^egg_816]: 367:2 'Formerly the gods and men and fathers (deva-manushyāḥ pitaraḥ) drank visibly together, but now they do so invisibly.' Śat. Br. III, 6, 2, 26.

23. Thereupon he takes the water-pitcher and makes them wash themselves [^egg_817], merely saying,

[^egg_817]: 367:3 Viz. by pouring water on the obsequial cakes. According to Āśval. Sr. II, 7, 5, and other treatises, he also puts down some  ointment, oil, or butter on the piṇḍas, saying, '(Father), N.N., anoint thyself!' &c.; see Donner, Piṇḍap., p. 25.

 'N.N., wash thyself [^egg_818]!' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself!' (naming) his great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest) when he has taken his meal, so here.

24. He then pulls down the tuck [^egg_819] (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the fathers (pitr̥devatyā): therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. Now obeisance means worship (or sacrifice): hence he thereby renders them worthy of worship. Six times he performs obeisance; for there are six seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: for this reason he performs obeisance six times. He mutters (Vāj. S. II, 32 g), 'Give us houses, O fathers!' for the fathers are the guardians (īśate) of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the cakes have been put back (in the dish containing the remains of boiled rice) he (the sacrificer) smells at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share. The

[^egg_819]: 368:2 Nīvim udvr̥hya = paridhānīyasya vāsaso daśā tām udvr̥hya visraṁsya, Sāyaṇa. According to Mahādeva, he (who presents the piṇḍas, viz. either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer) has previously to put on a garment with a tuck (nīvimat paridhānam), i.e. with the daśā, or unwoven edge of the upper garment, tucked up under the waistband. This he is to pull out. Kātyāyana has the following rules: IV, I, 15, Having made (them) wash themselves as before, and having loosened (visraṁsya) the tuck, he makes obeisance with 'adoration to your vigour, O fathers!' &c. (Vāj. S. II, 32 a-f). [According to the Comm., he adds the formula, 'Give us houses, O fathers! we will give to you of what is (ours).' Vāj. S. II, 32, 9.] 16, With 'Put on this your garment, O fathers!' (Vāj. S. II, 32 h), he throws three threads (pieces of  yarn), one on each cake. 17, Or, woollen fringe [or, wool or fringe (daśā), according to others]. 18, Or, hairs of the sacrificer (pulled out from the chest near the heart), if he is advanced in years. 19, He pours [the water, left in the pitcher, on the cakes] with 'Ye (O waters) are a refreshing draught, ye, that bring sap, immortal ghee and milk and foaming mead: gladden my fathers!' (Vāj. S. II, 34.) 20, [The Adhvaryu] having laid (the cakes on the dish) the sacrificer smells at them. 21, The firebrand and the once-cut stalks of grass (he throws) into the fire. 22, The wife, if desirous of a son, eats the middle cake with, 'Bestow offspring on me, O fathers, a boy crowned with lotuses; that there may he a man here!' (Vāj. S. II, 33.) [According to the comment, the other two cakes are thrown into the water or fire; or eaten by a priest.] For other variations, see Donner, Piṇḍapitr̥yajña. The Kāṇva recension, on the whole, agrees with our text.

 (stalks of sacrificial grass) cut with one stroke he puts on the fire; and he also again throws away the firebrand [^egg_820].

[^egg_820]: 369:1 The Kāṇva text has as follows: 'Therefore he says, Give us houses, O fathers!' He then smells at the pot (ukhā): that is the sacrificer's share. They again put down the cakes together (with the rice in the pot! samavadadhati). The once-severed (stalks of grass) they put on the fire. The firebrand he again shifts to (the fire; apy-arjati).

1. Prajāpati alone, indeed, existed here in the beginning. He considered, 'How may I be reproduced?'

 He toiled and performed acts of penance. He generated Agni from his mouth; and because he generated him from his mouth, therefore Agni is a consumer of food: and, verily, he who thus knows Agni to be a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.

2. He thus generated him first (agre) of the gods; and therefore (he is called) Agni, for agni (they say) is the same as agri. He, being generated, went forth as the first (pūrva); for of him who goes first, they say that he goes at the head (agre). Such, then, is the origin and nature of that Agni.

3. Prajāpati then considered, 'In that Agni I have generated a food-eater for myself; but, indeed, there is no other food here but myself, whom, surely, he would not eat.' At that time this earth had, indeed, been rendered quite bald; there were neither plants nor trees. This, then, weighed on his mind.

4. Thereupon Agni turned towards him with open mouth; and he (Prajāpati) being terrified, his own greatness departed from him. Now his own greatness is his speech: that speech of his departed from him. He desired an offering in his own self, and rubbed (his hands); and because he rubbed (his hands), therefore both this and this (palm) are hairless. He then obtained either a butter-offering or a milk-offering;--but, indeed, they are both milk.

5. This (offering), however, did not satisfy him, because it had hairs mixed with it. He poured it away (into the fire), saying, 'Drink, while burning (oshaṁ dhaya)!' From it plants sprang: hence their name 'plants (oshadhayaḥ).' He rubbed (his hands) a second time, and thereby obtained another

6. This (offering) then satisfied him. He hesitated: 'Shall I offer it up? shall I not offer it up?' he thought. His own greatness said to him, 'Offer it up!' Prajāpati was aware that it was his own (sva) greatness that had spoken (āha) to him; and offered it up with 'Svāhā!' This is why offerings are made with 'Svāhā!' Thereupon that burning one (viz. the sun) rose; and then that blowing one (viz. the wind) sprang up; whereupon, indeed, Agni turned away.

9. And as to that same birth from out of doubt,--when Prajāpati doubted, he, while doubting, remained steadfast on the better (side), insomuch that he reproduced himself and saved himself from Agni, Death, when he was about to devour him: so he also who knows that birth from out of doubt, when he doubts about anything, still remains on the better (side).

12. When they had sung praises, they went out towards the east, saying, 'We (will) go back thither!' The gods came upon a cow which had sprung into existence. Looking up at them, she uttered the sound 'hiṅ.'

And as this same sound 'Hiṅ' of the Sāman was in the cow, therefore the latter affords the means of subsistence; and so does he afford the means of subsistence whosoever thus knows that 'Hiṅ' of the Sāman in the cow.

[^egg_739]: 326:1 Pariharet [? 'let him avoid it (the term go in the sense of sacrifice), thinking that it is too holy']. Sāyaṇa merely remarks, that both the cow and the sacrifice are here represented as extremely auspicious (utkr̥shṭam puṇyam). Perhaps we have here a play on the words upanāma, 'a by-name,' and upanāmuka, 'inclining to (him).' 'Go' (for go-shṭoma) is the designation of one of the days of the Abhiplava at the Gavāmayana.

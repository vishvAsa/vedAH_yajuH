1. When he has taken out the Āhavanīya fire [^egg_690], he performs the Full-offering [^egg_691]. The reason why

[^egg_690]: 302:1 Previously to the performance of the full-offering, the other fires (if there are any more) are laid down. An integral part of the laying down of the Sabhya, or hall-fire, which seems to have been kept up only by Kshatriyas, is a game of dice, played by the priests, with a cow, offered by the sacrificer, for the stake. On an ox-hide, spread north of the sacrificial ground, they place a brass vessel upside down, and on it throw four times five cowries (or, if such are not to be had, five sticks) with 'Even I win, uneven thou art won (or defeated)!'

[^egg_691]: 302:2 The pūrṇāhuti, or 'full-offering,' is an oblation of a spoonful of clarified butter. Kāty. IV. 10, 5, and comm., supply the following particulars, applying to all ordinary juhoti-offerings: He puts butter into the butter-pot and places it on the Gārhapatya to  melt. Having then wiped the dipping-spoon (sruva) and offering-spoon (juhū) with sacrificial grass in the manner described at I, 3, 1, 6 seq., and taken the butter-pot off the fire, and strained the butter with the two stalks of darbha serving as strainers, he fills the juhū with the sruva. He now takes one stick, steps over to the north side of the Āhavanīya fire, strews grass around it, and puts the stick on the fire. He then sits down with bent right knee, and, while the sacrificer takes hold of him from behind, he pours the spoonful of butter into the fire with 'Svāhā!' the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyāga), 'This to Agni!'

he performs the full-offering is that he thereby causes that Agni to become an eater of food for his own self; that he thereby offers food to him. Even as (a mother or cow) would offer the breast to a new-born child or calf, so does he thereby offer food to him.

2. And having been appeased by that food, he (Agni) waits patiently for the other oblations to be cooked. If, on the other hand, that oblation were not to be offered up in him, he would ere long burn either the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer, for these two pass nearest by him. This is the reason why he makes this offering.

3. He offers it (with a) full (spoon); for the full doubtless means the All (universe), so that he thereby appeases him with the All. He offers it with 'Svāhā!' for the Svāhā is undefined, and undefined also is the All, so that he thereby appeases him by means of the All.

4. The first offering which Prajāpati made, he made with 'Svāhā!' Now that (offering) indeed is virtually the same as this one; and hence he (the sacrificer) also makes it with 'Svāhā!' At this (offering) he grants a boon (to the priests) [^egg_692]; but

[^egg_692]: 303:1 After the full-offering the sacrificer breaks the silence, imposed on him, by the words, 'I give a boon,' Kāty. IV, 10, 6; presents,  according to the commentary, being then made to the Adhvaryu and the Brahman. This ceremony is succeeded by the silent performance of the Agnihotra.

6. He takes out (material for an oblation) [^egg_693] to Agni Pavamāna (the Blowing) [^egg_694]. Now the blowing one is the breath, so that he thereby puts breath into him (the sacrificer). And this he puts into him by means of this (offering); for breath means food, and this offering also is food.

[^egg_693]: 304:1 The pūrṇāhuti, which marks the close of the Agnyādheya proper, is followed by the Agnihotra, performed with the texts pronounced in a low voice. Not less than twelve days after the Agnyādheya (if at all)--the three fires being kept up during the interval--the young householder has to get performed for him (on the model of the new and full-moon offering, mutatis mutandis, there being neither the uddharaṇa, or taking out of fire from the Gārhapatya, nor the choosing of a Brahman, &c.) the three ishṭis mentioned above. At the first ishṭi, the special havis (sacrificial dish) consists of a rice-cake on eight potsherds for Agni Pavamāna;--at the second of two such cakes for Agni Pāvaka and Agni Suci respectively;--at the third of a potful of boiled rice for Aditi. The three havis of the first two ishṭis being (according to Taitt. Br. I, 1, 6, 3) considered as representing the three bodies (tanu) of Agni; these offerings are called tanūhavir-ishṭis. They are, however, also called Pavamāneshṭis. At these the name of the recipient (Agni Pavamāna, &c.) has to be pronounced in a low voice in the formulas used at the chief offering. The Taitt. Br. mentions, besides, the usual Indrāgni cake (of the new-moon sacrifice) which is to be offered before the offering to Aditi.

[^egg_694]: 304:2 Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 5, 10, takes pavamāna as 'pure' or 'purified by himself' (svayaṁ śriddha); pāvaka as 'purifying (others);' and śuci as 'shining.'

1. On the day preceding his Agnyādheya, he (the sacrificer with his wife) should take his food in the day-time. For the gods know the minds of man: they are, therefore, aware that his Agnyādheya is to take place on the morrow; and all the gods betake themselves to his house and stay (upa-vas) in his house; whence this day is called upavasatha (fast-day) [^egg_670].

2. Now, as it would be unbecoming for him to take food before men (who are staying with him as his guests) have eaten; how much more would it be so, if he were to take food before the gods have eaten: let him therefore take his food in the day-time. However, he may also, if he choose, take food at night,

since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyādheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is merely a man, and may therefore, if he choose, take food at night.

3. Here now some tie up a he-goat [^egg_671], arguing that the goat is sacred to Agni and that (this is done) for the completeness of the fire. But he need not do this. Should he possess a he-goat, let him present it to the Āgnīdhra on the next morning; for it is thereby that he obtains the object he desires. He need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).

[^egg_671]: 292:1 This practice is perhaps the remnant of a former animal offering. See I, 2, 3, 6, where the goat is mentioned as the last of the animals meet for sacrifice.

4. They [^egg_672] then cook a rice-pap sufficient for (the) four (priests) to eat, 'Hereby we gratify the metres,' so they say, arguing that this is done in the same way as if one were to order a team, which he is going to use for driving, to be well fed. He need not, however, do this: for indeed that same wish (which he entertains in so doing) he obtains by the very fact that Brahmans, be they sacrificial priests or not, are residing in his family (kula) [^egg_673]: he need, therefore, take no notice of that (practice).

[^egg_672]: 292:2 That is, as would seem, those ritualists who maintain that a goat should be tied up for that night. The Kāṇva text reads, 'Here some cook that night that cātuḥprāśya rice-pap, saying (vadantaḥ), "Hereby we gratify the metres."' According to the Paddhati on Kāty IV, 8, the quotation 'Hereby we gratify the metres' seems to form the last of the formulas pronounced by the sacrificer, while washing the feet of the priests and offering them food.

[^egg_673]: 292:3 'The fulfilment of that wish he obtains through Brahmans, whether officiating priests or not, staying in his house (kula) and taking food there.' Kāṇva text.

5. Having then made a hollow in it (the pap) for

clarified butter to be poured in, and having poured clarified butter into it, they anoint three sticks of aśvattha wood with this butter and put them on the fire with the (three) R̥k-verses containing the words 'kindling-stick (samidh)' and 'butter (ghr̥ta) [^egg_674];' arguing that thereby they obtain what has grown out of a śamī [^egg_675]. It is, however, only by (daily) putting (three kindling-sticks) on the fire for a whole year previous (to the Ādhāna) that one obtains that object: let him therefore take no notice of that (practice).

[^egg_674]: 293:1 The three verses containing the words samidh and ghr̥ta are Vāj. S. III, 1, 3, 4. Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1, 9-10 has them in the order 1, 4, 3; and does not give the verse Vāj. S. III, 2 (Rig-veda V, 5, s). As neither version of our Brāhmaṇa makes any mention of this verse, it may be doubted whether originally it formed part of the Saṁhitā. According to Kāty. IV, 8, 5-6 he (? the Adhvaryu) is to put on (the three kindling-sticks) with Vāj. S. III, i, &c., one verse with each stick; whereupon he, (the sacrificer, according to the commentary) is to mutter III, 4; and according to ib. 7 'the Adhvaryu optionally mutters the second.' The Paddhati reconciles the different statements thus: he takes the sticks, rises and puts the first on the fire with III, 1; then sitting down he mutters III, 2; thereupon he again rises and puts on the second with III, 3, and the third with III, 4. The commentator, however, alludes to differences of practice in different schools as to this point.

[^egg_675]: 293:2 The sacrificial fire, to be set up at the Ādheya, should probably be produced by means of two pieces of aśvattha wood which has grown out of a śamī tree. Sāyaṇa remarks that the ritualists referred to in our passage consider that the cooking of the rice-pap takes place, not with the view of the latter being eaten by the priests, but merely to afford an opportunity for putting the kindling-sticks on the fire, and thereby securing to the sacrificer the benefits that would have accrued to hire from the above mode of ignition. This view, however, is not countenanced by our author, who, on the contrary, favours the daily cooking of a mess of rice-pap for the four priests for a twelvemonth preceding the Agnyādheya, as a substitute for the production of the fire by friction. See Kāty. IV, 8, 11 (and Paddhati).

6. And on this point Bhāllabeya remarked, 'If he were to cook that rice-pap, this would assuredly

be a mistake, just as if one were to do one thing, while intending to do another; or if one were to say one thing, while intending to say another; or if one were to go one way, while intending to go another.' And, indeed, it is not proper that they should either carry to the south, or extinguish, that fire on which a kindling-stick is put, or an oblation made, with a r̥c or a sāman or a yajus. Now they do indeed either take it to the south with the view of its becoming the Anvāhāryapacana (or Dakshiṇāgni), or (if there is to be no Dakshiṇāgni) they extinguish it [^egg_676].

[^egg_676]: 294:1 His argument seems to be that, since the cooking of the rice-pap involves the putting on of consecrated sticks with sacrificial formulas, one is not to cook the pap because that same fire will afterwards have to be extinguished or to be taken to the Dakshiṇāgni hearth. The passage is, however, far from clear to me.

7. Thereupon they [^egg_677] remain awake (during that night). The gods are awake: so that he thereby draws nigh to the gods, and sets up his fires as one more godly, more subdued, more endowed with holy fervour (tapas). He may, however, sleep, if he choose, since the observance of the vow is not necessary for him who has not performed Agnyādheya. For so long as he has not set up a (sacrificial) fire of his own, he is a mere man; and he may, therefore, sleep, if he choose.

[^egg_677]: 294:2 Viz. the ritualists referred to; that is to say, they make the sacrificer and his wife remain awake all night. Sāyaṇa takes jāgrati to stand for jāgarti, 'he, the sacrificer, remains awake.' The Kāṇva text, however, has, 'Here now they say, he should remain awake that night.'

8. Now some churn (the fire) [^egg_678] before sunrise and

[^egg_678]: 294:3 The production of the sacred fire by means of two sticks (araṇi) of the aśvattha (Ficus Religiosa) is thus described by Stevenson, 'Translation of the Sāma Veda,' pref. p. vii: 'The process by which fire is obtained from wood is called churning, as it resembles  that by which butter in India is separated from milk. The New-Hollanders obtain fire from a similar process. It consists in drilling one piece of araṇi wood into another by pulling a string tied to it with a jerk with the one hand, while the other is slackened, and so alternately till the wood takes fire. The fire is received on cotton or flax held in the hand of an assistant Brahman.' On the mythological associations of the agni-manthana, especially with the Teutonic need-fire and the myth of Prometheus; and those of the aśvattha tree, grown out of a śamī, with the mountain-ash (roun-tree, rowan-tree, witch-elm, witchen, witch-hazel, witch-wood; eber-esche), see A. Kuhn's epoch-making essay, 'Ueber die Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks.'

take it eastwards (from the Gārhapatya to the Āhavanīya) after sunrise, arguing that thereby they secure both the day and the night for the obtainment of out-breathing and in-breathing, of mind and speech. But let him not do so; for when they thus churn (the fire) before sunrise, and take it eastwards after sunrise, both his (fires) are in reality set up before sunrise. By churning the Āhavanīya after sunrise he will obtain that (combination of blessings).

9. The gods, assuredly, are the day. The fathers have not the evil dispelled from them (by the sun); (and accordingly) he (the sacrificer) does not dispel the evil (if he churns the fire before sunrise). The fathers are mortal; and verily he who churns the fire before the rising of the sun, dies before (he has attained his full measure of) life. The gods have the evil dispelled from them (by the sun): hence he (the sacrificer) dispels the evil (from himself, if he churn after sunrise).

N?'--the gotra-name being inserted in the case of the Bhr̥gus and Aṅgiras; and those of different R̥shis or gods and divine beings in that of others. At the sacrificer's bidding the Brahman or Adhvaryu then chants the Rathantara-sāman (cf. p. 196, note 2). Then follows the uddharaṇa or taking out fire from the Gārhapatya for the Āhavanīya. A bundle of wood is lighted at the lower ends on the Gārhapatya and placed in a pan on an underlayer of clay. It is then carried eastwards in such a way that the smoke is directed towards the sacrificer following it; the horse being led in front of the fire. At the starting of the procession the Brahman, at the Adhvaryu's call, chants the Vāmadevya-sāman.

they lead the horse in front of it; so that, in proceeding in front of it, it wards off from it the evil spirits, the Rakshas; and they carry it (to the Āhavanīya) safely and unmolested by evil spirits.

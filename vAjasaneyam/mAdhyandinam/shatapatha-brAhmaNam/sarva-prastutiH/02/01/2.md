1. He may set up the two fires [^egg_648] under the Kr̥ttikās; for they, the Kr̥ttikās, are doubtless Agni's asterism, so that if he sets up his fires under Agni's asterism, (he will bring about) a correspondence (between his fires and the asterism): for this reason he may set up his fires under the Kr̥ttikās.

2. Moreover, the other lunar asterisms (consist of) one, two, three or four (stars), so that the Kr̥ttikās are the most numerous (of asterisms) [^egg_649]: hence he thereby obtains an abundance. For this reason he may set up his fires under the Kr̥ttikās.

[^egg_649]: 282:2 Whilst the Kr̥ttikās, or Pleiades, are supposed to consist of seven (or, according to others, of six) stars. the remaining twenty-six nakshatras or lunar mansions, according to our author, vary between one and four stars. Hence the Kr̥ttikās are also called Bahulās, 'the numerous.' In the later accounts, however, a larger number of stars is attributed to several nakshatras. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra, II, pp. 368, 381. The Kāṇva text has: 'Other nakshatras are (i.e. consist of) four; and there is here an abundance, so that he thereby obtains abundance.'

Now it is a misfortune for one to be precluded from intercourse (with his wife): he should therefore not set up his fires under the Kr̥ttikās, lest he should thereby be precluded from intercourse.

6. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of Rohiṇī. For under Rohiṇī it was that Prajāpati, when desirous of progeny (or creatures), set up his fires. He created beings, and the creatures produced by him remained invariable and constant [^egg_651], like (red) cows (rohiṇī): hence the cow-like nature of Rohiṇī. Rich in cattle and offspring therefore he becomes whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fires under Rohiṇī.

[^egg_651]: 283:1 'Tā asya prajāḥ sr̥shṭā ekarūpā upastabdhās tasthū rohiṇya iva.' The Kāṇva text reads: Tam imāḥ prajāḥ sr̥shṭā rohiṇya ivopastabdhās tasthur ekarāpā iva. Sāyaṇa interprets upastabdhāḥ ('propped up, erect,' established) by 'pratibaddhajātayaḥ (of continuous lineage),' and ekarūpāḥ ('uniform') by 'avicchinnapravāhāḥ (of uninterrupted flow or succession).' In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 2, it is stated that Prajāpati created Agni under (the asterism) Rohiṇī, and that the gods then set up that fire under the same asterism.

8. He may also set up his fires under (the asterism of) Mr̥gaśīrsha. For Mr̥gaśīrsha, indeed, is the head of Prajāpati [^egg_652]; and the head (śiras) means excellence (śrī), for the head does indeed mean excellence: hence they say of him who is the most excellent (śreshṭḥa) of a community, that he is the head of that community. Excellence therefore he attains whosoever, knowing this, sets up his fire under Mr̥gaśīrsha.

[^egg_652]: 284:1 For the mythical allusions in this and the succeeding paragraphs, we have to compare Śat. Br. I, 7, 4, 1; Ait. Br. III, 33. According to the version of the myth given in the latter work, Prajāpati transformed himself into a roe-buck (r̥śya) and approached his own daughter (either the sky, or the dawn), who had assumed the shape of a doe (rohit). Out of their most fearful forms the gods then fashioned a divine being called Bhūtavat (i.e. Rudra), in order to punish Prajāpati for his incestuous deed. The latter was accordingly pierced by Bhūtavat's arrow and bounded up to the sky, where he became the constellation called Mr̥ga (i.e. Mr̥gaśīrsha), while his daughter became the asterism Rohiṇī. The arrow on the other hand, with which Prajāpati was pierced, became the constellation called 'the three-knotted arrow (perhaps the girdle of Orion).'

10. But he may, nevertheless, set them up (under Mr̥gaśīrsha). For, assuredly, the body of that god, Prajāpati, is neither a relic nor unholy, [^egg_655]: he may therefore set up (his fires under Mr̥gaśīrsha). 'Under the Punarvasū he should perform the Punarādheya [^egg_656],' thus (it is prescribed).

The direction has been inserted in this place on account of the position of Punarvasū, as the fifth mansion, between Mr̥gaśīrsha, the third, and (Pūrva and Uttara) Phalgunīs, the ninth and tenth mansions, in the original order of the nakshatras.

13. He may also set up his fires under Citrā. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, were contending for superiority. Both parties were desirous of rising to yonder world, the sky. The Asuras then constructed the fire (altar) called rauhiṇa (fit to ascend by), thinking, 'Thereby we shall ascend (ā-ruh) to the sky [^egg_659].'

[^egg_659]: 286:2 In Taitt. Br. I, 1, 2, 4-6 this myth is related as follows: 'There were Asuras, named Kālakañjas. They constructed a fire (altar) with a view to (gaining) the world of heaven. They put, every man of them, a brick to it. Indra, passing himself off for a Brāhman, put a brick on for himself, saying, "This one, Cītra (the wonderful or bright one) by name, is for me!" They climbed up to heaven; Indra, however, pulled out his brick, and they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down, became spiders: two of them flew up, and they became the two heavenly dogs.' On this myth, Dr. A. Kuhn, 'Über entwickelungsstufen der mythenbildung,' p. 129, remarks: 'The myth given in Homer's Od. xi, 305-325, of Otos and Ephialtes, who, in order to fight the immortal gods, piled Ossa on Olympos, and Pelion on Ossa, of ἵν᾽ οὐρανὸς, and who are destroyed by Apollon, shows an obvious resemblance to these Indian myths; the more so, if we divest the latter of their Brāhmanical form, by which altar-bricks are substituted  for mountains; and if we hear in mind that the later versions of the myth, e.g. in the well-known passage of Ovid, put the Gigantes in the place of the Aloades.'

For this reason also one need only take the sun for one's nakshatra (star), since he took away from them their energy, their power. But if he (the sacrificer) should nevertheless be desirous of having a nakshatra (under which to set up his fires), then assuredly that sun is a faultless nakshatra for him; and through that auspicious day (marked by the rising and setting of the sun) he should endeavour to obtain the benefits of whichever of those asterisms he might desire. Let him therefore take the sun alone for his nakshatra [^egg_664].

[^egg_663]: 288:2 This etymology of nakshatra is of course quite fanciful. For Aufrecht's probably correct derivation of the word from nakta-tra, 'night-protector,' cf. Zeitschrift für vergl. Sprachf., VIII, pp. 71, 72. See also Weber, Nakshatra; II, p. 268.

[^egg_664]: 288:3 The Kāṇva text reads: Tasmān na nakshatram ādriyeta yadaivaisha kadā codīyād apy ādadhītaisha hi sarvāṇi kshatrāṇi  yadyu nakshatrakāmaḥ syād upo āsīta nakshatram ahāsya bhavati no etasyānudayo ’sti tasmād v apy upaina(m ā)sīta, 'he need therefore not attend to any nakshatra; but may set up his fires at any time when that (sun) rises, for he (the sun) is all the kshatras. Should he nevertheless be desirous of a nakshatra, let him approach (the sun) with veneration; for then there is a nakshatra for him, and that (sun) does not fail to rise: for this reason let him approach (the sun) with veneration.'

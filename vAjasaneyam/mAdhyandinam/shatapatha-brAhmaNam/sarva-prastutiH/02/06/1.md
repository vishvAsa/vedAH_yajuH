1. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vr̥tra, and gained that supreme authority which they now wield. And by means of the sacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that had been slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence the name Pitr̥yajña [^egg_938] (sacrifice to the Manes).

[^egg_938]: 420:1 This is generally called the Mahāpitr̥yajña, as distinguished from the ordinary monthly Pitr̥yajña of the new-moon sacrifice; for which see II, 4, 2, I seq.

3. Now when he performs that sacrifice, he does so, hoping that thus they (the Asuras) will not slay any of his, or because the gods did so (perform it). Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which the gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods recalled to life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and whatever injury or loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct (or wrong sacrificial performance) [^egg_940] that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this sacrifice (to the fathers).

10. Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshiṇāgni [^egg_947]. He makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters. There are doubtless four intermediate quarters, and the fathers are the intermediate quarters: this is why he makes the corners point towards the intermediate quarters.

[^egg_947]: 422:3 At the conclusion of the Āptya ceremony (cf. I, 2, 2, 18-3, 5) he erects south of the (ordinary) Dakshiṇa-fire a (quadrangular) shed (see further on, paragraph 20) with a door on the north side. Inside it he prepares a quadrangular altar (of the same size as at the Darśapūrṇamāsa; cf. I, 2, 5, 14) with the corners towards the intermediate quarters, in the centre of which he makes the (new) Dakshiṇāgni hearth. [According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 5-6 no digging takes place in preparing the altar (which is to be square) at the Pitr̥yajña.] When the Dakshiṇa-fire is transferred to the new fire-place, the Praṇītā-water (see p. 9, note) is carried after it, followed by the Brahman and Sacrificer, and placed east (not north) of the hearth. The laying down of the fire is preceded by the usual fivefold lustration of the hearth (see p. 2).

Having thrown away the grass-bush, he first encloses (the altar) thus (viz. on the west side), then thus (viz. on the north side), then thus (on the east side).

In the same way he encloses it with the second line of enclosure; and having enclosed it with the second line of enclosure, and smoothed it down, he says, 'Place the sprinkling water on (the altar)!' They accordingly place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the firewood and barhis they lay down beside it [^egg_950]. He (the Āgnīdhra) wipes the spoons.

The latter then takes the dust from the lines and throws it on the utkara (the heap of rubbish, formed north of the altar in preparing the latter), and thereupon again obliterates them. According to Kāty. II, 6, 29, the same ceremony may be performed at the Darśapūrṇamāsa; but there no mention is made of it by our author (see I, 2, 5, 12).

The wooden sword also has been previously put down by the Adhvaryu close behind the praṇītāḥ.

[^egg_951]: 424:1 The lady of the house not being present at the sacrifice to the Manes, neither the ceremony of girding (I, 3, 1, 12 seq.), nor that of her looking at the butter--while it is taken from the Gārhapatya fire, along the east side of the Āhavanīya to the altar--takes place on this occasion. According to the commentators on Katy. V, 8, 25 (Paddh. p. 519), however, the Adhvaryu has to look down on the butter, with the same text (Vāj. S. I, 30) which was used by the sacrificer's wife. For some details to be supplied here, see I, 3, 1, 22-28.

[^egg_960]: 426:2 Instead of the ordinary eleven verses, the first and last of which are recited thrice; see I, 3, 5, 6. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9, I, the Adhvaryu summons the Hotr̥ with 'Recite to the fire, as it is being kindled for the gods (and) fathers!' The bunch of firewood, with the exception of one stick, which is reserved for the after-offerings, is divided into three parts, one of which is thrown on the fire at the same time when the syllable 'om' is pronounced by the Hotr̥ at the end of the kindling-verse.

Thereupon he says, 'Bring Agni hither [^egg_961]! bring Soma hither! bring hither the fathers, accompanied by Soma! bring hither the fathers, seated on the barhis! bring hither the fathers, consumed by Agni! bring hither the butter-drinking gods! bring hither Agni for the Hotr̥ship! bring hither (thine) own greatness [^egg_962]!' Having thus called on (Agni) to bring hither (the fathers and gods), he sits down.

For the formulas 'Bring hither Agni for the Hotr̥ship! bring hither thine own greatness!' Āśval. II, 19, 8 apparently substitutes 'Bring hither Agni Kavyavāhana!' cf. further on, par. 30.

Having then called [^egg_963] for the (Āgnīdhra's) 'Śraushaṭ,' he does not elect the Hotr̥; for this being a sacrifice to the Manes, he does not elect the Hotr̥ [^egg_964], lest he should consign the Hotr̥ to the Manes.

For he who has established his fires, and performs the New and Full-moon sacrifices, approaches the gods; but they have just been

performing the sacrifice to the Manes, and therefore they now propitiate the gods.

And as to his again walking thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling,--they think, 'This holy work of ours shall be accomplished sunwise [^egg_976],' and hence he walks thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling.

[^egg_976]: 435:1 The Kāṇva text has, 'The reason why he moves thrice round, sprinkling from left to right, is that, after going after those three ancestors of his, he thereby leaves them, and returns to this, his own, world.' See II, 6, I, 15.

The tuck, doubtless, is sacred to the Fathers: hence he makes obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck; and obeisance means worship: hence he thereby recognises them as entitled to worship.

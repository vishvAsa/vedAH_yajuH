1. Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is no cessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is imperishable righteousness for him. This, then, is why he offers the Seasonal sacrifices.

2. Then as to why he should perform the Śunāsīrya offering. The prosperity (śrī) that accrued to the gods on performing the Sākamedha offerings, and gaining the victory (over Vr̥tra), is śuna; and the essence (rasa) that belonged to the year gained by them is sīra [^egg_995]. Now that same prosperity which

[^egg_995]: 444:2 The author identifies sīra (plough) with sāra, 'essence, sap;' and takes śuna, ploughshare (?), as identical with śunam, 'successfully, prosperously.' See next page, note 3.

3. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They prepare no uttaravedi; they do not use clotted butter; nor do they churn the fire [^egg_996]. There are five fore-offerings, three after-offerings, and one Samishṭayajus.

[^egg_996]: 445:1 But see XI, 5, 2, 8, 'At all four of these (Cāturmāsya offerings) they churn the fire.' On account of this contradiction, the commentators, on Kāty. V, 11, 3, consider the churning of the fire as optional. But, if the fires were produced by 'churning,' nine fore-offerings and after-offerings would have to be performed, as at the other Seasonal sacrifices, which is expressly forbidden in the above passage. According to Kāty. himself, the Śunāsīrya is to be treated like an ordinary ishṭi, except that the barhis is to be tied together in the way prescribed for the Seasonal offerings; see II, 5, 1, 18.

4. Then, in the first place, there are those five (regular) oblations [^egg_997]. By means of these oblations, indeed, Prajāpati produced creatures; with them he delivered the creatures both ways from Varuṇa's noose; with them the gods slew Vr̥tra and gained that victory which was gained by them. And so does he, by means of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity which accrued to the gods from performing the Sākamedha offerings, and that essence of the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations are (offered).

[^egg_999]: 446:1 According to Kāty. V, II, 6-to, the milk, in this case, is to be offered quite fresh (and warm) from the cow, without having been put on the fire. Rice-gruel may, however, be offered instead.

Hence it is he (Vāyu) that produces it; and for this reason it is (offered) to Vāyu.

10. He may offer the Śunāsīrya at the same time when he performs the Sākamedha offerings. By offering (Seasonal sacrifices) three times in the year, he indeed obtains the (whole) year: he may therefore offer (the Śunāsīrya) at any time [^egg_1002].

[^egg_1002]: 447:2 That is to say, he may perform the Śunāsīrya, either immediately after the Sākamedhāḥ, or at any time within four months after that sacrifice (comm. on Kāty. V, 11, 3). Our author, however, evidently favours the views set forth in the succeeding paragraphs. According to these, the householder who wishes to discontinue the Seasonal offerings after the first round, and to become a Soma-sacrificer, is to perform the Śunāsīrya on the first day of the waxing moon of Phālguna, and then to undergo the dīkshā, or rite of consecration for the Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 2, 1 seq.), either immediately or before the approaching full-moon, when he is to perform the Agnishṭoma (or an animal offering to Agni and Soma or an Āgneyī ishṭi, Kāty. V, 11, 15). If, on the other hand, he intends to continue the Cāturmāsyas for another year (or more), he is to perform the Śunāsīrya on the upavasatha, or day preceding the full-moon.

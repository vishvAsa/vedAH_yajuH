5. And, accordingly, when he performs the Vaiśvadeva, he thereby gains four months, with Agni for his king, with Agni for his leader. Then (in shaving) are used a porcupine's quill spotted in three places, and a copper razor; that three-spotted porcupine's quill resembles the threefold science, and the copper razor resembles the Brahman; for the Brahman is fire, and fire is of reddish (lohita) colour: hence a copper (loha) razor is used. Therewith he has (his head) shaved all round [^egg_1005]; and thus he (the Adhvaryu) encompasses him with the Brahman and the threefold science.

[^egg_1007]: 451:2 The Kāṇva text has: In whatever season the performer of Seasonal offerings goes to yonder world, that season passes him on to the next season, and that next one to the next one,--him the seasons, by transmission, make thus attain to the highest station, to the highest world. Wherefore is it said, 'They find not him that offereth the Seasonal offerings, for he conquereth the highest world, the highest conquest (paramaṁ hy eva lokam paramāṁ jitim jayatīti).'

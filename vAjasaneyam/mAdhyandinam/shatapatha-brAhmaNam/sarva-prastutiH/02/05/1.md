1. Verily, in the beginning, Prajāpati alone existed here [^egg_856]. He thought within himself, 'How can I be propagated?' He toiled and practised austerities. He created living beings [^egg_857]. The living beings created by him passed away: they are those birds. Now man is the nearest to Prajāpati; and man is two-footed: hence birds are two-footed.

[^egg_856]: 384:1 Or, Prajāpati alone was this (universe). Cf. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, p. 70.

[^egg_857]: 384:2 By prajāḥ, or (living) beings, mammalia--especially man and domestic animals--seem to be understood.

2. Prajāpati thought within himself, 'Even as formerly I was alone, so also am I now alone.' He created a second (race of beings); they also passed away: they are those small crawling reptiles other than snakes. He created a third (race), they say; they also passed away: they are those snakes. Yājñavalkya, on his part, declared them to be of two kinds only; but of three kinds they are according to the R̥k.

3. While praising and practising austerities, Prajāpati

thought within himself, 'How comes it that the living beings created by me pass away?' He then became aware that his creatures passed away from want of food. He made the breasts in the fore-part of (their) body [^egg_858] teem with milk. He then created living beings; and by resorting to the breasts, the beings created by him thenceforward continued to exist: they are these (creatures) which have not passed away.

Hence it has been said by the R̥shi [^egg_859],.--'Three generations have passed beyond,'--this is said regarding those that passed away;--'Others settled down around the light (arka, the sun)'--the light doubtless is the fire: those creatures which did not pass away, settled down around the fire; it is with regard to them that this is said.

5. 'The great one (neut.)

And in like manner as Prajāpati created these living beings, so they are propagated: for whenever the breasts of woman and the udder of cattle swell, then whatever is born is born; and by resorting to the breasts these (beings) continue to exist.

6. Now that milk is indeed food; for in the beginning Prajāpati produced it for food. But that

food also means living beings (progeny), since it is by food that they exist: by resorting to the breasts of those who have milk, they continue to exist. And those who have no milk are nursed by the former as soon as they are born; and thus they exist by means of food, and hence food means progeny.

He accordingly set aside for them that share, the Maruts' cake on seven potsherds; and that is this same cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts. The reason why it is one of seven potsherds, is that the host of the Maruts is (distributed in troops) of seven each [^egg_867]. This is why there is a cake on seven potsherds for the Maruts.

With 'the two testicles are ye' he lays on it two stalks of sacrificial grass. With 'Urvaśī thou art' he places the lower araṇi (see p. 294, note 3) thereon. With 'Āyus (old age, or the son of Purūravas and Urvaśī) thou art' he touches the butter in the pot with the upper araṇi; and with 'Purūravas thou art' he puts it down on the lower araṇi. He then calls on the Hotr̥ to recite 'to the fire being churned out.' With the three formulas 'with the gāyatrī (trishṭubh, jagatī) metre I churn thee!' he churns thrice from left to right, and then alternately both ways until fire is produced. He then calls on the Hotr̥ to recite 'to the born fire' (Sāṅkh. III. 13, 21); and in carrying the fire towards the Āhavanīya he makes him recite 'to (the fire) being carried forward.'

Now the virāj metre consists of ten syllables: hence, he obtains both times an inferior (incomplete) virāj for the sake of production, because it was from that inferior (lower) source of production [^egg_874] that Prajāpati twice produced creatures--both the upright and those looking to the ground.

21. There are three Samishṭayajus [^egg_875]; for this (offering) is decidedly greater than an (ordinary) havir-yajña [^egg_876], since it has nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings. However, there may also be only a single Samishṭayajus, since this is a havir-yajña. The priest's fee for it (consists of) the firstborn calf (of the season).

[^egg_875]: 390:3 See I, 9, 2, 25 seq. The formula used, if there be only one Samishṭayajus, is the same as at the Darśapūrṇamāsa, viz. II, 21 b (VIII, 21). If there are three, they are offered to the wind (vāta), the sacrifice, and the lord of sacrifice respectively; the formulas Vāj. S. VIII, 22 a b being used with the second and third. Kāty. V, 2, 9. For the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ and Sākamedhāḥ three Samishṭayajus are prescribed, and for the Śunāsīrīya only one.

[^egg_876]: 390:4 Viz. such as the new and full-moon sacrifice, which serves as the model sacrifice, and at which there are only five fore-offerings and three after-offerings. See I, 5, 3, 1 seq.; I, 8, 2, 7 seq.

22. And what race, what prosperity accrued to Prajāpati from his offering this sacrifice, that same race he produces, that same prosperity he attains

whosoever, knowing this, offers this sacrifice: let him therefore perform this sacrifice.

1. Now it was by means of the Vaiśvadeva that Prajāpati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varuṇa's barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varuṇa. And from their eating Varuṇa's barley corn the name Varuṇapraghāsāḥ (is derived).

4. Now when this (sacrificer) performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Vaiśvadeva), he does so either because thus Varuṇa does not seize his offspring, or because the gods performed (the same offering); and both the children that have been born to him and those that are yet unborn he thereby delivers from Varuṇa's noose, and his children are born without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month.

5. At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires [^egg_879]. The reason why there are two altars and two

[^egg_879]: 392:1 For the performance of the Varuṇapraghāsāḥ the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthātr̥, have to prepare,--to the east of the Āhavanīya, and at the distance of at least three steps (prakrama) from it,--two altars, separate from each other by about a span (of thumb and fore-finger), one south of the other. The northern one, belonging to the Adhvaryu, is to measure between four and five cubits along the west side, and between three and four cubits along the east side; the two sides being between six and eight cubits distant from each other. The southern altar, reserved for the Pratiprasthātr̥; is to be of the usual size of the altar at the haviryajñā. The ceremonies, detailed in I, 2, Brāhmaṇas 4 and 5, have to be performed also on the present occasion. In the middle of the east side of the northern altar a stake is fixed in the ground. On the north side of the northern altar, and contiguous with it, a pit (cātvāla), 1⅓ cubits (the length of the wedge) square, is dug, so as to be separated on the west from the utkara (heap of rubbish) by a narrow passage. With the mould dug up from the pit, the so-called uttara-vedi (upper or north altar) is raised on the northern altar, either of the same dimensions as the pit (1⅓ cubits square) or one third of the area of the northern altar, and so that the stake marks the middle of its east side. In the centre of this mound he makes a hollow (or 'navel'), a span square; and the whole mound is then bestrewed with fine gravel. The texts used while tracing the sides of the pit, thrice throwing the wooden sword within the marked-off space, and raising the uttara-vedi, are given Vāj. S. V, 9-10. During the night the uttara-vedi remains covered with udumbara or plaksha branches or with sacrificial grass. Next morning the two fires for the newly-constructed fireplaces are taken from the Āhavanīya, either by dividing the latter into two equal parts, or by means of two bundles of firewood (threefold bound, see p. 389, note 1), lighted at it, and carried eastwards in a pan covered with sand or mould. While the fires, together with the lustral water and a spoonful of ghee, taken from the pot by five ladlings with the sruva, are taken eastward, the Hotr̥ thrice recites the verse 'Pra devyam deva,' &c.; and the Pratiprasthātr̥ draws, with the wooden sword, a line from the Āhavanīya to the south-west corner (or 'right hip') of the northern altar, or to the uttara-vedi. The Adhvaryu, standing between the two altars, then besprinkles the uttara-vedi with water, while muttering the  texts Vāj. S. V, II; whereupon he pours out on it crosswise the spoonful of clarified butter, with the texts V, 12; and lays, with the mantras V, 13, three enclosing-sticks (paridhi) of pītadāru wood round the 'navel' (see I, 3, 4, 2 seq.), and puts bdellium, fragrant reed-grass, and the front-hair of a ram on the 'navel' as a foundation (sambhāra, see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.) for the fire, which is then laid down thereon. On a hearth-mound (khara), a cubit square, formed on the southern altar, the Pratiprasthātr̥ also lays down his fire, after performing the usual fivefold lustration (see p. 2). Thereupon the praṇītā-water is brought forward in the way set forth at I, 1, 1, 12 seq. Kāty. V, 3, 9-4, 21. For a different mode of transferring the fire to the special fire-places, see p. 396, note 1.

fires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varuṇa's noose both ways,--on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking to the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.

6. On the northern (uttara) altar he raises the uttara-vedi (upper or north altar), not on the southern one. Varuṇa, doubtless, is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to the people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This is why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.

When the fire has been trimmed, both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātr̥) make the second libation (of butter). Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having called (on the Āgnīdhra) for the 'Śraushaṭ,' chooses the Hotr̥. The chosen Hotr̥ then seats himself on the Hotr̥'s seat beside the northern altar; and having seated himself, he urges (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātr̥) to proceed. Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step across (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for the 'Śraushaṭ,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hotr̥), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!' and 'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' at each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons) together (into the juhū) at the fourth [^egg_891], they both proceed with the nine fore-offerings [^egg_892].

Tanūnapāt (or Narāśaṁsa); 3. the Iḍs; 4. the Barhis. The remaining ones are--5. the doors (of heaven); 6. dawn and night; 7. the two divine Hotr̥s; 8. the three goddesses (Sarasvatī, Iḍā, and Bhāratī); 9. all the deities to whom offering is made during the sacrifice (see I, 5, 3, 22 seq.). The objects of the first eight offerings are identical with those of the first eight verses of the Āprī hymns.

Now the reason why they make this exchange, is this,--Varuṇa is the nobility, and the male represents energy: hence they thereby bestow energy on the nobility.

41. Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'O Brahman, shall I step forward?' Having put on the (remaining) kindling-stick [^egg_895] he says, Agnīdh, trim the fire!

[^egg_895]: 403:2 See II, 5, 2, 19, and I, 8, 2, 3.

 He, the Adhvaryu, then pours the clotted butter [^egg_896] (in the pr̥shadājya-upabhr̥t) into the two spoons (the juhū and upabhr̥t); and the Pratiprasthātr̥ also, if he have any clotted butter, divides it into two parts and pours it (into the two spoons); but if there is no clotted butter, he divides the butter in the upabhr̥t in two parts and pours them out separately. Then both step across (to the south side of the fires). The Adhvaryu, having stepped across and called for the 'Śraushaṭ,' says (to the Hotr̥), 'Pronounce the offering-formula to the gods!' and, 'Pronounce the offering-formula!' at each (subsequent after-offering). Thus they both perform the nine after-offerings [^egg_897], pouring together (the butter from the spoons) at the (or at every) fourth after-offering. The reason why there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings, is that he thereby delivers the creatures both times from Varuṇa's noose,--by the former (he delivers) the upright and by the latter those looking to the ground: for this reason there are nine fore-offerings and nine after-offerings.

[^egg_896]: 404:1 Pr̥shad-ājya (lit. mottled butter) is clarified butter mixed with sour milk.

[^egg_897]: 404:2 The recipients of the nine after-offerings are as follows: 1. The divine Barhis; 2. the divine doors; 3. the divine dawn and night; 4. the two divine benefactresses (joshṭrī); 5. the two goddesses of potent sacrifice (ūrjāhutī); 6. the two divine Hotr̥s; 7. the three goddesses; 8. the divine Narāśaṁsa; 9. the divine Agni Svishṭakr̥t.

and called for the (Āgnīdhra's) 'Śraushaṭ,' the Adhvaryu thus addresses (the Hotr̥) [^egg_899], 'The divine Hotr̥s are summoned for the proclamation of success; the human is called upon for the song of praise!' The Hotr̥ then intones the song of praise (sūktavāka). Thereupon both seize their prastara-bunches and throw them (into the fires); both take a single straw each therefrom and remain sitting by (the fires); when the Hotr̥ recites the song of praise,--

He has gone!'--'Bid (the gods) hear!'--'Yea, may (one) hear!'--'Goodspeed to the divine Hotr̥s! Success to the human!'---The Adhvaryu also (afterwards) [^egg_901] says (to the Hotr̥), 'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"' They both throw the enclosing-sticks (into the fire); and after taking up the spoons together, they both place them on the wooden sword [^egg_902].

[^egg_901]: 405:3 In thus briefly recapitulating the chief points of the course of sacrificial performance, the author's object is merely to assign to each officiating priest--especially to the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthātr̥--his special share of business. In the actual performance, the pronunciation of the formula of 'All-hail and blessing' (see I, 9, 1, 26), of course, comes after the throwing of the enclosing-sticks into the fire (see I, 8, 3, 22).

He (the Adhvaryu) performs the three Samishṭayajus (with the respective texts) [^egg_904]; the Pratiprasthātr̥ takes up his spoon (and performs those oblations) silently.--The same garments, worn by the sacrificer and his wife at the Vaiśvadeva, should be put on also on this occasion. They now take (the havis) mixed with the burnt scrapings of the Varuṇa curds, and betake themselves to (the place of) the expiatory bath (avabhr̥tha). This (ablution) stands in relation to Varuṇa, (being performed) with a view to deliverance from Varuṇa's power. No Sāman-hymn is sung on this occasion, for at this (sacrifice) nothing whatever is performed with a Sāman-hymn. Having silently walked thither and entered (the water), he (the Adhvaryu) immerses (the vessel containing the scrapings).

[^egg_905]: 406:2 Kāty. V, 5, 30-33, and the scholiasts supply the following particulars: The sacrificer and his wife, accompanied by the priests, are to repair to some quiet part of flowing water. The Adhvaryu then takes the sacrificer by the arm and makes him enter the water. Thereupon he himself enters, strews sacrificial grass on the water, puts a stick on it, and thereon offers a spoonful of butter to Agni. Then follow six oblations, viz. four fore-offerings, performed in the usual way (the one to the Barhis being omitted);  an oblation of butter to Varuṇa, and another of the scrapings of curds to Agni and Varuṇa. Other authorities offer ten oblations instead of six, viz. four fore-offerings, two 'butter-portions' to Agni and Soma, the two oblations to Varuṇa and Agni-Varuṇa, and two after-offerings. The Adhvaryu then immerses the butter-pot, with the text Vāj. S. III, 48. Thereupon the sacrificer and his wife bathe without diving, but wash each other's back. They then come out of the water and put on fresh clothes.

48. Thereupon they shave (the sacrificer's) hair and beard; and take up the two fires [^egg_906],--for only after changing his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground) he performs that (other) sacrifice [^egg_907], since it is not proper that he should perform the Agnihotra on the uttaravedi: for this reason he changes his place. Having gone to the house [^egg_908] and 'churned out' the fires, he performs the full-moon offering. These seasonal offerings doubtless are detached sacrifices; whereas the full-moon offering is a regular, established sacrifice: hence he finally establishes himself by means of that regular sacrifice; and therefore he changes his place (to the ordinary sacrificial ground).

[^egg_906]: 407:1 Viz. by lighting (or heating) at them two araṇis or churning-sticks, by means of which the fires are transferred to the old hearths. According to the Paddhati, the remaining ceremonies of the ishṭi, from the offering of the Barhis (see I, 9, 2, 29) to the end, are performed previously to the lifting of the fires.

[^egg_907]: 407:2 Viz. the full-moon sacrifice, see II, 6, 2, 59, where, however, agnau instead of agnī. The construction here is quite irregular. The Kāṇva text has: keśaśmaśrūptvāgnī samārohayata udavasāya hy etena yajate.

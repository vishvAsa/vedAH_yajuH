4. And, again, why standing towards north-east,--in that quarter is the gate of the world of heaven, hence it is standing with his face towards northeast that one offers libations, and standing towards north-east that one leads up the dakshiṇās: it is by the gate that he thus makes him enter into the world of heaven.

6. [Vāj. S.

7. With two (verses) he heats it on the fire,--the Sacrificer is two-footed, and the Sacrificer is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus heats it (the pan). [He does so] with a gāyatrī and a trishṭubh verse,--the Gāyatrī is the vital air, and the Trishṭubh the body; and the animal is as much as the vital air and the body: thus by as much as the animal (consists of) he puts that (pan) on the fire. And, again, the Gāyatrī is Agni, and the Trishṭubh is Indra; and the fire relates to Indra and Agni: as great as the fire is, as great as is its measure, by so much he thus heats it. These two (verses) have seven feet (viz. three and four respectively),--the fire-altar consists of seven

layers [^egg_489]; seven seasons are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

9. Now, if the flame is too long in mounting up, some throw coals on (the pan), thinking, 'There is fire now on both sides.' But let him not do so; for the animal is indeed born with bones [^egg_490]; but it is not forced in with bones, as it were, at first; but it is introduced only as seed. Now that flame is boneless seed: hence the flame alone should mount up to it.

[^egg_490]: 254:2 The fire ultimately to be placed on the new Gārhapatya hearth (VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.)--whence the Āhavanīya on the great fire-altar has to be kindled--is to be produced in the ukhā, or pan, as it were in its womb; but the material (grass and hemp) which has already been put in the pan, is only to be kindled by the blaze of the fire on which the pan has been placed, without any burning coals being applied to the fuel within the pan.

11. It should be one of kr̥muka wood. Now, the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, strove together. The gods, having placed Agni in front, went up to the Asuras. The Asuras cut off the point of that flame held forward. It settled down on this earth, and became that kr̥muka tree: hence it is sweet, for there is vital essence (in it). Hence also it is red, for it is a flame, that kr̥muka

tree being the same as this Agni: it is (in the shape of) fire that he imparts growth to it.

13. It is soaked in ghee;--the inner membrane of the womb from which Agni was produced consisted of ghee: hence he now blazes up towards it, for it (the stick) is his self (body); and hence it (the kr̥muka) has no ashes: (Agni) himself now enters into his own self,--to avoid injury [^egg_491], for the inner membrane does not injure the embryo; and it is from the inner membrane that he who is born is born: 'When he (Agni) is born, may he be born from the inner membrane!' thus he thinks.

[^egg_491]: 255:1 The dative 'ahiṁsāyai' again doubtless belongs to the first sentence of the paragraph ('it is soaked in ghee'), the intervening clauses being inserted for explanation. For a similar construction, see above, p. 198, note 2.

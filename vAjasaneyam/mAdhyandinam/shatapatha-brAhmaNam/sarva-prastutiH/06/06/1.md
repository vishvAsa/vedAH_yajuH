1. Many [^egg_481] are the oblations, in the building of the fire-altar, as well as at any other (special ceremony) than the building of the fire-altar. For there are supernumerary rites,--supernumerary are those which are (performed) over and above another rite: of these [^egg_482] are the building of the altar (Agnicityā), the Rājasūya, the Vājapeya, and the Aśvamedha; and because they are over and above the other (normal) rites, therefore they are supernumerary.

[^egg_481]: 246:1 Or rather, too many, more (than are required at one of the normal Soma-sacrifices),--ādhvarikebhyo bahutarāni, Sāy.

[^egg_482]: 246:2 That is, as would seem from Sāyaṇa, of such ceremonies as have supernumerary, or additional, oblations to the normal ones connected with them. This discussion seems to be introduced here on account of the additional oblation (that to Vaiśvānara) offered at the initiation ceremony. As an 'additional' or special, oblation at the Vājapeya, Sāyaṇa refers to the pap of wild rice (V, 1, 4, 12); whilst at the Rājasūya the one to Anumati (V, 2, 3, 4) is said to belong to the same category.

2. A cake [^egg_483] on eleven potsherds to Agni and Vishṇu,--that is the initiation (offering) of the (Soma) sacrifice;--one on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvānara, and a pap to the Ādityas,--these two belong to Agni.

[^egg_483]: 247:1 These and the subsequent offerings form part of the Dīkshā, or initiation ceremony, for the Soma-sacrifice to be performed after the completion of the fire-altar. This initiation ceremony commences on the day of new moon, a week after the preparation of the ukhā, or fire-pan. An integral part of (the first day of) this ceremony is the kindling of a fire in the ukhā--the 'Ukhya Agni'--which ultimately serves to supply the fires for the brick altars built on the completion of the period of initiation. The Dīkshā is, as a rule, to be performed daily for a year, during which time the fire has to be kept up in the ukhā, and carried about by the Sacrificer for a time each day. while the cake to Agni-Vishṇu here mentioned is the ordinary cake-offering prescribed for the Dīkshā of the normal Soma-sacrifice (see III, 1, 3, 1), the Vaiśvānara cake is peculiar to the Agnicayana.

5. Now as regards that (cake) for Agni and Vishṇu, its mystic import is the same as what is (implied) in a preparatory ceremony. And the (cake) on twelve potsherds for Vaiśvānara is for

the obtainment of all the fires, Vaiśvānara being all the fires;--it is one of twelve potsherds, for twelve months are a year, and Vaiśvānara is the year.

6. And, again, as to why he prepares one for Vaiśvānara,--it is because he is about to produce Agni as Vaiśvānara (belonging, or dear to, all men): in the initiation offering he first pours him forth as seed, and whatlike the seed is that is poured into the womb, suchlike is (the child) born therefrom; and inasmuch as he now pours forth that (Agni) Vaiśvānara as seed, therefore he is born hereafter as Vaiśvānara.

7. And why he prepares those two (other) oblations,--Vaiśvānara is the ruling power, and that Āditya pap is the people: he thus makes both the ruling power and the people. The Vaiśvānara (cake) he prepares first, and having thereby made the ruling power, he makes the people.

8. That (Vaiśvānara cake) is one single (oblation), having one single deity: he thus makes the ruling power to be concentrated in one (person), and excellence to be concentrated in one. The other, the pap, has many deities, for the pap is a multiplicity of rite-grains, and those Ādityas are a multiplicity of gods: he thus bestows multiplicity on the people.

[^egg_485]: 249:2 Viz. the five Audgrabhaṇa libations of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice offered in the manner there described. See part ii, p. 20, note.

[^egg_486]: 249:3 Though Agni, or the fire-altar, is commonly called the five-layered one (pañcacitika), consisting as it does of five complete  layers of bricks, on the top of these there is a small additional pile of two layers, the lower one (punaściti) in the form of the Gārhapatya hearth (VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.), and the upper one, consisting of two bricks, on which the fire is ultimately laid down. See p. 188, note 4. Hence Agni is also called 'saptacitika.'

 Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus pours him forth as seed. Those two kinds (of libations) amount to twelve,--twelve months are a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

[^egg_348]: 172:2 On the two libations of ghee, see part i, p. 124 note; p. 128, n. 2. It is doubtful which of the two libations is intended here; whether the first which in any case belongs to Prajāpati, but is usually made with a different formula from the one prescribed here, or the second. The later ritualists themselves seem to have been doubtful on this point; but Kātyāyana (XVI, 1, 35-37) leans to the opinion, that the second libation must be intended; both libations thus being made to Prajāpati on this occasion. Sāyaṇa remarks,--hiraṇyavatyā r̥kā 'hiraṇyagarbhaḥ samavartatety' ata uttaraṁ samaprakam (? samaprakāram) āghāram āghārayati; prajāpatir vai hiraṇyagarbhaḥ sa cāgnis tam evam tarpayitvāpnotīty abhiprāyaḥ.

[^egg_349]: 172:3 That is, Vāj. S. XXV, 10 (XIII, 4; Rd S. X, 321, 1, 'Hiraṇyagarbhaḥ samavartatāgre), 'Hiraṇyagarbha (the golden child) came first into existence; he was born as the only lord of all being; he sustained this earth and sky: what god (or the god K a) shall we serve with offering.'

is Prajāpati, and Prajāpati is Agni. There are twelve Āprī-verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Prajāpati, for the relation of the victim is also that of the animal cake [^egg_350]. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Prajāpati. The offering and invitatory formulas contain the word 'Ka,' for Prajāpati is Ka [^egg_351].

[^egg_350]: 173:1 See III, 8, 3, 1 seq.

[^egg_351]: 173:2 See I, 1, 1, 13 with note.--The above verse, R̥k S. X, 121, I, and following five verses,--each of which ends with, 'what god (or the god Ka) shall we serve with offering,'--are used with the omentum, the animal cake (paśupuroḍāśa), and the animal oblations respectively; viz. the first three verses as invitatory formulas (anuvākayā) and the last three as offering formulas (yājyā). Āśv. Śr. III, 8, 1.--Vāj. S. XXV, 10-13, only the first four verses are given together; whilst Sāyaṇa, in accordance with Āśvalāyana, remarks,--vapā puroḍāśapaśūnāṁ 'hiraṇyagarbhaḥ samavartatāgra' ity ādayaḥ syuḥ.

6. He then slaughters for Vāyu Niyutvat (the wind, driving a team of horses) that white, bearded (he-goat). When Prajāpati had produced living beings, he looked about him, and from exceeding delight his seed fell: it became that white, hornless, bearded he-goat (aja, 'unborn'); for seed is life-sap, and as far as there is life-sap, so far extends the self. And when he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar). It is a white one, because seed is white. It is hornless, because seed is hornless. It belongs to Vāyu, because Vāyu (the wind) is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams (niyut [^egg_352]) are the in-breathing: the out-breathing and in-breathing he thus lays into him.

12. And, again, why the victim belongs to Vāyu, and the animal cake to Prajāpati;--when the gods restored the relaxed Prajāpati, they, by means of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and by means of this cake they restored that body (trunk) of his. And as to why it belongs to Prajāpati, it is because the body (self) is Prajāpati; and (why it is) one on twelve potsherds,--twelve months are a year, and Prajāpati is the year. One of the offering prayers and one of the invitatory prayers [^egg_354] contain (the word) 'ka,' for Prajāpati is Ka.

[^egg_354]: 175:1 The three chief oblations of the Animal Sacrifice, requiring each an invitatory prayer (anuvākyā) and an offering prayer (yājyā), are the omentum-oblation (vapā), the animal cake (paśupuroḍāśa), and the meat oblations (paśu-havis). This is the order on the present occasion, whilst usually the cake-oblation succeeds the offering of meat portions. Now the first of the three invitatory prayers (that of the omentum), viz. Vāj. S. XXVII, 26 (R̥k S. X, 121, 8), and the last of the three offering prayers (that of the meat portions), viz. Vāj. S. XXVII, 25 (R̥k S. X, 121, 7), end with the refrain, 'what god (or, the god Ka) should we serve with offering.' Thus, then, the first and the last of the six formulas would be  addressed to Prajāpati; and to him is also exceptionally offered the animal cake, which is here assigned the central position, and which, in the normal sacrificial order, would belong to the recipient of the animal sacrifice itself, or in the present case, to Vāyu Niyutvat. Sāyaṇa, on the other hand, makes the above two verses, containing the word Ka, the invitatory and offering prayers of the cake-offering, as the MS. makes him say,--kadvatyau yājyānuvākye puroḍāśasya, 'āpo ha yad br̥hatīr' (R̥k S. X, 121, 7), 'yaścid āpo' (X, 121, 8) ity ete. This, indeed, would also seem to be the opinion of Kātyāyana, whose rules (XVI, I, 39-43) are,--39. To Prajāpati belongs the animal cake at both (animal sacrifices); 40. The offering and invitatory formulas of the Prājāpatya (animal sacrifice) contain the word 'Ka;' 41. Those of the Vāyavya contain the word 'bright;' 42. Optionally so, those of the omentum (but not at the meat portion, commentary); 43. The remainder is equal in all (three views).--Now it would indeed be the most natural, that the formulas of the cake-offering, here exceptionally assigned to Prajāpati, should be made to correspond to that deity; but the order in which the formulas are given in the Vāj. S. XXVII, 23-28 (cf. Āśval. III, 8, I, as well as paragraph 13 above, seems to favour the first view; though the next paragraph shows that there were differences of opinion on this point. Cf. next note.

13. Now when in the first place he offers the omentum, he thereby puts into him (Prajāpati) that vital air which is here in front. And when they proceed with that (cake) in the middle, it is because this trunk is in the middle. And when they proceed thereafter with the (meat) oblation, he thereby puts into him that vital air which is behind. The (remaining) offering and invitatory prayers should contain the word 'bright,' with the view of the obtainment of bright forms; and the word 'niyut' (team), for the obtainment of that form which has a team [^egg_355].

[^egg_355]: 176:1 The form of Prajāpati which has a team of horses is Vāyu, the god of wind; while his bright forms are represented by Agni, the fire (VI, I, 3, 20, 'Agni is all bright things').--Vāj. S. XXVII, 29-34 gives six verses for use as invitatory and offering formulas  at the ishṭakāpaśu to Vāyu. Five of these contain the word 'niyut,' team, but only the first two contain the word 'śukra' (bright): these two are presumably to be used on the present occasion; though I am at a loss to see what other two verses containing the word 'bright' are to be used; unless indeed 'śuklavatyaḥ' in the text means verses containing some word for 'bright,' in which case the ordinary verses used at an animal offering to Vāyu Niyutvat, viz. Vāj. S. XXVII, 23 and 24 (R̥k S. VII, 91, 3; 90, 3) which contain the word 'śveta' (white, light), might be used. The MS. of Sāyaṇa's commentary is unfortunately very corrupt in this place; it alludes to the latter two verses, but whether to recommend them, or set them aside, for the present occasion, is not clear. He does, however, specially except the formulas of the animal cake from being included in the above specification. In the view put forth in paragraph 14, the above-mentioned two verses would apparently have to be used for the omentum-oblation, the two verses containing 'Ka' for the cake-oblation, and (any) two verses containing the word 'team' (either the ordinary ones, R̥k S. VII, 92, 5; VI, 49, 4; or some of the special ones) for the meat-oblation.

And, again, why he slaughters this animal;--in this animal doubtless the form of all (the five kinds of) animals is (contained): inasmuch as it is hornless and bearded, that is the form of man, for man is hornless and bearded; inasmuch as it is hornless and furnished with a mane, that is the form of the horse, for the horse is hornless and furnished with a mane; inasmuch as it is eight-hoofed, that is the bull's form, for the bull is eight-hoofed; inasmuch as its hoofs are like those of the sheep, that is the form of the

Whichever of these may suit him--either those five animals, or that (he-goat) for Prajāpati, or that one for (Vāyu) Niyutvat [^egg_356]--

[^egg_356]: 178:1 Sāyaṇa here supplies 'let him perform that,'--eshām karmaṇāṁ madhye yat karmāsya sampadyeta tat kuryād iti śeshaḥ; but he then adds, that the pronoun 'it' (tam) at the beginning of the next paragraph is caused by proximity of the Niyutvatīya.

Vr̥tra, assuredly, is no other than the moon; and when during that night (of new moon) he is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (Indra) finishes in destroying him by means of that (new-moon sacrifice), and leaves nothing remaining of him.'

[^egg_359]: 179:1 In the older division of the year the first or spring season (vasanta) begins with the month of Phālguna, that is the month when the moon is in conjunction with the nakshatra of the Uttare Phalgunī, whence that full moon, in the Kaush. Br. 5, 1, is called the mouth, and that of the first Phalgunī the tail, of the year. See A. Weber, Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, p. 329. In the above, somewhat bold figure, we are, Sāyaṇa reminds us, to understand the fifteenth or last day (of the dark fortnight) of the first Phalgunī, and the pratipad, or first day of the second Phalgunī.

And when, after initiating himself at new moon, he buys (Soma) at new moon [^egg_366], he piles up as many bricks as he (during the interval) makes space for; and when his (Agni's second) wing is covered (with loose soil), the whole Agni is built up.

[^egg_364]: 181:2 The author argues in support of the orthodox initiation-period of just one year, as just the amount of time required for preparing the exact amount of space (or brick-spaces) requisite for an altar of proper size. If the initiation were to last less than a year, he would not have had sufficient time to prepare the necessary amount of space, or rather, number of spaces required for the bricks; and, by implication, he would not acquire for himself an adequate place hereafter.

spaces of his filled up (which are prepared) during the days there are after the buying (of Soma) [^egg_367]? Well, when he buys (Soma) at new moon, after becoming initiated at new moon (a year previously), then he piles up just as many bricks as (during that interval) he makes space for; and what days there then are after the buying (of Soma), during that interval the Adhvaryu builds up the fire-altar. But when should he build up, if there were not that interval? As many as there are days and nights in the year, so many are the bricks of that fire-altar. Thereto (comes) a thirteenth month, for there is that thirteenth month;--thus during the days there are after the buying (of Soma), those spaces of it (the altar) are filled up afterwards with those bricks of the thirteenth month: thus the spaces and the bricks become equal.

[^egg_367]: 182:1 That is, during the days from the commencement to the completion of the altar. These are the upasad-days (part ii, p. 104 seq.), the number of which varies from three days up to three years. During this period the Upasads have to be performed twice daily, and in the interval between the two performances the building of the altar takes place, a certain number of bricks being added each day.

38. As to this they say, 'Of that animal he should offer no Samishṭayajus, nor should he go down with the heart-spit to the purificatory bath [^egg_375]; for that animal (sacrifice) is the commencement of Agni; the Samishṭayajus are the gracious dismissal of the deities [^egg_376]; and the purificatory bath is the completion;--lest he should at the very commencement dismiss the deities, and complete the sacrifice.' Let him nevertheless complete (the sacrifice): Prajāpati, having offered that animal, saw that he had not reached the end of him, Agni,--let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). And, again, why he completes it;--that animal sacrifice is his vital air, and if anything were to cut him off from that, it would cut him off from the vital air; and if anything were to cut him off from the vital air, he would thus die: let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). Now, then, as to the vows (rites of abstinence).

[^egg_375]: 185:1 See III, 8, 5, 8 seq.

[^egg_376]: 185:2 See I, 9, 2, 26-27.

39. Here now they say, 'After he has performed that animal offering, he must not sleep upon (a couch), nor eat flesh, nor hold carnal intercourse; for that animal sacrifice is the first Dīkshā, and improper surely it would be, were the initiated to sleep upon (a couch), or were he to eat flesh, or hold carnal intercourse.' But in no way is this a Dīkshā, for there is neither a girdle, nor a black

antelope skin [^egg_377]; but he makes this the first brick [^egg_378]: let him therefore, if he like, sleep upon (a couch); and whatever food animals here eat, all that is here obtained and taken possession of by him; and whatever kinds of food there are other than honey, of all those he may eat at pleasure, if he can get them. Carnal intercourse, however, he may not hold prior to the (offering of) clotted curds to Mitra and Varuṇa [^egg_379]: the purport of this (will be explained) hereafter.

[^egg_377]: 186:1 For the antelope skin used at the initiation-ceremony, see III, 2, 1, 1; for the girdle, ib. 10.

[^egg_378]: 186:2 See above, VI, 2, 1, 20.

[^egg_379]: 186:3 This is the concluding oblation of the Soma-sacrifice, performed at the close of the Agnicayana; see IX, 5, 1, 54.

40. Here now they say, 'At this sacrifice he should give a Dakshiṇā (sacrificial gift); thinking, "Lest my sacrifice should be without a dakshiṇā!" let him give to the Brahman the prescribed dakshiṇā, for the Brahman is the entire sacrifice: thus the entire sacrifice of his becomes healed.' Let him not do so; for he makes this a brick, and it would be just as if he were to give a present with each brick: only at that (proper) time [^egg_380] let him therefore give what it befits him (to give).

[^egg_380]: 186:4 Viz. at the proper time when the priests receive their fees, after the mid-day Soma-service, see part ii, p. 340.

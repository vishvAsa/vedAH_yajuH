28. He builds up with [^egg_307], 'By that deity'--that deity, doubtless, is Vāc (speech),--'Aṅgiras-like,'--Aṅgiras, doubtless, is the breath;--'lie thou steady!'--that is, 'lie thou firm;' or 'lie thou firmly established.' It is both with speech and with breath that he builds; for Agni is speech, and Indra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up. And again, Indra and Agni are all the gods, (for) Agni belongs to all deities: thus as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up.

[^egg_307]: 154:1 This is the formula (Vāj. S. XII, 53) with which the so-called 'sādanam' or 'settling' of the bricks is performed. See VII, 1, 1, 30.

29. Here now they say, 'Wherefore is Agni (the fire-altar) built of this (earth)?' But, surely, when that deity (Prajāpati) became relaxed (fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his life-sap; and when the gods restored him (put him together), they gathered him up from this earth: this earth then is that one brick [^egg_308], for Agni is this earth, since

[^egg_308]: 154:2 That is, the first brick which the wife of the Sacrificer herself forms, and which is called Ashāḍḥā. See VI, 3, 1, 1; 5, 3, 1.

it is thereof [^egg_309] that the whole Agni is built up. Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.

30. As to this they say, 'But if he (Agni) thus consists of one brick, how then (comes he to be) a five-bricked [^egg_310] one?' Now surely the first brick of clay is this earth,--whatever made of clay he places on that (altar) that is that one brick. And when he puts thereon the heads of the animal victims [^egg_311], that is the animal-brick. And when he puts on the gold plate and man [^egg_312], when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And when he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee) [^egg_313] when he puts on the mortar and pestle [^egg_314], and fire-sticks, that is the wood-brick. And when he puts on a lotus-leaf (petal), a tortoise [^egg_315], sour curds, honey, ghee, and whatever other food he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food. Thus, then, it is a five-bricked (Agni).

[^egg_310]: 155:2 Sāyaṇa only refers here to the fact that the sacrifice (yajña) is called 'pāṅkta,' 'the fivefold.'

[^egg_316]: 155:8 Apparently some kind of porous stone. Three such perforated stones or 'bricks' are used in the construction of the fire-altar; viz. one which is laid on the gold man in the centre of the bottom layer (a sāman relating to bhūs, the earth, being pronounced  on it while touching it); the second in the centre of the third layer; and the third one being laid upon the centre of the completed fifth layer. They are meant to represent the three worlds, the holes being intended to afford to the Sacrificer (represented by the gold man) a passage to the highest regions. See VI, 2, 3, 1 seq.

say a prayer while touching it, but thus all those (bricks) of his are turned towards the naturally perforated one.' Let him not do so, for those bricks doubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would be just as if he were to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But indeed, the fire which is deposited on the pile, that is the head of all those (bricks).

Having become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but let him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became Prajāpati [^egg_318]; by assuming that form, Prajāpati created the gods [^egg_319]; by assuming that form, the gods became immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Prajāpati, and the gods became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby becomes.

1. He then stands by him worshipping with the Vātsapra rite [^egg_536], For Prajāpati, having by means of the Vishṇu-strides produced creatures, created vital power for them by means of the Vātsapra rite; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having, by means of the Vishṇu-strides, produced creatures (or, subjects), creates vital power for them by means of the Vātsapra rite.

[^egg_536]: 283:1 That is, the recitation of Vāj. S. XII, 18-28 or 29 (R̥k S. X, 45), ascribed to the poet Vatsaprī Bhālandana. The Brāhmaṇa, however, comments only on the first three verses, and perhaps these alone were used for the purpose at the time when the Brāhmaṇa was composed.

2. Now the Vātsapra rite, doubtless, is he, the golden-handed [^egg_537] (Agni);--hence whomsoever that is born one may wish to obtain the full (measure of) life, let him touch that one with the Vātsapra rite, and he thereby creates vital power for that newborn one; and accordingly that one obtains the full (measure of) life. And whomsoever one may wish to be vigorous, let him first address that one with the Vikr̥ti (fashioning) formula [^egg_538], and that one accordingly becomes vigorous.

[^egg_537]: 283:2 This is a somewhat doubtful meaning of 'dākshāyaṇa-hasta.' The synonyms (if correct), hiraṇyapāṇi and hiraṇyahasta, always refer to Savitr̥, the sun.

3. [Vāj. S. XII, 18-20] 'From the sky Agni was first born;'--the sky, doubtless, is the breath, and from the breath he (Agni) was indeed first born,--'from us the second time, the knower of beings,'--inasmuch as he, man-like, on that occasion generated him a second time [^egg_539];--'the

[^egg_540]: 284:1 The construction of the text here favoured by the author is very doubtful. It has probably to be construed,--'the third time (he, Agni, was born) in the waters, he, the manly-minded (or, friendly to men). Kindling him, the imperishable (Agni), the heedful (? or pious) one praises him,'--or perhaps, 'While kindling him, the considerate one praises him unceasingly.' A point which favours the author's construction is that, in verse 3, 'nr̥maṇaas' certainly refers not to Agni, but to him who generated him.

Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trishṭubhs, and eleven (syllables), they are Indra;--but Agni consists of Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him.

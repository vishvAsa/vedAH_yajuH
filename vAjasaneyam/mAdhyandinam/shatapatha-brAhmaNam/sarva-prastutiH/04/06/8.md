1. Now the consecration-ceremony [^egg_1018] (for the sacrificial session) is a sitting down, is a session (sattra): hence they say of them, 'they sit.' And when thereafter they perform the sacrifice, then they (under)go; then he, who is the leader, leads: hence they say of them, 'they (under)go [^egg_1019].'

[^egg_1018]: 440:3 For the Dīkshā see III, 1, 1, 1 seq. In the Kāṇva text I have found nothing corresponding to the present Brāhmaṇa.

[^egg_1019]: 440:4 That is to say, the verb 'i' (to go; more especially its compound upa-i, to undergo, go through, undertake) is used of sacrificial performances in the Sattra lasting for twelve (pressing) days and upward, to distinguish the latter from the ahīna-sacrifices, lasting for from two to twelve (pressing) days.

And when afterwards, having reached the end of the sacrifice, they rise, that is 'the rising:' hence they say of them, 'They have risen.' So much, then, for preliminary remark.

3. Now those who are about to consecrate themselves settle (the time and place) between them. If they intend to construct a fire-altar, they take up their (ordinary sacrificial) fires on churning-sticks [^egg_1020] and betake themselves together to where they are about to perform the animal offering to Prajāpati. Having churned (the fire), and put fire-wood on, they take out the Āhavanīya fire, and perform that animal offering to Prajāpati.

They have one and the same Āhavanīya, but different Gārhapatyas, during the consecration and the Upasads [^egg_1023].

[^egg_1023]: 442:1 At Sattras there are usually twelve Upasad days. See p. 105, note 1. Ait. Br. IV, 24 enjoins twelve days for the Dīkshā and as many for the Upasads of the Dvādaśāha. Kāty. XII, 1, 19; 2, 14 gives no special rule regarding the duration of the Dīkshā, but enjoins twelve Upasads. See also Lāṭy. III, 3, 27; Āśv. VI, 1, 2.

1. Threefold, forsooth, is science; the R̥cs, the Yajus, and the Sāmans. The R̥cs are this (earth), since it is thereon that he who sings them, does sing them; the R̥cs are speech, since it is by speech that he who sings them, does sing them. And the Yajus, forsooth, are the air, and the Sāmans the sky. That same threefold science is used in the Soma-sacrifice.

3. This, then, is the thousandfold progeny of Vāc (speech) [^egg_1012]. Indra (obtained for his share) two-thirds, and Vishṇu one-third [^egg_1013]: the R̥cs and Sāmans are Indra, and the Yajus are Vishṇu. Therefore in the Sadas they perform (the Śastras and Stotras) with the R̥c and Sāman, for the Sadas is Indra's own.

6. The gods said to Speech, 'Go thou forward and make this known!' She said, 'What will be my reward then?'--'Whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svāhā, and without Vashaṭ, that shall be thine!' Hence whatever in the sacrifice is offered with Svāhā, and without Vashaṭ, that belongs to Speech. She then went forward and made that known, saying, 'Do this so! do this so!'

1. The Upāṁśu (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the Sacrifice [^egg_600], the Upāṁśu-savana (press-stone) the through-breathing, and the Antaryāma (graha) the in-breathing.

[^egg_600]: 248:1 That is, the sacrificial man, or the sacrifice personified in Soma and the sacrificer.

2. Now as to why it is called Upāṁśu. There is a graha called Aṁśu [^egg_601], that is Prajāpati: his out-breathing is this (graha); and because it is his out-breathing, therefore it is called Upāṁśu.

[^egg_601]: 248:2 Lit. 'the Soma-plant,' hence the (Soma)-sacrifice itself, or Prajāpati. See IV, 6, 1, 1 seq.

3. This (graha) he draws without a strainer [^egg_602]: whereby he puts the out-breathing into him as one tending away from him, and thus this forward-tending out-breathing of his streams forth from him. He purifies it with sprigs of Soma, thinking 'it shall be pure.' He purifies it with six (sprigs), for there are six seasons: it is by means of the seasons that he thus purifies it.

[^egg_602]: 248:3 Bahishpavitrāt, lit. from (a vessel, or Soma) having the strainer outside (away from) it. While no proper strainer is used for the Upāṁśu-graha, the Soma-juice being poured through Soma-plants (see p. 244, note 2); at the great pressing it is passed through a fringed straining-cloth (daśāpavitra) spread over the Droṇakalaśa (the largest of the three Soma-troughs, the others being the Ādhavanīya and Pūtabhr̥t).

5. He throws them down again (on the unpressed plants) with (Vāj. S. VII, 2), 'What inviolable, quickening name is thine, to that Soma of thine, O Soma, be Hail!' Thus his sprigs become purified by means of the Svāhā ('Hail!'). But this graha means everything, for it is the type of all the pressings [^egg_603].

[^egg_603]: 249:1 Viz. inasmuch as the Upāṁśu-graha is obtained by three turns of pressing, and each of the three Savanas (pressings, Soma-feasts) consists of three rounds of pressing of three turns each. See p. 256, note 1.

7. Even at the morning Soma-feast they then completely established the entire sacrifice [^egg_604],--at this same (upāṁśu) graha by means of the Yajus; at the first chant (stotra) by means of the Sāman; and at the first recitation (śastra) by means of the R̥k: with that sacrifice thus completely established they subsequently worshipped. And in like manner does this sacrifice now become completely established,--by means of the Yajus at this same graha; by means of the Sāman at the first chant; and by means of the R̥k at the first recitation; and with this sacrifice thus completely established he subsequently worships.

9. He draws (the juice of the first turn of pressing into the cup) with (Vāj. S.

[^egg_605]: 250:1 Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. I, 4, 2, interprets it, 'Having been purified by the ray of the sun (while growing in the forest), do thou now become pure for the gods through the sprigs of the bull!' Cf., however, Taitt. S.

[^egg_608]: 252:2 With the Taittirīyas the order of proceeding is somewhat different: The Adhvaryu pours the Soma through the Soma-plants into the Upāṁśu cup after each turn of pressing, with, 'Become pure for Vācaspati, O courser!'--'The bull purified by the hand with the plants of the bull!'--'Thou, a god, art a purifier of the gods whose share thou art: thee, to them!' respectively. He then takes the cup from the Pratiprasthātr̥ with, 'Thou art self-made' eyes it with, 'Make our drinks sweet;' and wipes it clean upwards with, 'Thee for all powers, divine and earthly!' He then rises with, 'May the mind obtain thee!' steps to the Āhavanīya with, 'I move  along the wide air,' and offers, while the sacrificer holds on to him from behind, with, 'Hail! thee, O well-born, to Sūrya!'

the Rakshas roams rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man here roams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides [^egg_609]; and, that formula being the Brahman (prayer), a slayer of the Rakshas, he, by means of that Brahman, renders the air free from danger and injury.

22. He (the Adhvaryu) offers with (Vāj. S.

'Hail! thee, O well-born, for Sūrya!' thus he utters the second [^egg_612]

[^egg_610]: 253:2 'For this libation is the out-breathing, and the out-breathing is he that blows yonder (the wind); and he indeed is made by himself, begotten (jāta) of himself, since there is no other maker nor begetter of him.' Kāṇva text.

[^egg_611]: 253:3 Perhaps we ought to translate the passage, 'from all the powers, divine and earthly,' for it is born by itself from all the creatures. But cf. Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5: 'Thereby he puts out-breathing both into gods and men.'

[^egg_612]: 253:4 While, in its force of 'subsequent,' avara here refers back to the first Svāhā, pronounced by the Adhvaryu (par. 19); it also has here the meaning of 'lower,' and, developed out of this, that of 'preceding' (in which meaning it occurs in the R̥kprātiśākhya). Hence it is quite impossible adequately to render this play on the words avara, 'subsequent, lower, preceding,' and para, 'higher, subsequent.'

 (or inferior) 'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent [^egg_613] (or higher; the highest) deity.

24. And, having offered, he wipes the (vessel of the) graha upwards; whereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him. Thereupon he rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards [^egg_615]--whereby he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him--with, 'Thee to the gods sipping motes of light!'

[^egg_615]: 254:3 That is to say, he is to pass his hand, palm upwards, under the middle enclosing stick.

26. For this same graha there is neither an invitatory prayer nor an offering prayer [^egg_616]: he offers it

[^egg_616]: 254:4 Such (R̥k verses) as are ordinarily recited by the Hotr̥: When  the Upāṁśu cup is drawn, the Hotr̥ says, 'Restrain the out-breathing (prāṇa)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to Sūrya!' whereupon he breathes into (or towards) the cup with, 'O out-breathing, restrain my out-breathing!' After that he remains silent till the Antaryāma is drawn, when he addresses that graha with, 'Restrain the in-breathing (apāna)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to Sūrya!' whereupon he draws in his breath over the cup, and says, 'O in-breathing, restrain my in-breathing!' He then touches the pressing-stone with, 'Thee to the through-breathing!' and therewith frees his speech from restraint. Ait. Br. II, 21. On the terms out-breathing (prāṇa) and in-breathing (apāna, or up-breathing, udāna) see part i, p. 19, note 2; J. S. Speijer, Jātakarma, p. 64; Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3 (vol. i, p.603); Taitt. S. VI, 4: 6. Different Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 118.

with a (Yajus) formula, and thereby it becomes for him supplied with both an invitatory and an offering prayer. And if he desire to exorcise, let him offer some spray (of Soma) which may adhere either to his arm, or to his breast, or to his garment, with, 'O divine plant, let that be true wherefore I pray thee: let N.N. be struck down by destruction falling from above, crash!' Even as one of (enemies) that are being slain might escape, so does this (sprig) fly away from those that are being pressed: thus nothing (hostile)--either running thither or running away [^egg_617]--remains to him for whom he performs this. He deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) indeed is his out-breathing.

[^egg_617]: 255:1 'Na dhāvan nāpadhāvat pariśishyate;' perhaps we ought to read 'nāpadhāvan;' unless indeed 'tasya' refers to Soma, as Sāyaṇa seems to take it. The Kāṇva text has: tathā ha teshāṁ nāpadhāvañs cana mucyate yebhyas tathā karoti.

27. Now some deposit it on the south part (of the khara [^egg_618]), for, they say, it is in that direction that

[^egg_618]: 255:2 According to the Sūtras of the Black Yajus (cf. Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. I, 4, 2, p. 598), the Upāṁśu cup is 'deposited' on the south-east and the Antaryāma cup on the north-east corner of the  khara or mound; the Upāṁśu-savana stone being placed between them. Before depositing the vessel, the Adhvaryu pours some of the residue of Soma-juice from the Upāṁśu cup into the Āgrayaṇasthālī, and having put a large twig of Soma into it for the evening pressing (? the Adābhya graha, cf. Sāy. on Taitt. S. I, 603), he deposits it on the mound.

yonder (sun) moves. Let him, however, not do this, but let him deposit it on the north (uttara) part (of the khara), because there is not any higher (uttara) graha than this. He deposits it with, 'Thee for the out-breathing!' for this (graha) is indeed his out-breathing.

28. He then takes the Upāṁśu-savana (pressing-stone). He neither touches it with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth, for that would be like rinsing it in water. If there be any spray adhering to it, let him remove it with his hand, and then lay down (the stone) beside (the Upāṁśu cup), with the face towards the north, with, 'Thee for the through-breathing!' for this (stone) is indeed his (Yajña's) through-breathing.

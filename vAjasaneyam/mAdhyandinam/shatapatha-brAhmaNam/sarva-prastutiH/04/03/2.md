The exact correlation between the stotras and śastras at the three savanas will appear from the following table:--

2. [The Hotr̥] calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with his face towards the east [^egg_775]. For all

[^egg_775]: 326:1 While the Adhvaryu sits before the Sadas, with his back to the Hotr̥ (p. 322, note 1), the latter performs the (tūshṇīm-) japa--i.e. the muttering of the formula 'May Father Mātariśvan grant flawless (verse-) feet! may the bards sing flawless hymns!' &c. Ait. Br. II, 38; Āśv. Śr. V, 9, 1--after which he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (āhāva), 'śõṁsāvõm (let us two recite, Om)!'--which formula is used at all śastras, except that, at the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by 'Adhvaryo' (O Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the verb is repeated, thus 'śośoṁsāvo.'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns round so as to face the Hotr̥, and responds by 'śoṁsāmo daiva (we recite, O divine one)!' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the Āhāva and Pratigara together are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the metre of the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then follows the Hotr̥s Tūshṇīṁ-śaṁsa or 'silent praise;' viz. 'Earth! Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light, Ether! the light is Indra, Om! Sūrya is the light, the light, Heaven! is Sūrya, Om!'--This is followed by a Puroruc, or preliminary invocation of a deity, recited in a loud voice, (and consisting of twelve short formulas resembling the Nivid part i, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5 seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the śastras of the midday and evening libations, being inserted in the middle or before the last verse of the hymn of the śastra; viz. Agni kindled by the gods, Agni kindled by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hotr̥ chosen by the gods, the Hotr̥ chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of sacrifices, the irresistible Hotr̥, the swift carrier of oblations: may he, the god,  bring hither the gods! may Agni, the god, worship the gods! may (Agni), the knower of beings, perform the sacrificial rites!' (Ait. Br. II, 34.) Then follows the hymn, the Ājya-sūkta, the chief part of the śastra, viz. Rig-veda III, 13, 'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with loudest voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best offerer, sit down on our sacred grass!' &c.; the seven (anushṭubh) verses of which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last verses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to eleven. The recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called ukthavīrya ('the strength of the praise'), consisting of the formula ukthaṁ vāci, 'praise hath been sung,' with some words added to it differing at different śastras,--at the present śastra 'ghoshāya tvā,' 'thee (I have recited) for sound (praise)!' [for school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 177],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, 'Om ukthasāḥ,' 'yea, singer of praise!' The Ukthavīrya, together with the response, is again to consist of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective libation. Then follows the recitation, by the Āgnīdhra (Ait. Br. VI, 14), of the yājyā or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As regards the term 'ājya,' the Pañc. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from āji, a race, in accordance with the following legend: When Prajāpati offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree as to which of them should have the first share. Prajāpati then proposed that they should run a race for it. In this race Agni came off first, then Mitravaruna, then Indra. To each of these three divinities an ājya was thereupon assigned; and, by a secret understanding between Indra and Agni, these two divided the fourth ājya between them. Hence the āgneya, maitrāvaruṇa, aindra, and aindrāgna śastra (and stotra), belonging to the Hotr̥, Maitrāvaruṇa, Brāhmaṇāchaṁsin, and Achāvāka priests respectively.

others except the Udgātr̥ perform their priestly duties while facing the east, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed towards the east.

3. Now the Udgātr̥ is Prajāpati, and the Hotr̥, (being) the R̥k (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgātr̥, Prajāpati, implants seed in the female Hotr̥, the R̥k; this the Hotr̥ brings forth by means of the śastra (recitation), he sharpens

it even as this man is sharpened [^egg_776], and because he thereby sharpens (śo) therefore it is called sastra.

[^egg_776]: 328:1 That is, fashions him, or makes him slender. A fanciful derivation of śastra (śaṁs, to recite, praise, cf. carmen), from the root śā (śo), to sharpen (? or from śas, to cut, carve).

For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hotr̥) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.

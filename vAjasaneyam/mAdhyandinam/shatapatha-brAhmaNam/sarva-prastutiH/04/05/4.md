1. Now, at first the gods were all alike, all good. Of them, being all alike, all good, three desired, 'May we be superior [^egg_936]!'--Agni, Indra, and Sūrya.

[^egg_936]: 402:3 Ati-tishṭḥāvānaḥ, lit. 'standing forth over (all others,' see IV, 5, 3, 2). In this, as in the preceding Brāhmaṇa, the prefix ati has to do service repeatedly for etymological and symbolical purposes.

2. They went on praising and toiling. They saw those Atigrāhyas [^egg_937], and drew (grah) them for themselves

[^egg_937]: 402:4 I.e. cups of Soma 'to be drawn over and above' (Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 235; for a different explanation see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 490). These three grahas are required at the Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha, which forms part of the Dvādaśāha (see note  [^egg_935]), and of sacrificial sessions generally. The shaḍaha, or period of six Soma days, which (though itself consisting of two tryaha, or  tridua) may be considered as forming a kind of unit in sattras, or sacrificial sessions, is of two kinds, viz. the Abhiplava shaḍaha and the Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha. Both require (for the Hotr̥'s pr̥shṭḥa-stotra at the midday pressing) the use of the Rathantara-sāman on uneven, and that of the Br̥hat-sāman on even days. The chief difference between them is that while the pr̥shṭḥa-stotras of the Abhiplava are performed in the ordinary (Agnishṭoma) way, the Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha requires their performance in the proper pr̥shṭḥa form, see p. 339, note 2. Besides, while the Abhiplava shaḍaha consists of four Ukthya days, preceded and followed by one Agnishṭoma day; the first day of the Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha is an Agnishṭoma, the fourth a Shoḍaśin, the remaining four days being Ukthyas. There is also a difference between the two in regard to the stomas, or forms of chanting, used; for while the Pr̥shṭḥya requires successively one of the six principal stomas (from the Trivr̥t up to the Trayastriṁśa, as given p. 308, note 2) for each day, the Abhiplava requires the first four stomas (Trivr̥t to Ekaviṁśa) for each day, though in a different order. In this respect, three groups or forms are assumed for the performance of the stotras at the Agnishṭoma and Ukthya, viz. the Jyotishṭoma [a. Bahishpavavamāna in the Trivr̥t; b. Ājyastotras and c. Mādhyandina-pavamāna in the Pañcadaśa; d. the Pr̥shṭḥa-stotras and e. Ārbhava-pavavamāna in the Saptadaśa; and f. the Agnishṭoma sāman in the Ekaviṁśa stoma]; the Goshṭoma [a. Pañcadaśa; b. Trivr̥t; c. Saptadaśa; e. f. (and g. Ukthastotras) Ekaviṁśa]; and Āyushṭoma [a. Trivr̥t; b. Pañcadaśa; c. d. Saptadaśa; e. f. g. Ekaviṁśa]. These forms are distributed over the two tridua of the Abhiplava in the order: Jyotishṭoma, Goshṭoma, Āyushṭoma; Goshṭoma, Āyushṭoma, Gyotishṭoma.

[^egg_935]: 402:2 The Dvādaśāha, or twelve days’ performance, forms the connecting link between the so-called Ahīna sacrifices (consisting of between two and twelve press-days) and the sattras, or sacrificial sessions (of twelve press-days and upwards); since it can be performed as one or the other. As a sattra (which seems to be its usual character) it consists of the Daśarātra, or ten nights’ (or days’) period, preceded and followed by an Atirātra, as the prāyaṇīya (opening) and udayanīya (concluding) days. The Daśarātra, on its part, consists of three tryahas (or tridua), viz. a Pr̥shṭḥya shaḍaha (see note  [^egg_937]), and three Ukthya days, the so-called Chandomas (on which see Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 347). These are followed by an Atyagnishṭoma day, called Avivākya (i.e. on which there should be 'no dispute, or quarrel').

over and above (ati): hence the name Atigrāhyas. They became superior, even as they are now superior [^egg_938] and verily he becomes superior for whomsoever, knowing this, they draw those cups of Soma.

[^egg_938]: 403:1 Lit. even as they are now the superiority, i.e. a superior power.

1. He proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation. The reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that former occasion [^egg_897], the gods said to her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the Soma-sacrifice).

2. And because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i) to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called Prāyaṇīya. And because he now offers after coming out (ud-ā-i) from the expiatory bath, therefore this (concluding oblation) is called Udayaṇīya [^egg_898]. For this indeed is one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the opening, to Aditi the concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).

3. To Pathyā Svasti he offers first (at the opening sacrifice): then the gods, through speech, saw their way in what was unknown to them, for by speech the confused becomes known. But now that it is known, he performs in the proper order.

5. Thereupon he slaughters a barren anūbandhyā [^egg_899] cow for Mitra and Varuṇa. And this indeed is performed as a different sacrifice, and that an animal offering; for the Samishṭayajus form the end of the sacrifice.

[^egg_899]: 387:1 The meaning of this technical term would seem to be 'to be bound (or immolated) after' the sacrifice.

7. Then they say, 'What has become of the sacrificer?'--whatever well-offered part of his (sacrifice) Mitra here takes, that he now again surrenders to him, being pleased with this (cow); and whatever ill-offered part of his Varuṇa takes, that indeed he makes well-offered for him, being pleased with this (cow), and surrenders it again to him.

8. And again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varuṇa. Now, when the gods caused the cast seed to spring,--there is that śastra called Āgnimāruta [^egg_902]: in connection therewith it is explained how

[^egg_902]: 387:4 The same passage occurs at I, 7, 4, 4, where I erroneously supplied 'samabhavat.' It is a broken, incoherent construction. The explanation, referred to in these two passages, may be Ait. Br. III, 34, though in that case one might have expected a somewhat closer adherence to the order of production there proposed;  see part i, p. 210, note 1. Regarding the Āgnimāruta śastra, see above, p. 369 note .

the gods caused that seed to spring. From it the coals (aṅgāra) sprung, and from the coals the Aṅgiras; and after that the other animals [^egg_903].

[^egg_903]: 388:1 ? Or, the others, the animals (tad any anye paśavaḥ). Cp. the French idiom, 'Les femmes et nous autres hommes.' The Kāṇva text reads, tad anu paśavaḥ.

9. Then the dust of the ashes which remained: therefrom the ass was produced,--hence when it is dusty anywhere, people say, 'A very place for asses, forsooth [^egg_904]!' And when no sap whatever remained,--thence was produced that barren cow belonging to Mitra and Varuṇa; wherefore that (cow) does not bring forth, for from sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And because she was produced at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the sacrifice. Hence also a barren cow for Mitra and Varuṇa is the most proper here: if he cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock [^egg_905].

[^egg_904]: 388:2 The Kāṇva reads, And when they (the coals) became dust of ashes, the ass was produced therefrom: hence they call 'asses’ place' where the dust of the ashes (lies).

[^egg_905]: 388:3 Kāty. X, 9,15 allows, in lieu of the animal offering, an oblation of clotted curds (payasyā or āmikshā). See also II, 4, 2, 1 4.

V, 38), 'Stride thou widely, O Vishṇu, make wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards, Hail!' For Vishṇu is the sacrifice: he thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him. And let him on this occasion give as much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be without a Dakshiṇā.

1. They lay hands on the barren cow [^egg_911], and having laid hands on it, they quiet it. It having been quieted [^egg_912], he says (to the slaughterer), 'Pull out the omentum!' The omentum having been pulled out [^egg_912], let him tell (the slaughterer) to search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why need they care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.

[^egg_911]: 391:1 The order of this and the succeeding Brāhmaṇas differs considerably in the two recensions. In the Kāṇva recension the present Brāhmaṇa (the text of which also differs very much) is preceded by three others (V, 6, 1-3), corresponding to M. IV, 5, 3; IV, 5, 4 and IV, 5, 6, respectively.

[^egg_913]: 391:3 The meaning of this would seem to be, that they should not content themselves with the supposition of its being a barren cow, but that they should ascertain whether she is not--as the term is--'ashṭāpadī,' or eight-footed, i.e. a cow with calf (cf. par. 12), and should in that case make atonement. The Kāṇva text reads, Now when they thus proceed with that (animal offering), they, thinking it to be one (cow) only, pronounce the āprī verses (āprīṇanti). They turn out to be two (te dve bhavataḥ); and surely it is not right that one should cast away that on which the āprī verses have been pronounced. Now that juice has flowed together from all the limbs: thus offering is also made with those sacrificial portions of that (embryo). And the sacrifice is as much as the havis and Svishṭakr̥t: he thus connects that whole (embryo) with that sacrifice,  and thus that which is superfluous (atirikta) becomes not superfluous.

The Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!' otherwise he would not pull it out from the womb, since it is only pulled out from the womb of a sick or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown, then indeed it comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after tearing asunder the thighs.

Having cut it below the neck, they should let that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice drips from all its limbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its limbs.

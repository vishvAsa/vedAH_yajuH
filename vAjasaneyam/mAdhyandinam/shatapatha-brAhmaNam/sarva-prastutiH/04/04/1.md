1. Savitr̥, forsooth, is his [^egg_833] mind: therefore he draws the Sāvitra cup. And, forsooth, Savitr̥ is his breath (vital air);--when he draws the Upāṁśu cup, then he puts into him that vital air in front; and when he draws the Sāvitra cup, then he puts into him that vital air behind: thus those two vital airs on both sides are beneficial (or, put into him), both that which is above and that which is below.

[^egg_833]: 357:1 Viz. that of Yajña, the sacrificial man, representing the sacrificer himself, with a view to the preparation of a new body in a future existence.

2. And the sacrifice, forsooth, is the seasons, the year. There, at the morning feast, they are overtly attended to, in that he draws the cups for the seasons; and at the midday feast they are covertly attended to, in that he takes the Marutvatīya libations by means of the two Ritu vessels [^egg_834]. Now here (at the evening feast) they neither draw any libation expressly for the seasons, nor is any libation taken with the two Ritu vessels.

4. He draws it with the Upāṁśu vessel. For Savitr̥ is his mind, and the Upāṁśu is his breath: therefore he draws it with the Upāṁśu vessel; or with the Antaryāma vessel, for that is one and the same, since the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma are the out-breathing and in-breathing [^egg_835].

7. Having drawn it, he does not deposit it; for Savitr̥ is his (Yajña's) mind, and hence this mind is restless. And Savitr̥ is his breath: hence this breath passes to and fro unrestingly. He then says (to the Maitrāvaruṇa), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the god Savitr̥!' Having called for the

 Śraushaṭ, he says, 'Prompt (the Hotr̥ to recite the offering prayer) to the god Savitr̥!' The Vashaṭ having been pronounced, he offers. He (the Hotr̥) pronounces no Anuvashaṭ [^egg_836],--for Savitr̥ is his mind,--'lest he should consign his mind to the fire;' and Savitr̥ being his breath,--'lest he should consign his breath to the fire.'

8. Then with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom [^egg_837], he draws the Vaiśvadeva graha. The reason why he draws the Vaiśvadeva graha with the (same) vessel, without drinking therefrom, is this: on the Sāvitra graha he (the Hotr̥) pronounces no Anuvashaṭ, and it is therefrom that he is about to draw the Vaiśvadeva graha,--thus it is by means of the Vaiśvadeva that it becomes supplied with the Anuvashaṭ for him.

[^egg_837]: 359:2 Lit. 'with the not-drunk-from vessel.' He is not to drink with the Hotr̥ the remains of the Sāvitra graha, which is to be offered up entirely (holocaust).

9. And further why he draws the Vaiśvadeva graha. Savitr̥, forsooth, is his rind, and the Viśve Devāḥ (All-gods, or all the gods [^egg_838]) are everything here: he thus makes everything here subservient and obedient to the mind, and hence everything here is subservient and obedient to the mind.

[^egg_838]: 359:3 In Ait. Br. III, 31 five classes of beings, viz. the gods and men, the Gandharva-Apsaras, the serpents and the manes, are included in the term Viśve Devāḥ.

10. And again why he draws the Vaiśvadeva graha. Savitr̥, forsooth, is his breath, and the All-gods are everything here: he thereby puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into everything here, and

11. And again why he draws the Vaiśvadeva graha. The evening feast belongs to the All-gods: thus indeed it is called on the part of the Sāman, in that the evening feast is called Vaiśvadeva on the part of the R̥c [^egg_839], and in the same way on the part of the Yajus, by way of preparatory rite, when he draws that Mahā-vaiśvadeva graha.

[^egg_839]: 360:1 The first śastra of the Tr̥tīya-savana, now about to be recited by the Hotr̥ (Rig-veda priest), is the Vaiśvadeva śastra; hence also, he argues, it is Vaiśvadeva on the part of the Sāman, because of the intimate connection of the Sāman chants (here the Tr̥tīya, or Ārbhava, pavamāna stotra; see p. 325, note 2) with the śastras.

Therewith he

deposits it; for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. Thereupon he goes (to the Sadas) and sits down (in front of the Hotr̥) with his face to the east [^egg_841].

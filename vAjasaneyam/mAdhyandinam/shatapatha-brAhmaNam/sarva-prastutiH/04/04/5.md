1. He now betakes himself to the expiatory bath (avabhr̥tha). The reason why he betakes himself to the expiatory bath is this. What vital sap there has been in him (Soma and the sacrificer), that (sap) of his he (the priest) has produced (extracted) for the offerings. Now that body (of Soma, i.e.

the Soma-husks),--there is no sap in it; (yet) it is not to be cast away: they take it down to the water and--water being sap--he puts that sap into it. Thus he unites him with that sap, and thus he produces him from it,--he (Soma), even when produced, produces him (the sacrificer) [^egg_878]: and because they take it down (ava-hr̥ [^egg_879]) to the water, therefore (the bath is called) avabhr̥tha.

[^egg_878]: 379:1 ? That is, as the Soma plants become juicy again, so the sacrificer has his vital sap or spirit restored.

[^egg_879]: 379:2 Or, according to the St. Petersburg Dictionary, 'they throw it into the water.'

2. In the first place he performs the Samishṭayajus offerings, for the Samishṭayajus are the extreme end of the sacrifice. As soon as he has performed the Samishṭayajus, they go together to the cātvāla (pit) with whatever he (the sacrificer) has about him [^egg_880]: both the black-deer's horn [^egg_881] and the girdle he throws into the pit,--

[^egg_880]: 379:3 Or, whatever is connected with Soma (?). According to Kāty. X, 8, 12, 19 the throne (āsandī) and Audumbarī, as well as the Soma vessels, Droṇakalaśa, &c., are to be carried in the first place to the cātvāla, and from there to the water.

3. With (Vāj. S. VIII, 23), 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!' Now when they take the Soma-husks down to the water, that forsooth is the wishing of 'good-speed [^egg_882]!' to it, and this now is the 'good-speed!' to him (the sacrificer); for snakes are like rope, and snakes' haunts are like wells (pits), and there is as it were a feud between men and snakes: 'Lest that should spring therefrom,' he thinks, and therefore he says, 'Be thou nor adder nor viper!'

21. Thereupon, letting it go, he stands by it with (Vāj. S. VIII, 26), 'Ye divine waters, this is your child,'--for he (Soma) indeed is the child of the waters,--'bear ye him, well-beloved, well-nourished!' he thereby makes him over to the waters for protection--'This, O divine Soma, is thine abode: thrive thou well therein, and thrive thou [^egg_893] thoroughly!' whereby he means to say, 'Be thou therein for our happiness, and shield us from all inflictions!'

[^egg_893]: 384:2 'Vakshva' is by Mahīdhara (and apparently by the author of the Brāhmaṇa) referred to 'vah;' by the St. Petersburg Dictionary to 'vas' for 'vatsva.' I have referred it to 'vaksh.' The Kāṇva text reads, Pari ca vakshi śaṁ ca vakshīti pari ca no gopāya śaṁ ca na edhīty evaitad āha.

22. He then immerses it with (Vāj. S. VIII, 27), 'O laving bath, laving thou glidest along: with the help of the gods may I wipe out the sin committed against the gods; and with the help of the mortals that committed against mortals!'--for the sin committed against the gods he has indeed wiped out with the help of the gods, namely, with the help of king Soma; and the sin committed against mortals he has wiped out with the help of mortals, namely, by means of the animal victim and the sacrificial cake--'Preserve me, O god, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to say, 'Preserve me from all inflictions!'

23. Thereupon both (the sacrificer and his wife) having descended, bathe, and wash each other's back. Having wrapped themselves in fresh garments [^egg_894] they step out: even as a snake casts its skin, so does he cast away all his sin,--there is not in him even as much sin as there is in a toothless child. By the same way by which they came out (from the sacrificial ground), they return thither [^egg_895]; and, having returned, he puts a kindling-stick on the Āhavanīya (at the front hall-door) with, 'Thou art the kindler of the gods!' He thereby kindles the sacrificer himself,

[^egg_894]: 385:1 According to the Mānava Sūtra, as quoted on Kāty. X, 9, 6, the sacrificer wraps himself in the cloth in which the Soma stalks were tied (somopanahana), and his wife in the outer cloth tied round the Soma bundle (paryāṇahana). The Soma vessels and implements are likewise thrown into the water.

[^egg_895]: 385:2 While going thither they all mutter the Āmahīyā verse, Rig-veda VIII, 48, 3, 'We have drunk Soma, we have become immortal, we have gone to the light, we have attained to the gods: what now can the enemy do unto us, what the guile, O immortal, of the mortal?'

for along with the kindling of the gods the sacrificer is kindled [^egg_896].

[^egg_896]: 386:1 The sacrificer sits down behind the śālādvārya fire and spreads the black deer-skin over his knees; the Adhvaryu then making an oblation of ghee from the dipping-spoon.

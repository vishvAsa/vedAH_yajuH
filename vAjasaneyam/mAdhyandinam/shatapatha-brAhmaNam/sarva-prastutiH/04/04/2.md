1. He proceeds with (the offering of) Soma's rice-pap; for Soma is the sacrificial food of the gods; and here now sacrificial food is prepared for Soma on his part; and thus Soma is not excluded therefrom. It is a rice-pap (caru), for rice-pap is food for the gods, since rice-pap is boiled rice, and boiled rice is clearly food: therefore it is a rice-pap.

2. Neither at the morning feast, nor at the midday feast does he offer it, for those two press-feasts, the morning feast and the midday feast, are the exclusive feasts of the gods; and Soma is sacred to the Fathers [^egg_845].

[^egg_845]: 363:1 Probably, because Soma is slain in being sacrificed (see IV, 3, 4, 1), and therefore belongs to the Fathers or Departed Spirits.

3. But were he to offer it at the morning feast, or at the midday feast, he would cause discord between the gods and Fathers. He offers it at the evening feast, because the evening feast belongs to the All-gods [^egg_846]: thus he does not cause discord. He recites no invitatory prayer (but only an offering prayer), for the Fathers have passed away once for all: hence he recites no invitatory prayer.

6. He then takes ghee a second time by four ladlings, and having called for the Śraushaṭ, he says, 'Recite the offering prayer of the ghee!' and offers as the Vashaṭ is uttered. From whatever oblations he intends to offer hereafter, he thereby separates this one (to Soma), and thus he causes no discord. If he chooses, he may offer (ghee) on both sides (before and after the Soma's rice-pap); or, if he chooses, he may offer on one side only [^egg_847].

[^egg_847]: 364:1 The homa of ghee, made-before the rice-pap oblation to Soma, belongs to Agni, and the one made after the oblation, to Vishṇu. If only one homa be made, it belongs to Agni and Vishṇu. The Kāṇva text reads, 'Tad vā āhur anyatarata eva pariyajet purastād eveti,' now they say, 'He should offer on one side only, and that in front (previously to the caru).' For the offering formulas, see Āśv. V, 19, 3; Ait. Br. III, 32. After the completion of these offerings, the Adhvaryu pours ordinary ghee on the rice-pap and presents it to the Hotr̥, who looks at it while pronouncing some formulas (Āśv. V, 19, 4, 5), and he smears his eyes with the ghee on the pap, after which the latter is handed to the chanters (udgātr̥) to be eaten by them.

7. Now there is an offering-spoon called 'pracaraṇī.' Therein the Adhvaryu takes ghee by four ladlings (with the dipping-spoon) and pours it on the Dhishṇya hearths by means of fagots (held over them). The reason why he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots is this. Because, on a former occasion [^egg_848], the gods said to those (Gandharva

[^egg_848]: 364:2 See III, 6, 2, 19.

 Soma-wardens), 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering,' that same offering of ghee now falls to their share at the evening pressing, but not one of Soma, in that he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots. One after another, in the order in which they were thrown up, and with the same formulas [^egg_849], he pours ghee upon them; on the Mārjālīya last of all.

[^egg_849]: 365:1 Viz., Vāj. S. V, 31, 32. The Āgnīdhra hearth is prepared first, and the Mārjālīya last of the eight dhishṇyas. See p. 148, note 4.

9. Now, while the Adhvaryu pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots, the Pratiprasthātr̥ draws the Pātnīvata [^egg_851] cup. For from the sacrifice creatures are produced; and being produced from the sacrifice, they are produced from union; and being produced from union, they are produced from the hind part of the sacrifice;--hence he thereby produces them from a productive union, from the hind part of the sacrifice: therefore he draws the Pātnīvata cup.

[^egg_851]: 365:3 The meaning of the term pātnīvata is 'relating to the patnīvant (i.e. wived or mated one),' the 'patnīvant' being probably Soma with the water mixed with it; or Agni with the wives of the gods, (with special reference to the sacrificer's wife); cf. Taitt. S. VI, 5, 8, I, 2. According to the Kāṇva text, Agni associated with the goddess Speech (Vāc patnī) seems to be understood.

The Unnetr̥ puts down the camasa cups behind the high altar, and pours into them the entire Soma-juice remaining in the Pūtabhr̥t, putting but little into the Hotr̥'s cup, to leave room in it for the dhruva libation. Besides this the Āgrayaṇa is the only Soma that remains. The Adhvaryu then, by touching the Soma in the Hotr̥'s cup with two stalks of grass, gives the signal for the chanting of the Agnishṭoma Sāman (viz. the Yajñāyajñīya, Sāmav. II, 53, 54), wrapping up his head, if he chooses, in the same way as the Udgātr̥s. Meanwhile the Neshṭr̥ leads up the lady through the back door into the Sadas, makes her sit down north of the Udgātr̥ and exchange looks with the latter three times (at the 'Hiṁ,' see p. 308, note 2). Three times also (at every Nidhana) she uncovers her right leg and pours on it some of the pānnejanī water fetched by her in the morning (see III, 9, 3, 27),  whereupon she returns to her own tent. Then follows the recitation of the Āgnimāruta śastra, consisting of the following parts:--At the Ukthya (and other Soma-sacrifices) the Ukthya graha is drawn immediately after the drawing of the Āgrayaṇa (see , with note). Previous to the after-offerings the Ukthya graha is divided, as at the morning and midday performances (see p. 293, note 2), between the three Hotrakas, with a view to the recitation of their śastras which form the distinctive feature of the Ukthya sacrifice, bringing up the number of śastras (and stotras) from twelve (of the Agnishṭoma) to fifteen. Besides, the Ukthya requires the immolation of at least two victims on the Soma-day, viz. a he-goat to Indra and Agni, besides the one to Agni.

1. Having brought water forward [^egg_43], he takes out (the material for) a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishṇu; for Agni is all the deities, since it is in Agni that offering is made to all the deities. Moreover Agni is the lower half, and Vishṇu is the upper half of the sacrifice: 'I will become consecrated after encompassing all the deities, after encompassing the entire sacrifice,' thus he thinks, and hence there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vishṇu.

[^egg_43]: 12:1 Viz. the so-called 'praṇītāḥ,' see part i, p. 9 note. The offering, described in the following paragraphs, is called the Dīkshaṇī-yeshṭi, 'Consecration offering.' As to the formulas used at the offering, see Ait. Br. I, 4 seq.

3. Now Aditi had eight sons. But those that are called 'the gods, sons of Aditi,' were only seven, for the eighth, Mārtāṇḍa, she brought forth unformed [^egg_45]: it was a mere lump of bodily matter [^egg_46], as broad as it was high. Some, however, say that he was of the size of a man.

[^egg_45]: 12:3 Or, the eighth she brought forth undeveloped, as a mārtāṇḍa (? either a bird, or, more probably, in accordance with Taitt. S. VI, 5, 6, 1, = vyr̥ddham āṇḍam, 'an abortive egg'). See Rig-veda Sanhitā, translated by M. M., p. 239.

4. The gods, sons of Aditi, then spake, 'That

which was born after us [^egg_47] must not be lost: come, let us fashion it.' They accordingly fashioned it as this man is fashioned. The flesh which was cut off him, and thrown down in a lump, became the elephant: hence they say that one must not accept an elephant (as a gift) [^egg_48], since the elephant has sprung from man. Now he whom they thus fashioned was Vivasvat, the Āditya (or the sun); and of him (came) these creatures.

[^egg_47]: 13:1 Or, perhaps, after the manner of us (anu).

[^egg_48]: 13:2 Muir, O. S. T. IV, 15, reads 'parigr̥hṇīyāt' instead of 'pratigr̥hṇīyāt,' and translates, 'let no one catch an elephant, for an elephant partakes of the nature of man.'

For the sake of completeness they perform the patnīsaṁyājas [^egg_50]; but he offers no samishṭayajus, lest, having put on that garment of the consecrated, he should reach the end of the sacrifice before its completion; for the samishṭayajus is the end of the sacrifice.

[^egg_55]: 15:3 Professor Delbrück, S. F. III, 27, takes it thus, 'He brushes the eye with the end of a reed, for the reed is a thunderbolt capable of repelling mischief.' But, if 'virakshastāyai' belonged to what precedes, it would probably have to be construed with 'śareshikayā ’nakti,' the clause with 'vai,' giving the reason, being inserted parenthetically; while, in an idiomatic rendering, it would have to be placed at the end: He anoints the eyes with a reed-stalk in order to chase away the evil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. This abstract dative of purpose is very common; it being generally construed with what precedes, as, for instance, I, 1, 4, 1; 3, 2, 8; 5, 3, 8; 15; III, 1, 2, 13; 19; ; and, with a parenthetic clause with 'vai' intervening, III, 2, 1, 13; IV, 5, 7, 7. Not less common is the analogous construction with a clause with 'ned'  ('lest such an event should happen') instead of the dative of the abstract, cf. I, 2, 1, 8; 9; IV, 5, 9, 3.

indeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air; even as man here roams along the air [^egg_56], rootless and unfettered on both sides: the reason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away the evil spirits.

[^egg_60]: 17:3 The Kāṇva text adds, sa hi cittānām īshṭe, 'for he rules over the thoughts.'

[^egg_61]: 17:4 The Kāṇvas read, ayaṁ vāva vākpatir yo ’yam pavate, tad enam esha punāti, 'the lord of speech doubtless is that blower (purifier, the wind): hence it is he that purifies him.'

 Savitr̥ has purified [^egg_62]; therefore he says, 'May the divine Savitr̥ purify me!'--'with a flawless cleanser;' for that blower (the wind) is indeed a flawless cleanser: 'with that one,' he means to say; 'with the rays of the sun;' for they, the rays of the sun, are indeed purifiers; therefore he says, 'with the rays of the sun.'

24. He then makes him pronounce the beginning of the benedictions (Vāj. S. IV, 5), 'We approach you, O gods, for desirable goods, at the opening of the sacrifice; we call on you, O gods, for holy [^egg_63] blessings.' Thereby the officiating priests invoke on him those blessings which are their own.

[^egg_63]: 18:2 I take yajñiyāsaḥ as acc. pl. fem., as does Mahīdh. Perhaps it ought to be translated 'for prayers proper at the sacrifice,' whereby he makes sure that each priest uses his own proper prayers during the sacrifice.

25. He (the sacrificer) then bends his fingers inwards, viz. the two (little fingers), with the text (Vāj. S.

Now when he says, 'Hail, from the mind (I take hold of) the sacrifice,' he takes hold of it from the mind;--in saying, 'From the wide ether,' he takes hold of it from the ether;--in saying, 'From heaven and earth,' he takes hold of it from those two, heaven and earth, on which this entire universe rests;--and in saying, 'From the wind I take hold of (the sacrifice)'--the wind being the sacrifice--he takes hold of the sacrifice directly.

[^egg_65]: 19:1 That is, 'svāhā' in each formula. The Saṁhitā has twice 'svāhā' in the last formula (svāhā vātād ārabhe svāhā), to which this might refer, but neither recension of the Brāhmaṇa mentions the final 'svāhā.'

[^egg_66]: 19:2 Literally, 'he takes within him' (as the speech confined within him through silence).

28. He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. He walks along the back of the Āhavanīya and the front of the Gārhapatya [^egg_67],--this is his passage until the Soma pressing. The reason why this is his passage until the Soma pressing is this. The fire is the womb of the sacrifice, and the consecrated is an embryo; and the embryo moves about

[^egg_67]: 19:3 That is, he enters the hall by the front (east) door, then walks along the north side of the Āhavanīya and altar, and passes between the Gārhapatya and altar to his seat south of the Āhavanīya. The Pratiprasthātr̥ then silently anoints and purifies the Dīkshita's wife and leads her into the hall, either by the front or back door.

within the womb. And since he (the sacrificer) moves about there (between the fires), and now turns round and now back, therefore these embryos move about, and now turn round and now back. Hence this is his passage till the Soma pressing.

2. Thereupon they enclose a place [^egg_30] north of the hall, and place a vessel of water in it. Beside this the barber takes up his position. He (the sacrificer) then shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails. For impure, indeed, is that part of man where water does not reach him. Now at the hair and beard, and at the nails the water does not reach him: hence when he shaves his hair and beard, and cuts his nails, he does so in order that he may be consecrated after becoming pure.

[^egg_30]: 6:1 It is to be square and covered in on all sides with mats, and with a door on the east side. Kāty. VII, I, 25 scholl.

3. Now some shave themselves all over, in order that they may be consecrated after becoming pure all over; but let him not do this.

6. His right whisker he moistens first, with the text, 'May these divine waters be propitious

unto me! The reason why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me,' is this: the waters are a thunderbolt, for the waters are indeed a thunderbolt; hence wherever these waters flow they produce a hollow, and whatever they come near that they destroy (lit. burn up). Hereby, then, he appeases that same thunderbolt; and thus appeased, that thunderbolt does not injure him. This is why he says, 'May these divine waters be propitious unto me!'

[^egg_31]: 7:1 The text has, when he shaves (vapati) the hair and beard [when he shaves himself (vapate), K.] he bathes.' According to this it would seem that he does not bathe unless he shaves (?). See, however, Kāty. VII, 2, 22, where the shaving is said to be optional, but not so, according to the commentary, the bathing. There seems also to be some doubt as to where the bathing is to take place. While, according to Karka, the sacrificer is to bathe in the vessel of water in the tent; according to other authorities he is to  do so in some tank, or other kind of bathing-place of standing water. Cf. Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, tīrthe snāti; tīrtham eva samānānām bhavati.

10. He bathes. For impure, indeed, is man: he is foul [^egg_32] within, in that he speaks untruth;--and water is pure: he thinks, 'May I be consecrated, after becoming pure;'--and water is cleansing: he thinks, 'May I become consecrated after being cleansed!' This is the reason why he bathes.

[^egg_32]: 8:1 I now take pūti (with Dr. Lindner) in the sense of 'foul, filthy, fetid,' and would correct the passage (I, 1, 1, 1) accordingly. Professor Ludwig (Göttinger Gel. Anz. 1883, p. 49) proposes to take pūti in the sense of 'pure,' both here and in I, 1, 1, 1.

11. He bathes, with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 2; Rig-veda X, 17, 10), 'May the waters, the mothers, cleanse us!' whereby he says, 'May they cleanse [^egg_33]!' 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with (heavenly) ghee!' For he, indeed, is thoroughly purified whom they have purified with ghee [^egg_34]: accordingly he says, 'May the purifiers of ghee purify us with ghee!'--'For they, the divine, take away all taint;' now 'all' means 'every,' and 'taint' means what is impure; for they do take away from him every impurity: therefore he says, 'For they, the divine, take away all taint.'

[^egg_33]: 8:2 The Kāṇva recension has the better reading, 'For they, indeed, now cleanse him when he bathes.' According to Taitt. S. VI, 1, 1, 3, he also sips (aśnāti) some water with the view of internal purification.

[^egg_34]: 8:3 Lit. 'for that indeed is well purified, whom they purified (i.e. when they purify anybody) with ghee.' The imperfect is rather strange. See also III, 1, 3, 22. The Kāṇvas read, 'For that, indeed, is well purified what is purified (yad pūyate) with ghee.'

21. He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall. Let him not eat (the flesh) of either the cow or the ox; for the cow and the ox doubtless support everything here on earth. The gods spake, 'Verily, the cow and the ox support everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belongs to other species [^egg_41]!' Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore the cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a cow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a going on to the end (or, to destruction). Such a one indeed would be likely to be born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report, such as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,' 'he has committed a sin [^egg_42];' let him therefore not eat (the flesh) of the cow and the ox. Nevertheless Yājñavalkya said, 'I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.'

[^egg_41]: 11:1 Vayasām, cf. III, 3, 3, 3. The Kāṇva rec. has 'yad anyeshāṁ vayasāṁ vīryaṁ yad anyeshām paśūnām.'

III, p. 25); but the Kāṇva text (sā taṁ heśvaro ’dbhutam abhijanitor jāyāyā vā garbhaṁ niravadhīd yad yeti tad u hovāca) shows that we have here, as frequently, to supply īśvaraḥ to the infinitive in tos. The Kāṇva yad vā ('or some such thing') would also seem to indicate that we ought to translate:--(as of one of whom) there is evil report: 'he has committed some such (iti) sin as the producing of abortion.'

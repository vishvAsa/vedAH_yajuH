2. By means of the sacrifice the gods gained that supreme authority which they now wield. They spake, 'How can this (world) of ours be made unattainable to men?' They sipped the sap of the sacrifice, even as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and scattered it by means of the sacrificial post, they disappeared: and because they scattered (yopaya, viz. the sacrifice) therewith, therefore it is called yūpa (post) [^egg_100].

[^egg_100]: 36:1 Professor Whitney (American Journal of Philology, III, p. 402) proposes to take yopaya here in the sense of 'to set up an obstacle, to block or bar the way.' He remarks, 'How the setting up of a post should operate to "efface traces" cannot easily be made to appear.' I am not aware that any one has supposed that it was by the 'setting up' of the post that the traces of the sacrifice were obliterated. From what follows--'They collected the sacrifice '--it seems to me pretty clear that our author at any rate connects 'yopaya' with the root yu, to mix, stir about, and hence to efface the traces by mixing with the ground, or by scattering about. This causative was evidently no longer a living form, but resorted to for etymological purposes.

3. Now this was heard by the R̥shis. They collected the sacrifice. As that sacrifice was collected (prepared) [^egg_101], so does he who is consecrated collect the sacrifice (by keeping his speech within him),--for the sacrifice is speech.

[^egg_101]: 36:2 Or, perhaps, They collected the sacrifice in the same way as this (present) sacrifice has been collected. See, however, the corresponding passage III, 2, 2, 29; 4, 3, 16. The Kāṇva text is clearer: Taṁ yathā yatharshayo yajñaṁ samabharaṁs tathāyaṁ yajñaḥ sambhr̥to yatho vai tad r̥shayo yajñam samabharann evam u vā esha etad yajñaṁ sambharati yo dīkshate.

7. Let him rather break silence with this one (Vāj. S. IV, 11), 'Prepare ye the fast-food! prepare ye the fast-food! [prepare ye the fast-food!] Agni is the Brahman, Agni is the sacrifice; the tree is meet for the sacrifice.' For this indeed is his sacrifice, this is his havis-offering at this (rite of consecration), even as the Agnihotra was heretofore [^egg_103]. In thus preparing the (Soma) sacrifice by means of the sacrifice, he establishes the sacrifice

[^egg_103]: 37:2 That is to say, the eating of the fast-food, consisting chiefly of milk, takes, as it were, the place of the Agnihotra, or evening and morning sacrifice, which he is not allowed to perform during the time of his consecration.

in the sacrifice, and carries on the sacrifice by means of the sacrifice; for (the partaking of) that fast-food is indeed carried on by him till the pressing of the Soma. Thrice he pronounces (the first words [^egg_104]), for threefold is the sacrifice.

8. Moreover, he breaks silence, after turning round towards the fire. He, on the other hand, who breaks silence with any other (formula) but this [^egg_105], does not strengthen the sacrifice, does not heal the sacrifice. In pronouncing the first (part of the formula) [^egg_106] he utters the truth of speech [^egg_107].

[^egg_105]: 38:2 Thus Sāy. 'ato ’nyena, bhūr bhuvaḥ suvar ityanena' (MS. I. O. 657). Dr. Lindner makes ataḥ refer to Agni. The Kāṇva text begins the passage, corresponding to paragraphs 7 and 8: 'So ’gnim īkshamāṇo visr̥jate vrataṁ kriṇuta (thrice) etad vā etasya havir esha yajño yad vratam.'

14. Now, some add both rice and barley to the first (day's) fast-milk, arguing,--"By means of these two substances (rasa) we restore what part of the sacrifice was sucked out and drained; and, should

the vrata-cow yield no milk, he may prepare his fast-food of whichever of these (cereals) he pleases; and thus both the rice and the barley are 'taken hold of' by him." But let him not do this; for he who adds both rice and barley (to the milk) neither replenishes the sacrifice nor heals it. Let him therefore add only the one or the other (cereal). Both the rice and barley doubtless form his (havis) material for offering (at the New and Full-moon Sacrifice), and when they do so become his material for offering, then they are also 'taken hold of [^egg_111]' by him. Should the vrata, cow yield no milk, let him prepare the fast-food of whichever of them he pleases.

[^egg_111]: 40:1 Anvārabdha has here the usual sacrificial meaning of 'taken hold of (from behind),' with perhaps something of that of 'taken (as medicine = einnehmen).' Thus at the invocation of the Iḍā, the sacrificer has to touch (anv-ārabh) the iḍā from behind, thereby keeping up his connection, and identifying himself, with the sacrifice. Cf. part i, p. 228, note 1; and III, 2, 4, 15. Hence the author, making use of the term suggested by those he criticises, argues that as both kinds of material have already been used and therefore touched (anvārabdha) by him at the New and Full-moon Sacrifice (Sāyaṇa), they have therefore been taken possession of by him. It is possible, though scarcely likely, that the verb may have reference here to the anvārambhaṇīyā ishṭi,--or preliminary ceremony of the first performance of the New and Full-moon Sacrifice,--with which the present use of these cereals would, in that case, be identified, as that of the vrata-milk was with the Agnihotra (cf. paragraph 7 above). The Kāṇva text has the verb ā-rabh instead, yathā havishārabdhena bhishajyed ity evam etat.

19. Having drank the fast-food, he touches his navel [^egg_118], with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 12), 'Ye waters that have been drank, may ye become palatable and auspicious within us! may they prove agreeable to us, freeing us from disease and weakness and sin,--they the divine, the immortal, the holy!' Now, he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities; but the sacrificial food of the gods is not increased (with other material): hence, if in handing the fast-food (to the consecrated) he increases it (with other milk), he commits a fault and breaks the fast. This (formula), however, is the atonement for that (transgression), and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break the fast (or  vow): therefore he says, 'Ye waters . . . !' Whenever, after drinking the fast-food, he touches his navel, let him touch it with this (formula); for who

knows whether (or not) he who hands the fast-food (to the consecrated) increases it (with other milk) [^egg_119]!

[^egg_119]: 43:1 No other fresh milk is to be added to that obtained by one milking of the vratadughā (fast-milk) cow (Kāty. VII, 4, 29); but the preceding formula is to be muttered in order to obviate any evil consequences arising from a possible secret breach of this rule, on the part of him who hands the milk to the sacrificer. Dr. Lindner takes upotsic in the sense of 'to spill,' but I find no authority for this rendering, which neither the prep. upa, nor abhi (in the equivalent abhyutsic) would seem to admit of.

20. When he intends to pass urine, he takes up a clod of earth or some other object by means of the deer's horn, with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 13), 'This (O Earth) is thy covering meet for worship.' For this earth truly is divine, and serves as a place for the worship of the gods: it must not be defiled by him who is consecrated. Having lifted up this its sacrificially pure covering [^egg_120], he now relieves himself on its impure body, with the formula, 'I discharge not offspring, but waters,'--for so indeed he does [^egg_121]; 'delivering from trouble, and consecrated by Svāhā,'--for they do indeed deliver from trouble what is pressed together inside: therefore he says, 'delivering from trouble,'--'consecrated by Svāhā, enter ye the earth!' whereby he means to say, 'Having become offerings, do ye enter the earth, appeased!'

For he who is consecrated draws nigh to the gods and becomes one of the deities; but the gods do not sleep, while to him sleeplessness is not vouchsafed; and Agni being Lord of vows to the gods, it is to him that he now commits himself and lies down to sleep, with the text (Vāj.

24. For, when he who is consecrated utters anything

that is foreign to the vow, or when he becomes angry, he commits a fault and breaks his vow, since suppression of anger behoves him who is consecrated. Now, Agni is the Lord of vows among the gods,--it is to him therefore that he resorts (Vāj. S. IV, 16; Rig-veda VIII, II, 7): 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.' This, then, is his atonement for that (transgression); and thus that fault is not committed by him, and he does not break his vow: therefore he says, 'Thou, O Agni, art the divine guardian of vows among men, to whom praise is due at the sacrifices.'

[^egg_124]: 47:1 Dhīkshate, apparently the desiderative of dih (Weber, in St. Petersb. Dict. s. v.) Cf. III, 1, 3, 7 seq. The construction (especially the first hi) is rather peculiar. This paragraph apparently is to supply further proof why he should be cautious in his speech, and the words 'sa vai dhīkshate' have to be taken parenthetically: 'He speaks his speech cautiously . . . .; for (anointing himself as he does) he anoints himself for speech, &c.' The Kāṇva text offers less difficulty: Atha yad dhīkshito nāma vāce vā esha etad dhīkshate, yajñāya hi dhīkshate, yajño hi vāk, tasmād dhīkshito nāma, dhīkshito ha vai nāmaitad yad dīkshita ity āhuḥ.

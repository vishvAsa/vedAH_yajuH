1. South of the Āhavanīya he spreads two black antelope skins on the ground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him. If there are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and earth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.

2. They are joined (fitted) together along their edge [^egg_77], for these two worlds are also, as it were, joined together at their edge. At the hind part they are fastened together through holes: thus, after uniting (mithunīkr̥tya) these two worlds, he consecrates him thereon.

[^egg_77]: 26:1 The two skins are fitted together at the inner sides, and stretched along the ground by means of wooden pins driven into the ground and passed through holes all round the edge of the skins; the hairy sides of the latter remaining outside (above and below). At their hind parts they are tacked together by 'means of a thong passed through the holes and tied together in a loop.'

3. But if there be only one (skin), then it is an image of these (three) worlds; then he consecrates him on these (three) worlds. Those (hairs) which are white are an image of the sky; those which are black are (an image) of this (earth);--or, if he likes, conversely: those which are black are an image of the sky, and those which are white are (an image) of this (earth). Those which are of a brownish yellow colour [^egg_78], are an image of the atmosphere. Thus he consecrates him on these (three) worlds.

[^egg_78]: 26:2 Yāny eva babhrūṇiva harīṇi. The Kāṇva text reads, Yāny eva madhye babhrūṇi vā harīṇi vā, 'those in the centre (or between the black and white) which are either brown or yellow (grey).

where the white and black (hair) join, he mutters (Vāj. S. IV, 9), 'Ye are the images of the R̥c and Sāman;'--an image doubtless is what is conformable [^egg_81]: 'Ye are conformable to, the r̥cs and sāmans' he thereby means to say.

8. He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the text, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!' for the skin (carma) of the black deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge (śarma): therefore he says, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.' 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!' Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice [^egg_81] doubtless raises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means of) sacrifice. Hereby, now, he propitiates that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure him: for this reason he says, 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!'

Now when Prajāpati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, that which was nearest to him, the amnion, became hempen threads: hence they smell putrid. And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the garment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and hence that (zone) is worn under the garment.

She then went up to where he was standing. Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported to them her having come, saying, 'She has indeed come.'

[^egg_86]: 31:1 Yoshā vā iyaṁ vāg yad enaṁ na yuvitā. The St. Petersburg Dict. (s. v. yu) takes it differently, 'That Vāc is indeed a woman, since she does not wish to draw him towards herself (i.e. since she does not want him to come near her).' Sāyaṇa, on the other hand, explains it elliptically, 'Since she has not joined him (no confidence can be placed in her).' The Kāṇva text reads: Ta u ha devā bibhayāṁ cakrur yoshā vā iyam iti yad vā enam na yuvīteti. Perhaps in our passage also we should read 'yuvīta' (as proposed by Delbrück, Syntact. Forschungen III, p. 79), and translate, 'Verily that Vāc is a woman: (it is to be feared) that she will [or, it is to be hoped that she will not] allure him [viz. so. that Yajña also would fall to the share of the Asuras];' 'Dass sie ihn nur nicht an sich fesselt!' For similar elliptic constructions with yad and the optative, see paragraphs 26 and 27; and II, 2, 4, 3 ['Dass er mich nur nicht auffrisst!']; IV, 3, 5, 3 ('Dass uns nur die Rakshas nichts zu Leide thun!'); IV, 6, 9, 1.

24. Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,--and he (who speaks thus) is a Mleccha (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.

Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it on the head of Yajña (sacrifice [^egg_90]);for the black (antelope) is the sacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black deer's horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,

He then touches with it his forehead close over the right eyebrow, with the text, 'Thou art Indra's womb,'--for it is indeed Indra's womb, since in entering it he enters thereby [^egg_91], and in being born he is born therefrom: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's womb.'

For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and were any one to scratch an embryo either with a chip of wood or his nail, thereby expelling it, it would die [^egg_92].

Now his

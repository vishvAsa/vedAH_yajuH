She thought, 'How is it that, in spreading the sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the sacrifice?' and confounded their sacrifice: they knew not that sacrifice.

[^egg_125]: 48:1 At IV, 5, 1, 2, the name prāyaṇīya is derived from pra-i, to go forth, because by means of this offering they, as it were, go forth to buy the Soma. Similarly, udayanīya is explained as the offering he performs after coming out (ud-i) from the bath. In Ait. Br. I, 7, on the other hand, the name prāyaṇīya is explained as that by means of which sacrificers go forward (pra-i) to the heavenly world. In the Soma sacrifice, the Prāyaṇīyā and Udayanīyā may be said to correspond to the Fore-offerings and After-offerings (prayāja and anuyāja) of the New and Full-moon Sacrifice; though, of course, the Fore- and After-offerings form part of the prāyaṇīyā and udayanīyā, as ishṭis. But they are peculiar in this respect, that offering is made at both to the very same deities, and that the invitatory prayers (anuvākyā) of the prāyaṇīyeshṭi form the offering-prayers (yājyā) of the udayanīyeshṭi, and vice versā. For these formulas, see Āśval. Śrautas. IV, 3; Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 16. The offering formula of the oblation to Aditi at the Prāyaṇīyā (and invitatory formula at the Udayanīyā), strange to say, is not a R̥k-verse, but one from the Atharvan (VII, 6, 2).

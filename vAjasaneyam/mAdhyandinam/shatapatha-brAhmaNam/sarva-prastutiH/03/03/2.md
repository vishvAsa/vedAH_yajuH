1. Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;--clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest [^egg_172] he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee.

[^egg_172]: 63:3 The construction in the original is as usual in the oratio directa.

2. Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger [^egg_173]). Now, twofold indeed is this (universe),--there is no third,--the truth and the untruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth. And gold having sprung from Agni's seed, he ties the gold to this (finger), in order that he may touch the twigs (of the Soma) with the truth, that he may handle the Soma by means of the truth.

3. He then orders (the sacrificer's men), 'Bring thou the Soma-cloth! bring thou the Soma-wrapper! bring thou the head-band!' Let some shining (cloth) be the Soma-cloth; for this is to be his (king Soma's [^egg_174]) garment, and shining indeed is his garment: and whosoever serves him with a shining (garment), he truly shines. But he who says, '(Bring) anything whatsoever,' he will indeed be anything whatsoever: let the Soma-cloth, therefore, be some splendid (cloth), and the Soma-wrapper one of any kind.

[^egg_174]: 64:1 I do not think 'asya' could refer to the sacrificer, in opposition to 'etasya' (Soma); nor can the latter be construed with the following relative clause 'sa yo . . .' The Kāṇva text reads, Tad yad eva śobhanatamaṁ tat somopanahanaṁ syād, vāso by asyaitad bhavati; sa yo haitac cḥobhanatamaṁ kurute, śobhate haiva saḥ, &c.

5. Now, in the first place, they pick the king (Soma). A pitcher of water is placed close to him, and a Brāhman sits beside him [^egg_175]. Thither they (the priests and sacrificer) now proceed eastward.

[^egg_175]: 64:2 The Pratiprasthātr̥, in the first place, takes the Soma-plants (from the seller) and puts them on an ox-hide, dyed red and spread on the ground at the place (in the east of the hall) where the 'sounding-holes' will be dug (see III, 5, 4, 1 seq.). The seller of the Soma, who is to be either of the Kutsa tribe or a Śūdra, then picks the Soma, breaking the plants at the joints. A jar filled with water is placed in front of the Soma, and a Brāhman (or the assistant of the Brahman, viz. the Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsin) sits down by the (right or south) side of the Soma. Kāty. VII, 6, 1-6.

6. While they go there, he (the Adhvaryu) makes

Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "This is thy jayatī-part!" Say thou, for me, unto Soma, "Obtain thou the supreme sovereignty of the names of metres!"' Now, when he (king Soma) is bought, he is bought for one (destination [^egg_177])--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres; and when they press him, they slay him: hereby now he says to him, 'It is for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres that I buy thee, not for slaying thee.' Having gone there, he sits down (behind the Soma) with his face towards the east.

[^egg_176]: 65:1 The three parts refer to the three Savanas, at which the respective metres are used. See IV, 3, 2, 7 seq.

[^egg_177]: 65:2 Bhāgam appears to have been lost here, since a play on that word seems to be intended, which might perhaps be reproduced by lot.' It is given both at the Kāṇva text and at III, 4, 1, 7.

8. Now some, on noticing any straw or (piece of) wood (among the Soma-plants), throw it away. But let him not do this; for--the Soma being the nobility and the other plants the common people, and the

people being the nobleman's food--it would be just as if one were to take hold of and pull out some (food) he has put in his mouth, and throw it away. Hence let him merely touch it, with, 'Let the pickers pick thee!' Those pickers of his do indeed pick it.

[^egg_179]: 66:1 Aticḥandas ('over-metre') is the generic name for the metres which number more than forty-eight syllables: hence it is said to include all the other metres which consist of fewer syllables. See VIII, 6, 2, 23, where the term is explained by atti-cḥandāḥ (metre-eater).'

Professor Ludwig takes it to mean 'press-arm' and the 'arm' generally, which suits very well some of the passages in which the word occurs. Here, in the loc. or gen. case, it can scarcely mean 'arms' (though Savitr̥'s two arms are often referred to as dispelling the darkness and keeping asunder the spaces, cf. Rig-veda II, 38, 2; IV, 53, 3; 4; VI, 75, 1; 5; VII, 45, 2), but apparently refers to 'heaven and earth' being thus equivalent to  the two camū (originally the two receptacles or bowls into which the pressed Soma flows) in Rig-veda III, 55, 20.

The meting out of the Soma is done with the fingers of the right hand, first with all five, and then successively turning in one (beginning with the thumb), till the little finger remains with which he takes Soma twice, whereupon he again successively releases the fingers.

[^egg_182]: 67:2 There is some doubt as to whether this refers to the preceding 'with all (viz. ten fingers);' or whether he is to take for the tenth time some Soma with the five fingers of the right hand, and then once more (without muttering the text) with the joined hands. See Kāty. VII, 7, 18, 29. The text seems to be purposely vague.

1. In the enclosed space (of the cart) [^egg_199] he (the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 30), 'Thou art Aditi's skin;' its significance is the same (as before) [^egg_200]. Thereon he places him (Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'

[^egg_199]: 75:1 The cart stands south of the place where the purchase of Soma took place, with the shafts towards the east, fitted with all the appliances, and yoked with a pair of oxen. The antelope skin is spread with the hairy side upwards, and the neck part towards the east.

[^egg_200]: 75:2 See I, 1, 4, 1 seq. The Kāṇva text has: 'the significance of this yajus is the same.'

2. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin [^egg_201].' For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, 'The bull hath propped the sky, the welkin,'

[^egg_201]: 75:3 In Rig-veda VIII, 42, 1, this verse relates to Varuṇa. In adapting it to the present sacrificial requirements, 'vr̥shabho (r̥shabho, K.) antariksham' has been substituted for the original 'asuro viśvavedāḥ;' Soma being meant by 'the bull.'

thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly shaft [^egg_202].

[^egg_202]: 76:1 Or, superior to (beyond the reach of) the slayer (or the blow), 'jyāyāṁsaṁ vadhāt.'

manliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness upon men; and 'milk into the kine' he says, because this milk is indeed contained in the kine;--'Into the hearts Varuṇa (hath laid) wisdom, into the homesteads [^egg_203] fire;' for into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed entered; and 'into the homesteads fire' he says, because that fire is in the homesteads, with the people;--'Into the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock;' for that sun is indeed placed in the heaven; and 'Soma on the rock' he says, because Soma is in the mountains. This is why he says, 'In the heaven hath he placed the Sun, and Soma upon the rock.'

Kāty. VII, 9, 15 comm. The cart stands with the oxen towards the east; it is then wheeled round towards the right to the west and driven to the hall, in front of which it is turned towards the north; the Soma being then taken down. See Ait. Br. I, 14.

[^egg_209]: 79:2 The duties of the Hotr̥, while the Soma-cart is driven to the hall, are set forth Āśv. Śrautas. IV, 4: He stands three feet behind the cart between the two wheel tracks, and throws thrice dust towards the south with the fore-part of his foot without moving the heel, with the formula, 'Thou art wise, thou art intelligent, thou upholding all things: drive away the danger arising from men!' Thereupon, after uttering the sound 'Him,' he recites eight verses, or, the first and last being recited thrice each, in all twelve verses. Cf. Ait. Br. I, 13. He first remains standing in the same place and recites thrice the first verse. Then in following the cart he recites the five following verses. The cart having now stopped, he walks round it on its right (south) side, and while looking on the Soma follows it while it is placed on the throne. He then touches it and completes his recitation by the last two verses. The first of these two verses is the same which the sacrificer is to mutter (with the Adhvaryu) while Soma is carried into the hall, and which is given in paragraph 30.

Sāyaṇa seems to interpret the passage differently: apy asya rājānaḥ iti sabhāgā ity anena rājñām anatikramaṇīyam  uktam bhavati; api sambhāvanāyām madhuparkam āha 'rājñe cācāryaśvaśurapitr̥vyamātulānaṁ ceti' (Āśv.

him) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings, for he is gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth, O Lord of the world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings. 'To all dwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with reference to his limbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee! may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.

[^egg_213]: 81:1 This myth, according to which Indra was supposed to have assumed the form of a ram and to have carried off Medhātithi, the Kāṇva (or, according to others, to have robbed him of his Soma), appears to be alluded to in Rig-veda VIII, 2, 40. On the possible connection of the myth with the Greek one of Ganymede, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 40. Sāyaṇa does not explain the Subrahmaṇyā formula, but remarks, that he has already done so in the Sāma-brāhmaṇa (viz. in the Shaḍviṁśa).

[^egg_214]: 81:2 According to Rig-veda I, 51, 13, Indra became the wife (menā) of Vr̥shaṇaśva (Mena); the reason for this transformation being, according to the Shaḍviṁśa Br., that he was in love with Menā or Menakā, the daughter of that king (or sage). Ind. Stud. I, p. 38. The later explanation of the simple statement of the R̥k seems of doubtful authenticity, unless the choice of the word menā for 'wife' was intended by the bard as an allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is more likely that the myth alluded to in the R̥k had been forgotten at the time of the Brāhmaṇas, and a new version of it was invented, based on the 'menā' of the original. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383, takes Menā here as a name.

[^egg_215]: 81:3 This is another of Indra's love-myths about which very little is known. Ahalyā (Maitreyī) is said to have been the wife of the R̥shi Gautama (or of Kauśika, according to Shaḍv. Br.) and to have been loved by Indra.

19. 'O Kauśika [^egg_216], Brahman, thou who callest thee Gautama [^egg_217].' Just so has this (formula) been devised in these days by Āruṇi, to wit, 'thou who callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not choose, he need not attend to it [^egg_218]. 'In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,' (stating) in how many days from hence the pressing is to be.

[^egg_216]: 82:1 According to Sāyaṇa on Rig-veda I, 10, 11 (where Indra is called Kauśika, 'favourable to the Kuśikas') Kuśika desired to have a son equal to Indra, whence the latter was born as Kuśika's son Gāthin (Gādhin). Differently Sāy. on Taitt. Ār. I, 12, 4.

[^egg_217]: 82:2 The Shaḍv. Br. (Ind. Stud. I, p. 38) explains this as follows:--The Gods and Asuras were at war with each other. Gotama was performing austerities between them. Indra went up to him and said, 'Go out as our spy.' 'I cannot,' he replied. 'Then I will go in your form.' 'As thou thinkest fit!' And because he (Indra) went about in the form of Gotama, passing himself off as Gotama, therefore he says, 'thou who callest thee Gotama.'

[^egg_218]: 82:3 The Kāṇva text also states that this last portion of the formula was devised by Āruṇi, but nothing is said as to its use being optional.

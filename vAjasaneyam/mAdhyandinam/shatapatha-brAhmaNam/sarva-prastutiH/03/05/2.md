1. They put fire-wood on (the Āhavanīya fire), and prepare the underlayer (of gravel [^egg_322]). He (the Adhvaryu) puts the butter on (the Gārhapatya to melt), and cleans both the dipping-spoon and the offering-spoon. Having then clarified the ghee, he ladles five times thereof (into the offering-spoon). When the fire-wood is ablaze-

[^egg_322]: 121:2 Some gravel is put in a pan for the burning wood to lie upon, when it is to be transferred from the Āhavanīya to the new altar. The Taittirīyas mix with the gravel one-fourth part of the dust of the foot-print of the Soma-cow (III, 3, 1, 6), the other three parts being used respectively for anointing the axle of the Soma-cart (III, 5, 3, 13), for the underlayer of the Āgnīdhra fire (III, 6, 3, 4), and for scattering about behind the Gārhapatya (III, 6, 3, 4-7).

Because she (Vāc--the altar) on that occasion became a lioness and roamed about unappeased [^egg_331], he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that sorrow of hers,--if he do not wish to exorcise. But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying, 'This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!' He then smites him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.

9. Now as to why he pours ghee on the high altar, while the fire is held (over it). Because the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering shall reach thee before Agni,' therefore the offering now does reach her before (it reaches) Agni. And because she said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' therefore the priests now invoke through her that blessing upon the sacrificer, and it is fully accomplished unto him.

18. And as to why there is a wether's hair-tuft,--Agni, forsooth, dwelt once for one night between the two horns of a wether: 'Whatever of Agni's nature is inherent therein, let that be here too,' so he thinks, and therefore there is a wether's hair-tuft. Let him, therefore, cut off that (tuft) which is nearest to the head, and bring it; and if he be unable to procure that, let him bring any kind (of wether's hair). And why there are enclosing-sticks?--for the

protection (of Agni): for it is somewhat long before the next enclosing-sticks will come nigh to him [^egg_338].

[^egg_338]: 126:1 Ordinarily the laying round of the paridhis takes place immediately before the fire is kindled for the offering; but as the next offering is not to come off for some time, the fire would be without a protection, if he were to leave it without the enclosing-sticks. Sāyaṇa takes 'dūre' in the sense of 'in a long time,' as above; but it might be taken of space 'far off,' when the passage would refer to the offering about to be performed on the old Āhavanīya (III, 5, 3, 10 seq.); and it may be noticed in reference to this point, that, according to Kāty. VIII, 3, 30, that fire does not become the Gārhapatya till immediately after that offering.

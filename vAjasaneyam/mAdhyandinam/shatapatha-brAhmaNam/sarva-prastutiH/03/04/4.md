1. Verily the Upasads (homages or sieges) are the neck of the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head. Hence when it is performed with the Pravargya [^egg_272],

[^egg_272]: 104:3 The Pravargya, an offering of heated milk, which precedes each performance of the Upasads,--except at the first performance of the Soma-sacrifice, when it is prohibited by many authorities,--seems originally to have been an independent ceremony, and as such it is treated by most ritualistic books apart from the exposition of the Soma-cult. The Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa deals with it in XIV, 1-3 (Vāj. S. XXXIX). Its mystic significance appears to have been that of supplying the sacrificer with a new celestial body. There seems to have been a tendency towards exalting its  importance--if not, indeed, towards making it take the place of the Soma-cult. The hot milk (gharma) is even styled 'Samrāj' or supreme king--as against the title 'rājan' or king, assigned to Soma; and a throne is provided for it, just as for the latter. The rules for its performance, according to the Āpastamba Śrauta-sūtra, have been published, with a translation, by Professor Garbe (Zeitsch. der D. M. G. XXXIV, p. 319 seq.). See also Haug's Transl. of the Ait. Br. pp. 41-43; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX. pp. 218-220.

they perform the Upasads [^egg_273] after performing the Pravargya, and thereby they put the neck in its place.

[^egg_273]: 105:1 The Upasadaḥ, consisting of three offerings of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vishṇu, followed by a Homa, have to be performed twice daily, for at least three days (the normal number at the Agnishṭoma). The first day's performance is called (from the corresponding Homa) the 'ayaḥśayā' (lying in iron, made of iron), the second day's 'rajaḥśayā' (silvern),and the third day's 'hariśayā' (golden). If there are six, or twelve Upasad days, each of the three varieties of performance has assigned to it an equal number of successive days; and if there are more than twelve the three varieties are to be performed alternately.

26. Now then of the fast-homages. Some Upasads get wider and wider, others narrower and narrower: those at which he milks out one (teat) [^egg_288] on the first day, then two, and then three, are those that get wider and wider; and those at which he

27. Verily, the world is conquered by austere devotion. Now, his devotion becomes ever and ever wider, he conquers an ever and ever more glorious world and becomes better even in this world, whosoever, knowing this, undertakes the Upasads that get narrower and narrower [^egg_289]: let him, therefore, undertake the Upasads that get narrower and narrower. And should he undertake twelve Upasads, let him have three (teats) milked out for four days, two for four days, and one for four days.

[^egg_289]: 111:1 The simile is apparently taken from the arrow, which pierces the deeper the more pointed it is; cf. parag. 14, above; Ait. Br. I, 25. Also Taitt. S. VI, 2, 3, 5, where a goad (āra?) is compared.

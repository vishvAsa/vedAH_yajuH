1. When the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord arose between them. They allayed it by means of the Tānūnaptra (oaths). They desired an atonement for having spoken evil to one another; for they had appointed no other consecration-ceremony till the expiatory bath. They perceived this intermediate consecration [^egg_256].

2. By means of fire they enveloped (the body) with a skin. Now, fire being fervour, and the consecration being fervour, they thereby underwent an intermediate consecration; and because they underwent that

intermediate consecration, therefore this intermediary consecration (avāntaradīkshā, is performed). They turned in their fingers more tightly and drew [^egg_257] their zone tighter, whereby they (again) put round them what had been put round them before [^egg_258];--and so does he thereby make atonement for what heretofore he has done injurious to the vow, for what he has spoken injurious to the vow.

And in like manner does this one now become like Agni, and thereby escape from the Rakshas and attain to the heavenly world.

11. Having touched the lustral water, they (the priests and sacrificer) therewith strengthen [^egg_262] the king (Soma). The reason why, after touching the lustral water, they strengthen the king is this;--ghee is a thunderbolt, and Soma is seed: hence they strengthen the king after touching the lustral water, lest they should injure the seed, Soma, by the thunderbolt, the ghee.

[^egg_262]: 100:1 On the 'āpyāyana' (ā-pyai,'to swell; make swell,' to strengthen, become strong, increase, fill), see part i, p. 178, note 2. According to Āpastamba and other authorities, they tie a piece of gold to their nameless (gold) finger, and touch the Soma with their moist hands.

18. They strengthen him with (Vāj. S. V, 7),

 'Let stalk after stalk of thine wax strong, O divine Soma!' whereby they strengthen (increase) stalk after stalk of his;--'for Indra, the winner of the ekadhanas [^egg_265];' Indra indeed is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'For Indra, the winner (or bestower) of the ekadhanas.' For verily every one of those stalks swells to fill a hundred or ten [^egg_266] ekadhana cups for the several gods. 'May Indra wax strong for thee, and wax thou strong for Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus strengthens him who is the deity of the sacrifice. By saying, 'Wax thou strong for Indra,' he instils that invigorating draught into him. 'Strengthen us friends with gain and understanding!' 'With gain' he says with reference to what he gains; and 'with understanding' he says with reference to what he recites. 'Mayest thou thrive, O divine Soma, and may I attain to the Soma-feast!' They, the priests and sacrificer, have one prayer in common, 'May we reach the end of the sacrifice!' hence he thereby means to say, 'May I reach the end of the sacrifice!'

[^egg_265]: 102:1 Ekadhana-vid; the meaning of 'ekadhana' (apparently 'one prize' or 'one part of the booty or goods') in this compound is not clear. The author of the Brāhmaṇa seems to take it in its technical sense, viz. the ekadhana pitchers in which the ekadhanā water, used for mixing with the Soma juice, is kept, see III, 9, 3; 16; 27; 34. According to Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 114 notes, they are so called because the Adhvaryu throws one stalk of Soma (eka-dhana) into each pitcher to consecrate it.

[^egg_266]: 102:2 This anticlimax is rather curious. The Kāṇva text reads: daśa daśa vā ha smaisha ekaiko ’ṁśur devān pratīndrāyaikadhanān āpyāyayanti (!) śataṁ śatam vā tasmād āhaikadhanavida iti.

but now they strengthen (Soma) after going, as it were, towards the right (south) [^egg_267]; and, the sacrifice being the fire, they thereby turn their back on the sacrifice and thus do wrong and are cut off from the gods. Now the prastara also is (part of) the sacrifice, and by (touching) it they again get hold of the sacrifice. And this is his expiation of that (transgression); and so no wrong is committed by them and they are not cut off from the gods: for this reason they make amends on the prastara.

[^egg_267]: 103:1 Soma's throne stands south of the Āhavanīya fire, and in going to perform the āpyayanam upon him, the priests and sacrificer have to move round the fire, along the east side of it towards the south (the region of the Fathers).

[^egg_268]: 103:2 This seems to be Sāyaṇa's interpretation of the passage 'akte nihnuvīrā̃n anaktā̃i.' The two words, with their final syllable protracted, being intended to strongly contradict the preceding 'akte.' It is hardly possible to take the latter absolutely, 'it being anointed (when thrown into the fire), let them make amends on it while unanointed.' On the throwing of the prastara into the fire, see I, 8, 3, 17. The prastara referred to is that of the guest-offering (ātithyeshṭi), which was broken off after the Iḍā ceremony (see III, 4, I, 26) and has to be completed after the present ceremony. Neither the prastara nor the barhis is burnt on this occasion.

21. They make amends [^egg_269] with, 'Desirable treasures (may come) forth for strength and well-being--the right for the right-saying'--whereby

[^egg_269]: 103:3 In performing this propitiatory rite, the priests and sacrificer lay their hands on the prastara, either both of them with the palms upwards, or only the right one, and the left in the opposite way. Kāty. VIII, 2, 9. The latter mode is the one practised by the Taittirīyas. Sāy. on Taitt. S. I, 2, 11.

he means to say, 'the truth for the truth-speaking;'--'Homage be to Heaven and to the Earth!' whereby they make amends to these two, heaven and earth, on whom this All is founded.

22. Having then picked up the prastara, he says, 'Agnīdh, does the water boil? It boils,' replies the Agnīdh [^egg_270]. 'Come hither with it!' He holds (the prastara) quite close over the fire. The reason why he does not throw it into the fire is that he (the sacrificer) is to perform therewith [^egg_271] during the days that follow; and in that he holds it quite close over the fire, thereby it is for him as if it were really thrown into the fire. He hands it to the Agnīdh, and the Agnīdh puts it aside (in a safe place).

[^egg_271]: 104:2 Or, 'in the shape of it (tena),' the prastara representing the sacrificer himself. This sentence seems also to imply, that the sacrificer thereby continues to live during the days that follow.

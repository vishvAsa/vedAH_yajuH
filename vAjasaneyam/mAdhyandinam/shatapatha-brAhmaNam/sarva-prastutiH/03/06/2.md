1. The Dhishṇya-hearths [^egg_392], forsooth, are no other

[^egg_392]: 148:4 There are altogether eight dhishṇyas, two of which, viz. the Āgnīdhra and the Mārjālīya, are raised north and south of the back part of the cart-shed (havirdhāna) respectively; while the other six are raised inside the Sadas along the east side of it, viz. five of them north of the 'spine,' belonging (from south to north) to the Hotr̥, Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsi, Potr̥, Neshṭr̥, and Acḥāvāka respectively; and one south of the spine, exactly south-east of the Udumbara post, for the Maitrāvaruṇa (or Praśāstr̥) priest. These six priests, together with the Āgnīdhra, are called the 'seven Hotr̥s.' The Āgnīdhra and Mārjālīya have square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east side and on the side facing the cart-shed. The Āgnīdhra hearth is thrown up first, and the Mārjālīya last of all; and the Maitrāvaruṇa's immediately after that of the Hotr̥. For the formulas by which they are consecrated, see Vāj. S. V, 32, 32.

2. Now Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired, 'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They produced those two illusions, Suparṇī and Kadrū [^egg_394]; Suparṇī, forsooth, was Vāc (speech) [^egg_395], and Kadrū was this (earth). They caused discord between them.

12. She took possession (ā-cakhāda) [^egg_400] of Soma by means of (a stick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the name) Khadira; and because she thereby took possession of him, therefore the sacrificial stake and the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.

[^egg_400]: 151:1 Sāyaṇa takes it in the sense of 'she swallowed (khād),' but I should feel inclined to refer it to the same verb 'khid' (? khad) as 'ākhidat' coming immediately after it. Could Pāṇini's Sūtra VI, 1, 52 refer to this passage? [Kāś. V., Benares edition cikhāda; MS. Indian Office cakhāda.] The Kāṇva text has the same reading: ācakhāda-ākhidat.

This passage  apparently refers to the Camasa-Adhvaryus or cup-bearers, who at the time of the Savanas hold up their cups filled with Soma, which, after libations have been made of it on the fire, is drunk by the priests.

 Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between [^egg_404] the hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him (Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let him pass north of the Āgnīdhra shed.

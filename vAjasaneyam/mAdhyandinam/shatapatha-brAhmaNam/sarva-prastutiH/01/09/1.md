1. Now [^egg_581] when (the Adhvaryu) says, 'The divine Hotr̥s are summoned for the proclamation of success,

[^egg_581]: 247:2 The author now proceeds to give in detail the formulas to be recited by the Hotr̥ during the ceremonies treated in the preceding Brāhmaṇa (see p. 236, note 2); pars. 1-23 treating of the sūktavāka; pars. 24-29 of the śamyuvāka.

the human one is called upon for the song of praise (sūkta-vāka);' and when the Hotr̥ thereupon recites, he recites good words only [^egg_582]: he thereby invokes a blessing on the sacrificer. It is indeed after the sacrifice that he thus invokes a blessing. A twofold reason there is for his invoking the blessing after the sacrifice.

[^egg_582]: 248:1 Sūktaiva tad āha, which the commentator paraphrases by sūktāṅy āha. It is apparently intended as an explanation of the term sūktavaka. The word sūkta here has exceptionally the accent on the penultimate.

2. He who sacrifices, assuredly, is the producer of the sacrifice, since it is by his order that, the priests spread it, that they produce it. He (the Hotr̥) now invokes a blessing; and that blessing invoked by him, the sacrifice, on its part, realises for this (sacrificer), knowing as it does that he has produced it. For this reason he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.

3. He who sacrifices, assuredly, pleases the gods. Having pleased the gods by that sacrifice,--that is, partly by R̥k-verses, partly by Yajus-formulas, and partly by oblations,--he obtains a share among them.

When he has obtained a share among them, then (the Hotr̥) invokes a blessing (on him); and that (blessing, invoked by him, the gods realise for this sacrificer), knowing as they do that he has pleased them. For this reason also he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.

utterance of worship [^egg_584],' for indeed these two, the singing of praises and the utterance of worship, form the sacrifice: and accordingly he thereby says, 'We have accomplished the sacrifice, we have obtained possession of the sacrifice.'--'Thou, O Agni, art the voice of praise at the listening [^egg_585] of heaven and earth,' he thereby says to Agni, 'Thou art the voice of praise, while heaven and earth listen.'--'May heaven and earth be propitious to thee, O sacrificer, at this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'May heaven and earth abound in food for thee, O sacrificer, at this sacrifice.'

[^egg_584]: 249:1 'Sūktavākam uta namovākam.' Our author seems to refer these terms to the R̥k-verses and the Yajus-formulas used during the sacrifice. Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. II, 6, 9, takes 'namovāka' in a more restricted sense, viz. as referring to the formula 'namo devebhyaḥ.' Both the Black Yajur-vela and Āśv. Ś. add 'r̥dhyāsma sūktocyam,' which has probably to be taken in the sense of 'May we accomplish that which is expressed in the sūktas.' [Sāyaṇa, 'May we succeed with the sūkta yet to be pronounced.']

[^egg_585]: 249:2 For upaśrutī the Black Yajur-veda has upaśrito, which Sāyaṇa explains, 'Since thou art established in heaven and earth, thou art able to recite the sūkta.'

[^egg_586]: 249:3 Śaṁgavī seems to be a corruption of Śaṁgayī (propitious to the household), which is the reading of the Black Yajur-veda and Āśv. Ś. (cf. Rig-veda IX, 97, 17).

[^egg_587]: 249:4 ? Apravede, according to Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, in an active sense, 'they who do not tell of, do not betray, our faults' (hence 'verschwiegen,' reticent, discreet, St. Petersb. Dict.) 'Difficult to obtain,' Harisvāmin. Our author apparently takes it in the sense of 'not obtained before.'

[^egg_588]: 251:1 Āśv. Ś. reads twice asau 'N.N., N.N.;' and the commentary remarks that the Hotr̥ has here to pronounce both the ordinary name of the sacrificer, and his nākshatra name (i.e. the mystic name given him for the duration of the sacrifice, and derived from the respective lunar mansion, or its tutelary deity). This practice was probably not yet in vogue in the time of our author. Cf. Weber, Nakshatra II, p. 316 seq.

24. Thereupon he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing' (śam-yos) [^egg_595]. Now it was Śamyu Bārhaspatya who perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice. He went to share in the world of the gods. Thereupon that (knowledge) was entirely lost to men.

[^egg_595]: 254:1 See p. 247, note 2. The original meaning of the terms śam yos, as they occur in the Rig-veda, is happily rendered by Professor Max Müller (Translation of the Rig-veda, I, p. 182) by 'health and wealth.' In the sacrificial ceremonial a deeper significance bas come to be attached to this benedictory formula, for which it is difficult to find an exact equivalent. The entire śamyuvāka, as here given, forms part of a khila to the last book of the R̥k-Saṁhitā; cf. Max Müller's edition, vol. vi. p. 32; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IV, p. 431. The Black Yajus version of the legend regarding Śamyu Bārhaspatya (Taitt. S. II, 6, 10) is quite different from ours; they were both invented to explain śam yos.

25. It then became known to the R̥shis, that Śamyu Bārhaspatya had perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice, and had gone to share in the world of the gods. By pronouncing the śamyoḥ, they attained to that same consummation of the sacrifice which Śamyu Bārhaspatya had perceived; and to that same consummation of the sacrifice, which Samyu Bārhaspatya had perceived, this (Hotr̥)

attains by pronouncing the śam-yoḥ. For this reason he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing.'

The Kāṇva Saṁhitā omits that formula, and hence assigns this touching to the Hotr̥. Harisvāmin remarks that the Hotr̥ touches the earth with the little finger of his right hand, as stated in the Kāṇva recension. The latter reads 'with the little finger.' No mention is made in the Āśv. Ś. of this touching of the earth on the part of the Hotr̥.

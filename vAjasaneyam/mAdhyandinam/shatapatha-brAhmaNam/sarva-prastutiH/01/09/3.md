1. The sacrifice being now complete, he (the Adhvaryu) walks round (the fire) to the south, and pours out a vessel (of water); for thus it is (poured out) towards north: therefore he pours it out after walking round to the south, He who sacrifices, doubtless, sacrifices with a desire that he also may obtain a place in the world of the gods. That sacrifice of his then goes forth towards the world of the gods: after it follows the fee which he gives (to the priests), and holding on to the priests' fee (follows) the sacrificer.

2. That same path leads either to the gods or to the fathers [^egg_621]. On both sides two flames are ever burning: they scorch him who deserves to be scorched, and allow him to pass who deserves to pass [^egg_622]. Now, water is (a means of) lustration: hence he thereby lustrates that path.

[^egg_621]: 267:1 Cf. Mahābh. XII, 525, 'Two paths are known, one leading to the gods, and one leading to the fathers; and ib. XIII, 1082, That sun is said to be the gate of the paths leading to the gods; and that moon is said to be the gate of the paths leading to the fathers.' See also Cḥand. Up. V, 3. In Śat. Br. VI, 6, 2, 4 the gate of the heavenly world is said to be situated in the northeast; whilst that of the world of the fathers, according to XIII, 8, 1, 5, lies in the south-east. Cf. Kaushīt. Up. I, 2 seq. (Max Müller, Up. I, p. 274), 'Verily, the moon is the door of the heavenly world,' &c.

[^egg_622]: 267:2 According to Harisvāmin, they scorch him who has not fulfilled his duties, and allow him to pass who has done so.

6. He (the sacrificer) intercepts it with his open hands held together, while reciting the text (Vāj. S. II, 24),

 'We have united with lustre, with vigour, with the bodies [^egg_623], with the happy spirit. May Tvashṭr̥, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and make even what was injured in our body!' What was torn, that he thereby heals.

[^egg_623]: 268:1 That is, with the departed persons, the fathers; or, more probably, with new bodies (?), cf. the funereal hymns, Rig-veda X, 14-18; especially X, 35, 14; 16, 5; 14, 8. Perhaps, however, it would be better to construe, 'by (our) bodies we have united with lustre and vigour; by (our) mind with bliss.' In IV, 6, 1, 1 it is said, that the sacrificer is born in the next world with his entire body; similarly XI, 1, 8, 6; XII, 8, 3, 31.

9. And again why he strides the Vishṇu-strides, is; Vishṇu, truly, is the sacrifice, by striding (vi-kram) he obtained for the gods that all-pervading power (vikrānti) which now belongs to them. By his first step he gained this same (earth), by the second this aërial expanse, and by his last (step) the sky. And this same pervading power Vishṇu, as the sacrifice, obtains by his strides for him (the sacrificer): for this reason he strides

the Vishṇu-strides. Now it is indeed from this (earth) that most (beings) go (upwards).

10. Hence (he strides thrice) with the texts (Vāj. S. II, 25 a-c), 'On the earth Vishṇu strode by means of the gāyatrī metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' 'In the air Vishṇu strode by means of the trishṭubh metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' 'In the sky Vishṇu strode by means of the jagatī metre: excluded therefrom is he who hates us, and whom we hate!' When one has thus ascended these worlds, that is the goal, that the safe refuge: the rays of him (the sun) who burns there, are the righteous (departed) [^egg_624]; and what highest light there is [^egg_625], that is Prajāpati or the heavenly world. Having then in this way ascended these worlds, he reaches that goal, that safe refuge. Now he who wishes to give instructions from hence, should come hitherwards from above. Twofold is the reason why he should come hitherwards from above:

[^egg_624]: 269:1 In VI, 5, 4, 8 we shall meet with the statement, that 'the stars (nakshatra) are the lights of righteous men who go to the heavenly world.' In the same passage, however (as in others), the nakshatras (lunar mansions) are represented as divine female beings (with unclipped wings; cf. Vāj. S. XI, 61), with whom, in IX, 4, 1, 9, the moon is said to live together, as the Gandharvas with the Apsaras.

11. By (or, from) the escape (of the enemies) [^egg_626] indeed the conquering gods formerly gained first the sky, and then this aërial expanse; and thereupon

[^egg_626]: 269:3 Apasaraṇataḥ; i.e. by allowing the enemies to escape, viz.; first from the sky to the air, and then from the air to the earth. It also, however, has the meaning of 'from escape;' that is, the gods drove the enemies to the earth, whence there was no escape for them.

they drove their enemies away from this (earth), whence there was no escape. And in like manner he (the priest) also by the escape (of the enemies) gains first the sky, and then this aërial expanse; and thereupon he drives his enemies away from this (earth), whence there is no escape.

For on this (earth) all this food is safely established (pratishṭḥita): for this reason he says, 'From this food! from this resort!'

[^egg_627]: 270:1 The sacrificer in making the strides of Vishṇu, may begin either with the stride on earth or with that in the sky (Kāty. III, 8, 11, 12). He begins from the southern hip (or south-west corner) of the altar, and makes three strides eastward with his right foot in front, reciting one formula with each stride, along the south side of the altar up to the Āhavanīya fire.

'"Light-bestowing art thou: give me light (varcas)!" so say I,' said Yājñavalkya, 'for at this indeed the Brāhmaṇa should strive, that he be brahmavarcasin (illumed by the brahma, or sacred writ).' Aupoditeya [^egg_629], on the other hand, said, 'He indeed will give me cows [^egg_630]: (therefore I say), "Cow-giving art thou, give me cows!"' Thus whatever wish he (the sacrificer) entertains (and expresses), that wish is granted to him.

[^egg_628]: 271:1 Seven rays of the sun are mentioned, Rig-veda I, 105, 9; II, 5, 2; Ath-veda VII, 107, 1. Mahīdhara remarks that four of them lie in, or point to, the four quarters; one pointing upwards and another downwards; and the seventh, and best, being the disc of the sun itself, called Hiraṇyagarbha. This apparently is the param bhās, or most excellent light, which in par. 10 is identified with Prajāpati, or the heavenly world.

21. Now (in pronouncing the following text) he

inserts his son's name: 'May this son (N.N.) carry on this manly deed of mine [^egg_632]!' Should he have no son, let him insert his own name.

[^egg_632]: 273:1 The Mādhyandina text of the Vāj. S. does not give this formula. The Kāṇva text of the Saṁhitā has the following (Weber's edition, p. 59), 'Woven art thou, a web art thou: weave me along (? extend my life) at this sacrifice, at this holy deed, in this food, in this world!' 'May my son weave on (continue) this work, this manly deed of mine!' Thus also Kāty. III, 8, 25. The Kāṇva text of the Brāhmaṇa, however, mentions only the formula given above. According to Laugākshi he names his favourite son; according to Śāṅkhāyana, his eldest son, or as many sons as he has. See comm. on Kāty. IV, 12, II.

23. Thereupon he divests himself of the vow, with the text (Vāj. S. II, 28 b), 'Now am I he that I really am.' For, in entering upon the vow, he becomes, as it were, non-human; and as it would not be becoming for him to say, 'I enter from truth into untruth;' and as, in fact, he now again becomes man, let him therefore divest himself of the vow, with the text, 'Now am I he that I really am [^egg_633].'

[^egg_633]: 273:2 See I, 1, 1, 6. For another mode of divesting oneself of the vow, see I, 1, 1, 3.

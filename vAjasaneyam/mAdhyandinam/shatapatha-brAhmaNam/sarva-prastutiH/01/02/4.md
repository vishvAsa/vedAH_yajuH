1. When Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, that hurled one became fourfold. Of (three parts of) it the wooden sword (sphya) represents one-third or thereabouts, the sacrificial post one-third or thereabouts, and the chariot one-third or thereabouts. That piece, moreover, with which he struck him, was broken off (śr̥); and on falling down it became an arrow (śara): hence the designation arrow, because it was broken off. And in this way the thunderbolt became fourfold.

In consequence of this, the priests make use of two (of these pieces) at the sacrifice, and men of the military caste (rājanyabandhu) also make use of two of them in battle: viz. the priests make use of the sacrificial post and the wooden sword, and the men of the military caste of the chariot and the arrow.

4. He takes it, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 24): 'At the impulse of the divine Savitr̥, I take thee with

the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pūshan; thee that performs sacred rites to the gods!' Savitr̥, namely, is the impeller of the gods: thus he thereby takes that (wooden sword) as one impelled by Savitr̥. 'With the arms of the Aśvins,' he says, because the Aśvins are the two Adhvaryu priests (of the gods): with their arms he therefore takes it, not with his own. Pūshan is distributer of portions (to the gods): with his hands he therefore takes it, not with his own; for it is the thunderbolt, and no man can hold that: he thus takes it with (the assistance of) the gods.

[^egg_183]: 54:2 I.e. 'from the sacrificial ground,' Sāyaṇa. It seems doubtful to me whether it does not rather mean 'you will then shut them in, or block them up, within that place,' that is to say, north of the altar, where the utkara, or heap of rubbish, lies. The four worlds by which he puts down the enemies are represented by the loose soil which is dug up by the sphya being flung four separate times at the grass-bush lying on the altar (vedi), and which is then thrown on the utkara.

[^egg_184]: 55:1 The ceremony called stambayajus (-haraṇam) consists in 'the throwing away of the grass-bush after cutting it by the (flinging of the) wooden sword, with the simultaneous reciting of Yajus-texts' [yajurmantrako darbhaḥ stambayajuḥ, tacca stambarūpaṁ sphyena bhittvotkaradeśe haret, Sāy., Taitt.

[^egg_185]: 55:2 This passage, in which the author seems to argue against some other ritualistic authority, is not quite clear to me. The Taitt. Br. has, 'from the atmosphere he drives him away (by the second throw), from the sky he drives him away (by the third throw).'

Wherever, in digging into her, they wound and injure her--water being (a means of) expiation--that he thereby expiates by the water which is (a means of) expiation; that he thereby makes good by means of the water: that is the reason why he says: 'May the sky rain on thee!'--'Tie him down, O divine Savitr̥, to the furthest end of the earth!' he says (whilst throwing on the heap of rubbish the soil dug up); he thus

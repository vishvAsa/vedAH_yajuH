1. He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hotr̥) [^egg_329]. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu's) call is

[^egg_329]: 131:2 The Hotr̥, on concluding the invitation of the gods, sits down with raised knees in the same place where he has been standing (see p. 95, note 1), parts the sacrificial grass of the altar, and measures a span on the earth, with the text (Āśv. I, 3, 22), 'Aditi is his mother, do not cut him off from the air. With the aid of  Agni, the god, the deity; with the threefold chant, with the rāthantara-sāman, with the gāyatrī metre, with the agnishṭoma sacrifice, with the vashaṭ-call, the thunderbolt,--I here kill him who hates us, and whom we hate!' The Adhvaryu having thereupon walked round the Hotr̥ from left to right, steps behind the utkara (heap of rubbish) with his face to the east and the fuel-band in his hand, and calls on (āśrāvayati) the Āgnīdhra, with Õ śrāvaya (or Õṁ śrāvaya, i.e. ā śrāvaya; or simply śrāvaya;' cf. Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11). The Āgnīdhra (whilst standing north of the Adhvaryu, with his face to the south, and taking the wooden sword and the fuel-band from the Adhvaryu) responds (pratyāśrāvayati) by 'astu śraushaṭ.'

the sacrifice: 'having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hotr̥,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.

3. Here now some utter the call after taking sacrificial grass (barhis) from the covered altar, or they utter the call after cutting off and taking a chip of fire-wood, arguing, 'this, surely, is something belonging to the sacrifice; after taking hold of this, the sacrifice, we will utter the call.' Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the firewood was tied together and wherewith they sweep the fire [^egg_330] is, doubtless, something belonging to the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking hold of the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the fuel-band.

[^egg_338]: 136:4 The six spaces or wide expanses (urvī) are several times referred to in Vedic texts, but the conception seems to have been very vague.

In Rig-veda VI, 47, 3-5 it is stated that they have been measured out  by Indra, and that outside of them there is no being (bhuvanam); and they are then enumerated thus: the expanse of the earth, the height (varshman,? highest point or sphere) of the sky (div), the sap (pīyūsha) in the three elevations [? i.e. flowing, animating moisture, as rain, rivers, sap, &c.], the atmosphere, the ocean (? arṇas,? of light, air), and the sky (div). The enumeration of six objects in Atharva-veda II, 12, 1 seems to refer to the same conception: heaven and earth (dyāvāpr̥thivī), the wide atmospheric region, the genius (fem.) of the field (kshetrasya patnī), the far-strider (Sun, Light), the wide atmospheric region (uru-antariksham as before; cf. the double enumeration of div in the R̥k passage); and what has the Wind for its guardian (vātagopa).

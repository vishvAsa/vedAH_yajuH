1. Now by means of the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven. But the god who rules over

the cattle was left behind here: hence they call him Vāstavya, for he was then left behind on the (sacrificial) site [^egg_456] (vāstu).

[^egg_456]: 200:1 Or perhaps, he was left behind with, or in, the remains (of the sacrifice);' vāstu being evidently also taken in this sense by our author, in par. 7.

3. He saw (what occurred, and said), 'I have been left behind: they are excluding me from the sacrifice!' He went up after them, and with his raised (weapon) [^egg_457] rose up on the north--the time (when this happened) was that of the (performance of the) Svishṭakr̥t.

[^egg_457]: 200:2 The text has ayatayā merely, which, to become intelligible, clearly requires some noun, which may have been lost here. Sāyaṇa is silent on this point. In Dr. Muir's version of the legend, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 202, the word is left untranslated. I am inclined to supply some such noun as heti, 'weapon;' cf. XII, 7, 3, 20, where this very word is used in connection with Rudra: in later times it is also specially applied to Agni's weapon or flame (jihvā, 'tongue'). It is not impossible, however, that we have to supply tanvā ('with his raised body, or self'). To mā vi srākshīḥ (for which the Kāṇva recension reads mā ’sthāḥ), 'do not hurl,' and to saṁvivarha ('he drew back'), Sāyaṇa supplies yajñam, 'sacrifice:' hence he apparently takes it thus,--'do not scatter (the sacrifice),'--'he kept (the sacrifice) together and did not injure it in any way.'

7. The Adhvaryu accordingly sprinkled the sacrificial dishes in proper succession, and replenished them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and again rendered them fit for use, and cut off one portion for each. This then is the reason why he (Rudra) is called Vāstavya [^egg_458], for a remainder (vāstu) is that part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have been made: hence, if sacrificial food is offered to any deity, the Svishṭakr̥t (Agni, 'the maker of good offering') is afterwards invariably offered a share of it; because the gods invariably gave him a share after themselves.

8. That (offering) then is certainly made to 'Agni,' for, indeed, Agni is that god;--his are these names: Śarva, as the eastern people call him; Bhava, as the Bāhīkas (call him); Paśūnām pati ('lord of beasts,' Paśupati), Rudra, Agni [^egg_459]. The name Agni, doubtless, is the most auspicious

[^egg_459]: 201:2 Passages such as this and VI, 1, 3, 7 seq. are of considerable interest, as showing, on the one hand, the tendency towards identifying and blending originally distinct and apparently local Vedic gods, especially Rudra, with the person of Agni, the representative of the divine power on earth in the later Vedic triad; and, on the other hand, the origin of the conception of Siva, in the pantheistic system of the post-Vedic period. On our passage, see also Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 37; I, p. 189; Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 328.

10. Having recited the invitatory formula [^egg_461], he (the Hotr̥) enumerates (those deities) which (have received oblations at the fore-offerings, butter-portions, &c.), as well as Agni Svishṭakr̥t:--'May Agni offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni's butter-portion [^egg_462]. 'May he offer Soma's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Soma's butter-portion.--'May he offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to that indispensable cake for Agni which is (offered) on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).

[^egg_461]: 202:2 The anuvākyā for the Svishṭakr̥t is Rig-veda X, 2, 1: piprīhi devān̐ uśato yavishṭḥa ('gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!') &c. Āśv. S. I, 6, 2.

The yājyā proper, however, which they precede is Rig-veda VI, 15, 14, agne yad adya viśo adhvarasya hotaḥ ['O Agni, Hotr̥ of the cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men '], &c.

favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni as Hotr̥; for after the gods had set apart this oblation for him, they still further propitiated him by this (formula), and invited him to his favourite dainty [^egg_463]: this is the reason why he thus enumerates.

16. The reason why on this occasion the invitatory and offering-formulas are made closely to correspond to each other (avakliptatama), is that the svishṭakr̥t (is equivalent to) the evening libation, and the evening libation, doubtless, belongs to the Viśve Devāḥ (the 'All-gods ) [^egg_468]. 'Gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!' this much in the invitatory formula refers to the Viśve Devāḥ [^egg_469]. 'O Agni, Hotr̥ of the cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men [^egg_470];' this much in the offering-formula refers to the Viśve Devāḥ. And because such is the form of these two (formulas), therefore they are of

[^egg_468]: 204:3 See Vāj. S. XIX, 26. Here the author, as usual (cf. p. 5 note), attempts to enhance the solemnity of the ceremony by identifying it with the tr̥tīya-savana, or evening libation at the Soma-sacrifice, both offerings constituting the final ceremonies in the main performance of the respective sacrifices. We shall, however, see (cf. I, 8, 3, 25) that as at the evening libation the remains of the Soma are offered up, so also are the remains of havis offered to the viśve devāḥ at the conclusion of the present sacrifice. At IV, 4, 5, 17 it is more especially the offering of rice-cake to Agni and Varuṇa, at the evening libation, which is identified with the svishṭakr̥t.

17. They are both trishṭubh verses; for the svishṭakr̥t is, as it were, the residue (or site, vāstu) of the sacrifice, and the residue (or, a vacant site) is without energy [^egg_471]. Now the trishṭubh means manly power [^egg_472], energy: hence he thereby imparts manly power, energy to that residue, the svishṭakr̥t. This is why they are both trishṭubh verses.

[^egg_471]: 205:1 Avīryam; cf. II, 1, 2, 9, where the (śarīra) empty body (of Prajāpati) is called a vāstu ayajñiyam avīryam. See also above, I, 7, 3, 7, where we met with vāstu in the sense of 'remainder, that which remains,' as Sāyaṇa also seems to take it here.

[^egg_472]: 205:2 Indriyam, literally 'Indra's power.' The trishṭubh often (ej. Rig-veda X, 130, 5) appears specially related to Indra; and the hymns addressed to him are almost entirely in this metre. Taitt. S. VII, 1, 1, 4 it is said to have been created by Prajāpati from his own chest and arms, immediately after Indra, and together with the Br̥hat-sāman, the Rājanya, and the ram; and that these are therefore vīryāvant, having been created out of vīrya (i.e. the seats of 'manly power').

And, verily, one who knows this, and whose (invitatory and offering-formulas) are two anushṭubh verses, his homestead (vāstu) is prosperous, and he himself prospers in regard to progeny and cattle.

[^egg_473]: 205:3 For this symbolical explanation see Taitt. S.

He cuts (the portions for Agni Svishṭakr̥t) from the north part (of the sacrificial dishes) [^egg_475], and offers them up on the north part (of the fire): for this is the region of that god, and therefore he cuts from the north part and offers on the north part. From that side, indeed, he arose [^egg_476], and there they (the gods) appeased him: for this reason he cuts from the north part, and offers on the north part.

[^egg_475]: 206:2 He makes, as usual, an under-layer (upastaraṇa) of butter in the juhū; cuts a piece from the north part of each of the two cakes (or of the one cake and of both the sweet and the sour milk constituting the sānnāyya); and thereupon bastes the pieces twice (not once) with butter.

[^egg_476]: 206:3 See above, par. 3. The same quarter is assigned to Rudra, IX, 1, 1, 10. See also Weber, Ind. Stud, I, p. 225.

21. He offers on this side (in front), as it were, of the other oblations. Following the other oblations cattle are produced, and the Svishṭakr̥t represents Rudra's power: he would impose Rudra's power on

the cattle if he were to bring it (the Svishṭakr̥t) into contact with the other oblations; and his (the sacrificer's) household and cattle would be destroyed. For this reason he offers on this side, as it were, of the other oblations.

22. That (fire)---to wit, the Āhavanīya--is, indeed, that sacrifice by which the gods then ascended to heaven; and that (other fire) which was left behind here, is the Gārhapatya: hence they take out the former from the Gārhapatya, (so as to be) before (east) of it.

[^egg_477]: 207:1 The Baudhāy. Śulvas. (66) lays it down as the rule that the Brāhmaṇa has to construct his Āhavanīya fire at the distance of eight prakramas (step of two padas or feet each) to the east of the Gārhapatya, the Rājanya at the distance of eleven, and the Vaiśya at the distance of twelve, steps.

Here, however, there is no (fixed) measure: let him, therefore, lay it down where in his own mind he may think proper [^egg_478]. If he takes it ever so little east (of the Gārhapatya), he ascends to heaven by it.

26. Here now they say, 'Let them cook the sacrificial

dishes on the Āhavanīya; for thence, assuredly, the gods ascended to heaven, and therewith they went on worshipping and toiling: therein we will cook the sacrificial dishes; therein we will perform the sacrifice! For, as it were, a displacement [^egg_479] of the sacrificial dishes would take place, if they were to cook them on the Gārhapatya. The Āhavanīya is the sacrifice: we will perform the sacrifice in the sacrifice!'

[^egg_479]: 208:1 Apaskhala. Sāyaṇa takes skhala to mean winnowing- (or threshing-) floor (? khala): hence apaskhala would mean 'the leaping (of the husk, &c.) out of the winnowing-floor.' The Kāṇva MS. reads, 'apaskhala iva sa havishāṁ yad gārhapatyaḥ' (? 'the Gārhapatya is to the sacrificial food the outside of a winnowing-floor, as it were.')

27. However, they also do cook on the Gārhapatya, arguing, 'The former is indeed āhavanīya (i.e. "suitable for a burnt-offering"); but that one, surely, is not (intended) for this,--viz. that they should cook uncooked (food) on it; but it is (intended) for this,--viz. that they should offer up cooked (food) on it.' He may therefore do it on whichever (fire) he pleases.

'I dread thirst.' 'How art thou to be satiated?' 'May I satiate myself after the priest has been satisfied!' Let him therefore, on the completion of the sacrifice, order that the priest be satisfied; for then he satisfies the sacrifice.

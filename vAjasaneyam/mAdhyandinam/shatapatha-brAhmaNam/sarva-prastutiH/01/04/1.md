1. He recites after uttering (the syllable) 'Hiṅ!' Sacrifice, they say, is not (performed) without the Sāman; and neither is the Sāman chanted without 'Hiṅ' having been uttered. By his uttering 'Hiṅ!' the peculiar nature (rūpam) of the word 'Hiṅ' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the Sāman. By uttering 'Om! Om [^egg_275]!' this his entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the Sāman.

[^egg_275]: 100:1 That is, by uttering 'Om!' after each verse. The recitation of the first verse is preceded by the mystic words 'Hiṅ bhūr bhuvaḥ svar om!' Āśv. Ś. I, 2, 3. Both syllables 'hiṅ' and 'om' are essential elements in the recitation of Sāman hymns, See II, 2, 4, 11 seq.

2. And (another reason) why he utters 'Hiṅ!' is this. The word 'Hiṅ' means breath, for the word Hiṅ' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore pronounce the word 'Hiṅ,' when he closes his nostrils. The r̥c (verse) he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a productive union of the sāmidhenīs is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hiṅ!'

3. He utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice. Were he, on the contrary, to pronounce 'Hiṅ' aloud, he would make 'voice' of both the one and the other: for this reason he utters the word 'Hiṅ' in a low voice.

4. He recites with 'ā (hither)!' and 'pra (forth or thither) [^egg_276]!' He thereby joins a gāyatrī verse directed hitherward to one directed away from here: the one which tends from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and the one which tends hitherward pleases the men. For this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'

[^egg_276]: 101:1 The particles pra and ā were apparently used in phrases wishing one a safe journey and return (cf. Ait. Br. 3, 26, with Haug's note). The first sāmidhenī begins, 'prá vo vā´gā abhídyavaḥ' (forth go your viands, heavenward); and the second 'ágna ā´ yāhi vītáye' (come hither, Agni, to the feast!). It is from these verses that the above symbolical explanation is derived. Cf. Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3 [prācīnaṁ reto dhīyate--pratīcīḥ prajā jāyante].

5. And (another reason) why he recites with 'ā' and 'pra,' is this. 'Pra (forth)' clearly means out-breathing, and 'ā (hither)' means in-breathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing (for the sacrificer). For this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'

6. Yet (other reasons) why he recites with 'hither (ā)' and 'thither (pra),' are these. 'Thither' the seed is cast, and 'hither' birth takes place. 'Thither' the cattle disperse (for grazing), 'hither' they return. Indeed, everything here (moves) 'hither' and 'thither:' for this reason he recites with 'ā' and 'pra.'

7. He recites [^egg_277], 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!'--

[^egg_277]: 102:1 The following is a connected translation (as literal as possible, if not elegant) of the eleven sāmidhenīs, or kindling verses, in the same octosyllabic metre as the original. The first and eleventh verses are recited three times; and when at the end of each verse the Hotr̥ pronounces the syllable oṁ, the Adhvaryu throws a stick (samidh) into the fire,--up to the eighth verse, at the end of which the tenth stick is thrown in. At the end of the ninth verse five of the remaining six sticks are thrown into the fire. The throwing of the first stick is accompanied by the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (tyāga), 'For Agni this, not for me!'

hereby, then, the 'thither' is (realised). And (in the second verse), 'Come hither, Agni, to expand [^egg_278]!'--by this, on the other hand, the 'hither' is (realised).

8. Now, in reference to this point, some people say, 'Both these (texts) surely result in a "thither [^egg_279]."' This, however, is beyond the ordinary understanding: the text, 'forth go your viands, heavenward!' is clearly (directed) away from (the sacrificer); and the text, 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' is (directed) towards (him).

9. He recites (the first kindling verse), 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!' this, then, tends in a forward direction. 'Viands' (vāja) [^egg_280] he says, because viands mean food: hence food is obtained (for the sacrificer) by this recitation. 'Heavenward' he says, because those that tend heavenward are the half-moons:

[^egg_280]: 103:3 In the Taitt. S. II, 5, 7, 3-4 also vāja is in the first place rendered by 'food,' while afterwards it is identified with the months (i.e. the coursers? gamanaśīla, Sāy.); as abhidyavaḥ (in the sense of 'shining in both directions,' i.e. in the form of the waxing and waning moon, Sāy.) is referred to the half-moons.

it is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation. 'In havis rich' he further says, because those that are rich in havis (milk, butter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby obtains through the recitation.

10. 'With buttered (spoon)--' he adds. Now Māthava, the (king of) Videgha [^egg_281], carried Agni Vaiśvānara in his mouth. The R̥shi Gotama Rāhūgaṇa was his family priest. When addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.

[^egg_281]: 104:1 To this important legend attention was first drawn by Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 170 seq. (cf. also Ind. Streifen, I, p. 13; J. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, II, p. 402). It was pointed out by Weber that this legend distinguishes three successive stages of the eastward migration of the Brāhmanical Hindus. In the first place the settlements of the Āryans had already been extended from the Pañjab (where they were settled in the times of the hymns of the Rig-veda) as far as the Sarasvatī. They thence pushed forward, led by the Videgha Māthava and his priest, according to our legend, as far east as the river Sadānīrā (that is, 'she that is always filled with water'), which, according to Sāyaṇa, is another name for the Karatoyā (the modern Kurattee, on which Bograh lies), which formed the eastern boundary of the Videhas; or more probably the Gaṇḍakī (the modern Gunduck, a noble river which falls into the Ganges opposite Patna, and) which formed the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas (cf. par. 17). It would appear from our legend, that for some time the Aryans did not venture to cross this river; but at the time of the author the country to the east of it had long been occupied by them. Sāyaṇa takes the hero of the legend to be Videgha, the Mādhava or son of Madhu; but Videgha, an older form of Videha, is more probably intended here (as Weber takes it) for the name of that people and country (corresponding to the modern Tirhut). The Agni Vaiśvānara (or Agni who is common to all men) of our legend Professor Weber considers a personification of Brāhmanical worship and civilisation and the destructive effects of their extension.

[^egg_284]: 106:2 Jigāti is taken by Sāyaṇa in the sense of 'he sings, praises.' Our author, on the other hand, seems to interpret it by 'he conquers (ji);' see, however, next note.

[^egg_285]: 106:3 The text has, 'Sa hi devān jigīshati sa hi devān jigāṁsati.' The Kāṇva recension has the same reading, except that it omits 'hi'  in both cases. Instead of jigāṁsati, however, some MSS., as well as Sāyaṇa, read jighāṁsati ('he wishes to conquer, or beat, the gods'), probably an old corruption, easily accounted for by the circumstance that jigishati is the regular desiderative of ji, 'to conquer,' though it also occurs in some passages as the desiderative of gā, 'to go.' Sāyaṇa, however, though he reads jighāṁsati, here allows to the root han (with Naigh. 2, 14) the meaning of 'to go.' Cf. Weber, Omina and Portenta, p. 406, note 4.

This, however, he should not do; for by (doing) so they do at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is inauspicious at a sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the R̥k, 'for Hotr̥, the all-knowing, him!' [He continues], 'Performing well this sacrifice!' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'performing well this sacrifice.' She (gāyatrī, or the earth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were victorious and the Asuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse), is himself victorious and his adversaries are defeated.

[^egg_297]: 111:2 That is to say, instead of 'Hotāraṁ viśvavedasam,' they recite 'Hotā yo viśvavedasaḥ;' for the reason that Hotāram (accusative of hotr̥) might be understood to be 'hotā aram,' aram, 'enough,' being a particle implying a prohibition.

Here now some people place the two (dhāyyās) additional kindling verses before (the eighth sāmidhenī), arguing, 'The two dhāyyās [^egg_298] mean food: this edible food we place in front (or, in the mouth, mukhataḥ).' But let him not do this: for with him who inserts the additional verses before (the eighth), the latter (the eighth) is clearly out of its place [^egg_299], since in that case it (and the succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With him, on the other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling verse), it is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two additional verses after (the ninth).

[^egg_298]: 112:1 Whenever thirteen kindling verses are recited instead of eleven (or counting the repetitions of the first and last verses, seventeen instead of fifteen), the two verses Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6 are inserted according to our author after the ninth, and according to others before the eighth, sāmidhenī. They are called dhāyyā, probably derived from dhā, 'to put, add,' whilst those ritualists whose practice is here rejected apparently connect the word with the root dhā (dhe), 'to suck.'

[^egg_299]: 112:2 According to Sāyaṇa, because it no longer occupies the eighth place for which it is specially appropriate on account of its being, according to our author, 'peculiarly a gāyatrī (eight-syllabled) verse.' This reasoning is far from satisfactory, since the two dhāyyās (Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6) are also gāyatrī verses.

40. This tristich, containing (the word) 'cult (adhvara),' he thus recites. For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhurv, dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them, they were

unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called adhvara ('not damaged, uninterrupted'); and for whomsoever, that knows this, they recite this tristich containing (the word) adhvara ('cult, sacrifice'), his rival, though desirous of injuring him, is foiled; and he, (the sacrificer), moreover, gains as much as one gains by offering a Soma-sacrifice [^egg_301].

[^egg_301]: 114:1 Saumya adhvara is the common designation of the solemn Soma-sacrifice; hence, our author argues, the word adhvara is here used for sacrifice (yajña) with a view to insure to this offering the efficacy of a Soma-sacrifice.

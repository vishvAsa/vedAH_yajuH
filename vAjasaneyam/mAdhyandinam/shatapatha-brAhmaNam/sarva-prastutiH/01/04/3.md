2. And in like manner as the fire blazes when kindled by means of the kindling verses, so also blazes the priest (brāhmaṇa) that knows and recites the kindling verses; for, indeed, he is unassailable, unapproachable.

3. He recites, 'Pra vaḥ [^egg_313];' for the (word) prāṇa contains the syllable pra ('forwards;' or, is directed forwards):. hence it is the prāṇa (out-breathing) which he kindles by this (the first sāmidhenī). [He further recites the second verse], 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' the backward breathing (apāna) [^egg_314], doubtless, is of this nature: the backward breathing he accordingly kindles with this (verse). Further (in the third verse), 'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!' the high-flaming one [^egg_315], indeed, is the upward breathing (udāna): the upward

[^egg_313]: 120:1 The first two words of the first sāmidhenī, cf. p. 101 note. A mystic meaning is obtained for them by our author combining them and identifying the form obtained with the adjective pravant, meaning both 'containing the syllable pra' and 'directed forwards,' both of which meanings apply to the breathing-forth or expiration (prāṇa, cf. I, 1, 3, 2).

4. Further, 'Sa naḥ pr̥thu śravāyyam [^egg_316],' the 'far-hearing one,' indeed, is the ear, for it is with the ear that one hears here far or widely: the ear he accordingly kindles with this (the fourth verse).

[^egg_316]: 121:1 'That (region) wide and glorious' (do thou obtain for us); but the author takes pr̥thu śravāyyam as 'that widely hearing one' or 'the wide hearing.' Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8, interprets it by 'that (holy work) which is extended and worthy of being heard by the gods.'

8. Further, 'Agni we choose for messenger,'--what central breath there is (in the body), that he kindles with this (the eighth verse): that one indeed is the internal motive force of the breathings; from it (two) others tend upwards, and from it (two) others tend downwards, for it is indeed the internal motive force. And whosoever knows that internal motive force of the breathings, him they regard as the internal motive force.

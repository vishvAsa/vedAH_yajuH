1. Now in former times the gods appointed Agni to the chief (office), namely, that of Hotr̥; and having appointed him to the chief (office) saying 'do thou carry this our oblation!' they cheered him up, saying, 'Surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour, even as in our own days, when they appoint any one from among their kinsmen to the chief (office), they cheer him up saying 'surely, thou art vigorous; surely, thou art equal to this!' thereby endowing him with vigour. By what, therefore, he recites after this, he eulogizes him, puts vigour into him [^egg_302].

[^egg_302]: 114:2 The invocations he now proceeds to recite, on the termination of the sāmidhenīs or kindling verses, belong to the class of formulas called nigada. In the present case, they consist of the pravara mantra--or formula by which Agni is invited to assist the sacrificer as Hotr̥ or Invoker on the present occasion, as he has of old assisted his ancestors (cf. the following note)--and of short detached formulas called nivid. Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8.

2. 'O Agni, thou art great! O priest (brāhmaṇa), O Bhārata!' for Agni, indeed, is the brahman

 (sacerdotium): therefore he says 'O Brāhmaṇa!--O Bhārata' he says, because he (Agni) bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods: therefore they say 'Agni is bhārata (the bearer).' Or, he, being the breath, sustains (bhar) these creatures: therefore he says 'O Bhārata (sustainer)!'

3. He now calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hotr̥ priest) [^egg_303]. He thereby introduces him both to the R̥shis and to the gods (as if he were to say), 'Of great vigour is he who has obtained the sacrifice!' This is the reason why he calls on (Agni as) the ancestral (Hotr̥).

[^egg_303]: 115:1 Ārsheyam pravr̥nīte, literally 'he chooses the ancestral' (r̥shi). I take 'ārsheyam' as a masculine adjective qualifying a supplied '(Agniṁ) hotāram.' In this way the formula is explained by Sāyaṇa on I, 5, 1, 9 (r̥shīṇāṁ sambandhinam adhvaryur hotāraṁ vr̥ṇīte), and this seems to me the most natural interpretation. It is true, however, that, as the formula ('he chooses the ancestral') became stereotyped, its exact import became forgotten, and ārsheya was generally taken as a neuter, either adjective (viz. 'nāmadheyam,' 'apatyam') or noun (ancestral lineage). Agni is invoked as the one who has of old officiated as the Hotr̥ of the sacrificer's ancestors, three or five ancestral names being usually mentioned: thus, in the case of a sacrificer belonging to the Jāmadagna Vatsa family, claiming Bhr̥gu, Cyavana, Apnavāna, Aurva, and Jamadagni as its founders, Agni is invoked, on the present occasion, as 'Bhargava Cyavana Āpnavāna Aurva Jāmadagna!' (Āśval. Sr. 12, 10, 6; Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8). If the sacrificer belongs to the Kshatriya or Vaiśya castes, the priest substitutes for the sacrificer's ancestors those of his family priest (purohita) or his spiritual guide (guru); and in the case of kings the same course was adopted, or the names of their royal r̥shi ancestors (rājarshi) were chosen. As to the second pravara, or the election of the human Hotr̥, for the present sacrifice, see I, 5, 1, 1. Cf. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 386 seq.; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 325 seq.; X, 78 seq.; M. Haug, Aitar. Br., Translation, p. 479.

4. He calls from the remote end (of the sacrificer's

ancestral line) downwards; for it is from the remote end downwards that a race is propagated. He (the Hotr̥) also thereby propitiates the lord of seniority for him (the Sacrificer); for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he calls from the remote end downwards.

Previously to these an upāṁśuyāja or 'low-voiced oblation' is made by some to Agni-Soma at the full moon, and one to Vishṇu (or to Agni-Soma) at the new-moon sacrifice; according to others also one to Prajāpati,--the names of the gods being whispered in the respective formulas.

bring hither his own greatness; his own greatness, in truth, is his voice: hence he says it in order that he may bring hither his voice [^egg_310].--'Bring thou hither (the gods), O Jātavedas [^egg_311], and offer up a good offering!' what deities he bids him bring hither, with regard to those (deities) he thereby says 'bring them hither!' When he says, 'offer up a good offering!' he means to say, 'sacrifice in the proper order!'

[^egg_310]: 119:1 Sāyaṇa on Taitt. S. II, 5, 9 explains the formula 'Bring hither the own greatness' by 'bring hither whatever greatness or power is peculiar to each of the havis-eating gods,' and he remarks expressly that it is not to be referred to Agni, as our author certainly appears to do. Cf. I, 7, 3, 13.

[^egg_311]: 119:2 Jatavedas probably means 'he who knoweth (all) beings,' but it is more generally explained by 'he who possesseth riches (or wisdom),' not to mention other interpretations. According to Haug, Ait. Br. vol. ii. p. 224, the proper meaning of the term is 'having possession of all that is born, i.e. pervading it.' He further mentions that the R̥shis are quite familiar with the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power; and that by Gātavedas the 'animal fire' is particularly to be understood. Our present formula 'ā ca vaha jātavedaḥ suyajā ca yaja' somewhat differs from the corresponding formula of the Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5, 'ā cāgne devān vaha suyajā ca yaja jātavedaḥ.'

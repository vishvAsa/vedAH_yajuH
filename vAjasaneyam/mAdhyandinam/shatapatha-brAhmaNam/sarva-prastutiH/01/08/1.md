4. It soon became a jḥasha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish) [^egg_505]. Thereupon it said, 'In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou

[^egg_505]: 216:3 ? Saśvad dha jḥasha āsa, sa hi jyeshṭḥaṁ vardhate ’thetithīṁ samāṁ tad augha āgantā. 'Bald war er ein Grossfisch (jḥasha), denn er wuchs gewaltig,' Weber. 'He became soon a large fish. He said to Manu, "When I am full-grown, in the same year the flood will come,"' Max Müller. 'Straightway he became a large fish; for he waxes to the utmost,' Muir. Perhaps jḥasha is here intended for the name of some fabulous horned fish (cf. śr̥ṅgi, śr̥ṅgī). In the Black Yajur-veda (Taitt. S. I, 7, 1; II, 6, 7) the  iḍā is represented as a cow, produced by Mitra and Varuṇa (see below, par. 24). Perhaps it was this version and the symbolical representation of the iḍā as meaning cattle, which suggested the notion of a horned fish, in adapting an older legend.

shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship [^egg_506]; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'

[^egg_506]: 217:1 I adopt here, though not without hesitation, the interpretation proposed in the St. Petersb. Dict. (s.v. upa-ās), which the separation of mām from the verb favours. Professor Max Müller translates: 'Build a ship then, and worship me.' Dr. Muir: 'Thou shalt, therefore, construct a ship, and resort to me.' The Mahābhārata has: 'When standing on the ship, thou shalt look out for me: I shall be recognisable (by my being) furnished with a horn,' which, after all, may furnish the correct explanation of our passage.

5. After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he [^egg_507] passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.

[^egg_507]: 217:2 Or, 'it,' that is, either the ship, or the fish. That abhi-dudrāva, the reading of the Kāṇva school, is the right one, seems to follow from the next paragraph. Professor Weber's edition has ati-dudrāva, as read by his best MS., 'it (or he) sailed across the mountain.' The reading of the other MSS. adhi-dudrāva must be a clerical error, most likely for abhi-dudrāva. Professor Müller translates: 'The fish carried him by it over the northern mountain.' Dr. Muir: 'By this means he passed over (or, he hastened to) this northern mountain.'

[^egg_509]: 218:1 According to the version of the Mahābhārata, 'the peak of the Himālaya to which the ship was tied, was afterwards called naubandhana, 'the tying of the ship.' Professor Weber also draws attention to Ath.-veda XIX, 39, 8, where the term nāvaprabhraṁśana or 'gliding down of the ship' is used in connection with the summit of the Himavat.

7. Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a pāka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid [^egg_510] she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuṇa met her.

The five cuttings of the iḍā consist of the upastaraṇa, or underlayer of butter in the iḍāpātrī; of two cuttings of each of the havis (or dishes of sacrificial food) from their southern and central parts respectively; and of two drippings (or bastings, abhighāraṇa) of butter, as in the case of the svishṭakr̥t (see Kāty.

In thus calling her (the Iḍā) to him, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants [^egg_522].

[^egg_520]: 222:1 There are considerable differences between the text of, the Hotr̥'s call to the iḍā as here given and that given in Āśv. Ś. I, 7, 7. The text of the Black Yajur-veda (Taitt. Br. III, 5, 8; Taitt. S. II, 6, 7; I, 7, 1), on the other hand, only differs from ours in one or two points. According to Āśv. Ś. I, 5, 28, the calls are to be uttered in the highest pitch (cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 126, note).

The Grāvastut, another assistant of the Hotr̥, is often added as eighth Hotr̥. Cf. Haug, Ait. Br. II, p. 147. Instead of upahūtā saptahotrā in our text, the Kāṇva text and the Black Yajur-veda read upahūtāḥ saptahotrāḥ, 'called hither are the seven Hotr̥ships;' Āśval.

40. Now when he (the Hotr̥) intones (in a loud voice) [^egg_534], he (the Adhvaryu) divides the (Agni) cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis (the sacrificial grass covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the fathers; for there are four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate quarters represent the fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis [^egg_535].

[^egg_534]: 228:1 Viz. 'Iḍa is called hither!' see par. 24. According to Kāty. III, 4, 12, all (the other priests and the sacrificer, probably with the exception of the Brahman) touch the iḍā (or, according to Karka, they touch the Hotr̥ who holds the iḍā) whilst the invocation of the iḍā takes place. The quartering of the cake, according to ib. 13, is done with the text, 'Make swell, O ruddy one! milk me life; milk me offspring; milk me cattle; milk me brahmahood; milk me kshatriyahood; milk me people! Fatten through the progeny, through the cattle of him who hates us, whom we hate!'

[^egg_535]: 228:2 According to Kāty. III, 4, 14, the Adhvaryu puts the four parts on the barhis and assigns one to each priest. But according to the commentary and to other Sūtras, it is the sacrificer who allocates the portions by laying them down so as to correspond with the four intermediate regions, commencing in the south-east (or Agni's) region, and saying, 'This for the Brahman,' 'This for the Hotr̥,' 'This for the Adhvaryu,' 'This for the Agnīdh.' The sacrificer then shifts his Brāhmanical cord from the right to the left shoulder, and while touching the four portions, and looking towards the south (the region of the fathers), murmurs (Vāj. S. II, 31), 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither (āvr̥shāyadhvam) each to his own share!' He then quits his hold of the portions, and murmurs, 'The fathers have regaled themselves: like bulls they came each to his own share!' See Śat. Br. II, 4, 2, 20 seq.; Vāj. S. p. 57. [The Kāṇva text of the Brāhmaṇa does not mention the formulas here any more than does our author.] He then shifts the cord back on his left shoulder, touches water, and hands the portions to the priests for them to eat.

41. And when he recites, 'Hither are called heaven and earth,' he hands it (the shaḍavatta [^egg_536]) to the Āgnīdhra. The Āgnīdhra eats (the two pieces), with the respective texts (Vāj. S. II, 10-11), 'Hither is called mother Earth; may mother Earth call me to her! Agni (am I) by virtue of my Āgnīdhraship. Hail!' 'Hither is called father Heaven; may father Heaven call me to him! Agni (am I) by virtue of my Āgnīdhraship. Hail!' He, the Āgnīdhra, truly is the representative of heaven and earth, and therefore he eats (the shaḍavatta) in this manner.

[^egg_536]: 229:1 Kāty. Śr. III, 4, 19. There is some uncertainty as to the particular time when the Adhvaryu cuts the shaḍavatta; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 123. Mahīdhara on Vāj. S. II, 10 remarks: When the Hotr̥ pronounces the call to heaven and earth, then he (the Adhvaryu), having put one piece of each of the two cakes in (the two bowls of) the Shaḍavatta (vessel), gives it to the Agnīdh; and the latter eats it with the formulas 'Hither is called (the mother Earth),' &c. The 'six cuttings' of the Shaḍavatta consist of a piece of the Agni cake with an 'underlayer' and a dripping of butter for each of the two bowls of the Shaḍavatta dish.

42. And when (the Hotr̥) pronounces the benediction [^egg_537], then (the sacrificer) mutters (Vāj. S. II, 10 a), 'May Indra bestow on me that power of his! may abundant riches accrue to us! may there be blessings for us! may there be true blessings for us!' For indeed this is a receiving of blessings: hence what blessings the priests on this occasion invoke on him, those he thereby receives and makes his own.

[^egg_537]: 229:2 That is, the formula 'Hither is called the sacrificer,' see par. 29.

43. [On the conclusion of the invocation and the eating [^egg_538]] they cleanse themselves (with water poured)

[^egg_538]: 229:3 The priests eat first their quarter of the cake and then, with the sacrificer, their share of the iḍā. The Hotr̥ eats also the avāntareḍā, with the text (Āśv. Ś. I, 7, 8), 'O Iḍā, accept graciously our share!' &c.

through the two strainers (pavitra, 'purifier'). For they have now performed the iḍā, which represents the domestic offerings; and thinking, 'Purified by the purifiers we will now perform what part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished,' they cleanse themselves with the strainers.

44. He (the Adhvaryu) then throws the two strainers on the prastara [^egg_539]. The prastara, doubtless, represents the sacrificer, and the two strainers the out-breathing and in-breathing: hence he thereby invokes out-breathing and in-breathing on the sacrificer; and for this reason he throws the strainers on the prastara.

[^egg_539]: 230:1 See I, 3, 2, 5 seq. The Kāṇva text omits this paragraph.

1. He now separates the two spoons (juhū and upabhr̥t), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 15 a), 'May I be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.' With his right hand he moves the juhū eastwards (from its usual place on the prastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), 'May Agni and Soma drive him away who hates us, and whom

we hate! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I drive him away.' With his left hand he moves the upabhr̥t westwards (from its place on the barhis to outside the altar):--Thus, if the sacrificer himself (does it) [^egg_554].

[^egg_554]: 237:1 In Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9 a different symbolical explanation is given of the separation of the spoons: it is said there that by shifting the juhū eastwards, he drives away the enemies that have been born; and by shifting the upabhr̥t towards the west, he drives away those that will be born hereafter; and the sacrificer then stands firmly established in this world.

Thus he does at the full-moon sacrifice, because the full-moon offering belongs to Agni and Soma.

6. Thus the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one and the same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband), and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk (gātyāḥ) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, 'In the fourth (or) third man (I.e. generation) we unite [^egg_556].' And this is so in accordance with that (separation of the spoons).

[^egg_556]: 238:1 This passage is of considerable importance, as showing that the prohibition of intermarriage between near blood-relations,--so rigidly enforced in later times, and already formulated in passages such as Āpast. Dharm. II, 5, 15, 16, 'One must not give one's daughter to a man belonging to the same gotra. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the mother's (or father's) side.' Gobh. III, 4, 3-5, 'One must take for one's wife one who is not of the same gotra, or one who is not sapiṇḍa to one's mother,'--was not as yet firmly established in our author's time. Harisvāmin remarks on our text, that the Kāṇvas allow intermarriage in such cases from the third generation--(the Kāṇva text of the Śat. Br. reads, 'In the third man we unite, in the fourth man we unite')--and the Saurāshṭras from the fourth generation; and that the Dākshiṇātyas allow marriage with daughters of the mother's brother,  and with sons of the father's sister.

[He continues], '--for the proclamation of success [^egg_561],'--for on this the gods themselves are indeed intent, to wit, that they should speak what is favourable (conducive to success, sādhu), that they should do what is favourable: hence he says 'for the proclamation of success.'--'The human one is called upon for the song of praise (sūktavāka) [^egg_562]!' by these words he urges on this human Hotr̥ to singing praises.

[^egg_562]: 240:3 According to Kāty. III, 6, 1, and the other Sūtras, the Adhvaryu adds here sūktā brūhi, 'recite the praises (hymns)!' which Sāyaṇa on Taitt. Br. III, 6, 15 combines with the preceding sūktavākāya, and explains thus: 'hotā tvaṁ sūktasya vāko vacanaṁ yasya so ’yaṁ devaḥ sūktavākaḥ (? i.e. Agni, cf. Śat. Br.

12. Should he desire rain, let him take up (the prastara), with this text (Vāj. S. II, 16 d), 'Be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and earth!' for when heaven and earth are in harmony with each other, then indeed it rains [^egg_565]: for this reason he says, 'be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and earth!'--'May Mitra and Varuṇa favour thee with rain!' whereby he says, 'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Now he that rules over the rain is undoubtedly that blowing one (Vāyu, the wind); and he, it is true, blows as one only; but, on entering into man, he becomes a forward and a backward moving one; and they are these two, the out-breathing and the in-breathing. And Mitra and Varuṇa assuredly are the out-breathing and in-breathing; and hence he says by that (prayer), 'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Let him then take it up, with this text, for then the rain will at all times be propitious. He anoints it (the prastara): thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) an oblation, thinking, 'May he, as an oblation, go to the world of the gods!'

14. He anoints (each time), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 16 e), 'May (the gods) eat, licking the anointed bird [^egg_566]!' He thereby causes it (the prastara and hence symbolically the sacrificer) to be a bird and fly up from this world of men to the world of the gods. He then draws it twice (towards the Āhavanīya) alow (near the ground). The reason why he must draw it alow (is this): the prastara is the sacrificer; and in this way he does not remove him from this firm footing of his; and he, moreover, secures rain for this locality.

[^egg_566]: 242:1 Vyantu vayo ’ktaṁ rihāṇāḥ. Mahīdhara interprets it, 'May the birds (i.e. the metres) go (? to heaven,--taking and) licking the anointed (prastara).' The Kāṇvas read, 'vyantu vayo ripto rihāṇāḥ.' The Black Yajus (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 1) has 'aktaṁ rihāṇā viyantu vayaḥ, prajāṁ yoniṁ mā nirmr̥ksham, āpyāyantām āpa oshadhayaḥ,' which Sāyaṇa explains by 'May the birds having licked the anointed (top) go their several ways,' &c.; and the Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9, 3 remarks to viyantu vayaḥ, 'Having made him birds, he makes him go to the heavenly world.' According to Sāyaṇa, the three above formulas are by Āpastamba referred to the three acts of anointing, whereas the others, he says, divide the first formula into two, and use the second one (prajām, &c.) while the lower part of the prastara is anointed. See, however, Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 142, note 3.

[The Adhvaryu] having thrown it silently after, touches himself [^egg_570], with the text (Vāj. S. II, 16 f): 'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni; guard mine eye!' In this way also he does not throw himself into the fire after (the prastara or sacrificer).

[The Adhvaryu asks], 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnīdh?' whereby he says, 'Has he really gone?'--'He has gone!' replies the other.--'Bid (the gods) hear!' by these words he (the Adhvaryu) means to say, 'Make him (the sacrificer) be heard, make him be noticed by the gods!'--'May (one or they) hear (sraushaṭ)!' thereby he (the Āgnīdhra) means to say, 'They know him, they have recognised him.' Thus the Adhvaryu and the Āgnīdhra lead the sacrificer to the world of the gods.

For, assuredly, when any sacrificial food is taken without being announced to any one deity, then all the gods think that they have a share in it. Now when he takes that sacrificial food, the (residue of) butter, he does not announce it to any one deity; and hence he takes up (the two spoons) for the Viśve Devāḥ, and thus makes that (residue of butter) the vaiśvadeva [^egg_575] at the haviryajña.

 'The residue (of the butter) ye have for your share, ye, mighty by (this) food!' the residue, of course, is that which remains;--'O ye gods, staying on the prastara, and representing the enclosing-sticks [^egg_576];' for both the prastara and the enclosing-sticks have been thrown into the fire;--'All of you, applauding this speech,' thereby he makes it the vaiśvadeva (belonging to the Viśve Devāḥ);--'Be seated on this couch of grass (barhis) and enjoy yourselves!

[^egg_577]: 246:2 The original meaning of this sacrificial call, as of the apparently allied vashaṭ, vaushaṭ, appears to be, 'May he (Agni) carry it (the oblation to the deity)!' Cf. p. 88, note 2.

first uses them). Now, were he only to release (unyoke) either of them after putting it down, it would fall down just as a draught animal [^egg_580] (would, if made to lie down before being unyoked). At the Svishṭakr̥t these two undergo an unyoking: he then lays them down, and so unyokes them. He then yokes them again, at the after-offerings. Having performed the after-offerings, he effects another unyoking: he lays them down, and so unyokes them. Thereupon he yokes them again when he seizes them both at the same time; and when he has travelled over the way for which he has yoked them, he unyokes them. After the sacrifice offspring (is produced). Hence this man yokes (unites), and then unyokes, and again yokes them; and when he has travelled over the way for which he yoked them, he finally unyokes them. He lays (the spoons) down, with the text (Vāj. S. II, 19 a), 'Fond of butter are ye; protect the two yoke-fellows! gracious are ye: lead me to grace!' whereby he says, 'good are ye: lead me to goodness!'

[^egg_580]: 247:1 I adopt the interpretation of Harisvāmin, who translates avārcḥet by adhaḥ patet. The St. Petersb. Dict. apparently proposes, 'he would unharness them, as he would unharness a horse (or team).' According to Harisvāmin, the author here controverts the view of the Karakas (carakaśruti), who apparently taught that the (symbolical) unharnessing of the spoons should succeed their being laid down on the yoke; while our author maintains that the unharnessing should precede the laying down.

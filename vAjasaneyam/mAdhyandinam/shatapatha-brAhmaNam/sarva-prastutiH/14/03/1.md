1. Now, on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day [^egg_1292], having combined (the two performances of) the Pravargya and Upasads [^egg_1293], he 'sets out [^egg_1294]' the Pravargya, for set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the trunk). Having gathered together all around it [^egg_1295] (the Mahāvīra pot), they

[^egg_1292]: 493:2 That is, according to whether there are three, six, or twelve Upasad days to the particular form of Soma-sacrifice about to be performed. On each of these days there would be two performances of the Upasads,--and in case the Pravargya is to be performed--as many performances of that sacrifice.

[^egg_1293]: 493:3 On the day before the Soma-sacrifice, the two performances of the Pravargya and the Upasads are combined and gone through in the forenoon, instead of the forenoon and afternoon as is otherwise the case. Kāty. XXVI, 7, 1 does not refer to the performance of the Pravargya on this day, but merely remarks that 'at the end of the Upasads (i.e. of the combination of the Upasads, comm.) the removal of the Pravargya' takes place. Āpast. XV, 12, 4-6, on the other hand, states distinctly that the total number of performances of the Pravargya is to be double that of the Upasad days.

[^egg_1294]: 493:4 The 'setting out' (utsādana) of the Pravargya is the technical phrase for the removal and orderly laying out (in the form of a man) of the apparatus used for the Pravargya ceremony.

[^egg_1295]: 493:5 After collecting the implements they take them out of the śālā  and lay them down near the Antaḥpātya peg, at a few steps from the front door (whilst Āpast. makes them to be put on the throne-seat placed north of the Āhavanīya).

2. The Āgnīdhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the Āhavanīya, and kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it [^egg_1296] on a level with (the Sacrificer's) mouth. When the sacrifice had its head cut off its heat went out of it, and entered these worlds: it is with that heat he thus supplies and completes it.

[^egg_1296]: 494:1 According to the comm. on Kāty. XXVI, 7, 4, it is the Adhvaryu who--after ladling four times into the offering-spoon--distributes this ghee successively over the three bundles of sticks,--viz. pouring some upon the first two whilst they are held, at the specified height over the Āhavanīya fire, by the Agnīdh (who immediately after the offering throws them into the fire), and upon the third after it has been held knee-high by the Agnīdh, and then thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu. According to Āpastamba, who makes the Pratiprasthātr̥ and Adhvaryu the two performers, the third portion of the ghee is offered on the bundle of sticks whilst it is still held knee-high over the fire. As noted by Kātyāyana, the ceremony is analogous (though reversed as regards the order of height) to the offering on the three enclosing-stones at the Śatarudriya ceremony, IX, 1, 1, 5 seqq.

XV, 13, 4, the Pratiprasthātr̥ now leads the Sacrificer's wife within the enclosure; and whilst attendants carry away the objects not immediately connected with the Pravargya ceremony (post, peg, strings, sand, &c.), the Adhvaryu places the throne-seat (with the chief vessels) so as to stand with two feet on the Vedi, and with the other two outside it, and calls on the Prastotr̥ to sing the Sāman. This (as is usual in chanting) is done three times--the Adhvaryu, however, repeating his summons each time--and each time all of them (including the Patnī) sing or utter a special finale,--the first time in the śālā, the second time midway between the śālā and the Uttaravedi, and the third time when they have arrived behind the Uttaravedi; the finales corresponding to the formulas of this paragraph, viz.--'For the protection (or protector) of heaven (we follow) thee!'--'For the protection of the Brahman--thee!'--'For the protection of the self--thee!'

 (Vāj. S. XXXVIII, 19), 'Thee (we will follow) for the protection of the Kshatra,'--for he who shines yonder [^egg_1298] is indeed the divine ruler: 'for the protection of this human ruler,' he thereby means to say;--'guard thou the Brahman's body!'--that is to say, 'preserve thou the Brahman's person (ātman);'--'Thee (we will follow) as a stay for the Viś,'--the Viś (people, clan) doubtless is the sacrifice: 'for the safety of the sacrifice,' he thus means to say;--'we will follow to new prosperity,'--it is for the safety and the stability of the sacrifice that the says this.

navel) with its point towards the east: a belly he thus gives to it. On the two sides thereof the two milking-bowls (pinvana): two testicles he thereby gives to it, for by means of his testicles the male overflows (pinv). Behind (them he places) the post and peg: whereby he gives two thighs to it; behind (them) the two Rauhiṇa-plates, whereby he gives two knees to it; and as to their being single plates, it is because these knees consist, as it were, of single plates (bones). Behind (them) the two poking-sticks (dhr̥shṭi), whereby he gives two feet to it, for with the feet one strikes out boldly (dhr̥shṭam).

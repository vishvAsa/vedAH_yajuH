1. Now at the time when he there [^egg_1212] proceeds with the guest-meal, he who intends to perform the Pravargya, prior to the Upasads [^egg_1213], spreads Kuśa grass with its tops directed towards the east, in front of the Gārhapatya, and places the vessels thereon in pairs [^egg_1214],--the Upayamanī (tray) and the Mahāvīra (pot), the pair of lifting-sticks [^egg_1215], the

[^egg_1212]: 458:2 That is, at the Soma-sacrifice, of the preliminary day (upavasatha) of which the guest-meal to, or hospitable reception (ātithya) of, King Soma forms part (see part ii, p. 85 seqq.). The assumption here is, that the performance of the Pravargya takes place on that day before the Pressing-day, whilst in reality it has been performed for at least two days before that.

[^egg_1213]: 458:3 See III, 4, 4, 1. The Upasads are performed twice daily, for at least three days, up to the day before the Soma-sacrifice; and if the Pravargya is to be performed likewise, it precedes immediately each performance of the Upasad. Cf. also XIV, 3, 1, 1 with note.

[^egg_1214]: 458:4 Prior to this, the doors of the śālā are to be closed, to keep the Mahāvīra from being seen; see p. 452, note 2. The entire performance of the Pravargya indeed has to be kept secret from the eyes of unauthorised persons.

[^egg_1215]: 458:5 The 'parīśāsau' (also called 'śaphau,' XIV, 2, 1, 16) are two  pieces of wood or laths apparently fastened together by a kind of clasp (or a cord) at one end, so as to serve the purpose of a pair of tongs (parīśāsau saṁdaṁśākārau, comm. on Kāty. XXVI, 2, to) for taking up the Mahāvīra pot, which must not be handled in any other way. According to Haug, Ait. Br., Transl., p. 51, they are placed underneath the pot in lifting it, but this seems very improbable, seeing that, at the end of the sacrifice, the Adhvaryu, by means of them, turns the pot upside down so as to pour the remainder of its contents into the offering spoon (see Kāty. XXIV, 6, 17 with comm.); nor could the blackened pot in that way be cleansed properly and placed on the supporting tray (XIV, 2, 1, 16-17).

two milking-bowls, the two Rauhiṇa-plates, the two offering spoons for the Rauhiṇa (cakes), and whatever other (implement) there is,--these make ten, for the Virāj consists of ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Virāj: he thus makes this to be equal to the Virāj, the sacrifice. And as to their being in pairs,--a pair means strength, for when two take hold of each other they exert strength; and a pair (couple) means a productive union: with a productive union he thus supplies and completes it.

Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hotr̥, sing praises!' for the Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hotr̥, sing praises!' he says, because the Hotr̥ is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hotr̥ begins to recite--

It has probably to be understood in the sense of, 'where he (viz. the Adhvaryu) calls for the śraushaṭ.' Mahīdhara explains the term 'āśruti' by 'where they, the priests, utter the sacrificial calls,' i.e. 'meet for sacrifice.'

[^egg_1232]: 465:1 Here the masculine gender can hardly be understood otherwise than in the sense 'where (Br̥haspati, or Brahman) disposes on high.' Mahīdhara takes no notice of this interpretation of the Brāhmaṇa, but explains 'vidhr̥ti' as either 'one who upholds (dhārayati) in an especial manner,' or where 'the offering spoon, &c., is held upwards (uparishṭād dhriyate,--? who holds it upwards),'--an explanation which can hardly commend itself.

If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.

According to Kāty., on the other hand, the Pratiprasthātr̥ proceeds with the baking of the cakes, whilst the Adhvaryu sprinkles the pot with ghee each time that the Hotr̥, in his recitation, utters the syllable 'om' at the end of a verse.

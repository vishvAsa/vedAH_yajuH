1. Now, at the beginning, Prajāpati was (composed of) both these, the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone were immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he made his body uniformly undecaying and immortal. And in like manner is the Sacrificer (composed of) both the mortal and the immortal--his vital airs alone are immortal, his body mortal: by this sacrificial performance, and by this order of proceeding, he makes his body uniformly undecaying and immortal.

9. Having then laid down the Vikarṇī and Svayamātr̥ṇṇā, he scatters chips of gold, and places

the fire thereon: Prajāpati then finally made a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he did so) finally, this was the final form of his body; whence people speak of 'the golden Prajāpati [^egg_542].' And in like manner does the Sacrificer now finally make a golden form for his body; and inasmuch as (he does so) finally, this is the final form of his body; and hence, whether they know this or not, people say that the Agnicit (he who has built an altar) is born in yonder world as one made of gold [^egg_543].

[^egg_542]: 295:1 Apparently an allusion to Hiraṇyagarbha, the golden germ, or the golden egg (XI, I, 6, I), from which the Purusha, creator of the universe, arose. Cf. also Aitareyār. II, I, 3, with Sāyaṇa's commentary.

[^egg_543]: 295:2 Sāyaṇa assigns to 'hiraṇmaya' the meaning 'of a colour resembling gold' (hiraṇyasamānavarṇaḥ).

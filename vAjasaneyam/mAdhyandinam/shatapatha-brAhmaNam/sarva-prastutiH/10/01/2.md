1. Prajāpati was desirous of gaining these worlds. He saw this bird-like body, the Fire-altar: he

fashioned it, and thereby gained this (terrestrial) world. He saw a second bird-like body, the (chant of the) Great Rite [^egg_530]: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the air. He saw a third bird-like body, the Great Litany [^egg_530]: he fashioned it, and thereby gained the sky.

[^egg_530]: 286:1 The Mahāvrata-sāman and the Mahad uktham, as we have seen (p. 282, note 5; p. 111, note 1), are constructed so as to correspond to the different parts of the bird-like Agni-Prajāpati.

2. This built Fire-altar, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, the Great Rite the air, and the Great Litany the sky: all these, the Fire-altar, the Great Rite, and the Great Litany, one ought therefore to undertake together, for these worlds were created together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of these worlds this (terrestrial) one was created first. Thus with regard to the deity.

3. Now with regard to the body. The Fire-altar is the mind, the (chant of the) Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany speech: all these one ought therefore to undertake together, for mind, breath, and speech belong together; as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because the mind is prior to the breathings.

5. The Fire-altar, indeed, is the head, the Great Rite the breath, and the Great Litany the body:

one ought therefore to undertake all these together, for head, breath, and body belong together; and as to why the Fire-altar is built first, it is because of him who is born the head is born first; and hence, whenever all these are undertaken together the Great Litany, indeed, is accounted the highest (ātamām) [^egg_531], for the Great Litany is the body (or self, ātman).

[^egg_531]: 287:1 The combination 'ātamāṁ khyāyate' is, as it were, the superlative of 'ā-khyāyate;' cf. anutamāṁ gopāyati, X, 5, 2, 10; and Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 194.

6. As to this they say, 'If all these are difficult to obtain together, what (means of) obtaining them is there?'--In the Jyotishṭoma (form of the) Agnishṭoma [^egg_532]: let him perform offering with the Jyotishṭoma Agnishṭoma.

[^egg_532]: 287:2 The Agnishṭoma may be performed in three different modes, according to the variation of stomas (or hymn-forms) employed for the stotras (or chants). In the Jyotishṭoma the order of stomas is that set forth in paragraph 7, viz.: a. Bahishpavamāna-stotra in the Trivr̥t (nine-versed); b. Ājya-stotras, and c. Mādhyandina-pavamāna-stotra, in the Pañcadaśa (fifteen-versed); d. Pr̥shṭḥa-stotras, and e. Ārbhava-pavamāna-stotra, in the Saptadaśa (seventeen-versed); and f. Agnishṭoma-sāman (Yajñāyajñiya) in the Ekaviṁśa (twenty-one-versed) stoma, or hymn-form. In the Goshṭoma, on the other hand, the succession of stomas is a. Pañcadaśa, b. Trivr̥t, c. d. Saptadaśa, e. f. Ekaviṁśa; and in the Āyushṭoma: a. Trivr̥t, b. Pañcadaśa, (c. d.) Saptadaśa, (e. f.) Ekaviṁśa. Cf. part ii, p. 402, note 4; for the scheme of Stotras (and Sastras), ib. p. 325, note 2. The Agnishṭoma is singled out here for the reason that the Mahāvrata-day takes the form of an Agnishṭoma sacrifice.

 Ājya (stotra) is (in) the Pañcadaśa, the Pr̥shṭḥa (stotra in) the Saptadaśa, and the Yajñāyajñiya (stotra in) the Ekaviṁśa (stoma)--they are the tail.

8. Now these two, the Pañcadaśa and Saptadaśa, have thirty-two hymn-verses: twenty-five of these are the twenty-five-fold body [^egg_533]; and the seven which remain over are the Parimād (sāmans), for these are the cattle (or animals), (for) cattle are sporting all around us (pari-mād [^egg_534])--thus much, then, is the

[^egg_533]: 288:1 See p. 168, note 3.

[^egg_534]: 288:2 Sāyaṇa takes 'parimād' here in the sense of 'a source of pleasure all around'--parito harshahetavaḥ.--The Parimādaḥ are thirteen Sāmans sung (not chanted, in the proper sense of the word) by the Udgātr̥, his two assistants joining merely in the Nidhanas or chorus-like passages. They are given, figured for chanting, in the Araṇyagāna of the Sāma-veda (Calc. ed., ii, p. 387 seq.). This performance takes place immediately after the Adhvaryu has given the sign for, and the Udgātr̥ 'yoked,' the Mahāvrata-stotra or sāman (i. e. the Hotr̥'s Pr̥shṭḥastotra of the Great Rite),--or, according to some authorities, before either the 'yoking,' or the Adhvaryu's summons,--and thus serves as an introduction to the central and chief element of the Great Rite, the Mahāvrata-sāman. According to the ritual symbolism, these preliminary sāmans are intended to supply the newly completed Prajāpati with hair (feathers) and nails; but the performance would rather seem to he a solemn mode of doing homage (upasthānam) to the different parts of the bird-like altar and the sacrificial ground; thus corresponding to a similar, though simpler, ceremony performed on the completion of the fire-altar in its simplest form, as described at IX, 1, 2, 35-43. On the present occasion the ceremony is performed in the following order: 1. near the head of the altar (the Āhavanīya fire) he sings the Prāṇa ('breath;' Sāma-v., vol. ii, p. 436); 2. near the tail the Apāna (downward-breathing, ii, p. 437); 3. 4. near the right and left wing the two Vratapakshau (ii, p. 438); 5. near the left armpit the Prajāpati-hr̥daya ('heart of Praj.,' ii, p. 499); 6. near the Cātvāla or pit, the Vasishṭḥasya Nihava (Sāma-v., vol. v, p. 602); 7. near the Āgnīdhra hearth the Satrasyarddhi ('success of the sacrificial session,' ii, p. 465); 8. 9. in front and behind the Havirdhāna carts, the Śloka and Anuśloka (i, pp. 887-9);  10. towards the Mārjālīya the Yāma (ii, p. 461); 11. 12. in front and behind the Sadas, the Āyus, and Navastobha (ii, pp. 450-51); 13. in front of the Gārhapatya the R̥śyasya sāman (ii, p. 324).

 Great Rite: thereby he obtains the Great Rite even in this (Agnishṭoma).

9. And the Hotr̥ recites seven metres--each subsequent one-versed (metre) increasing by four (syllables)--with the Virāj as an eighth: these (eight) consist of three eighties and forty-five syllables. Now by the eighties thereof the eighties (of the mahad uktham) [^egg_535] are obtained, for the Great Litany is counted (or recited) by eighties (of triplets); and of the forty-five (syllables which remain) twenty-five are this twenty-five-fold body [^egg_536]; and where the body is there, indeed, are (included) the head, and the wings and tail; and the twenty (syllables which remain) are the insertion [^egg_537];--thus much, then, is the Great Litany: thereby he obtains the Great Litany even in this (Agnishṭoma). All these (three) are indeed obtained in the Jyotishṭoma Agnishṭoma: let him, therefore, perform offering with the Jyotishṭoma Agnishṭoma.

3. He places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vaushaṭ [^egg_660]!' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),

[^egg_660]: 341:2 See IX, 2, 3, 35, where it was stated that the fire should be laid down with the Vashaṭ-call ('vaushaṭ!') uttered after the two verses, Vāj. S. XVII, 72. 73. Here, as at I, 7, 2, 21, the sacrificial call, 'vaushaṭ'--for 'vashaṭ,' apparently an irregular subjunctive aorist of 'vah': 'may he bear (the oblation to the gods)!'--is fancifully explained as composed of 'vauk' (i.e. vāk, speech), and 'shaṭ,' six.

and 'shaṭ (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to this body, for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.

Now that Arka [^egg_661] (flame) is this very fire which they bring here; and the Kya [^egg_661] is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar built here: that (combined) makes the Arkya [^egg_662] in respect of the Yajus. And the Great one (mahān) is this (Agni), and this vrata [^egg_663] (rite) is his food: that makes the Mahāvrata (sāman) in respect of the Sāman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (śastra, recitation) [^egg_664] in respect of the R̥k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.

6. Now those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit, the gold plate and the (gold) man [^egg_665]: Indra is the gold plate, and Agni the man.

[^egg_665]: 342:5 For the gold plate worn by the Sacrificer whilst carrying about  the Ukhya Agni, and ultimately deposited on the lotus-leaf in the centre of the altar-site before the first layer is laid down, see VI, 7, I, 1 seq.; VII, 4, 1, 10 seq. For the gold man placed on the gold plate, VII, 4, 1, 15 seq. Whilst the gold man was indeed identified with Agni-Prajāpati, as well as with the Sacrificer, the gold plate was taken throughout as representing the sun.

 They are made of gold: gold means light, and Indra and Agni are the light; gold means immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal life.

8. And the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed on the built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce creatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick [^egg_666], and into this the whole Agni passes: this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable (akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which is the perfection of syllables.

[^egg_666]: 343:1 According to Sāyaṇa, this one brick is the syllable ('akshara,' which also means 'the imperishable, indestructible') 'vauk' contained in the 'Vaushaṭ,' uttered when the sacred fire is placed on the newly-built altar.

10. And, indeed, Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana, knowing this, once said, 'If this my sacrificial performance were complete, my own race would become the kings (nobles), Brāhmaṇas, and peasants of the Salvas; but even by that much of my work which has been completed [^egg_668] my race will surpass the Salvas in both ways;'--for this (Agni, the fire-altar), indeed, is (social) eminence and fame, and an eater of food [^egg_669].

[^egg_668]: 344:2 Or, perhaps--but since so much of my work has been completed, my race will thereby surpass the Salvas. Cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 266.

[^egg_669]: 344:3 Sāyaṇa takes this as intended to explain the 'in both' ways' of the quotation, viz. in regard to 'śrī' (social distinction) on the one hand, and to 'yaśas' (fame) and food (material prosperity) on the other. There is, however, nothing in the text to favour any such grouping of the distinctive objects of aspiration associated with the three classes (varṇatrayātmakatvam upajivya karmaṇaḥ, śrīyaśonnādalakshaṇaṁ phalam. Sāyaṇa), or with men generally (cf. Aitareyār. I, 4, 2, 10). Perhaps it means both in an intellectual and material point of view. The Syāparṇas seem to have been a rather self-assertive family of priests. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa tells the following story about them (VII, 27):--Viśvantara Saushadmana, setting aside the Śyāparṇas, got up a sacrifice without them. The Syāparṇas, becoming aware of this, came to the sacrifice and sat them down inside the sacrificial ground. On seeing them, Viśvantara said, 'There sit those doers of evil deeds, those speakers of foul language, the Syāparṇas: turn them out let them not sit inside my sacrificial ground!'--'So be it!' they said, and  turned them out. In being turned out, they cried aloud, 'At a sacrifice of Janamejaya, son of Parikshit, performed without the Kaśyapas, the Asitamr̥gas from amongst the Kaśyapas won the Soma-drink from the Bhūtavīras (who were officiating). In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is there amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?'--'Here is that hero of yours,' said Rāma Mārgaveya. Rāma Mārgaveya was a Śyāparṇīya, learned in sacred lore. When they rose to leave, he said, 'O king, will they turn out of the sacrificial ground even one so learned as me?'--'Whoever thou art, what knowest thou, vile Brāhman?'--'When the gods turned Indra away because he had outraged Tvashṭr̥'s son Viśvarūpa, and laid low Vr̥tra, and thrown devotees before the jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on Br̥haspati (the teacher of the gods)--then Indra was deprived of the Soma-cup; and along with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By stealing the Soma from Tvashṭr̥, Indra obtained a share in the Soma-cup, but to this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they turn out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can be put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are deprived?'--'Knowest thou (how to procure) that drink, O Brāhman?'--'I know it indeed.'--'Tell us then, O Brahman?'--'To thee, O king, I will tell it,' he said. Ultimately the Śyāparṇas are reinstated in their sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur Litteratur and Geschichte des Weda, p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Syāparṇa Sāyakāyana was stated to have been the last who was in the habit of immolating five victims instead of two, as became afterwards the custom.

18. These sixteen digits convey the food to that vital air; and when they take to conveying no food to it, then it consumes them and departs (from the body): hence he who is hungry here, feels very

restless, consumed as he is by his vital airs; and hence he who suffers from fever becomes very thin, for he is consumed by his vital airs.

19. Now for that seventeenfold Prajāpati they prepared this seventeenfold food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these sixteen officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth priest [^egg_678] lest one should do what is excessive;--and what vital sap there is here--the oblations that are offered--that is the seventeenfold food.

[^egg_678]: 348:1 This prohibition is probably directed against the Kaushītakins, who recognise a seventeenth officiating priest, the Sadasya, who seems to have taken no other part in the sacrificial performance except sitting in the Sadas as the permanent custodian thereof.

20. And when they chant the hymn, and when he (the Hotr̥) afterwards recites (the śastra), he (the Adhvaryu) offers to him that food as the Vashaṭ-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and shaṭ' this sixfold food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when there is too much it does injure it, and when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.

21. Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar built here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Soma-sacrifice: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Yajus. And the Great one (mahān) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahāvrata in respect of the Sāman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the R̥k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. With this food he went upwards; and he who

went upwards is yonder sun, and that food wherewith he went up is that moon.

And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the R̥k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold. And, indeed, that (Agni) is that (sun) as to the deity, and this (breath) as to the body.

1. Now, the Yajus, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along he (Vāyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Yajus is no other than Vāyu.

2. And the course [^egg_647] (jūḥ) is this space, to wit, this air [^egg_648], for along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Yajus is both the wind and the air--the 'yat' and the 'jūḥ'--whence (the name) Yajus. And the 'yat' (that which goes) is this (Adhvaiyu) [^egg_649], for when he 'goes' on (performing), the R̥c and Sāman carry that Yajus established on the R̥c and Sāman. Hence the Adhvaryu performs his work with the very same Grahas (cups of Soma), (while) there are each time [^egg_650] different stotras (chants) and śastras (recitations): it is just as if, after driving with a first pair (of horses), one drives with a second pair.

[^egg_647]: 336:1 'Jūḥ' would rather seem to mean 'the urger, or speeder.'

[^egg_648]: 336:2 'Yad idam antariksham,' perhaps, with the double sense--'this air is the "yat (the going, moving thing)"'--made use of in the sequel. The construction, however, is not quite clear. Sāyaṇa explains: ayam evākāśo jūr iti; ju iti sautro dhātur gatyarthaḥ; yad idam pratīyamānam antariksham asti tad eva jūr iti; yad evocyate--etam ākāśam anulakshya javate, vāyur gaccḥati, vāyujavamādakaraṇa--tvāj jūr ākāśaḥ.

[^egg_649]: 336:3 Or, whence (the name) Yajus, to wit, this (Adhvaryu).

[^egg_650]: 336:4 That is, in different Soma-sacrifices.

3. Now Agni is in front [^egg_651] (puras), for placing Agni in front (of them) these creatures attend upon him; and the sun is motion (caraṇa), for as soon as he rises everything here moves about. Such is the Yajus with the preparatory performance (puraścaraṇa [^egg_652]) as regards the deities.

[^egg_651]: 337:1 Literally, apparently, 'The in-front is Agni.'

[^egg_652]: 337:2 This term, literally, 'moving in front,' seems virtually to imply the entire manual work connected with the sacrifice, and which, along with the muttering of the Yajus-formulas, forms the official duty of the Adhvaryu. It would thus include all the sacrificial performances prior to the muttering of a Yajus, as the finishing or consecratory rite. For a somewhat similar discussion, see IV, 6, 7, 20. 21. The commentary introduces the present discussion thus: atha brāhmaṇāparanāmadheyasya puraścaraṇaśabdasya pūrvavan nirvacanapuraḥsaram adhidaivam artham āha.

9. And if any one strives to become a rival [^egg_653] among his own people to one who knows this, he does not satisfy his dependants; but, indeed, only he satisfies his dependants, who is faithful [^egg_654] to that one and who, along with him, strives to support his dependants.

11. This Brahman has nothing before it and nothing after it [^egg_655]; and whosoever thus knows this Brahman to have nothing before it and nothing

[^egg_655]: 338:3 Sāyaṇa seems to take 'aparavat' in the sense of 'it has (only) something after it'--srashṭavyajagadrūpāparavat--and the use of the word 'aparapurushāḥ (descendants)' immediately after might indeed seem to favour that interpretation.

after it, than he there is no one higher among his equals in station; and ever higher will be the descendants that spring from him. Wherefore, if any one would be greater than he, let him reverentially approach the regions in front (to the eastward) of that one in this way, and he will do him no injury [^egg_656].

[^egg_656]: 339:1 The MISS. of the commentary (I. O. 613. 149) are unfortunately not in a very satisfactory condition:--sa yo haitad iti, evam upāsītety arthaḥ; yadi vedituḥ sakāśāt gyāyasaḥ purushasya sadbhāve tadā svayam bādhyo bhavatīty āśaṅkya tasmād adhikapurushād adhikam (acḥādikāt B) [vastu diśyopāsītavyam (!) ity āha, yosmāj jyāyān iti; yadi asmād upāsakāt yodhikaḥ syāt tarhi tasmād adhikāt, om.

12. But, indeed, the mystic import (upanishad) is the essence of this Yajus; and thus, if, with ever so small a yajus-formula, the Adhvaryu draws a cup of Soma, that (essence) is equal to both the Stotra and the Śastra, and comes up to both the Stotra and the Śastra: hence, however small the essence (flavour) of food, it benefits (renders palatable) the whole food, and pervades the whole food.

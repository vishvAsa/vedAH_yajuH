1. The Gāyatrī is the breath (of Prajāpati, the altar), the Ushṇih the eye, the Anushṭubh the voice, the Br̥hatī the mind, the Paṅkti the ear; the Trishṭubh is that generative breath; and the Jagatī

that downward breathing;--these are the seven metres increasing by four (syllables) each [^egg_631], which are produced in Agni (the fire-altar).

[^egg_631]: 328:1 The Gāyatrī verse consists of twenty-four syllables; and each of the following increases by four syllables, the Jagatī consisting of 4 × 12, or forty-eight syllables.

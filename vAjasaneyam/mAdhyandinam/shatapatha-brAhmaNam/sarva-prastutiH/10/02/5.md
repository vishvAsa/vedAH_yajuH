1. Now as to the building itself. He builds between the two (performances of the) Upasads [^egg_605]. For at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy that (Agni's body) of theirs (built) there [^egg_606]. They saw these strongholds, the Upasads, to wit, these worlds, for these worlds are indeed strongholds. They entered them, and having entered them, they completed that body in a place free from danger and devilry; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after entering these strongholds, complete this body in a place free from danger and devilry.

[^egg_605]: 316:1 The Upasads (or sieges) are performed twice a day on at least three days (the regular number for ordinary one day's Soma-sacrifices) intervening between the end of the Dīkshā (initiation) and the day of the Soma-sacrifice; see part ii, p. 105, note 1. On the first day the first layer is built between the two performances (whilst the final preparation of the altar-site, as well as the building of the Gārhapatya altar and the installation of the Ukhya Agni thereon, takes place before the morning performance of the Upasads), and on the second day the remaining layers are built.

[^egg_606]: 316:2 For the construction in the oraṭio ḍirecṭa, see part iii, p. 34, note 2.

3. And the Upasads also are the fervour [^egg_608] in the sacrifice, for they are indeed fervour; and inasmuch as it is built (ci) in fervour (tapas) it is called 'Tāpaścita [^egg_609].' As long as they perform the Upasads so long (do they perform) the Pravargya [^egg_610]: (if) it is for a year. that they perform the Upasads, it is for a year (they perform) the Pravargya.

[^egg_608]: 317:1 Or, austere devotion, see III, 4, 4, 27, where fasting during the Upasad days is recommended as calculated to promote religious fervour. There is also, however, the primary' meaning 'heat' implied, whence the 'heating' of the cauldron (gharma--θερμός) at the Pravargya (representing the sun) is connected with the Upasads.

[^egg_609]: 317:2 That is, the fire-altar used at the sacrificial period (ayana) called Tāpaścita, which generally requires a full year (360 days) for the performance of the Upasads (as do also the Dīkshā- before them, and the performance of the Soma-sacrifice after them); cf. XII, 3, 3, 10 seq.; Kāty. XIV, 5, 1.--Āśval. XII, 5, 9; Kāty. XXIV, 5, 7, however, mention a Tāpaścita which only requires four months for each of the three periods, or a year altogether, whilst the maximum duration is by Āśv. fixed at thirty-six years (twelve for each period); and by Kāty. at three years for the Upasads and a year for each of the two other ceremonies.

At all events, the Sacrificer would be at liberty to adopt that number of Upasad-days instead of the minimum of days prescribed, if he hoped to derive special benefit therefrom.

9. Now, then, the inquiry as to the earth-layers of the altar-pile. One month (the building of) the first layer (of bricks takes), and one month the layer of earth [^egg_613],--so long desire (lasts) in the spring season (of two months): he thus [^egg_614] builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the spring season [^egg_615].

[^egg_613]: 318:2 That is, when the Upasads last for a whole year, as at the Tāpaścita.

[^egg_614]: 318:3 That is, by building for his Soma-sacrifice an altar the body of which requires a whole year in being laid down, as it does in the Tāpaścita.

[^egg_615]: 318:4 Translated literally, the sentence would run thus: 'Thus as  much desire as there is in the spring season--he builds for himself a body so as to obtain all that (desire).' Only the building of an altar (body) for a whole year ensures the full fruition of sensual pleasures supplied during the year.

[^egg_618]: 320:2 The Viśvajit, as usually performed, is an Agnishṭoma sacrifice, the twelve Stotras of which are chanted in three different stomas or hymn-forms, viz. the first four in the trivr̥t (nine-versed), the next four in the pañcadaśa (fifteen-versed), and the last four in the saptadaśa (seventeen-versed) stoma. For the stotriya-texts see  Tāṇḍya-Br. XVI, 5, 1 seq. It is closely united with the Abhijit Soma-day--the stotras of which are performed in four stomas, viz. three in each of those used for the Viśvajit, and the last three in the ekaviṁśa, or twenty-one-versed, stoma--with which it may, indeed, be combined in one and the same performance; and both form part of the sacrificial session called Gavām ayanam (part ii, p. 427). The Viśvajit (as well as the Abhijit) may, however, also be performed as an Atirātra instead of Agnishṭoma, and in that case the sequence of Stomas is entirely different, their order being as follows: the first four stotras are performed in the first four stomas (trivr̥t, pañcadaśa, saptadaśa, ekaviṁśa); the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with the second stoma (up to triṇava), and the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with the third stoma (up to trayastr̥ṁśa). Of the three Ukthastotras, the first is performed in the triṇava, and the two others in the ekaviṁśa; the Shoḍaśin in its own (ekaviṁśa) form; the night-chants in the pañcadaśa; and the twilight-chant in the trivr̥t-stoma.

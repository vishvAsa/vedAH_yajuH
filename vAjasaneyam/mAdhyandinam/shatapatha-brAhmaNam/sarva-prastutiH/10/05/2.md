4. There is this verse:--'Within Death is immortality,'--for below death is immortality;--'founded on Death is immortality,'--for established on that man (in the sun) the immortal shines [^egg_716];--'Death putteth on the radiant,'--the

Sāy. But for this interpretation, one might have rendered the first pāda by, 'Close unto death is immortality,' for after death comes immortality.

radiant one (vivasvant), doubtless, is yonder sun, for he irradiates (vi-vas) day and night; and it is him that (Death) puts on, for on every side he is surrounded by him;--'Death's self is in the radiant,'--for the self (body) of that man indeed is in that orb: such, then, is that verse.

5. Now, that orb is the foundation (foothold) of both that light and that man; whence one must not recite the Great Litany for another [^egg_717], lest he should cut away that foothold from beneath his own self; for he who recites the Mahad Uktham for another, indeed cuts away that foothold from beneath his own self: wherefore the (professional) singer of praises (śastra) is greatly despised, for he is cut off from his foothold. Thus in regard to the deity.

[^egg_717]: 367:1 Cf. Aitareyār. V, 3, 3, 1, 'No one but a dīkshita (initiated) should recite the Mahāvrata (śastra); and he should not recite it at a (Mahāvrata) unless it be combined with (the building of) a fire-altar; neither should he do so for another person, nor at a (sacrificial session lasting) less than a year,' so say some; but he may recite it for his father or for his teacher, for in that case it is recited on his own behalf.

6. Now as to the sacrifice. That shining orb is the same as this gold plate (under the altar) [^egg_718], and that glowing light is the same as this lotus-leaf (under the altar); for there are those (divine)

[^egg_718]: 367:2 In these symbolical identifications, one might also take the relative clause to be the predicate, not the subject, of the sentence; the former usually preceding the latter.

waters [^egg_719], and the lotus-leaf is water [^egg_720]; and that man in yonder orb is no other than this gold man (in the altar): thus, by laying down these (in the fire-altar), it is that (divine) triad he constructs. And after the consummation of the sacrifice it rises upwards and enters that shining (sun): one need not therefore mind destroying Agni, for he is then in yonder (world) [^egg_721]. Thus, then, in regard to the sacrifice.

[^egg_719]: 368:1 Though the sun itself does not consist of water, he at any rate floats along a sea of water; cf. VII, 5, 1, 8, 'For that indeed is the deepest of waters where yonder sun shines;' and there are waters above and below the sun, VII, 1, 1, 24; and the sun is encircled by 360 navigable streams, and as many flow towards it, X, 5, 4, 14.--Sāyaṇa, on the other hand, takes it to mean, 'for that (light) is water,' inasmuch as the sun's rays produce the rain,--arcisho hy āpaḥ sūryakiraṇānām eva vr̥shṭikartr̥katvāt kāryakāranayor abhedena arcir vā āpa ity uktam. Possibly this may be the right interpretation.

[^egg_720]: 368:2 See VII, 4, 1, 8, where the lotus-plant is said to represent the (cosmic) waters, whilst the earth is a lotus-leaf floating on the waters.

[^egg_721]: 368:3 According to Sāyaṇa, he is so in the shape of both the sun and the Sacrificer's body or self,--yatosminn agniṁ citavān paratrādityo bhavati, atogniṁ parihantuṁ nādriyeta, ciṭam agnim ishṭakāviśesheṇa nāśayitam ādaraṁ na curyāt, kutaḥ, eshognir amutra bhavati, paraloke yajamānaśarīrātmanotpadyate; yad vā parihantuṁ prāptuṁ sprashṭum ity arthaḥ, cityāgnisparśane doshaśravaṇāt. Sāyaṇa, thus, is doubtful as to how 'Agnim parihantum' is to be taken, whether it means 'to injure the altar (? or extinguish the fire) by some brick,' or to 'knock against (touch) the altar.' The St. Petersb. Dict. takes it in the sense of 'to extinguish the fire,'  but it might also, perhaps, mean, 'to destroy the fire-altar' by taking it to pieces.

8. The Lokampr̥ṇā (space-filling brick) is the same as that (gold man in the sun) [^egg_722]: it is that (brick) which this entire Agni finally results in [^egg_723]. Moreover, this man (or person) in the left eye is the mate of that one (in the right eye and in the sun); and a mate is one half of one's own self [^egg_724], for when one is with a mate he is whole and complete: thus it (the second man) is for the sake of completeness. And as to there being two of these (persons in the eyes), a pair means a productive couple: hence two Lokampr̥ṇās are laid down each time [^egg_725], and hence they set up the layer by two (kinds of bricks).

[^egg_722]: 369:1 On the identification of the sun with the Lokampr̥ṇā on the ground that the former fills these worlds (lokān pūrayati), see VIII, 7, 2, 1.

[^egg_725]: 369:4 When the layers are filled up with 'space-fillers,' two Lokampr̥ṇās are first laid down in one of the four corners, and from them the available spaces are then filled up, in two turns, in the sunwise direction; cf. p. 22, note 1.

[^egg_727]: 370:1 Or, 'act most in secrecy.' Sāyaṇa explains it: manushyāṇāṁ madhye rājanyabandhavonutamāṁ gopāyanti atyarthaṁ rahasyatvena kurvanti tasmāt teshu viryavān putro jāyate. The St. Petersb. Dict., on the other hand, takes it in the sense of 'they protect most of all;' though it is difficult to see how the, 'protection' afforded by princes or rulers could have any bearing on men taking their food apart from their wives. If the above interpretation is right we may compare 'anu-gup' in the sense of 'to conceal.' See, however, the next note, where Sāyaṇa takes 'gopāyati' in the sense of 'observes (that law),' which might also have suited here. Princes, having their seraglio, would naturally have less occasion for coming into contact with their wives at mealtime than men of lower stations of life. On the superlative of the preposition, see p. 287, note 1.

17. As to this they say, 'Is Death near or far away?' Let him say, 'Both near and far away;' for inasmuch as he is here on earth in the body he is near, and inasmuch as he is that one in yonder world he also is far away.

18. Regarding this there is the verse,--'Concealed

in food he, the immortal, shineth at the flowing together of vital saps;'--yonder shining orb is food, and the man in that orb is the eater: being concealed in that food, he shines. Thus much as to the deity.

20. That same (divine person), the Adhvaryus (Yajur-veda priests) serve under the name of 'Agni' (fire-altar) and 'Yajus,' because he holds together (yuj) all this (universe) [^egg_736]; the Chandogas (Sāma-veda priests, chanters) under that of 'Sāman,' because in him all this (universe) is one and the same (samāna) [^egg_737]; the Bahvr̥cas (R̥g-veda priests, Hotars) under that of 'Uktham,' because he originates (utthāp) everything here; those skilled in sorcery, under that of 'sorcery (yātu),' because everything here is held in check (yata) by him; the serpents under that of 'poison;' the snake-charmers under that of 'snake;' the gods under that of 'ūrj (strengthening food);' men under that of 'wealth;' demons under that of 'māyā (magic power);' the deceased Fathers under that of 'svadhā (invigorating draught);' those knowing the divine host under that of 'divine host;' the Gandharvas under that of 'form (rūpa [^egg_738]);' the Apsaras under that of 'fragrance (gandha),'--thus, in whatsoever form they serve him that indeed he becomes, and, having become that,

[^egg_738]: 373:3 The characteristic attributes of the Gandharvas and Apsaras are evidently exchanged in the text as it stands; cf. IX, 4, 1, 4.

he is helpful to them; whence he who knows should serve him in all these (forms), for he becomes all that, and, having become all that, he is helpful to him.

21. Now this Agni (fire-altar) consists of three bricks,--the R̥c being one, the Yajus another, and the Sāman another: whatever (brick) he lays down here with a r̥k (verse) that has the gold plate for its foundation [^egg_739]; whatever (brick he lays down) with a yajus (formula) that has the (gold) man for its foundation; and whatever (brick he lays down) with a sāman (hymn-tune) that has the lotus-leaf for its foundation. Thus he consists of three bricks.

[^egg_739]: 374:1 Viz. inasmuch as the (round) gold plate (representing the sun) is deposited in the centre of the altar-site, before the first layer is constructed. In the same way the other two objects.

23. Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and this man in the right eye, are no other than Death [^egg_740]; and he becomes the body (self) of him who knows this: whenever he who knows departs this world he passes into that body, and becomes immortal, for Death is his own self.

[^egg_740]: 374:2 Sāyaṇa seems to construe this somewhat differently: sa esho gnir yajurātmakodhidaivaṁ maṇḍalamadhyavartī adhyātmaṁ dakshiṇākshivartī purusho mr̥tyurūpaḥ.

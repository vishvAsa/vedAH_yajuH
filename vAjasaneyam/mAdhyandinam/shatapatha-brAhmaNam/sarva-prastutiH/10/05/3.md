3. This Mind, when created, wished to become manifest,--more defined [^egg_742], more substantial: it sought after a self (body) [^egg_743]. It practised austerity [^egg_744]: it acquired consistency [^egg_745]. It then beheld thirty-six thousand Arka-fires [^egg_746] of its own self, composed of mind, built up of mind: mentally [^egg_747] alone they were established (on sacrificial hearths) and mentally

[^egg_742]: 375:1 Niruktataraṁ niruktaṁ śabdanirvācyam. Sāy.

[^egg_743]: 375:2 Sāyaṇa also allows the interpretation, 'after (its source, or cause,) the (supreme) self,'--ātmānaṁ svakāraṇaṁ paramātmānaṁ svasvarūpaṁ vānvaickḥat. What seems, indeed, implied in these esoteric lucubrations, is that meditation on the infinite is equivalent to all ceremonial rites which are supposed to be incessantly performed for one so engaged, even during his sleep (paragraph 12).

[^egg_744]: 375:3 I. e. intense meditation (paryālokanam), Sāy.? 'it became heated.'

[^egg_745]: 375:4 Sāyaṇa apparently takes 'prāmūrcḥat' in the sense of 'became great, or important,'--samuccḥritam babhūva.

[^egg_746]: 375:5 Sāyaṇa here takes 'arka' in the sense of 'arcanīya (worthy of veneration), as, indeed, he did several times before; though once he seems to call them 'agnyarkāḥ,' as being the highest, merely speculative or immaterial form of sacrificial fires or fire-altars (dhyeyā agnayaḥ); cf. X, 3, 4, 3 seq.--The 36,000 fires are calculated so as to be equal to the number of days in the life of the perfect man living a hundred years (X, 2, 6, 9); there being thus for each day of his life a (spiritual) sacrificial fire, a mental exercise or discipline, as Sāyaṇa expresses it,--tatraikasmin dine (āgneyā?) manovr̥ttiḥ.

[^egg_747]: 375:6 The text has everywhere the instrumental 'manasā,' which would imply either the agent, the instrument, or the material, as the case might be.

built up [^egg_748]; mentally the cups (of Soma) were drawn thereat mentally they chanted, and mentally they recited on (near) them,--whatever rite is performed at the sacrifice, whatever sacrificial rite there is, that was performed mentally only, as a mental performance, on those (fires or fire-altars) composed of mind, and built up of mind. And whatever it is that (living) beings here conceive in their mind that was done regarding those (mental Agnis [^egg_749]):--they establish them (on the hearths) and build them up (as fire-altars); they draw the cups for them; they chant on (near) them and recite hymns on them,--of that extent was the development of Mind, of that extent its creation,--so great is Mind: thirty-six thousand Arka-fires; and each of these as great as that former (fire-altar) was.

[^egg_748]: 376:1 That is, the ceremonies of Agnyādhāna (establishment of the sacrificial fire) and Agnicayana (building of the fire-altar) were performed by means of these fires. Sāyaṇa remarks that these rites were performed by the same 'beings (bhūtāni),' which are mentioned immediately after, as would, indeed, appear to be the case from paragraph 12.

[^egg_749]: 376:2 Yat kiṁ ca bhūtāni manasā dhyāyanti vācā vadanti taiḥ saṁkalpavadanādibhir eva teshām agnīnām karaṇam. Sāy.

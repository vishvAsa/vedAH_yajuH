He beheld this three days’ Soma-sacrifice, the Aśvamedha, and took possession of it, and sacrificed with it: by sacrificing therewith he obtained all his desires, and attained all attainments; and, verily, whosoever performs the Aśvamedha sacrifice obtains all his desires, and attains all attainments.

For this (offering) there are fifteen kindling-verses [^egg_897]; for fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with the thunderbolt (of) vigour the Sacrificer thus from the first repels evil.

[^egg_898]: 350:3 The two Ājyabhāgas, or butter-portions to Agni and Soma, are said to be 'Vr̥tra-slaying' (vārtraghna), or to relate to the slaying of Vr̥tra, when their anuvākyās, or invitatory formulas, are the two verses R̥g-veda VI, 16, 34 (agnir vr̥trāṇi gaṅghanat, 'May Agni slay the Vr̥tras'), and I, 91, 5 (tvaṁ soṁāsi satpatis tvaṁ rājota vr̥trahā, 'Thou, O Soma, art the true lord, thou art the king and the slayer of Vr̥tra,' &c.). This is the case at the Full-moon sacrifice, whilst at the New-moon sacrifice the two butter-portions  are said to be 'vr̥dhanvant,' or 'relating to growth,' because the anuvākyās used on that occasion are two verses containing forms of the root vr̥dh, 'to grow,' viz. VIII, 44, 12 (agniḥ pratnena manmanā . . . kavir vipreṇa vāvr̥dhe, 'Agni has grown strong by the old hymn,--as the wise one by the priest') and I, 91, 11 (Soma gīrbhish ṭvā vayaṁ vardhayāmo vacovidaḥ . . ., 'O Soma, we magnify thee (make thee grow) by our songs, skilful in speech'). In the same way the one or the other form is used in different ishṭis. At I, 6, 2, 12, the translation, 'the two butter-portions should be offered to the Vr̥tra-slayer (Indra)' should therefore be altered to 'the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of Vr̥tra' (or, 'are Vr̥tra-slaying').

 Vr̥tra is evil. [The verses, Vāj. S. XIII, 14, 15,] 'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky . . . [^egg_899],' and 'Be thou the leader of the sacrifice and the realm of space (whither thou strivest with auspicious teams: thy light-winning head hast thou raised to the sky, and thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering),' pronounced in a low voice, are the anuvākyā and yājyā of the chief oblation. The one contains (the word) head,' the other (the verb) 'to be,'--for the head, assuredly, is he that shines yonder: thus it is in order to secure him (the Sun); and as to why (the other) contains (the verb) 'to be,'--he thereby secures that which is (the real, truly existent). The Saṁyājyās [^egg_900] are two virāj-verses [^egg_901]; for that--to wit, the Virāj--is the metre

It is doubtless the two former verses, commonly employed at special ishṭis (cf. part i, p. 164, note 3), which are to be used on the present occasion.

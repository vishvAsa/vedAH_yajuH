1. They now fix pegs round it [^egg_1157],--a Palāśa (Butea frondosa) one in front,--for the Palāśa is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes him go to the heavenly world with the Brahman for his leader;--a Śamī (Prosopis spicigera) one on the left (north corner), in order that there may be peace (śam) for him;--a Varaṇa (Crataeva Roxburghii) one behind, in order that he may ward off (vāraya) sin from him;--

[^egg_1157]: 436:3 According to Kāty. Sr. XXI, the pegs are driven in immediately after the measuring, and prior to the sweeping, of the site of the tumulus; and this must certainly be the case, seeing that the cords by which the site is enclosed (XIII, 8, 1, 19) are fastened to the pegs.

and a Vr̥tra-peg [^egg_1158] on the right (south corner) for sin not to pass beyond.

[^egg_1158]: 437:1 The exact meaning of 'vr̥tra-śaṅku' is doubtful. Kāty. Śr. XXI, 3, 31 has 'deha-śaṅku' instead, to which the commentary assigns the rather improbable meaning of 'stone-pillar,' in favour of which he refers to IV, 2, 5, 15 of our Brāhmaṇa--'Soma, in truth, was Vr̥tra: the mountains and stones are his body; 'whence he makes 'vr̥tra' = 'aśman' (stone).

2. On the right (south) side they then dig two somewhat curved (furrows [^egg_1159]), and fill them with milk and water,--these, indeed, are two inexhaustible streams (that) flow to him in the other world;--and seven (they dig) on the left (north) side, and fill them with water, for sin not to pass beyond, for indeed sin cannot pass beyond seven rivers [^egg_1160].

[^egg_1159]: 437:2 Or narrow trenches or ditches--kuṭile karshū, Kāty. XXI, 4, 20. They are apparently semicircular, probably with their open part towards the grave.

[^egg_1160]: 437:3 These seven furrows are straight, running from west to east; thus separating the grave from the north, the world of men.

5. They bathe at any place where there is water. With (Vāj. S.

6. And if it be standing water, it makes their (the bathers’) evil stop; and if it flows, it carries away their evil. Having bathed, and put on garments that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox [^egg_1163], and return (to their home),--for the ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni they thus return from the world of the Fathers to the world of the living. And Agni, indeed, is he who leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it is he who leads these over.

[^egg_1163]: 438:1 That is to say, one of them takes hold of the tail, whilst the others follow in single file, each holding on to the one walking in front of him. Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 21, note, refers to the somewhat analogous practice of tying to the left arm of a dead man the tail of the anustaraṇī-cow slain at the funeral sacrifice, whereby the deceased is supposed to be led safely--across the river Vaitaraṇī (Styx); see Sāy. on Shaḍv. Br., as quoted Ind. Stud. I, p. 39; cf. also Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, second ed., p. 192--to the world of the Fathers. According to Katy. XXI, 4, 24 the ceremony of taking hold of the tail is performed with the verse, Vāj. S. XXXV, 53, 'For our well-being we hold on to the ox, sprung from Surabhi: even as Indra to the gods, so be thou a saving leader unto us!'

7. They proceed (towards the village) muttering this verse (Vāj. S.

When they have arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such, indeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off death from themselves.

Then, in the house, having made up the (domestic) fire, and laid enclosing-sticks of Varaṇa wood round it, he offers, by means of a sruva-spoon of Varaṇa wood, an oblation to Agni Āyushmat [^egg_1165], for Agni Āyushmat rules over vital power: it is of him he asks vital power for these (the Sacrificer's family). [Vāj. S. XXXV, 16,] 'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers to flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity. far from us),' serves as invitatory formula.

[^egg_1168]: 440:3 Viz. the Adhvaryu, according to Mahīdhara on Vāj. S. XXXV, 15. According to Katy. XXI, 4, 25, this ceremony takes place whilst they are on their way back from the grave to the village; as indeed appears from the order in which the formula used appears in the Vāj. Saṁhitā. It is difficult to see why the author should not have given it in its right place, unless it was done with a view to a good conclusion to the Kāṇḍa, or because he really wished it to he done after the performance of the offering. It is scarcely necessary to assume that this Kaṇḍikā is a later addition, perhaps based on the Kāṇva recension.

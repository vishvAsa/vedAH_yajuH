1. [Vāj. S. XXII, 22 [^egg_739]], 'In the priestly office (brahman) may the Brāhmaṇa be born, endowed with spiritual lustre (brahmavarcasa):' on the Brāhmaṇa he thereby bestows spiritual lustre, whence of old the Brāhmaṇa was born as one endowed with spiritual lustre [^egg_740].

[^egg_739]: 294:1 These formulas are muttered after the thirteen samidhs have been put in the ukhā, or fire-pan. See p. 290, note 1.

[^egg_740]: 294:2 'Whence formerly a Brāhmaṇa was at once born as Brahmavarcasin (whilst now he must study),' Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 287. Perhaps, however, 'purā' has here (as it certainly has in the following paragraphs) the force of 'agre'--at the beginning, from the first, from of old.

[^egg_741]: 294:3 I take 'śauryam mahimānam' here (and 'jaitraṁ mahimānam' in paragraph 7) to stand in apposition to one another, with something of the force of a compound word. See above, p. 66, note 4.

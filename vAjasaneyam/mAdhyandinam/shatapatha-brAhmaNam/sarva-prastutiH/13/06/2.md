1. And as to why it is called Purushamedha:--The stronghold (pur) doubtless is these worlds, and the Purusha (spirit) is he that blows here (the wind), he bides (śī) in this stronghold (pur): hence he is the Purusha. And whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food; and inasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called) Purushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes [^egg_1059] men (purusha) meet for sacrifice (medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.

3. He seizes them by decades [^egg_1060] for the obtainment

[^egg_1060]: 407:2 The statement in paragraphs 3 and 4, according to which there are eleven decades of human victims, does not refer to the actual distribution of victims over the eleven stakes, but it is apparently made purely for symbolical reasons (viz. with reference to the Virāj and Trishṭubh metres), and is probably based on the way in which the victims are enumerated in the Vājasaneyi-saṁhitā, XXX, 5-22 (see the Translation at the end of this chapter, where they are, however, numbered according to the stakes). There the first eleven Kaṇḍikās (5-15) are made up of the names and deities of ten victims each, hence together of eleven decades; whilst of the subsequent Kaṇḍikās--k. 16 consists of twelve, ks. 17-22 of ten each, and k. 22 of twelve victims. The actual mode of distribution over the several stakes is that referred to in paragraphs 5-8, viz. the first forty-eight victims are tied to the central stake, after which eleven victims are tied to each of the other ten stakes. After these, amounting to 258 victims, the Saṁhitā  enumerates twenty-six additional victims, which, according to Mahīdhara (cf. Kāty. XXI, 1, so), are to be added to the eleven victims of the second stake,--viz. fourteen victims dedicated to various so-called deities; eight victims, sacred to Prajāpati and belonging neither to the Śūdra nor to the Brāhmaṇa castes; and finally four more victims, characterised in exactly the same way as the eight preceding ones. It will be seen that of these twenty-six victims only the first set of (eight) Prājāpatya victims are referred to in the Brāhmaṇa, and that as the victims seized last of all. This circumstance clearly characterises the last four victims of the Saṁhitā as not recognised by the Brāhmaṇa; and seeing that all four of these are such as have already occurred amongst the previously enumerated victims (though there assigned to different divinities) they must be considered (as they are by Prof. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 68) as having been added to the list of the Saṁhitā subsequently to the composition of the Brāhmaṇa. A similar inference will probably apply to the fourteen victims preceding the eight Prājāpatya ones, though all that can be urged against them is that they are not referred to in the Brāhmaṇa.

of all food, for the Virāj consists of ten syllables, and the Virāj is all food [^egg_1061].

1. He then lays down a Lokampr̥ṇā [^egg_233] (space-filling brick); the Lokampr̥ṇā, doubtless, is yonder

[^egg_233]: 131:2 In laying down the Lokampr̥ṇās of the fifth layer, he begins, as in the first layer, from the right shoulder, or the south-east corner, of the altar, but so that in this case the first 'space-filler' is laid down, not at the corner, but a cubit to the west of it. Starting from that spot, he fills up the available spaces, in two turns, moving in the sunwise fashion.

sun, for he fills these worlds: it is thus yonder sun he thereby sets up. He lays down this (Lokampr̥ṇā) in all the (five) layers, for those layers are these (three) worlds [^egg_234]: he thus places the sun in (all) these worlds, whence he shines for all these worlds.

[^egg_234]: 132:1 Rather, the first, second, and third layers are the three worlds.

2. And, again, as to why he lays down a Lokampr̥ṇā,--the Lokampr̥ṇā, doubtless, is the nobility (or chieftaincy) [^egg_235], and these other bricks are the peasants (or clansmen): he thus places the nobility (or chieftain), as the eater, among the peasantry. He lays it down in all the layers: he thus places the nobility, as the eater, among the whole peasantry (or in every clan).

[^egg_235]: 132:2 At VI, 1, 2, 25 Tāṇḍya was made to maintain that the Yajushmatīs, or bricks laid down with special formulas, were the nobility, and that the Lokampr̥ṇās, laid down with one and the same formula, were the peasants, and as the noble (or chieftain) required a numerous clan for his subsistence, there should be fewer of the former kind of bricks, than the established practice was. This view was however rejected by the author of the Brāhmaṇa, and here, in opposition to that view, the Lokampr̥ṇā is identified with the nobility, and the Yajushmatīs with the clan.

3. Now this is only a single (brick): he thus makes the nobility (or the chieftaincy) and (social) distinction to attach to a single (person). And what second (such brick there is) that is its mate,--a mate, doubtless, is one half of one's own self, for when one is with a mate then he is whole and complete: (thus it is laid down) for the sake of completeness. With a single formula he lays down many bricks [^egg_236]: he thereby endows the nobility preeminently

[^egg_236]: 132:3 The common formula used with these bricks, and from which they derive their name--beginning as it does 'Lokam pr̥ṇa,' 'Fill the space!' see parag. 6--is pronounced once only after every ten such bricks, and after any odd ones at the end.

with power [^egg_237], and makes the nobility more powerful than the peasantry. And the other (bricks) he lays down singly, with separate formulas: he thereby makes the peasantry less powerful than the nobility, differing in speech, and of different thoughts (from one another).

[^egg_237]: 133:1 In the translation of VII, 5, 2, 14 (part iii, p. 404), the passage 'having taken possession of the man by strength,' which was based on a wrong reading (see Weber, Berl. Cat. II, p. 69), should read thus: 'having pre-eminently endowed man with power' (or, perhaps, 'having placed him above (others) in respect of power,' St. Petersb. Dict.)

4. The first two (Lokampr̥ṇās) he lays down in that (south-east) corner: he thereby places yonder sun in that quarter: from this (earth) he follows him (the sun) from that (place) there [^egg_238]; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows hire from that (place) there; from this (earth) he follows him from that (place) there.

[^egg_238]: 133:2 I do not know whether 'atas' might be taken here in the sense of 'thither,' or whether it goes along with 'tasmāt,' merely strengthening it. The meaning in either case would seem to be this. In the first turn of filling up the empty spaces he first moves along from the south-east corner (the point where the sun rises) to the back or west end of the spine (the place where the sun sets) and the central brick; and having thus, as it were, touched the earth again, he proceeds from there in the same sunwise fashion, filling up the north part of the altar until he reaches the east end of the spine, and there, as it were, touches the earth once more. In the second turn he again begins (with the second brick) in the south-east, and repeats the same process, in filling up the south part of the altar, and completing at the southeast corner. The laying down of the Lokampr̥ṇās would thus be supposed to occupy the full space of two days and two nights.

5. And in whatever place he lays down the first two (bricks), let him there lay down alongside of

them the last two (bricks): for (otherwise) having once revolved round these worlds, that sun would not pass by them. Let him lay down the two last alongside the two first by reaching over them: he thus causes that sun to pass by these worlds; and hence that sun revolves incessantly round these worlds again and again (from left) to right.

6. [He lays them down, with, Vāj. S. XV, 59], 'Fill the space! fill the gap!'--that is, 'fill up the space! fill up the gap;'--'and lie thou steady!'--that is, 'and lie thou firm, settled!'--'Indra and Agni, and Br̥haspati, have settled thee in this womb;' that is, 'Indra and Agni, and Br̥haspati, have established thee in this womb.' Thus (he establishes them) by an anushṭubh verse; for the Anushṭubh is speech, and Indra is speech, and the space-filler is Indra. He does not settle them, for that (sun) is unsettled. He pronounces the Sūdadohas on them, for the Sūdadohas is vital air: he thus makes him (Agni) continuous and joins him together by means of the vital air.

On the wings and tail (he places) only Lokampr̥ṇās, whence the wings and tail are, as it were, thinner. On the body (of the altar) he places them both lengthwise and crosswise, for the bricks are bones: hence these bones in the body run both lengthwise and crosswise. On the wings and tail (he places them so as to be) turned away (from the body), for in the wings and tail there is not a single transverse bone. And this, indeed, is the difference between a built and an unbuilt (altar): suchlike is the built one, different therefrom the unbuilt one [^egg_239].

To adapt the passage to our own mode of diction, we should have to translate:--Let him not lay down either a broken brick or a black one, lest he should form a sickly body; for a brick which is broken comes to grief, and what is black is of sickly appearance.--In the next sentence of the translation, the direct form of speech has been discarded.

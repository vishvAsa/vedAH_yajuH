are just these (ordinary) stones. The gods, having laid them down, saw them as such: that they were dry stones.

6. They have different preludes, and the same finale [^egg_255]; and as to their having different preludes, it

[^egg_255]: 145:1 These hymn-tunes are given, Sam. Ved. V, p. 487, in the way in which they are here to be chanted. They consist entirely of the respective words, separated four times by musical interjections (stobhas) inserted between them, ending with the common finale: thus, (r) bhūḥ--bhūḥ--hoyi--bhūḥ--hoyi--bhūḥ--hā~ūvā~e--suvarjyotī~ḥ; (2) bhuvāḥ--bhuvaḥ--hoyi--bhuvaḥ--hā~ūvā~e--suvarjyotī~ḥ; (3) suvāḥ--suvaḥ--hoyi--suvaḥ--hoyi--suvaḥ--hā~ūvā~e--suvarjyotī~ḥ. Along with these, as to be chanted on the same model, are given, (4) the 'satyaṁ sāman,' beginning 'satyām--satyam--hoyi' &c., and  (5) the 'purusha-sāman,' beginning 'purushāḥ--purusha--hoyi' &c.; which are similarly chanted by the Sacrificer at the beginning of the first layer, when laying down the lotus leaf (part iii, p. 363, where note 1 should be corrected in accordance with the present note), and the gold man (ib. p. 369, where the note requires likewise to be corrected), as the 'citre gāyati,' 'he sings on the bright one,' of the text cannot refer to the 'Citra-sāman' there referred to. Cf. Lāṭy. S. I, 5, 8.--In regard to these sāmans (hymn-verses), the text might lead one to suppose that they only consist of two, instead of the usual four parts (omitting the intermediate Udgītha and Pratihāra, cf. part ii, p. 310 note). The sāman being, however, sung by the Sacrificer himself, the usual distinction into parts to be performed by different chanters was probably dispensed with.

is because they (the gods) saw them separately; and as to their having the same finale (nidhana), it is because there is only one foundation, only one finale to the sacrifice--even heaven: therefore they have 'svar-jyotis (heaven-light)' for their finale.

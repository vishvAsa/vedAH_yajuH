1. 'The he-goat is vigour [^egg_92],'--the he-goat he overtook by his vigour;--'gapless the metre,'--

[^egg_92]: 37:1 Mahīdhara, in accordance with the explanation added by the Brāhmaṇa to this and the corresponding formulas in the succeeding paragraphs, takes vayas' as a defective instrumental (vayasā). It is, however, very doubtful whether such an interpretation of the formula was intended by the author of the Brāhmaṇa.

the gapless metre, doubtless, is the Ekapadā: in the form of Ekapadā (metre) the goats indeed went forth (from Prajāpati).

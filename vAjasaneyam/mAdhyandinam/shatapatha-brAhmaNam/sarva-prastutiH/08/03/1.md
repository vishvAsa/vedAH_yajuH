[^egg_97]: 41:4 For the connection of these deities with the third layer, and the  air, see also VI, 2, 3, 3. Viśvakarman is likewise the deity by which the Viśvajyotis-brick, representing Vāyu (the wind), the regent of the air-world, is settled; see VIII, 3, 2, 3.

11. He then lays down (five) Diśyā (regional bricks) [^egg_102]. Now the regional ones, doubtless, are

[^egg_102]: 43:4 The five Diśyās are placed on the spines in the four directions at the retaḥsic range, just over where the five Vaiśvadevī bricks were placed in the second layer (see the sketch, p. 24). Between them and the central (naturally-perforated) brick there is thus an  empty space a foot square, and the two southern Diśyās are half-bricks lying north and south of each other.

the regions: it is the regions he thus bestows (on the air-world). And these are those same regions not separated (from the air) wherewith Vāyu on that occasion [^egg_103] stepped nigh: it is them he thereby bestows. But prior to these same (bricks) he lays down [^egg_104] both the bunch of Darbha grass and the clod-bricks; and these (diśyās) being yonder sun [^egg_105], he thus places yonder sun over the regions, and builds him up upon (or, in) the regions. But were these (laid down) at the same time (as the bunch of grass and the clod-bricks), they would be outside (of the altar); and outside of the womb (foundation), indeed, is that sacrificial work regarding the fire-altar which is done prior to the lotus-leaf [^egg_106]. When he

[^egg_103]: 44:1 See VI, 2, 3, 4. The second naturally-perforated brick represents the air-world with which Vāyu, the wind, is most closely associated.

[^egg_104]: 44:2 That is to say, he laid them down on the site of the altar, before the first layer was commenced, viz. the darbha-bunch in the centre of the 'body' of the altar, where the two spines (anūka) intersect each other (VII, 2, 3, 1 seqq.); and the clod-bricks (logeshṭakā) on the four ends of the two spines (VII, 3, 1, 23 seqq.), that is, in the middle of each of the four sides of the square of which the body' consists.

[^egg_105]: 44:3 The symbolic interpretation here seems somewhat confused, inasmuch as the Diśyās, which are now apparently identified with the sun, have just been stated to represent the regions. At VI, 7, 1, 17 the sun was represented as the central point of the universe to which these three worlds are linked by means of the quarters (as by the strings of a scale). The clod-bricks, on the other hand, were indeed, in VII, 3, I, 13, identified with the regions (quarters); and the bunch of grass, being laid down in the centre, might be regarded as marking the fifth region, that upwards from here. Cf. IX, 5, 1, 36.

[^egg_106]: 44:4 The lotus-leaf is placed in the centre of the altar when the first layer is about to be laid down. See VII, 4, 1, 7 seqq., where  it is explained as representing the foundation of the fire-altar, or rather, the womb whence Agni is born.

now brings and lays down these (bricks), he thereby establishes them in the womb, on the lotus-leaf, and thus these (bricks) are not outside (the fire-altar). He lays them down so as not to be separated [^egg_107] from the naturally-perforated one; for the middle [^egg_108] naturally-perforated one is the air: he thus places the regions so as not to be separate from the air. Subsequently [^egg_109] (to the central brick he lays them down): subsequently to the air he thus sets up the regions. In all (four) directions he places them: he thus places the regions (quarters) in all directions, whence the regions are in all (four) directions. [He places them] on all sides so as to face each other: he thereby makes the regions on all sides face each other, and hence the regions on all sides face each other [^egg_110].

[^egg_107]: 45:1 That is, not separated therefrom by other special bricks; though the full space of one brick is left between the Diśyās and the central brick. Perhaps, however, 'anantarhita' here means 'immediately after.'

[^egg_108]: 45:2 That is, the second of the three svayam-ātr̥ṇṇās, the one in the third layer.

[^egg_109]: 45:3 Uttara seems here and elsewhere to have a double meaning, viz. that of subsequent, and upper, or left, inasmuch as looking towards these bricks from the centre of the altar, they are placed to the left of the particular section of the anūkas.

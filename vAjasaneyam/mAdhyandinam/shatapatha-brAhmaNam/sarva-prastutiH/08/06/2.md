1. He lays down Chandasyās [^egg_199] (bricks pertaining to the metres). Completed now was the entire

[^egg_199]: 109:2 The Chandasyās represent the principal metres, the formulas used in laying down the bricks being composed in the respective metres. They consist of ten sets of three bricks each, representing the ten metres, and an additional (thirty-first) brick representing the Atichandas, or redundant metre. Each of the ten sets consists of a central brick of full size (a foot square) placed on one of the two spines, and flanked on the two sides not in contact with the spines by two half-size bricks, viz.:--1. gāyatrī at the east end of the 'spine'; 2. trishṭubh on the Retaḥsic range (joining the  Gārhapatya on the front, or east, side); 3. jagatī, on the Retaḥsic range (joining the Gārhapatya on the west side); 4. anushṭubh, immediately behind (west) of the preceding set; 5. br̥hatī, immediately in front (east) of the Ashāḍḥā range (on which the ring of Stomabhāgās lies); 6. ushṇih, immediately behind (west of) the Gāyatrīs; 7. kakubh, immediately in front of the br̥hatī bricks; 8. paṅkti, at the right (south) end of the 'cross-spine'; 9. padapaṅkti, at the left (north) end of the 'cross-spine'; 10. the single atichandas, immediately in front (east) of the fifth Asapatnā (see p. 84, note 1); 11. (three) dvipadā at the back, or west, end of the 'spine.'

 Agni (fire-altar). He now wished for distinction [^egg_200]; for, indeed, heretofore he was not equal thereto, that he should sustain distinction; whence people here say even to this day, 'This one is not equal to sustain distinction, either in regard to kingship or to headmanship.' The gods bestowed on him this distinction, these Chandasyās; for the metres (Chandas) are cattle, and cattle are food, and (a position of) distinction is food.

[^egg_200]: 110:1 That is, a position of honour, or dignity (śrī).

2. He lays down triplets, for the beast is threefold--father, mother, son; and, embryo, amnion, chorion; and food also is threefold--ploughing, rain, seed. One of them is an Atichandas [^egg_201] (excessive metre); for even whilst being one, that one is beyond all the metres. And as to that distinction, it is this great hymn of praise [^egg_202]; and as to this great hymn of praise, it is these Chandasyās.

[^egg_201]: 110:2 By the metres, here and in the sequel, we have to understand bricks laid down with verses of the respective metres (Vāj. S. XV, 20 seq.).

[^egg_202]: 110:3 That is, the so-called Great Litany (mahad uktham) recited, by the Hotr̥, in response to the Mahāvrata-sāman, or Chant of the Great Rite, at the midday service of the last but one day--the so-called Mahāvrata day--of the sacrificial session called 'Gavām ayanam,' or 'cows’ walk.' The Great Litany consists of numerous  hymns, and some detached verses and prose formulas; the whole matter recited being stated to amount to as many syllables as would make up a thousand Br̥hatī verses (of thirty-six syllables each)--or 36,000 syllables in all. From an analysis I have made of the Mahad uktham (or Br̥had uktham, as it is also called) as contained in MS. Ind. Off. 1729 D, I find it very difficult to check the accuracy of this statement; my own calculation yielding somewhere about 37,200 syllables. By leaving out of account the prose formulas, as well as certain repetitions, this gross amount might, however, be reduced to something approximating the stated number of syllables; and, indeed, the calculation was probably not meant to be a strictly accurate one. Cf. II, 3, 3, 19, 20 (where read Litany, instead of Chant), part ii, p. 430. See also IX, I, 1, 44; 3, 3, 19; 5, 2, 12.

3. Gāyatrī verses are the head thereof, Trishṭubh verses the body, Jagatī verses the spine, and Paṅkti verses the wings; and of each of those Kakubh verses he takes four syllables [^egg_203], and adds them to

[^egg_203]: 111:1 The three Kakubh verses (Vāj. S. XV, 38-40) consist each of three pādas, of eight, twelve, and eight syllables respectively, making together twenty-eight syllables. In muttering these verses, whilst laying down the Kakubh bricks, he is to omit four syllables from the middle pāda of each verse (so as to make it equal to the other two pādas), and mutter the words thus omitted at the beginning of the verse (XV, 47) used in laying down the Atichandas brick. The syllables omitted make up complete words in each case, viz. 'bhadrā rātiḥ' at the beginning of the middle pāda of the first verse, 'vr̥tratūrye' at the end of the middle pāda of the second verse, and 'ava sthirā' at the beginning of the second pāda of the third verse. The remaining portions of the Kakubh verses consist each of twenty-four syllables, or a Gāyatrī verse. The references here made to the different parts of the Mahad uktham are not quite clear, and seem to point to a somewhat different arrangement of that śastra from that known from the Aitareyāraṇyaka and the Śāṅkhāyana-sūtra. The head, indeed, consists of Gāyatrī verses, viz. R̥g-veda I, 7., either the whole, or, according to some, only certain verses of it; the first three, or nine, verses also forming the opening triplet, or triplets, of the Mahāvrata-sāman, the chanting of which precedes the recitation of the Great Litany.--For the trunk (ātman) consisting of trishṭubh verses, see p. 113, note 1. The Paṅkti verses, on the other hand, said to form the wings, would seem to be R̥g-veda VIII, 40 (consisting of mahāpaṅktis),  which in the Aitareya arrangement forms the thighs, whilst Sāṅkhāyana makes it part of the tail; and the Jagatīs here referred to as constituting the spine would seem to be X, 50, which immediately follows the hymn just referred to, and is not otherwise identified with any special part of the body. The MSS. of Harisvāmin's commentary are unfortunately hopelessly corrupt in this place.

the Atichandas: that is just (what makes) that Atichandas (excessive metre). The others result in Gāyatrīs: this is just that fourscore of Gāyatrīs [^egg_204], the Br̥hatīs (make up) the Bārhata one, and the Ushṇihs the Aushṇiha one. And as to the Vaśa hymn [^egg_205], the two half-verses, the Aindrāgna (hymn), and the insertion, they are Atikḥandas; and as to

[^egg_204]: 112:1 The Great Litany begins with seven sets of hymns and verses, meant symbolically to represent certain parts of Agni-Prajāpati's bird-shaped body which the ceremony is intended to reconstruct, viz. the trunk, neck, head, the roots (sinews) of the wings, the right and left wings, and the tail, between each two of which the so-called Sūdadohas verse (R̥g-veda VIII, 69, 3), meant to represent the vital air pervading the body, is inserted, as it also is between (and before) the succeeding parts. In the first place there follow three eighties of triplets (or, 3 sets of 240 verses each) in the Gāyatrī, Br̥hatī and Ushṇih metres respectively. Then comes the Vaśa hymn representing the belly, and finally a course of recitations (beginning with hymn VIII, 40) forming the thighs. For the part which the number eighty plays in the Agnicayana ceremony, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 167. The term for 'eighty,' viz. 'aśīti,' gives rise to a constant etymological play. Sāyaṇa, on Aitareyāraṇyaka I, 4, 3, 1, takes it in the sense of 'food' (cf. above, VIII, 5, 2, 17); whilst the Āraṇyaka itself takes it in that of 'obtainment':--yad evāsmin loke yaśo, yan maho, yan mithunaṁ, yad annādyaṁ, yā ’pacitis tad aśnavai, tad āpnavāni, tad avaruṇadhai, tan me ’sad iti.

[^egg_205]: 112:2 This is the hymn R̥g-veda VIII, 46, ascribed to Vaśa Aśvya, and remarkable for the variety of metres in which the different verses are composed. In the Aitareya recension of the Mahad uktham (which is followed in the MS. of this śastra referred to in the preceding notes) only the first twenty verses are recited, but verse 15 being divided into two verses, a dvipadā and an ekapadā, they are thus made to consist of twenty-one verses.

the Nada-verse [^egg_206], the Sūdadohas, the pāda-appendages, and whatever Anushṭubh matter there is, they make up the Anushṭubhs.

[^egg_206]: 113:1 The Nada-verse, R̥g-veda VIII, 69, 2 (in the ushṇih metre) deriving its name from its first word 'nadam,' plays a peculiar part in the recitation of the Great Litany. The opening set of recitations, representing the trunk, consists of twenty-two trishṭubh verses; these are recited in such a way that after each pāda (or quarter of a verse) one of the four pādas of the Nada-verse is inserted. The chief object of this insertion seems to be a metrical one, viz. that of making each two pādas (trishṭubh = eleven, and ushṇih = seven syllables) to form half a br̥hatī verse (eighteen syllables), the whole Litany being computed by br̥hatī verses. Moreover, of v. 3 of the first Trishṭubh hymn of this set (R̥g-veda X, 120) only the first two pādas are recited at this stage (whilst the remaining two are recited in different places later on), and this half-verse is followed by a br̥hatī and a satobr̥hatī pāda (VII, 32, 23 c, and VI, 46, 2 c), after which the recitation proceeds with verse 4 of the first hymn. This seems to account for one of the two half-verses here referred to, whilst the other would seem to be VII, 20, 1 a, b, recited later on in the śastra. Cf. Prof. F. Max Müller's translation of Aitareyār., Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 181 seqq.--The Aindrāgna hymn is VIII, 40, 1-9; 11; 12, being the first hymn of the portion representing the thighs. It consists of ten mahāpaṅkti verses (6 × 8 syllables)--each of which is split up into two Gāyatrī verses (3 × 8 syllables)--and one trishṭubh verse.--The chief anushṭubh verses are those of R̥g-veda I, 11, 1-8, which are recited in a peculiar way (towards the end of the śastra), the last pāda of each verse interchanging with the first pāda of the next verse.

That body of his (Agni) is well-made;--and, indeed, for whomsoever they thus make that body of his so as to be well-made, he becomes possessed of that body of his as a well-made one; but for whomsoever they make it otherwise than that, for him they make that body of his so as to be ill-made, and he becomes possessed of an ill-made body.

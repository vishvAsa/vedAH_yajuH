4. Whilst meditating, they saw these Asapatnā ('foeless') bricks; they laid them down, and by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed; and because by means of them they made that world foeless, undisturbed, these (are called) Asapatnās. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, by laying them down, now make that world foeless, undisturbed. On all (four) sides he lays them down: on all sides he thus makes that world foeless, undisturbed. He places them on the other side: he thereby makes that whole world foe-less, undisturbed.

5. He then lays down the Virājs [^egg_168] (far-shining bricks): this Virāj, indeed, is that far-shining (virāj) fifth layer which the gods saw. He lays them down by tens: the Virāj (metre) consists of ten syllables, and this layer is 'virāj.' He places them on every side; for he who shines (rules) in one direction only, does not shine far and wide, but whosoever shines in all directions, he alone shines far and wide.

6. And as to why he lays down those Asapatnās. Now at that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, evil beset Prajāpati on every side. He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) 'foeless' (bricks).

7. And what the gods did, the same is done now. Evil, indeed, does not now beset this (Sacrificer), but when he now does this, it is that he wants to do what the gods did; and he thereby drives off whatever evil, whatever foe besets him; and because, by means of them, he drives off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) the 'foeless' (bricks). He places them on every side: he thereby drives off the foe, evil, on every side. He places them on the other side: from his whole self he thereby drives off the foe, evil.

Their position thus is the same as those of the Āśvinīs in the second layer (see p. 31, note 1) except that these were placed on the Retaḥsic range instead of at the ends of the spines. The line-marks of these four bricks run parallel to the respective spines. The fifth Asapatnā is thus laid down north of the southern one, so as to leave the space of a cubit (about a foot and a half) between them. These latter two Asapatnās are full-sized bricks (one foot square), and not half-sized, as were the two southern Āśvinīs. Moreover, whilst the southern Asapatnā has its line-marks running parallel to the adjoining cross-spine (south to north), the fifth Asapatnā has them running from west to east (? as well as from south to north).

The fifth Asapatnā, lying immediately north of that southern one, thus has its line-marks parallel, not (as one would expect) to the cross-spine, but to the further removed spine.

[^egg_171]: 86:2 This is a doubtful rendering of 'udyāma,' which is accepted by the St. Petersb. Dict. for 'shaḍ-udyāma,' at VI, 7, 1, 16, 18; whilst in the present case 'dakshiṇata-udyāma' seems to be taken by it to mean southward erected, southward drawn (aufgespannt).' Udyāma, in the sense 'extension,' might mean a protruding part, serving as a handle.

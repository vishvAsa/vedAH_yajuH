2. They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed,

they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.

3. They said to the Brahman, 'We will lay thee down (or, set thee up) here!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'Thou shalt be the highest of us!'--'So be it!' They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms) [^egg_130]: the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.

[^egg_130]: 59:1 This refers to the first eighteen bricks of the fourth layer; but as the names of the bricks (ishṭakā, f.) are invariably of the feminine gender, it is doubtful whether stoma (m.), in this case, is meant as the designation of these bricks, or merely as their symbolical analogon. In the former case, one would rather, from the analogy of other bricks, expect some such term as 'stomyā.' To the first four of them Mahīdhara, on Vāj. S. XIV, 23, applies the epithet mr̥tyumohinī, or 'confounders of death.'

4. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that time, said to Prajāpati, 'We will lay thee down here! So be it!' He did not say, 'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Prajāpati wished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom accrue to us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his sons, they say, 'What will therefrom

accrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father, he says, 'So be it!' for in this way Prajāpati and the gods used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Prajāpati also being the vital airs, it is Prajāpati he thus lays down.

At each end of the spine (running from west to east) one brick, of the size of the shank (from knee to ankle), is placed, with its line-marks running from west to east; the eastern one being placed north, and the western one south, of the spine. Thereupon an ordinary brick, a foot square, is placed  at the southern end of the 'cross-spine,' so as to lie on the spine (though not apparently exactly in the middle, but so that only one-fourth of the brick lies on one side of the spine) with its line-marks running from south to north; and a second brick of the same size is placed on the north, but so as to leave the full space of another such brick between it and the northern edge of the altar. Behind (west of) the front brick, fourteen half-foot bricks are then laid down, in a row from north to south, seven on each side of the spine.

21. 'Design, the Ekatriṁśa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless, means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the year itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. And

as to his calling it 'design,' the year indeed designs (makes, forms) all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

22. 'The foundation, the Trayastriṁśa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it 'the foundation,' the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed the foundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his calling it 'the foundation,' the year is indeed the foundation of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.

23. 'The range of the ruddy one, the Catustriṁśa!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of the ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the thirty-four-fold. And as to his calling it 'the range of the ruddy one,' the range of the ruddy one, doubtless, means supreme sway, and the thirty-four-fold one means supreme sway: it is that form he now lays down.

But the firmament, the thirty-six-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-moons, and twelve months. And as to why he calls it 'the firmament' (nākam), it is because there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes there. And the firmament indeed is the year, the heavenly world is the year: it is that form he now lays down.

26. 'The stay, the Catushṭoma!' he therewith lays down the chant of praise consisting of four stomas [^egg_136]. And as to his calling it 'the stay,'--stay means support, and the Catushṭoma is a support. But the stay, the Catushṭoma, doubtless, is Vāyu (the wind), for he sings from all those four quarters. And as to his calling him 'the stay,'--stay means support; and the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he now lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus encloses all these beings on both sides.

28. And as to why there are eighteen,--the year is eighteenfold: twelve months and six seasons. And Prajāpati indeed is the year, Prajāpati is eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he makes it when he lays it down.

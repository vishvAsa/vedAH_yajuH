2. He spake unto the vital airs [^egg_143], 'Together with you, I will here bring forth creatures!'--'Wherewith shall we sing praises [^egg_144]?'--'With me and with

[^egg_143]: 72:1 That is, to the deities representing the vital airs, viz. the regions, &c. Mahīdh.

[^egg_144]: 72:2 Professor Delbrück, in his Altindische Syntax, pp. 136, 257, 265, takes 'stoshyāmahe' in this passage in a passive sense--'by whom shall we be praised?' I think, however, that this is a mistake, and Harisvāmin's commentary certainly takes it in the same sense as I have done; and, indeed, the paragraphs which follow seem to me to make it quite clear that no other interpretation is possible. Prajāpati is about to perform the 'sr̥shṭis,' i. e. the creation of living beings by means of sacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Prāṇas (vital airs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he also appeals to (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as R̥shis (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udgātr̥) priests. They ask, 'Wherewith shall we sing praises?' and he answers, 'With me and with your own selves.' The wherewith,' according to Harisvāmin, refers both to the 'stotriyā' verses to be used, and to the deities of the sr̥shṭi-stotras. That the former, at all events, is indeed the case, a glance at the subsequent paragraphs shows, where the stotriyās are identified with the vital airs, and, when their number (ten) becomes exhausted, with parts of the year (Prajāpati), and of his (the Sacrificer's, or Prajāpati's) body. As regards the deities whom Harisvāmin considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no means improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I looked at the commentary. In the Udgātr̥'s text-books, the chanting of stotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of 'food' (cf., for instance, Tāṇḍya-Br. I, 3, 6, 'annaṁ karishyāmy annaṁ pravishyāmy annaṁ janayishyāmi'), whilst here it seems identified with the production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, 'br̥haspatis tvā yunaktu devebhyaḥ prāṇāya &c.'); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br. X, 3, 1, 1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called 'prajanana-prāṇa.'

yourselves!'--'So be it!' So they sang praises both with the vital airs and with Prajāpati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with praise, that--praise being sacrifice--they do with sacrifice. Hence (the words) 'they sang praises' recur with all (these bricks).

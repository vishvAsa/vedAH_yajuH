24 [^10] . If (the demon bringing disease) Kumāra attacks the boy, the father covers him with a net or with an upper garment, takes him on his lap, and murmurs: Kūrkura, Sukūrkura, Kūrkura, who holds fast children. Cet! cet! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sīsara, barker, bender.


[^10]:  Kūrkura seems to me, and this is also Professor Stenzler's p. 297 opinion, identical with kurkura, kukkura ('dog'). The Petersburg Dictionary explains it, 'Name eines die Kinder bedrohenden Dämons (vielleicht eine Personification des Hustens).'


'That is true that the gods have given a boon to thee. Hast thou then chosen even this boy?

'Cet! cet! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sīsara, barker, bender.

'That is true that (the divine she-dog) Saramā is thy mother, Sīsara thy father, the black and the speckled (two dogs of Yama) thy brothers.

'Cet! cet! doggy! let him loose. Reverence be to thee, the Sīsara, barker, bender.'

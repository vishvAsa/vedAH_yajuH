1 [^1] . Beginning from the wedding the worshipping of the Aupāsana (i.e. sacred domestic) fire (is prescribed).


[^1]:  9, 1. The expression which I have translated 'beginning from the wedding' is upayamanaprabhṛti. The Indian commentators and Professor Stenzler explain the term upayamana as implying a reference to the Sūtra I, 1, 4, upayamanān kuśān ādāya ('having taken up the Kuśa blades with which he is to take hold of the lower surface of the Ājya pot'). 'The worshipping of the domestic fire,' says Stenzler, following the native authorities, 'consists in the rites which have been prescribed above (I, 1, 4), beginning from the word upayamana, i.e. in the taking up of the Kuśa blades, the putting of wood on the fire, the sprinkling and sacrificing. As the rites preceding that word, such as the preparation of the sacrificial spoon (I, 1, 3), are hereby excluded, the oblations are offered with the hand.' It would be easy to show that the upayamanāḥ kuśāḥ have nothing at all to do with the regular morning and evening oblations of which these Sūtras treat. The comparison of Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 9, 1 (see also Manu III, 67, &c.) leaves no doubt that upayamana is to be understood here as derived from upayacchati in its very frequent meaning of marrying. I have translated the Sūtra accordingly.

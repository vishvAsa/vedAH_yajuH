10 [^5] . (The Abhyātāna formulas run thus): 'May Agni, the lord of beings, protect me. May Indra, (the lord) of the noblest, Yama, of the earth, Vāyu, of the air, the Sun, of heaven, the Moon, of the Nakṣatras, Bṛhaspati, of the Brahman, Mitra, of truth, Varuṇa, of the waters, the sea, of the rivers, food, the lord of royalty, protect me. May Soma, (the lord) of herbs, Savitṛ, of impulses, Rudra, of cattle, Tvaṣṭṛ, of forms, Viṣṇu, of mountains, the Maruts, the lords of hosts, protect me. May the fathers, the grandfathers, the former, the later, the fathers, the grandfathers protect me here in this power of holiness, in this worldly power, in this prayer, in this Purohitaship, in this sacrifice, in this invocation of the gods. Svāhā!' - this is added each time.


[^5]:  The words, 'in this power of holiness . . . svāhā!' are to be added to each member of the whole formula (comp. Atharva-veda V, 24). The expressions 'fathers' and 'grandfathers,' which are twice identically repeated in the translation, stand the first time for pitaraḥ pitāmahāḥ, and then for tatās tatāmahāḥ of the Sanskrit text.

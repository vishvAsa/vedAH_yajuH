6 [^6] . Because the Śruti says, 'There are five great sacrifices.'


[^6]:  Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI, 5, 6, 1: 'There are five great sacrifices which are great Sattras, viz. the sacrifice to living beings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Manes, the sacrifice to the gods, the Brahmayajña.' As the Gṛhya ceremonies are included here under the category of mahāyajñās or great sacrifices, they require, according to the teachers whose opinion is stated in Sūtra 5, a form of the Agnyādhāna (setting up of the sacred fire) analogous to the Agnyādhāna of the Śrauta ritual, and containing, like that Ādhāna, the act of the Araṇipradāna or handing over of the kindling woods (Sūtra 5).

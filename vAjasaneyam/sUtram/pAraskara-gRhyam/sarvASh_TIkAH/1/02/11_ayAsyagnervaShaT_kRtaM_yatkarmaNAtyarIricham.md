11 [^9] . With (the formulas), 'Into the quick one (has been put) Agni's (sacrificial portion) over which the word vaṣaṭ has been spoken;' 'What I have done too much;' 'O gods who know the way.'


[^9]:  Professor Stenzler, following Jayarāma, takes the whole as one Mantra, which he translates: 'Ungehemmet sei Agni's Spende, die durch die That ich überreich machte, bahnschaffende Götter!' But the words yat karmaṇātyarīricam are the opening words of a Mantra quoted Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XIV, 9, 4, 24, (comp. also Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 10, 23; the connection in which atyarīricam there stands, shows that the word designates a mistake made in the sacrificial work by doing too much.) The words devā gātuvidaḥ are the Pratīka of Vāj. Saṃhitā VIII, 21. Thus I have no doubt that also ayāsy Agner vaṣaṭkṛtam (or possibly ayāsy Agner (?) and vaṣaṭkṛtam (?)) is a Pratīka. Of course, the translation of these words must remain uncertain until the Mantra to which they belong has been discovered.

5 [^3] . And he puts gall of a tortoise on her lap.


[^3]:  The commentators state that kūrmapitta (gall of tortoise) means 'a dish with water.' I place no confidence in this statement, though I cannot show at present what its origin is. I am not sure about the translation of vikṛtyā (or vikṛtya?). But it seems impossible to me that it should be the name of the metre Vikṛti. 'Steps of Viṣṇu' is a name for the Yajus following in the Saṃhitā on the one prescribed in this Sūtra. It begins, 'Viṣṇu’s step art thou, &c.' (Vāj. Saṃh. XII, 5).


If he desires; 'May (the son) become valiant,' he recites over him (i.e. over the embryo), modifying the rite (?), 'The Suparṇa art thou' (Vāj. Saṃh. XII, 4), (the Yajus) before (the formulas called) 'steps of Viṣṇu.'

2 [^1] . Having cooked milk-rice for Indra and cakes, and having put cakes round (the fire), he sacrifices the two Ājya portions and Ājya oblations to Indra, to Indrāṇī, to Aja Ekapad, to Ahi Budhnya, and to the Proṣṭhapadās.


[^1]:  15, 2. After these Ājya oblations follows the chief oblation of the whole sacrifice, the oblation of milk-rice to Indra. In one of Professor Stenzler's MSS. there is a special Sūtra inserted after Sūtra 2, 'Of the cooked food he makes an oblation with (the formula), "To Indra svāhā."' I do not, however, think it right to receive this Sūtra into the text, as the other MSS. do not support it, and the commentators did not find it in the text which they read.

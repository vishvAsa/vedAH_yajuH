11 [^4] . Taking the Brāhmaṇa's portion (of the food which he is going to distribute), he should give it to a Brāhmaṇa, after he has made him wash himself, with (the words), 'Well! (this) to thee!'


[^4]:  What I have translated 'the Brāhmaṇa's portion' is agra. See on this word the remark of Nīlakaṇṭha quoted by Böhtlingk-Roth sv. agrahāra: agraṃ brāhmaṇabhojanaṃ, tadarthaṃ hriyante rājadhanāt pṛthakkriyante teऽgrahārāḥ kṣetrādayaḥ. According to different commentators and lexicographers one Agra is equal to four or to sixteen mouthfuls of food.

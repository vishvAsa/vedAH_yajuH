15 [^6] . After he has made them wash themselves as above, he combs them with combs (with the formulas)


[^6]:  The words as above refer to Sūtra 11. Pralikhati, which I have translated 'he combs them,' is the same act for which Sāṅkhāyana (IV, 15, 7) says, phaṇena ceṣṭayati. I think Professor Stenzler is wrong in translating: Er scharrt (das Mehl) mit Kämmen zusammen. Jayarāma says: pralekhanaṃ ca krameṇa pratimantram balikaṇḍūyanaṃ kaṅkataiḥ. tāni ca vaikaṅkatīyāni prādeśamātrāṇy ekatodantāni kāṣṭhāni bhavanti.

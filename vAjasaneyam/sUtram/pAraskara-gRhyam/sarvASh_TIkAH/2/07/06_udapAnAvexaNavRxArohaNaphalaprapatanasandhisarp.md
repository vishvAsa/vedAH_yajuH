6 [^4] . He shall avoid looking into a well, climbing up a tree, gathering fruits, crawling through narrow openings, bathing naked, jumping over uneven ground, using harsh language, looking at the sun while it is rising or setting, and begging. For there is a Śruti: 'After he has bathed, he should not beg. For he who bathes, drives away from himself begging.'


[^4]:  The passage of the Śruti quoted is found in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI, 3, 3, 7. Comp. Vasiṣṭha XII, 2, 10, 25; Gautama IX, 32, 61, &c.

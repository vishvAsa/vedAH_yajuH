5 [^3] . Or (he may) not (do so), because (that verse) has been prescribed for (the erection of) the Agni (-altar), and the act of sowing stands in connection (with it).


[^3]:  At the Agni-cayana ceremony furrows are drawn with the plough on the Agni-kṣetra with the verses Vāj. Saṃh. XII, 69-7 2. Afterwards grains of different kinds are sown. See Kātyāyana XVII, 2, 12; 3, 8; Indische Studien, XIII, 244 seq. Thus in the Śrauta ritual the verse Vāj. Saṃh. XII, 69 stands in a connection which does not conform to the occasion for which it would be used here.

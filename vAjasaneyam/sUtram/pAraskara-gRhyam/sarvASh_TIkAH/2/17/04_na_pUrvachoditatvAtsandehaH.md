4 [^3] . (There should be) no doubt (as to whether rice or barley is to be taken), as a rule thereon has been stated above.


[^3]:  A rule has been given in the Śrauta-sūtra (Kāty. I, 9, 1: 'Rice or barley, if a Havis [is prescribed]') which shows that it is indifferent whether rice or barley is taken. Thus the sacrificer is free to elect the one or the other. At least this is the traditional meaning of this Sūtra. But possibly we had better understand it otherwise. The sacrificer should offer, according to Sūtra 3, rice or barley. Whether he has to take the one or the other, there can be no doubt, as the rule given above (Sūtra 2) shows that rice should be cooked, if the ceremony is performed for a rice-field, and barley, if for a barley-field.

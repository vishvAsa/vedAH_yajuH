9. 'For whom earth and heaven, the intermediate points and the chief points (of the horizon) are veiled with light, that Indra I invoke here. May his weapons be friendly towards us. Svāhā!

'Whatsoever it be that I wish for at this sacrifice, O killer of Vṛtra, may all that be fulfilled to me, and may I live a hundred autumns. Svāhā!

'May success, prosperity, earth, rain, eminence, excellence, luck here protect the creatures. Svāhā!

'In whose substance dwells the prosperity of all Vedic and worldly works, Indra's wife Sītā I invoke. May she not abandon me in whatever work I do. Svāhā!

Her, who rich in horses, rich in cows, rich in delight indefatigably supports living beings, Urvarā (i.e. the field) who is wreathed with threshing-floors, I invoke at this sacrifice, the firm One. May she not abandon me. Svāhā!

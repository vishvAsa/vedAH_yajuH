14 [^5] . Then to the south with (the Mantra), 'They who are sitting towards the south, not winking the eyes, wearing armour, may they protect thee from the south, and be vigilant and not abandon thee. To them I bring adoration, and I offer this Bali to them.'


[^5]:  Some words in the beginning of the Mantra are lost. We should probably write: atha dakṣiṇataḥ. ye dakṣiṇatoऽnimiṣāḥ . . . varmiṇa āsate, &c. Of course it is impossible to say which is the word that is wanting before (or perhaps after) varmiṇaḥ.

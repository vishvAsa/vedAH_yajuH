43 [^12] . Of such persons those who desire to receive the sacrament, may perform the sacrifice of Vrātyastoma and then study the Veda, if they like. For (of persons who have done that) it is said, 'Intercourse with them is permitted.'


[^12]:  Kātyāyana, after having given the rules on the Vrātyastoma sacrifice (see Weber, Indische Literaturgeschichte, 2nd edition, pp. 73 seq.), says: 'Intercourse with them (who have performed that sacrifice) is permitted' (Śraut. XXII, 4, 28).

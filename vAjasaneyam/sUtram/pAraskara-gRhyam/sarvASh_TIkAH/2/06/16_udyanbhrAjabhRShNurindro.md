16 [^7] . With (the formulas), 'Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the morning. Thou art a tenfold winner; make me a tenfold winner. Make me attain to renown.


[^7]:  In the Mantra the Pāraskara MSS. give bhrājabhṛṣṇuḥ and bhrājabhṛṣṭiḥ, and the Gobhila MSS. (Gṛhya III, 4) bhrājabhṛṣṭibhiḥ. Possibly the instrumental case is right. Böhtlingk and Roth propose to read bhrājadṛṣṭiḥ.


Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in day-time. Thou art a hundredfold winner; make me a hundredfold winner. Make me attain to renown.

Rising, bearing a shining spear, Indra stands with the Maruts; he stands with the gods who walk in the evening. Thou art a thousandfold winner; make me a thousandfold winner. Make me attain to renown.'

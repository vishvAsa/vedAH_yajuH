12 [^6] . (A second time he draws water out of a second of the eight vessels with the formula given in Sūtra 10, putting instead of the words, 'The shining one, &c.,' the verse): 'By which you have created prosperity, by which you have touched surā, with which you have anointed the eyes, which is your' glory, O Aśvins.'


[^6]:  The reading of the Mantra seems to be corrupt. Compare the form in which it is given by Bhavadeva, quoted in Professor Stenzler's note on this Sūtra. Instead of śriyam we have probably to read, as Bhavadeva has, striyam; instead of akṣyau, akṣān. Professor Stenzler very pertinently compares Atharva-veda XIV, 1, 35. 36. Comp. also Mantrabrāhmaṇa I, 7, 5.

13 [^4] . According to some (teachers he accepts the staff) in the way prescribed for the inauguration, because it is said, 'He enters upon a long Sattra (or sacrificial period).'


[^4]:  Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI, 3, 3, 2: 'He enters upon a long Sattra, who enters upon Brahmacarya.' The student, when being initiated, ought to behave, consequently, in the same way as those who receive the inauguration (dīkṣā) for a long Sattra. This is the meaning of this Sūtra. The rules regarding the staff handed over by the Adhvaryu to the Yajamāna at the dīkṣā ceremony are given by Kātyāyana, Śrauta-sūtra VII, 4, 1-4.

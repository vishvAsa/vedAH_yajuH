37 [^12] . The entering and what follows after it is the same (for these persons) as for the others.


[^12]:  The position of this Sūtra after 35, 36 seems to me to indicate that it refers to those who have touched the dead body; comp. Yājñavalkya III, 14: praveśanādikaṃ karma pretasaṃsparśinām api. I believe that the same persons are concerned also in Sūtra 38.

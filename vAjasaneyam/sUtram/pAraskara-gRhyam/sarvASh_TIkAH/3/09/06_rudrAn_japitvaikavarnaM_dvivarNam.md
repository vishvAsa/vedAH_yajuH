6 [^6] . After murmuring the Rudra hymns they adorn a one-coloured or a two-coloured (bull) who protects the herd or whom the herd protects. Or it should be red, deficient in no limb, the calf of a cow that has living calves and is a milk-giver; and it should be the finest (bull) in the herd. And besides they should adorn the best four young cows of the herd and let them loose with this (verse), 'This young (bull) I give you as your husband; run about sporting with him, your lover. Do not bring down a curse upon us, by nature blessed ones. May we rejoice in increase of wealth and in comfort.'


[^6]:  Śāṅkhāyana, §§ 6-54. On the Rudra hymns, see above, chap. 8, § 13. Perhaps the words mā naḥ śāpta are corrupt; the correct reading may possibly be, māऽvasthāta.

13 [^10] . And in the middle of the rainy season (there is) a fourth Aṣṭakā on which vegetables are offered.


[^10]:  I have stated in the note on Śāṅkhāyana III, 13, 1 my reasons for believing that the true reading of this Sūtra is not madhyāvarṣe (in the middle of the rainy season), but māghyavarṣe (the festival celebrated during the rainy season under the Nakṣatra Maghās). There are no express rules given with regard to the third Aṣṭakā, but I think we should understand this Sūtra as involving a statement on that Aṣṭakā: (The third Aṣṭakā) and the fourth, on the Māghyavarṣa day, are Sākāṣṭakās (Aṣṭakās on which vegetables are offered). Śāṅkhāyana (Gṛhya III, 13, 1) declares that the ritual of the fourth Aṣṭakā is identical with that of the second.

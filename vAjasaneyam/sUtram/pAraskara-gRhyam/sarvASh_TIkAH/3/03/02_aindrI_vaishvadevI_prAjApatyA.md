2 [^2] . (The Aṣṭakā is) sacred to Indra, to the Viśve devās, to Prajāpati, and to the Fathers.


[^2]:  As there are four deities named, I think it probable that they are referred to all Aṣṭakās indiscriminately; comp. Āśvalāyana II, 4, 12. Thus in the Mantras prescribed for the first Aṣṭakā (Sūtras 5 and 6), Indra, the Viśve devās, and Prajāpati are named; to the Fathers belongs the Anvaṣṭakya ceremony.

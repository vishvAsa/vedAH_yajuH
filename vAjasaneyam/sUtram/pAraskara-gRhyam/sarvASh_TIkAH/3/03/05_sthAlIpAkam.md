5 [^4] . Having cooked a mess of sacrificial food and having sacrificed the two Ājya portions, he sacrifices Ājya oblations with (the texts):


[^4]:  Comp. Taitt. Saṃhitā IV, 3, 11; Atharva-veda III, 10.


(a [^5] ) 'Thirty sisters go to the appointed place, putting on the same badge. They spread out the seasons, the knowing sages; having the metres in their midst they walk around, the brilliant ones. Svāhā!


[^5]:  (a) The thirty sisters seem to be the days of the month. As to p. 342 madhyechandas, comp. Taitt. Saṃh. loc. cit. § 1: chandasvatī uṣasā pepiśāne; § 2: catuṣṭomo abhavad yā turīyā yajñasya pakṣāv ṛṣayo bhavantī, gāyatrīṃ tṛṣṭubhaṃ jagatīm anuṣṭubham bṛhad arkaṃ yuñjānāḥ suvar āऽbharann idam.


(b) 'The shining one clothes herself with clouds, with the ways of the sun, the divine night: manifold animals which are born, look about in this mother's lap. Svāhā!

(c) 'The Ekāṣṭakā, devoting herself to austerities, has given birth to a child, to the majesty of Indra. Through him the gods have conquered the hostile tribes; he became the killer of the Asuras through his (divine) powers. Svāhā!

(d [^6] ) 'You have made me who am not the younger (sister), the younger; speaking the truth I desire this: may I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.


[^6]:  (d) Probably one Aṣṭakā addresses the others, her sisters, as Jayarāma explains this verse.


(e) 'In my favour dwelt the omniscient one; he has found a firm standing; he has got a footing. May I be in his (i.e. the sacrificer's?) favour, as you are; may none of you supplant the other in her work.

(f [^7] ) 'On the five dawns follows the fivefold milking; on the cow with the five names, the rive seasons. The five regions (of the sky) are established through the fifteenfold (Stoma); with one common face (they look over) the one world. Svāhā!


[^7]:  (f) The explanation by which the 'fivefold milking' is referred to what is called in Taitt. Brāhmaṇa II, 2, 9, 'the milkings of Prajāpati,' seems to me more than doubtful, for 'the milkings p. 342 of Prajāpati' are only four: viz. the dark night, the moonlight, the twilight, and the day.


(g) 'She who shone forth as the first, is the child of truth. One (of them) bears the majesty of the waters; one wanders in the courses of the sun; one (in those) of the heat; Savitṛ shall govern one. Svāhā!

(h) 'She who shone forth as the first has become a cow in Yama's realm. Give us milk, thou who art rich in milk, year by year. Svāhā!

(i [^8] ) 'She, the owner of bright bulls, has come to us with clouds and with light, she who has all shapes, the motley one, whose banner is fire. Carrying on the common work, leading us to old age, come to us thou who art exempt from old age, Uṣas! Svāhā!


[^8]:  (i) Sukra-ṛṣabhā cannot be translated, as Professor Stenzler does, 'die schönste unter den Lichtern' (Mādhava: śukreshu nakṣatrādishu śreṣṭhā), for this meaning of ṛṣabhā occurs only in later texts. The word is a Bahuvrīhi compound, as the Petersburg Dictionary explains it.


(k) 'The consort of the seasons, the first one has come to us, the leader of days, the producer of offspring. Being one, thou shinest manifold, Uṣas. Being free from old age, thou leadest to old age everything else. Svāhā!'

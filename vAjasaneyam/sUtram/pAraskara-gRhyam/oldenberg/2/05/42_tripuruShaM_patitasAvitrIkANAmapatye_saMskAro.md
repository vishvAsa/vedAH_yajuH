42 [^11] . A person whose ancestors through three generations have been patitasāvitrīkas, is excluded from the sacrament (of initiation) and from being taught the Veda.


[^11]:  Those who have not been initiated in due time, may act as p. 312 stated in Sūtra 41. But if the omission has been perpetuated through three generations, the descendant of such persons is subject to the rules stated in Sūtras 42 and 43.

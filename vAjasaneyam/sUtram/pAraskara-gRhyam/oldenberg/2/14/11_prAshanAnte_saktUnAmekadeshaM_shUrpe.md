11 [^4] . After he has eaten (of the sacrificial food), he throws a portion of the flour into a basket, goes out, besmears an elevated spot outside the hall (with cowdung), says, while a fire-brand is held (before him), 'Do not step between (myself and the fire),' and without speaking (anything except the Mantras), he causes the serpents to wash themselves, (pouring out water for them, with the formulas:)


[^4]:  The ceremony with the fire-brand seems to stand in connection with the rule given by Āśvalāyana, II, 1, 13, that before the sacrificer has given himself in charge' to the serpents, nobody is allowed to step between him and the Bali destined for the serpents. Comp. also below, Sūtra 23.

4 [^2] . 'Beat away, O white one, with thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the hind-foot, these seven [children] of Varuṇa and all (daughters) of the king's tribe. Svāhā!'


[^2]:  Āśvalāyana II, 3, 3; Śāṅkhāyana IV, 18, 1. For Vāruṇaiḥ and rājabāndhavaiḥ I read Vāruṇīḥ, rājabāndhavīḥ. Prajāḥ is an interpolation.

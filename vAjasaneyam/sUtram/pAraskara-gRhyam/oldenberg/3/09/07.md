7 [^7] . When (the bull) stands in the midst of the cows, he recites over it (the texts beginning with) 'Bringing refreshment,' down to the end of the Anuvāka (Vāj. Saṃh. XVIII, 45-50).


[^7]:  Śāṅkhāyana, § 15. There is no Mantra in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā beginning with the word mayobhūḥ, but this word occurs in the middle of XVIII, 45 a; the texts which he recites begin at that word and extend down to the end of the Anuvāka. It is clear that mayobhūḥ was intended in the original text, from which both Śāṅkhāyana and Pāraskara have taken this Sūtra, as the Ṛk-Pratika, Rig-veda X, 169, 1.

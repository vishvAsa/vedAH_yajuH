6 [^9] . He makes offerings of the mess of cooked food with (the verses):


[^9]:  In the first verse I have omitted vyaśnavai, which impedes the construction and violates the metre. The word has found its way into the text, no doubt, in consequence of the phrase dīrgham āyur vyaśnavai occurring in chap. 2, 2. In the second verse p. 344 akṛtad is corrupt. I have translated abhayam; comp. Āśvalāyana II, 4, 14. In the third verse I have left out mayi, as Professor Stenzler has done in his translation.


'May the earth be peaceful, the air friendly to us; may the heavens give us bliss and safety. May the points (of the horizon), the intermediate points, the upper points give us bliss, and may day and night create long life for us. Svāhā!

'May the waters, the rays protect us from all sides; may the creator, may the ocean turn away evil. The present and the future, may all be safe for me. Protected by Brahman, may I be well guarded. Svāhā!

'May all Ādityas and the divine Vasus, may the Rudras and Maruts be our protectors. May Prajāpati, the highest lord, bestow on us vigour, offspring, immortality, long life. Svāhā!'

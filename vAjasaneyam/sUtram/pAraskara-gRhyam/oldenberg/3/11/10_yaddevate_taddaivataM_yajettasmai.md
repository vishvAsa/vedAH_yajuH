10 [^8] . At (a sacrifice) directed to a special deity he should sacrifice (an animal) belonging to that deity, should make a portion for that (god), and should say to him (i.e. to the messenger who is to convey that offering to a place sacred to that deity): 'Take care that this may reach that (god).'


[^8]:  10, 11. The way for interpreting these Sūtras is shown by Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya I, 12. I do not think that they have anything to do, as Jayarāma states, with reference to Sūtra II, with the offering due to a relative who has died while being absent on a journey (chap. 10, 44).

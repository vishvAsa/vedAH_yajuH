14 [^5] . (The bride's father?) anoints the two, (while the bridegroom recites the verse,) 'May the Viśve devās, may the waters unite our hearts. May Mātariśvan, may Dhātṛ, may Deṣṭrī (the 'showing' goddess) join us.'


[^5]:  The literal translation would be: 'He salves together (samañjayati) the two . . . May the waters salve together (samañjantu) our hearts.' It was a real anointing of the bridegroom and of the bride, that took place, and we cannot accept Professor Stenzler's translation (based on Jayarāma's note: samañjayati parasparaṃ sammukhīkaroti), by which the proper signification of samañjayati is effaced: Dann heisst (der Vater der Braut) sie beide zusammentreten. See the note on Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 12, 5. The parallel passage of the Khādira-Gṛhya runs thus: apareṇāgnim auduko gatvā pāṇigrāhaṃ mūrdhany avasiñced, vadhūṃ ca, samañjantv ity avasiktaḥ.

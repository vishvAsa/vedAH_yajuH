      <description>&lt;p&gt;PĀRASKARA-GRIHYA-SŪTRA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TO THE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PĀRASKARA-GRIHYA-SŪTRA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE Gr̥hya-sūtra of Pāraskara, which belongs to the White Yajur-veda and forms an appendix to Kātyāyana&amp;rsquo;s Srauta-sūtra, has been edited, with a German translation, by the scholar who was the first to make a Gr̥hya text accessible to Orientalists and to begin to grapple with the first and most serious difficulties that beset its interpretation, and who has continued since to do more than anyone else towards elucidating that important branch of Vedic literature. It would be very unbecoming in any one engaged in the study of Gr̥hya texts, not to acknowledge most warmly the debt of gratitude which he owes to Professor Stenzler. At the same time the respect due to the veteran editor and interpreter of Āśvalāyana and Pāraskara not only allows, but requires that one who proposes to himself the same task at which Prof. Stenzler has worked with so much learning, should state as clearly as possible what that distinguished scholar has left for others to do, and why one who prepares an English translation of Pāraskara has a very different task from merely translating into English the German translation of Prof. Stenzler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

VISNU IN THE VEDA
 
One of the most intriguing problems of Indian mythology relates to the elevation of Visnu in the classical Hindu mythology to the prominent position of the supreme god from the more or less minor position which has been assigned to him in the Vedic mythology He cannot be said to have ever been regarded, in the Vedic religion, as a god of any consequence We do come across a few Vedic references to Visnu (II 1 3,22 1, 34 11 ) which seem to reflect his glory, but actually they are quite general and pointless in character and by no means indicate that Visnu ever dominated Vedic thought and faith, as for jostance, Varuna and Indra did Hymns in praise of Visnu are, indeed, very few, he is celebrated 10 not more than five whole hymns and in parts of others, while his name occurs only about a hundred times in the Rgveda (RV) Even in those stray passages, Vişnu is very casually mentioned among a crowd of other divinities He thus seems to have occupied a comparatively subordinate position in the pantheon of Vedic gods, from which he rose, more or less suddenly, to supreme eminence in Hindu mythology of all the Vedic gods, Visnu is perhaps the only god whose name is promi nently preserved in the Hindu Trinity 
Is it possible to account for this rather unique mythological phenomenon on the strength of the evidence derived from the Veda itself? The assumption of certain scholars, like RAYA CHAUDHARI," that Visnu was a great god even in the earliest Vedic times is difficult to accept The statistical standard makes him out to be a deity only of the fourth rank At the same time, to assume that an ordinary god of the Veda, who was not much glorified in the hymns, became only in later times the god of ever increasing importance is unconvincing There are, accord 10g to MACNICOL, somс hints 10 the Brahmiana literature of the

progress which Visnu was making towards the position which he occupies later on But the mere fact that the Brahmanas speak of Visnu as being identical with the sacrifice and ask him to make good its defects does not necessarily indicate that Visnu was attaining eminence : Moreover, that assumption does not help the solution of the Visnu problem A workable hypothesis, in this connection, can be that there had been some elements in the original nature and personality of Vistu, which, at one time, ensured his position as an all important god, but that these elements were suppressed, perhaps consciously, by the Vedic poets and priests Visnu must have been a highly worshipped god even in very ancient times, but he must have been deliberately shoved into the background in the Vedic religion on account of some intrinsic characteristics of his essential nature which might have been disagreeable to the Vedic religious ideology Docs tbe available Vedic evidence corroborate this hypothesis to any extent? 
Visnu's personality as represented in the RV is not rich in mythological details The outstanding features of the Visnu mythology in the Veda are mainly two namely, the three strdes which he is said to have taken in order to traverse the whole Udiverse and which are often glorified as the most distinctive achie vement of his, and, secondly, the help which he rendered to Indra at the time of the latter s fight with Vitra These events in the carcer of Visnu are mentioned, in the Vedic literature, sometimes As two independent achievements (I 154 2 3, 155 4-5. VII 100 3-5, VIII 29 7), and sometimes as connected with cach other 
cosmic character attributed to Vişnu (1 154 1-2, VI 69 5, VII 99 2-3), but they are such as would be attributed to any Vedic god, as the result of the so-called henotheistic tendency in the Yedic religion, and may not be regarded as essentially distinctive of Visnu's nature Let us therefore, analyse the two above mentioned features of the Visnu mythology and see if they throw any light on the primary nature of Visay

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS 
The first thing that would strike a crilical student of the Vedic mythology is that the association or Visnu and Indra in the RV is clearly superficial The help which Vinu is said to have given to the Vedic Aryan war god at the time of his glorious achievements of killing Vrtra and letting the waters frec' could have been casily dispensed with Thc hymas addressed to Indra and Visnu together are again positively colourless The later Vedic passages (TS VIS 1 1. II4 12) also indicate that Indra hardly depended on Visnu for his hclp at the time of slaying Vrtra Wc cycn sce that the steps of Visnu, which form his distinctic characteristic, are sometimes (VI 69 5) attributed also to Indra, thus clearly rendering Visnu supertluous The natural conclusion in this regard would, therefore, bc that Visnu's comradeship of Indra at the time of the Vitra fight, which is obviously artiâcial, is necessarily an afterthought Even from the point of view of the naturalistic interpretation of Vedic mytho logy, the coalescence of Visnu and Indra is, as pointed out by HILLEBRANDT," who, incidentally, is a strong advocate of such an interpretation, entirely without any significance What thca is at the bottom of this artificial bringing together of (wo intrinsically usconnected divinities? It is a well known practice of the Vedic poets to connect any sigoificant activity of any god with Indra and his achievements Indra was by far the most prominent god of the Vedic Indians As shown elsewhere the changing environ ments of the conquering and ever victorious Vedic Aryan tribes made them transfer their religious loyalty, which they had origi nally entertained for the World sovereign, Asura Varuna, to the national war god, Indra But, even after that, some ardent followers of the Varuna religion, like the Vasisthas, tried to preserve the primary greatness of Varuna's personality One of the methods adopted to secure this was to bring about a compro mise between the Varuna religion and the new Indra religion Varuna was consequently associated with Indra, more or less artificially, as his comrade in a common cause

If religious dignity and recognition had to be specially granted to any particular god, it was the practice of the Vedic poets to do so by associating that god with Indra and his fight with Vrtra That made the god, so to say, a legitimate' member of the Vedic pantheon This seems to bayc becn the purpose of the obviously loose and artificial connection of the Visnu-mythology with the Indra mythology 
There are three distinct phases of the relation of Visnu with Indra, as seen in the Vedic hymos Firstly, Indra and Visnu are brought together as equal partners in a common glorious deed (IV 18 11; VIII 52 3), secondly, a clear attempt is made by the Vishu-glorifiers to place Visnu, in some cases (VIII 31 10). in a more emincnt position than Indra, by calling the latter, 11snoh sacabhinah; and, finally, Visnu is said to be the subordinate ally of Indra, deriving his power of taking three strides from the latter (VIII. 12 27), and is also represented (VII 15 9) as celebratiog the greatness of Indra All these phases indicate that there was no definite view point held by the Vedic poets regarding the mutual relationship between Indra and Visnu It was more or less in a fluid condition! It may be suggested in this connection that Visnu belonged to and was glorified by some circles outside the hicratic families of the Vedic poets The artificial bringing together of Visnu and Indra may then be said to be the result of the efforts made on the mythological plane to establish some kiod of under standing between the respective worshippers of these two gods This would explain the obvious awkwardness felt by the Vedic poets in this connection The followers of the Visnu rcligion wanted to invest their god with the necessary religious dignity by associat ing him with the officialnational god, Indra. Not only that, but they cyen tried to make Visnu supersede lodra It is of course not possible to accept the suggestion that the coalescence of the Visnu religion with the Indra-religion reflected that of the

Brāhmanas with the Ksatriyas? Two other more reasonable explanations of this phenomenon may be offered Either Visnu was a very important god of the indigenous tribes of India and was, therefore, not readily accepted by the Vedic Aryans at the time of the fusion of the two cultures Or--and this is surely more likely - Visau was a god of great eminence among the masses of the Aryan nomads themselves and was not parti cularly liked by the orthodox families of the Vedic poets, perhaps on account of some “revolting' traits in the primary nature of that god Anyway, the foregoing analytical examination of Vispu's association with lodra would give us the necessary start ing point for the discussion of the problem of Vişnu's true personality 
The three strides of Visņu form a more ipherent feature of the Visru mythology What do these strides indicate? Yāska quotes in his Nirukia the views of his predecessors in this regard (XII 19)

WHITNEY, ROTH, MAX MULLER, and KAEGI who took the three steps of Visnu to mean the risiøg the culminating and the setting of the sun. The solar pature of Visnu is undoubtedly prominent in the Veda, since many other subsidiary features of Visnu's personality mentioned there clearly confirm it Vedic references to Visnu such as falarcas (VIT 100 3) sardrś (1 155. 5), vbhūladyumna (I 56 1 ), etc, definitely make him out to be a god of light and splendour 10 The common epithets of Vishu in the RV are urugaa wide stepping) esa or eva) aran (full of motion) dharmani dharayan, riasja garbha, redhah (upholding the ordinances), and pūryja aad nana (ancient and new) The sun god is observed to be traversing the whole atmosphere from borizon to horizon through his wide strides, he completes the whole extensive course just during one day, he never swerves from the path and never misses the time, he is an htc has been seen since times immemorial and at the same time, he is young because lie appears newly every morning Thus the four prominent characteristics suggested by the above mentioned epithets or Vinu-namely, vide steppiog, swift motion, regularity of course and new and ancient forms on the same day - are found together only in the sun god The solar nature of Visnu, in the Veda, is consequently beyond doubt In the Salapatha Brahmana (IV 11 10) we have been told that Visņu s head was cut off and it later became the sun But the most sure cvidence in this regard is the passage in the RV (1 155 6) where Vishu is celebrated as setting in motion, like a tevolving wheel, his minety steeds with four dames each This tclercncc talen in conjunction with certain stanzas in I 164 lealcs no doubt that the steeds represent the days and the pames represent the seasons It is thus the description of the sun god creating the solar car or 360 days It is further likely that Visau's

Even in the post-Vedic representation of Visnu, there are certain features which are clearly indicative of his original solar nature in the RV. The sudarśana cakra, which is the symbol of the orb of the sun, the padma, which is the symbol of the life awakening power of the heaven's light, the pitāmbara, which is suggestive of the clustre of bright rays - all these traits of Visnu, in later mythology, have clearly preserved his identity with the sun-god. The imagery connected with hair', which is the usual symbol for sun's rays, is quite apparent in Visau's paurānic names, such as, Keśava and Hrşikeśa,14 Visnu's pames, Hayasiras and Hayamukha, have preserved the 'sun-horse' imagery. That god is further described as ravilocana, sahasrārcis, etc.15 Even Vişnu's favourite vehicle, in the later Puräna-mythology, namely,

that the principal motif in the Vedic Visnu.mythology is the extent of space The references about Visnu such as, urugaya, uruksit, urusu vikramanesu, vigāman, etc, make it clear that Visnu was eminently a space god The emphasis is mainly put on Visnu's measuring the vast space Even in the

Against this theory put forth by that antı solar mythologist OLDENBERG, it must be first of all mentioned that the concep tion of the three strides. understood by him as indicating exclusi vely the vastness of space, is not warranted by the Vedic evidence Moreover, bis objection, namely that Visnu's characteristic three steps cannot refer to the sun's course, since what is said about them does not agree with morning, noon, and evening, is surely not valid The interpretation of the three steps of Visnu, men tioned by OLDENBERG in his objection, is certainly wrong, but the Vedic descriptions of the three steps clearly connect them, as will be shown later on, with a different and quite a distinctive activity of the sun Further, OLDENBERG seems to translate the word urugaya as 'the lord of wide spaces', and not as wide stepping', whuch latter would be the more correct render ing The emphasis put on the notion of wide space appears to have been based more particularly on 10cidental ritualistic referen ces thas on actual Vedic descriptions OLDENBERG and other scholars like GELDNER,18 for instance, who say that Visou is the

god whose main function is to create space in the world, seem to ignore altogether the solar traits in his nature Monier WILLI AMS also first thought that the primary idea of Visnu ( derived from the root yos) permeating and infusing his essence into material objects was originally connected with the personification of the infinite heavenly space But he later on found that the Vedic evidence, which went against such assumption, made Visnu a form of the ever-moving solar orb (1 22. 16-17 ) 19 Even HILLEBRANDT, who originally thought that Visnu was not necessarily identical with the sun god, finally came to the conclu sion that the sun theory explained almost all the features of the Visnu mythology in the best possible manner 20 HOPKINS21 summarises the position in this regard quite convincingly when he says that Visnu was regarded as a sun god not through any predilection for sun-gods in general, but because what little is said of him in the RV answers only to that conception 23 Other theories24 regarding the true nature of Visnu as represented 10 the Veda, which also do not seem to take into account the

emphatically solar traits in his personality, must likewise be set aside 
Though the predominantly solar nature of Visou is thus indicated by the Vedic evidence as a whole, it is not correct to identify his three strides with the rising, the culmination, and the setting of the sun, as ROTH. KAEGI, and MAX MULLER did, following Aurnavābha 24 The third step of Visnu, which is described as very sublime and as leading to the mysterious world of the highest heaven, shows no connection whatsoever with the sun set Not even the soaring winged birds venture to approach that third step of Visnu (I 155 5 ) 25 With it is connected the highest and the third place of Agai(I 72 2–4), that is, of the sun The gods enjoy themselves there (VIII 29 7), for, in the third step of Visnu there is a spring of honey (I 154 5) 28 Visnu's epithet, girih sit, as well as the reference to the many-horded cows (clouds ?) (I 154 6) moving at the highest step of Visnu are further indicative of its being in the highest heaven That step is also the abode of the pious devotecs (I 154 5-6, V 3 3) HOPKINS understands these pious devotees ( devayavah) to be the pious dead and seems to put special emphasis on this characteris tic of Vişnu's highest step Visou is, according to him, the first god to represent, what he continues to represent through later ages, the sun home of souls 27 This conception of the solar home of souls,28 which is too evidently connected with Visnu to be

25 Accor ling to the explanation of Aurnavabha namely that samdrohana, Disnupada and gayasiras are the three steps of Visny, it would be necessary to rccognise the second step as the highest step which fact is however, not suggested by the Vedic references It may be mentioned here as a matter of intercat that JAYASWAL believes that visnupada represents the actual geographical locality of that pame 
26 R G BUIANDARKAR thinks (taisnadism, a osm etc 47) that the obscurity surrounding the third step of Vişnu helped to give bim an association of mystery such as is necessary for a god that is to be acknowledged as sole and supreme Actually, however there is hardly any obscurity regarding Vinu's th rd step

casıly set aside as of no account, make two things quite clear: firstly, that in Visnu's personality solar nature is very prominent; and, sccondly, that his highest step is on the top of the sky and may not, therefore, be identified with the setting of the sun Other features of Visnu's three strides, such as that all the worlds subsist in them (I 154 2), that Visnu measured the whole url verse with them (1. 154 3), and that they commence on the tarth (1 22 16 ) and end in the bighest heaven (I 154 5 )- all go to prove that the naturalistic interpretation of the three strides, given by Aurnavābha and adopted by ROTH and others, is not at all warranted by the Vedic evidence They do not represent the daily course of the sun from horizon to horizon Through the Visnu mythology the Vedic poets have presented the picture of the sun as a swiftly moving lumipary which, with vast strides, traverses the whole universe in its thrce fold division of the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven, which is so familiar to the Vedic cosmography This explanation originally suggested by Sakapūni and later on accepted by a majority of scholars satisfactorily meets all the requirements of the three steps as described in the RV It is again this explanation, which presalis in the later Vedic literature I'S II 25, TS 1 7 5 4, ŚPBI 9 39, VI 7 4 7) The essen tial notion underlying the three steps of Visnu us thus the diurnal course of the sun in his ascent from the horizon of the earth, through the atmosphere, to the zenith, namely the solar paradise of the Vedic • Elysion' The reference to the three Visnu-steps to be taken by the sacrificer in the full moon and the neiy.moon sacrifices (TS I 7 6 1 ) is also clearly indicative of the three regions of the universe 29 It is not a solar deity in its general character that is represented through the Vedic Visnu, rather the

secondly, Visnu is described as taking the three strides for the deliverance of mankind in distress (VI 49 13) MACDONELL brings forth other traces of Vişou's general character as the 
Preserver, in the Veda Visou 15 beneficent (I 156 5), 15 innocuous and bountiful (VII 25 12), and a generous protector (1155 4) But only such features of an ordinary sun god cannot adequately account for Visnu's sudden rise to prominence in Hindu mythology As pointed out elsewhere, Vişnu must have already been a great god among the 'extra-Vedic circles and his later eminence was merely a legitimately recognised come-back 
Though there is no reference to Vāmana in the RV, the three strides of Visnu undoubtedly form the foundation of the paurānic vāmanāvatāra In the Brālimana literature (TS VI 2 4, SPB I 2 S, AB VI. 15) Visnu's dwarf-form is actually connected with his three steps by means of which he covers the whole Universe The faint traces of the later jarállatára of Visnu are to be found in the RV (1 61 7, VIII 77 10) and the later Vedic literature (TS VII 1,5 1, TB1 1 3 5, TAXI 8, SPB XIV 1 2 11 ) 
35 Vhat the primary action underlying Viçou s dwarf form is it is not casy to imagine A KUHN (Uber Entwicklungsstufen der Althenbrldung, 128) thinks that the dwarf represents the sun light which sbrinks into dwarf's size In die cycoing OLDEYBERC (Rd5", 233 ) suggests that the idea has evolved out of a fable about a wide stepping giant who could turn busell into a dwarf This is evidently far fetched According to LEITH (RPJU, 111), MACDOVELL (FRAS 1895, 176-77) and HILLEBRANDT (VM, N A , 139 ), Vitou assumes the dwarf form only by way of a stratagem 10 order to mislcad the Asuras An cthical interpretation of this aralara u given by MACNICOL

Whatever the real factors were which contributed towards the clevation of Visnu from a minor position which he occupied in the RV-mythology to be an important member of the Hindu Trinity of gods, it is evident that the faint traces of the beginning of this process are to be discovered even in the Brāhmana litera. ture Visnu is said to be the highest among the gods (ŚPB XIV 115), he is their door-keeper (ABI 30 19), the gods have their mouth in Visnu (TSI 7 5) Though Visnu has only few insignificant offerings made to him in the Vedic ritual, a stage was reached when he was actually identified with the sacrifice as a whole The AB(I 1) clearly states agnir jai derānām ayamah, visnuh paramah, tadantarena sarvā devatah It cannot, however, be said that Visnu lad attained his paurānic supremacy in the Brahmanas The process had only begun As the importance of Vişnu was gradually growing, that of Indra was correspondingly diminishing This position is finally consolidated 10 the Mahābhārata where we are told that Indra, in fear, hastens to Visou and that Visnu bestows upon him his power Visnu is there positively placed over and above Indra The Visnu-religion may thus be said to have overpowered the Vedic Indra-religion 
It would be greatly helpful to see what light the etymology of the name Visnu throws on the wliole Visnu-problem The most common way of explaining the game is to derive it from the root vis,' to be active 97 The very quick and active movements of the sun god are suggested through this explanation But it is not made clear what suffix is added and how the word is gramma tically formed 38 BLOOMFIELD may be said to have made a distinct contribution to the Visnu problem by proposing that the name was made up of two parts, ( = through) and snu or sānu

38 Mention may be made in this context of the pauranic attempts to connect the namt Vış bu etymologically with the root vrť (=to enter, to pervade) According to the Vişnupurana Vinnu enters into or pervades the universe as pointed out in the Vedic text tam eta srstua tam anuprdons at In the Padmapurana the name is made to refer to Vignu s combining with praktı

(=the back) 39 Visnu's strides through the back of the world are, according to that scholar, indicated by that word It is, howevcr, difficult to see how BLOOMFIELD could understand i in the sense of 'through' and make the word usnu mean 'cross ing the back' GUNTERT also seems to accept the same etymo logy of the word He, however, understands the prefix si in the usual sense of apart from one another'40 Visnu, according to GUNTERT, thus means one who sets the surface apart The word, visnul, made up of the two component parts, w and snu ( sanu), can have only three senses (1) one whose sanu is vi ( = parted), (12) one for whom the sānu has separated itself Wide apart, and (11) one separated from sumi that is, without sanu Neither any of these three senses nor the one proposed by GUNTERT gives any satisfactory explanation of Visau's nature as directly represented in and indirectly implied by the Veda It would be, moreover really straoge if a word, more or less artificially excogitated by the Brahmanas in such a manner, could become pot only the common name of the principal god of later Hinduism but also a name which must have already been necessarily popular among certain culture groups of old " The most satisfactory etymology of the word is to derive it from the root vi with the suffix snu (the same as we find in forms like jisnu, alamkarısnu, ksesnu, etc) The root vi, on its part is linguisti cally connected with IE *uer (=to fly) The other formations from the root are av vis, lat aus, ahd 110, nhd weih, arm hav, etc <3 The word visnu, therefore, originally means the flyer'.

It is also not unlikely that the name itself primarily indicaetd a bird We shall, therefore, be justified in presuming that the bud form is the earliest known feature of the personality of Visou In the early Veda, Visnu is clearly represented as the sun bird, though it is not pecessary to assume that this conception was the primary one to many ancient mythologies the sun is seen to have been represented as a bird 4 In some cases the sun is also represented as the 'flying horse', some faint traces of which may be available even in the descriptions of Vişnu 15 Very early in the evolution of religious thought people imagined of a divide being overrunning the three regions of the universe with the greatest possible speed Such a being could only be a bird, which is popularly supposed to be the quickest among the creatures Like many other peoples of antiquity, the Indians also represented the sun under the form of a bird which flies swiftly through the sky

VISNU IN THE VEDA 
I have so far sought to show that the Vedic hymns Tepresent Visnu mainly as a solar deity in the form of a bird, and that the ascent and the descent of the sun through the three regions are glorified through Visnu's three strides which form the outstanding feature of his mythology in the Veda These conclusions, however, cannot be said to have finally solved the basic problems regarding Visnu Firstly, if Visnu was merely an ordinary sun-god, why should there have been the obvious hesitation on the part of the Vedic poets in legitimately admittiog him to the pantheon of the Vedic gods? What otherwise is the significance of associating Visnu with Indra, and that too in such a superficial and artificial manner 1 Secondly, why should a Vedic sun-god alone be chosen for the supreme position in the Hindu mythology? And why particularly Visnu from among the several solar diyioities? These questions would ultimately lead us to the hypothesis that, besides his solar nature, there was another more essential aspect of Visnu's personality and that an attempt was made by the Vedic poets and priests to suppress it purposely As, however, the case is, there have survived some up mistakable traces of that aspect of Visnu's personality in the Vedic hymns and ritual 
The most significant word in this connection is śipivista, which is exclusively employed in the Veda with reference to Visnu The passages where the word occurs in the RV (VII 99 7, 100 5-7) scem to have been kept obscure with a purpose The Vedic poets evidently sought to make a guarded and a casual reference to that aspect of Visnu's personality which was indicated by the word ßipuvista Many attempts lave been made to explain that word, but few satisfy the requirements of philology47 and DONC brings out the true nature of Visnu It is not possible

to separate philologically the word sepa ( = penis) from śipi Other simular IE forms are sıpha (=a root), pkt chepa, lat cippus, scipio ( staff), etc Even Nirukta (V 7) seems to be vaguely supporting this view though its further explanation 15 not clear 48 Added to that word is a form from the root vs, thus making the whole word mean the changing phallus, the swelling and diminishing penis ' 49 We may now easily understand why the Vedic poets speak in such guarded and obscure way about this form of Visnu It is also very signi ficant that Aupamanyava (Nirukia, V 7) says of this name of Visnu kursitārthiyam pun am bhavaht The word sipasta has thus unmistakably preserved Vişnu's ancient phallic nature. There are also many other incidental references to Visnu in the Vedic hymns and ritual, which clearly associate him with the notions of fertility, productivity, and sex-life 
One of the obscure features of the Vedic śrāddha ritual is that the angustha, without nail, is to be dipped into the offering intend ed for the Pitrs This action is accompanied by an invocation to Visnu The angustha is undoubtedly a symbol of the phallus Visnu is, in this rite, clearly connected with the phallıc aspect of the Vedic ritual 50 In the TS passage (VI 2 4 2), jajno deiebhyo nila, ata risnurupam krna sa prthn im prāvasat, we find another piece of evidence in this regard Visnu's entering into the mother

earth is a symbolical description of a fertility-rite The words, tanvī irdhanah, used with reference to Visnu (VII 99 i, also cf. VIII 100 2) may further be understood to be indicative of his phallic nature Visnu is significantly identified, in later literature, with Hiranyagarbha and Nārāyana si Visgu's close connection with Sidivāli (AV VII 46 3), the broad hipped' divinity protect ing the feminine sex functions, throws considerable light on thus aspect of Visnu's personality According to the sänhhayana Grhyasūtra (I 22 13), the RV-mantra, visnur yonim halpazatu (X 184 1 ), accompanies the garbha ceremony, thus suggesting that Visou is the efficacious protector of the embryos 52 In the AV (VII 17 4), Visnu is significantly connccted with praja. The two epithets of Visnu, nisiktapā (VII 36 9) protector of the semen ', and sumajjani (I 156 2) 'facilitating easy birth'(?) speak for themselves The word, paumsja manly vigour' is significantly used with reference to Visnu in the RV (I 155 3-4). The vrsākapı-hymn in the RV (X 86 ) has aroused serious contro versy regarding its interpretation Without going loto the details of that controversy, one may say that, broadly speaking, that hymn describes how, when Indra felt greatly exhausted, a bold, lascivious monkey administered to him some medicine, and how, as a result of it, Indra regained his manly power This Yrsäkapı is identified, in later literature, with Visnu, the word beiag also mentioned as one of his pames in the Visnusahasra namastotra 53 There is thus abundant indirect evidence provided by the Vedic hymns and ritual to proye Vasnu's connection with fertility and productivity rites 5: As elsewhere, so also in India, 
51 Narayana is philologically connected with #onra (= manly vigour). 
52 It is agnificant that Sinivall is referred to in the next stanza of this hymn (X 184 2) As a matter of fact, the entire hymn X 184 throivs much useful light on Vişnu's original character

popular customs and conceptions of the religion of the masses have paturally been the primary foundations of great Brahmapical sacrifices The god of fertility and productivity occupied a very prominent place in the religion of the common people The Aryans particularly, who had been mainly agriculturists must have glorified the vegetation divinity and vegetation-rites to a very great extent For instance, in the Mahārata, which was clearly a vegetation ritual, the main features of generative nites and vegeta tion rites are quite transparent Through a very penetrating study of the Nahāvrata, from this point of view, JOHANSSON has proved that a conspicuous part was played in that ritual by a vegetation divinity 10 bird form 55 According to MANNHARDT (Wald und Feldk I) and FRAZER (The Golden Bough), the fertility fetish in many primitive vegetation rites was a bird Thus bird-motif is seen also in the bird form of the mahadukihy a-vedi in the Malāvrata A possibility is hereby suggested that it was Visnu, as a bird, who was the most prominent figure in all such rites The original nature of Visnu as a bird has already been indicated Visnu was, therefore, primarily the fertility bird All this explains how Visnu, as a god of fertility, must have occupied a prominent position in the primitive Aryan religious thought and ritual Other so called obscure references to Visnu, such as śipivista, agree perfectly well with this aspect of Visnu's personality 
A well reasoned account may thus be offered of the evolution of the whole Visnu-religion Visnu must have been regarded as a bird, at least among certain culture groups among the Vedic people in that form he was very closely connected with the vegetation ritual He was, indeed, the god of fertility and productivity and as such he must have been regarded as most eminent in the popular religion of the masses It was, however, on account of the aversion, on the part of the Vedic priestly intellectuals and the conquering higher classes, for this popular fertility god and his upcouth, frivolous, and to a certaia extent

obscene fertility rituals, that Visnu was not easily admitted to the pantbeon of the Vedic gods. The Vedic poets could not, how ever, completely ignore him. They, therefote, sought to trans form the basic character of Visou. This attempt of theirs was greatly facilitated by the original bird-form of that god. The hieratic Vedic poets understood the bird-form of Visnu as indi cating not the fertility-god but the sun-god. They thus tried to suppress, as far as possible, the true nature of this god of the people'. But those culture-groups 56 among whom Yısau was a prominent god must have persisted in forciog him upon the 
official” Yedic religion which was dominated by the Indra mythology. From the point of view of the official' Vedic religion, the popular god Visnu was, so to say, hierarchised by being artificially and deliberately brought into association with Indra who, as it were, served as the philosopher's stone for such purpose. This accounts for the obvious fluctuations in the artificial and superficial relationship between Visnı and Indra. It is not necessary to assume non-Aryan influence in this regard 57 It was merely a matter between the classes' and the masses" among the Vedic people themselves.58 la post-Vedic times when the popular religion again came into prominence, Visou became the supreme god. He had by then inherited several features from the many earlier aspects of his personality. As KEITH has poin ted out,9 Krsoa himself was originally the spirit of reviving vegetation.

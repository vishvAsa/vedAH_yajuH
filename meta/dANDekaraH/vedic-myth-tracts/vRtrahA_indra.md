VRTRAHA INDRA 
Vedic mythology, as we generally know it from the Rgreda (RV), is clearly dominated by the personality of Indra By far the largest number of suhtas - about 250 out of 1028 — are ex clusively devoted to the glorification of this god Apart from these suktas, there are several others, wherein Indra is praised in association with other gods or is referred to in some other connec tion Indra is thus obviously the most popular god of the Vedic pantheon He has always been regarded almost as the very sym bol of the official Vedic religion--the Indra mythology being very nearly identified with the Vedic rcligion as a whole It is true that Indra is celebrated in nearly one fourth of the RV, but this fact must not be taken to indicate, as is usually done, that the Vedic religion had all along been dominated by the Indra my thology Such an assumption could only be the result of study ing the Vedic mythology as if it were a static phenomenon and would make it difficult rationally to correlate several mytho logical concepts in the Veda with the facts derived from the study of comparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropo logy, and the cultural history of the Aryans A critical study of the Veda would show that the Vedic mythology is essentially an cvolutionary mythology, that, at different stages in the cvolution of the Vedic mythological thought it has been domi nated by different Vedic gods, and that the Indra-dominated mythology represents but a lic stage in the course of that cyolu tion There is another aspec the Vedic mythology It will be seen that the personality of a Vedic god normally presents a cry complex picture it often contains ciements which are mutually inconsistent or sometimes cien self-contradictory Tlus peculiar inythological plicnomc. non can be satisfactoriis explained only on the assumption that a cdic god possesses a growing' personality with the dific reat vicissitudes in Vedic life and culture, different elements came

to be introduced into the personality of a Vedic god In other words, the dynamic character of the life of the Vedic people is faithfully reflected in the complex make up of their gods To emphasize only certain specific clements in a god's personality and thus try to define his character, one way or another, would, therefore, be unsound What we have to do is to determine, 10 the light of the facts derived from the study of comparative philo logy, comparative mythology, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Aryans, the prionty of these varied elements, and thereby present, so to say, a complete history of the entire be coming' of a Vedic god A study of the Vedic god, Indra, from the point of view of this two fold evolutionary character of the Vedic mythology, would lumine several obscure points concern ing the Vedic mythology in general and the personality of Indra in particular 
If we were to analyse the large number of the RV-passages referring to Indra and his activities, we would find that they present three main strands of the personality and character of that god Indra is presented as a cosmic power, as a warlıke leader of the Vedic Aryans, and as an ancient mythical dragon killing hero Most of the descriptions of Indra are centred round his war with and subsequent victory over Vr̥tra This is by far the most outstanding event in Indra's career A proper under standing of this event would, therefore, serve as an adequate starting point for a critical study of Indra's personality and character We may begin with an ancient traditional attempt at interpreting this contest between Indra and Vr̥tra Yaska, the author of the Niruksa, has posed the question ko yrtrah who was Vytra? He has mentioned two principal views regarding this question it appears that, more or less by way of a purva paksa, he refers to the opinion of the Aitihasikas who believed that Vr̥tra was a demon, a son of Tvastī Without, however, caring to discuss and refute this view, Yaska states the view of the school of the Nairuktas, who held that Vịtra represented a

cloud This passage from the Nirukta would thus clearly show that, even since very early times, there have been two principal schools of interpretation of the Vedic mythology -- the historical school and the naturalistic school The etymologists, among whom Yaska was the foremost adhered to the naturalistic inter pretation The influence of the naturalistic school on Vedic studies in general has, indeed, been very great, and many scholars belonging to the earlier generation of modern Vedists accepted, without demur and almost as the final solution of the problem, the theory that the Vedic gods represented various powers of nature and that the Vedic mythology consisted of symbolical descriptions of various phenomena of nature Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, among themselves, the naturalistic mytho logists are not unanimous as to which specific power of nature a particular Vedic god represents in pursuance of the naturalistic idcology, the Vedic gods are classified into three categories those belonging to the sky, those belonging to the mid region and those belonging to the earth, in accordance with the cosmic regions where the powers of nature represented by those gods normally become evident 
The most dominant view so far as the naturalistic inter pretation of the Indra mythology is concerned, is the one suggest ed by Yaska His lead has been followed by a majority of the carly Vedists of the modern times Indra is said to be the personification of thunderstorm He stands at the head of the gods of the antariksa and is verily the rain god of the Vedic pan. theon The heavenly waters are obstructed by the cloud demon, Vpira Indra, therefore, smites down this cloud demon by means of his vajra or thunderbolt, and releases the waters, which then flow down in the form of rain showers The various descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra-Vr̥tra battle are said to be cleariy jadi cative of the phenomena of thunderstorm, lightning, and rain Heaven and carth tremble with fear when Indra strikes Vr̥tra with

indu, are related to each other, and that, as suggested by MAX MULLER,Indra may have thus been associated with drops of rain water & It has been further suggested by some of the scho lars mentioned above that there was a two fold development of this basic character of Indra On the one hand, from a mere god of thunderstorm, he was elevated to the position of an all. god- of the creator and director of the entire universe (I 52 14, II 30 1, IV 30 22, X 54 5), and on the other, the Vedic poets brought about the humanization of Indra's divind and cosmic person and described him as a human hero and war lord (1 10 3, 130 8, IV 26 3, VI 18 3, VIII 14 5, 24, 27 6, X 49 2) 
Let us critically examine the theory that Indra is the raja god in the Veda It must be mentioned, at the very outset, that there undoubtedly are, in the personality of Indra as represented in the RV, a large number of elements of the character of a rain god But we may ask can these elements be said to be the basic elements in Indra's character? And, secondly, con these ele ments alone be said to indicate the entire personality and character of that god? A minute and careful consideration of the descriptions in the RV of the Indra-Vr̥tra-contest brings out some significant facts in this connection It will be seen that, in all such descriptions, the words like thunder!, cloud's * lightning', 'rain', etc, seldom occur directly The waters, which Indra is credited with having released and let flow, are often terrestrial, rather than celestial, waters The terms, which are frequently used in these passages, are 'thunderbolt', 'moun tain", fortresses', 'cows', 'light', 'waters', etc One would, therefore, be justified in asking whether the main intention of the Vedic poets could have really been to suggest the phenomena of

thunderstorm and rain through the symbolism of the Indra Vr̥tra war * The occurrence, in the RV, of poetic symbolism is, it may bc pointed out, guite understandable But at least once in a while we should have come across Vedic passages which are un cquivocably indicative of the phenomenon of rain Indeed, BERGAIGNE seems to be right when he suggeststo that there is in the RV, no clear mention of Indra's being responsible for the rain fall" The symbolism of vajra, pariata, pur, gauh, etc, can bc interpreted and this, more or less satisfactorily -- in several ways As a matter of fact, it is actually interpreted variously It is, verily, difficult to understand why the Vedic poets should have described the basic character and exploits of their principal god in such vague and undefinite terms 
The identification of Indra with the rain god is based on some other identifications, which seem to be taken for granted Indra's vajra for instance, is understood to be the regular mytho logical name for lightning But do the Vedic passages referring to vajra support such an exclusive assumption? The ajra is generally described as ajasa or metallic (I 52 8, 57 2) It is said to be four aogled (IV 22 2), hundred angled (VI 17 10), hundred jointed (VIII 6 6), and thousand pointed (I 80 12) It is sharp (VII 18 18 ) and Indra whets it like a kaife (1 55 I, 130 4) Such descriptions are too specific to be regarded as symbolically indicative of lightning Moreover, though ajra is ludra's special weapon, it is not the only weapon which he uses He is sometimes descobed as being armed with a bow and arrows

(VIII 77 11, X 103 2-3), or as carrying anhusa (X 449) These latter descriptions can hardly be said to fit in with the rain god theory 1? Another equation, on which the rain-god theory is based, is that Vr̥tra is the cloud demon Several objections can be raised against this equation To begin with, it may be pointed out that the word varathra occurs frequentlyi n the Avesta That that word is philologically the ancient Iranian cognate of the Vedic word yrtra is beyond any shade of doubt In a subsequent part of this paper, we shall have to consider the word vrtra in all its aspects In the present context, however, it may be pointed out that in the Avesta, the word varathra does not signify a cloud demon even remotely Further, in che Ayesia, we come across a god called Vrthragna, but he is in no way connected with the rains 13 Again, supposing that Indra was the rain.god in the Vedic mythology, no rational explanation can be given of the fact that Aodra, who is obviously the ancient Iranian counterpart of Iadra, is represented in the Aresta, as an obnoxious demon Why should a mere rain god of the Veda have been transformed 
into the third worst devil in the Iranian mythology? 
In the descriptions of the Indra-Vr̥tra contest the Vedic poets have frequently used certain words and idioms in a more or less technical sense, such as, for instance, api+dhā, gras, bādh, rudh, vr, stabh, pari+stha, etc HILLEBRANDT has made a critical and analytical study of all such words and has come to the conclusion that they do not fit in well with the phenomenon of rain". It will be thus seen that the descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra Vţtra-contest are such as do not warrant the assumption that they indicate, primarily and unequivocally, the phenomenon of rain Even if the symbolism in those descriptions is considered from the naturalistic point of view, it may be possible to interpret it in terms of some other natural phenomena as well It does not, 
12 HILLIDRANDT has rightly pointed out (M III, 165) that the tota need not be necessarily regarded as the d sunctive characteristic of a storm god

therefore, stand to reason to suggest, on the strength of such in. definite evidence, that Indra is basically a rain god 
There is another significant point to be noted in this connec tion In the Vedic mythology there are three dividities which are more or less closely connected with the phenomenon of rain 
Tria Aptya, Parjanya, and Indra from among these three, Indra seems to be later than the other two As a matter of fact, Indra secms to have been added to the Vedic pantheon later than many other gods The tradition preserved in the Taitti rija-Brahmona (II 2 3 3, II 2 7 2) pamely, that Prajapati created all gods but not ladra and that Indra was later gene rated among them as a new power is highly significant in this connection lodra is referred to in the Taimurija Samhita (II 34 2) as deanam anwjāsara Under these circumstances, a question may occur why did the Vedic poets feel the necessity of creating a new rain god when they already had two in their pantheon If, op the other hand, it is suggested, for the sake of argument, that the concept of Indra is earlier than that of either Parjanya or Trita Āptya, it may still be asked, and, perhaps, with greater validity, why the latter two apparently subsidiary rain. divinitics should have been thought of by the Vedic mythologist who already there existed, in the Vedic ponthcon, a very promie nent rain god, namely, Indra As regards Parjanya, it might be argued that between lodra and Parjanja there is no absolute similarity For, while Parjanya is the rain itself, Indra represents the rain giving god 18 No such distinction can be made between lodra and Trita Āptya The character of Parjanya, in the Veda, is quite transparent, but that of Trita Artya is rather vague and

thunders, and waters roar wandering in their course (V, 54 2770 Such a connexion can be confirmed also by an etymological consideration of the name, Āptya 17 In the RV, Trita some times appears in the special capacity of a preparer of Soma (II 11. 20, IX 32 2, 34 4, 38 2, 102 2) This secondary trait accruing to him must have obviously been the extension of his primary character, namely, that of the bringer of rains 19 A critical examination of the RV-passages referring to Trita brings forth an illuminating set of facts so far as his relations with Indra are concerned Though, in some passages, he appears as almost identical with Indra so far as his activities in connection with the rain phenomenon are concerned (I 187 1, VIII 7 24), there is absolutely no doubt that Indra and Trita were distinct persona lities Again, it would become quite clear that, though Indra also is called Aptya (X 120 6), Trita must have been the original Aptya The earlier occurrence in the Avesta of the ancient Ira pian counterpart of the latter, namely, Thrita, than that of Jodra 15, indeed, a significant piece of evidence in this connection 
16 MACDONELL (TRAS 1893, 419 ff has tried to show that Trita Aplya represents the third form of Agni He is, according to hun, the divinity of lightning Thc peculiar relationsbıp between Indra and Trica cannot, however, be adequately accounted for f MACDONELL's view is accepted Moreover, V 54 2, Trita is clearly distinguished from lightning Also of M FOWLER, JAOS 67, 59 60 BLOOMFIELD (JAOS XVI, cxıx) regards Trita as a scape goat of the gods

But a stul more significant piece of evidence as RV I 52 5, where ladra is described as having performed the feat of conquering the raio stealers in the manner of Tnta This passage clearly shows that the function of overcoming the cloud demons and releasing the celestial waters originally belonged to Trita, white, later on, lodra stepped into the shoes of that original Aryan rain god and imitated him in the explort of bringing rarns Trita's victory over the rain stealers must have been regarded as so primary and characteristic as achievement of his as to be mentioned as an illustration (1 52 5, V 86 1 ) 
Three distinct stages may be marked in the development of the rain god mythology in the Veda The Vedic poets must have originally glorified the rain god of their Aryan ancestors namely, Trita Aptya This god thus found a place in the mytho logies of both the branches of the Aryans, namely, the ancient Iranians and the Vedic Indians Later on, as the result of some peculiar mythological development among the latter, a new god ame to be regarded as tbe rain god in the Vedic mythology That god was Indra But even after Indra s celebration as a rain god, in the RV, the original Aryan rain god was not altoge ther forgotten As shown above Indra was desoribed as imitat ing Trita in his fent of conqucting the rain stealers (1 52 5) There arc, however, unmistakablc indications in the RV that Indra was gradually superseding the original rain god bepeyer Trita appcars with Indra the former is clearly represented as the subordinate of the latter (II 11 19 20, VIII 12 16, X 878, 99 6)* Moreover, a large number of Vedic passages sofersing to Trita arc such as would suggest that that god had been slowly bun Surely siaking into obuvibn Hc is never presented in cicat cod Jife hic form but is mentioned in cursory allusions Trita is

said to be dwelling 10 the farthest distance (1 105 9, VIII 47 13 17) because, as ROTH rightiy points out 21 he had gradually become more and more obliterated from memory 22 The fact that Trita is not at all mentioned in certain mandalas, such as, the second, the fourth, and the seventh particularly, the seventh --- 15 also highly significant in this context 23 This sub Ordination of Trita by Indra represents the second stage in the evolution of the Vedic rain god mythology In the last stage, Trita, who was the original Aryan god of storm and rain, indeed older than Indra, was completely shelved into the background as the result of the growing popularity of lodra as the rain god It is suggested' that dim reminiscence of Trita's vanished glory and an allusion to his final subordination may be lurking in II 34 10 Trita is there said to have been given over to the derision of the worshipper All this discussion will have now made it amply clear that Indra was not the original rain god of the Veda, and that, as the result of some peculiar mythological development, the character of rain god was superimposed on his primarily different personality It may be incidentally pointed out, in this connec. tion, that the line of contact between the Indo European store gods on the one hand and the Vedic Indra on the other is nowhere distinct or even provable 
It should be further remembered that Indra is a god, who originated and grew specifically among the Vedic Aryans If it were to be supposed that he had been a rain god from the very beginning, it would be difficult satisfactorily to explain why the Vedic poets should have created a Dew rain god of a specifically Indian ongın Moreover the facts that Indra was elevated to the position of the national god of the Vedic Indians and that he came to be regarded as the truc symbol of their official religion

nnot be adequately accounted for on the assumption that Odra's basic character was that of a rain god Why should a 
in god have been raised to that position in India, but not else here? There is one more point, which definitely goes against nc assumption of Indra's basic character as a rain god As a atter of fact, that point can be raised, with equal relevance, alost all paturalistic interpretations of the Indra mythology more or less detailed reference will have to be made, in a sub quent part of this paper, to the human character of Indra as resented in certain passages of the Veda A careful study of ich passages would at once convince one that they cannot have -en the result of the humanization of an originally naturalistic 
vinity Some details of the human aspect of Indra's personality, uch as the mysterious manner of his birth, his assuming various orms, his peculiar interest in the welfare of unmarried girls, his 
eat fondness for the intoxicating beverage, Soma which is metimes made fun of by the Vedic poets, and several others hich will be mentioned later, are so realistic and intimate that would be difficult to believe that they are artificially super iposed on Indra's original character as a rain god by the fancy 
the Vedic poets We have, therefore, to conclude that, though acrc arc, in the personality of Indra as presented in the RV, 
Itain clements normally belonging to the rain god mythology, Gesc elements cannot be said to represent either the primary or nc exclusive traits of his basic character 
HILLEBRANDT has interpreted the lodra Vr̥tra war in quite different light -- though, again, mainly from the naturalistic sint of view 25 He had originally adopted the popular VICW 11t Indra was the rain god of the Vedic pantheon Later on, owever, on a closer examination of the litcrature (both Vedic ad post Vedic) and ritual relating to Indra he found it neces ary to revise his vicws more or less radically As indicated Isewhere, he starts by critically studying the words and idioms, Ich as api+dha, badh, erdh, ir, etc, which are frequently used

in the descriptions of the evil deeds of Vśtra, from which Ind is said to have brought about deliverance These words a idioms, according to him, cannot be understood to refer, er remotely, to the phenomenon of rain Again, the pariatas adrı, asman), which also are often referred to in that conte do not signify the clouds 26 As a matter of fact, clouds 1 distinguished from the pari atas, for, it has been said that 1 wings of the pariatas were cut off and that those wings beca clouds And, why should clouds have been regarded as demoi In Indian literature, generally a cloud is hailed as the bringer rains and not condemned as the obstructor of celestial watt HILLEBRANDT has, therefore, suggested that the waters obstr. ed by Vr̥tra are not the celestial rain waters, but that they : actually the streams of earthly rivers According to bim development of the Vedic mythology is not necessarly restric to the geographical limits of India He further points that, so far as the Indra Vstra legend is concerned, there sufficient ground to assume that, in its original form, ! legend was not indigenous to India but that it was carried the Vedic people from outside India to their new home. ? season, in which Vr̥tra is described as lying on the mounta cannot be the summer in that season, the waters are not loc up, on the other hand, the rivers are in spate as the result of melting of the glaciers in the North Western mountains 
In the opinion of HILLEBRANDT, Vr̥tra is the winter dem who locks up the flow of the river-streams At the advent of spring, Indra, that is to say, the sun god, overpowers Vstra, winter demon, and releases the waters It is the winter not cloud -- which is universally regarded as the obstructor waters 27 In the winter, the streams in the North-Western res dwindle away But, as the mountain snows melt on the api ach of the Indian summer followed by the rainy season,

waters rise and overflow the surrounding country 29 In support of his theory that lodra was primarily the sun god, who con quered the winter-demon, Vetra, and thereby released the locked. up waters, HILLEBRANDT has tried to adduce much evidence In the frequent allusions to Vr̥tra, as śayāna (sleeping), he finds a suggestion of the winter representing the "sleep of nature' In the Atharvaseda ( HIT 10 12), Ekastala that is, the new year's night, is said to be the mother of lodra, thus implying that Indra is the symbol of the advent of the new year, that is, of the spring One of the demons, bulled by Indra, is called Rauhoa This may be but one of the many names by which Vįtra is referred to in the Veda HILLEBRANDT interprets Rauhina as the moon and confirms the identification of Vr̥tra with the winter by pointing out that the moon is the lord of the winter Coming to the Vedic ritual, HILLEBRANDT emphasizes the facts that the mid day oblation ( madhjahna savana) is normally offered to Indra (be cause he is the sun god )29 and that Indra is associated with 
grisma 30 
A careful examination of the cvidence adduced by the spon sors of the rain god theory and the sun-god theory 10 support of their respective theories, would seem to show that these theories cancel each other Broadly speaking, most of the objections raised againt the first naturalistic interpretation of the Indra mythology, which has been discussed above, can, with cqual vall. dity, be raised against this second naturalistic interpretation as well It may be pointed out, for instance, that Vara's counter part in the Alesta does not signify the water demon even remo. tcly Wlat, again, is the vajra of the sun god ?% ff lodra was

originally a sun-god belonging, as HILLEBRANDT suggests, parti cularly to the pre Iadian Vedic mythology, no satisfactory explana tion could be given as to why he should have been condemned to the position of a demon in the ancient Iranian mythology Further, there was already, in the Vedic pantheon, one sun god, namely, Surya What could have been the specific reasons for introducing a new sun god? As a matter of fact, Indra and the sun are often mentioned side by side thus indicating their distinct personalities (1 32 4, 51.4, II 12 7. III 31 15, VI 17 3, 21 3, VIII 12 30, X 171 4 Again, the elevation of a solar divinity to the supreme position in the Vedic pantheon cannot be adequately accounted for 
The descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra-Vr̥tra battle are such as produce the impression that that battle had been parti cularly violent and fearful (1 80 11, II 11 9-10, VI 17 9) In overpowering Vr̥tra, bus vanquisher, Indra, had to perform enormously terrific feats (I 32 5,57 6, 80 14) Such descrip tions would appear quite incongruous when related to the springe time sud At the advent of the spring, the sun appears as a particularly life giving ard energising power rather than as a fear ful giant Further, it is to be seriously doubted whether the phenomenon of the dwindling away of rivers in the winter, even in the regions mentioned by HILLEBRANDT, was actually so very common and significant in the life of the Vedic people as to be made the central iheme of the mythology relatiog to their greatest god The idea of glaciers, etc, which are supposed to be lock ing up the waters of the rivers, is nowhere unequivocally present cd in the RV HILLEBRANDTS suggestions that Rauhina, as the moon, is the lord of the winter and thus represents the winter demon killed by Indra, and that the references to sayāna Vr̥tra may poetically signifv the sleed of nature (that is, the winter)

were to be accepted, Indra should have been connected with the sasanta rather than the grisma Other features of the Indra mythology, particularly Indra's close association with the Maruts and his proverbial fondness for the intoxicating beverage, would not fit in well with the sun god theory The human elements in Indra's character are, as indicated above, too vital and realistic to be regarded merely as the result of anthropomorphic tenden cies It is, therefore, difficult to accept HILLEBRANDT's theory that Indra originally represented the sun god 97 As a matter of fact, that scholar himself could not altogether overlook the fact that the elements relating to the phenomenon of rain are suffi clently prominent in Indra's personality He, therefore, conclu

Several other variations of the solar theory have been proposed by scholars Mas MOLLER, for instance, sees in the Indra Vstra myth the symbolical description of the daily triumph of light over darkness (Contri bution to the Same of Afythology I, pp 141-42) It may be recalled that he has identified Indra also with Jupiter Pluvus ( Lectures on the Sacter of Language 11, 470) Hc bclicvcs that ytra primarily the demon of darkness and that the vascularing of poctic imagery between dark night and dark cloud would be quite in keeping with the Vedic myth making BG TILAK 
(Arche Home, 233 ff ), who propounded the theory that the Vedic mythology, 23 a whole, can be best understood only by relating it to the natural phenomena observable in the Arctic region saw in Indra the sun-god who overpowered the demon of darkness who dominated that region continuously for some months, VA GADCIL suggests (ABORI XXIII, pp 134 ff that Indra and Varuṇa represent the two aspects of the central Vedic concept of pla Varuṇa, according to hin the representative of the passivc moral Principle while Indra is the representative of the highest physical aspect of nature GADCU. further zuggests that the concept underlying the Indra Vpra myth the eternal conflict between leas and tamas It may be pointed out that GADCIL a interpretation, besides not being supported by Vedic evidence is far too abstract It is indecd, doubtful whether Vedic poets ever made a clear cut istinction between the physical and the non physical aspects of nature More or less the same thing can he said about the theory of FATEH SINGH (JBHU 5), who sees in Indra the deity of universal light and energy He interprets the myth of Indra s birth through the side of bus mother as representing the first light of dawa wh ch is visible in a circular way R Sram SASTRI (DC Law Vol 1, 227-281) conoccts the Vedic mythology with astronomical bodies and phenomena According to him, Indra 15 the sun fighting with the eclipse demon Sambara he explains Thomas Comm l'ol, 257-61), is an eclipse-demon of the type of Rahu and

ded that Indra was originally the sun, but, in the RV, is no longer the sun god, while not yet a rain god 53 For, as he points out, the six passages in the RV, which unequivocally refer to Indra as the giver of rains, occur in the fourth, the eighth, and the tenth mandalas, which fact would indicate, according to him, that the character of Indra as a rain god was still not established in the Rgvedic times HILLEBRANDT, however, does not seem to have taken into account the fact that several descriptions of the Indra Vr̥tra fight in the RV, 31 though not necessarily indicative of Indra's essential character as rain god, do indirectly imply the phenomenon of storm and rain Those descriptions may not and, as shown above, do not prove that Indra was primarily a rain god But they do certainly indicate that, among the naturalistic elements superimposed on Indra's original character, those normally connected with a rain god are more prominent 
The foregoing discussion of the two principal naturalistic interpretations of the Indra mythology will have made it amply clear that the naturalistic or cosmic elements could not have been either the basic or the primary elements in Indra's character

on the original personality of that god Our aim will, therefore, be, firstly, to find out what the original character of Indra must have been, and, secondly, to describe and rationally account for the circumstances under which the cosmic elements must have been superimposed on his personality 3*

36 Some other theorics regarding the basic character and personality of Indra baic also been put forth by scholars HOPKNS, for instance, believes that Indra was originally a god of fertility (JAOS 36, pp 242 ff) In support of his theory, that scholar has adduced evidence from the cpic, post-Vedic, and Vedic sources In the epics, Indra i called pakafasona (= crop controller ?), and the festival of Indra u always associated with harvest and fortuity rather than with victory Io the PfraskaraGS (II 17 9), Indra's wife is said to be Sit, that is personificd furrow Indra figures as the foremost among the gods worshipped at the ceremony of first starting the ploughs (Cf Gobhilas IV 4 28 ) In AV IV 4 4, Iodra 1 said to be responsible for putting vinlity in the o adhus Indra is described in the RP 25 utvarHart, he wins the tilth, is lord of tilth, as he 11 lord of cattle (11 21 6, VI 601, VII 21 3) Such references, according to HIOPKINS, indicate that Indra was first celebrated as a demon of fertility He was then accepted as the chief war god among two or three clans (HOPKNS bas clscwhere - JAOS 37, 83 ff - tried to show that the combination of gods of war and fertility 1not uncommon) From war god he was later on elevated to be the greatest god of the large group of clans Without cxamining, in detai, the vicws of HQFAINS, we may only point out that several of thic objections raised against the rain god thcory or the sun god theory can be raised, with cqual appositeness, against the fertility-god theory as well The references to thu aspect of Indra's character arc clearly secondary and incidental. It is not unlikely that tlac hinu regarding the power of fertility possessed by Indra are duc to the combination of the elements of the rain-god and the sun god, which were superimposed on his personality Its well known that the sun and the rain together on use fertility 
One great drawback of the naturalistic and simular other interpretations Is that their sponsors stm to view Vedic mythology as if it were a static phcaatacnon They forget that, in consonance with the various 17c1iSitudes In the Vedic way of life and thought, there must have been revitably elected ngalfcant modifications in the Vedic mythology as well Therefort, lo emphauzt only one aspect of the personality of a cdc god without taking into account the other aspects and thereby try to determine the basic character of thrt god u bound to prove a faulry procedure It would lead but to a partnl picture of the personality of that god

character (prakrti) so conspicuously prominent as in Indra A closer examination of the descriptions of Indra's person and character would further convince one that so plastic a figure as his and so essentially human a behaviour as is attributed to him cannot be considered to have been the result of more anthropo morphism It may be pointed out that, as against the vague and indefinite naturalistic elements, the human features in Indra's personality are so realistic and life like that one feels iaclined unhesitatingly to accept the latter as more basic and essential Indra's body, bead, arms, and hands are very often referred to (11 162, VIII 963) He is said to be golden in colour (1 72, VIII 66 3) His body is gigantic, his neck mighty, and his back brawny His arms are sleek, and his hands thick and firm — both right and left being particularly well shaped (I 1026, IV 219, VI 193, VIII 81 1) He has hardsome cheeks (or lips ), and is, therefore often called susipra (II 126, 335), Siprin 29 2, III 36 10), or sipraian ( VI 17 2) He is tawny haired (X 96 5,8) and tawny bearded (X 234) These and several other similar descriptions of Indra s person unmistakably produce before our minds eye a very life lıke picture of a tall, strong, well formed, handsome, blonde Aryan Far more life lıke, how eyer, are the descriptions of some peculiar physical mannerisms of that god He agitates his jaws (VIII 76 10 ), or puffs out his beautiful lips (III 321) ip a characteristic fashion, in an cipation of or after the Soma draught Once he is described very realistically, indeed -- as shaking off the drops of Soma from his moustaches (11 11 17) There are references to another peculiar movement of the upper lip, and to the shaking of the beard (X 231, 26 7) Such characteristic physical traits and mapnerisms must necessarily be distinguished from the very general human traits attributed to a god as the result of the normal anthropomorphic tendencies Indra's appearance and mannerisms are so very distinctively individual that they seem to have been derived from a specific human person 
Another peculiarity which clearly distinguishes Indra from the other major gods of the Veda, is the fact that he is frequently

referred to as having been born Two entire hymns, namely, III 48 and IV 18, deal with the subject of his birth In one of these hymns. Indra is said to have been born in an unnatural way, that is, through the side of his mother (IV 18 1-2) A special reference to such an unusual phenomenon would become meaning Jess unless there had been in vogue, among the people, some such traditional belief relating to the birth of an actual human hero As is scll known, such miraculous birth is always associated, 10 the popular mind, with a great and unique person 37 It is further not unlikely that the reference to Indra's having killed his father in order to snatch away Soma from him and having thus made his own mother a widow (III 48 4, IV 18 12) is the result of popular myth making based on an ordinary historical fact such as that Indra's father dicd suddenly soon after his birth 38 Indra's miraculous power is said to have become evident as soon as he was born (111 518, Y 30 5, VIII 45 4, 771, X 113 4) In X 1531, there is a reference to the infant god surrounded by atten dant women Apother interesting reference is to be found in VIII 69 15, where the immature boy, Indra, of head strong temperament, is spoken of as having mounted a new wagon, and roasted, for his parents, a fierce bull All these descrip

tions point unmistakably to the basic human character of Indra's personality 
A reference has already been made elsewhere to the tradı tional belief that Indra is a later addition to the Vedic pantheon This very significant tradition cannot be adequately explained except on the assumption of Indra's primarily human personality It implies that Indra was not originally a god, but that he was a human hero who attained godhead by virtue of his miraculous exploits Not only that, but he soon superseded the older gods (VII 21 7) and came to be regarded as the foremost among them (II 121) This fact is mythologically represented in a variety of ways in the later Vedic literature ( TS II 342, MSI 94, 
TB II 233, 277, AB VIII 4 12) 
But by far the most convincing proof of the essentially human character of Indra is the fact that the Vedic poets have often referred to what may be called the weaknesses' of that god One such oft-mentioned weakness is Indra's proverbial fondness for Soma Hıs immoderate indulgence in the intoxicating beverage is a favourite theme of the Vedic poets Indra is spoken of as having gone to the extent of stealing Soma to quench his thirst (III 48 4, VIII 44) He was somapa par excellence But his was not merely an addict's passion for drink For Soma always exhilarated him to carry out his warlıke deeds (II 151, 192, VI 47 1-2, VII 222, VIII 926) For, instance, in order to prepare himself for a decisive war with Vr̥tra, Indra is described of course, hyperbolically to have drunk three tankfuls of Soma (V 29 7) But the most significant sukta, which must needs be mentioned in the present context, is X 119 39 In this sūkla, Indra is represented as being under the influence of an excessive draught of Soma and consequently boasting of his greatness and capricious power As PERRY has rightly pointed out, Indra's condition after a drink of Soma parodied in this suhta is too realistic not to be considered human It is a fine example of

caricature and would remind one of modern newspaper caricatures - either in the form of humorous articles or of cartoons in which innocent fun is made of some foible in tlic character of a great personage No disrespect is, however, thereby intended On the other hand, by light-heartedly poking at such a foible, that high personality is brought neater to the hearts of the people, for, it, indeed, emphasizes his essential humapness As a matter of fact, it is believed that such harmless foibles enhance, rather than detract from, the genuine greatness of that person Ipdra, the human hero, must have been in the habit of indulging in a more or less sumptuous draught of Soma in order to invigorate himself before entering battle This well known habit of his seems to have been made the subject of a delightful parody in the Laba suhta 
Similarly Indra is represented as an expert in female lore (VIII 33 17) He seems to have taken a peculiar interest in the welfare of the children of uomarried girls (IL IS 7) As a domestic aider and as particularly interested in girls not yet married, he appers in the form of the little man' iqvoked by Apālā (VIII 91 ), who chews Soma plant and prepares grain for him that he may make her friutful" In AV (VIII 6 13), Indra is said to come to the help of a pregnant woman Though Indra's amorous adventures are nowhere clearly mentioned in the RI, there are, in it, a few faint jedications of that trait of his character These latter must have, indeed, been the basis of Indra's representation, in later mythology, as a romantic figure a 'gay Lothario'"? In the Athari aleda, Indra is once said to have been enticed away by an Asura female ( VII 38 2) In another Vedic passage, we are told that Indra, being enamoured of a danari, named Valistenga, went to live among the Asuras, assuming the form of a female among females and of a male among males A mention must also be made, in this context,

of the famous Vrsākapı hymn (X86) In that hymn, Indra 18 spoken of as having been exhausted when a bold, lascivious monkey administered to him some medicine, through which Indra regained his manly power As shown in another paper," this Vrsākapı is to be identified with the fertility-god Viṣṇu 
The whole episode may thus refer to Indra's efforts to preserve his virility intact 45 Such descriptions of a more or less intimate' character must be understood to refer to the actual life of a human hero before he became the supreme god 
It may be pointed out, in this connection, that the Vedic poets have never unnecessarily overidealised the character of Indra, which they would have done had he been primarily thought of as a god Indra was essentially a man of this world, and, as such, he did not disdain deceiving his enemy or cleverly circumscribing the conditions of an agreement whenever circumstances so de manded 46 Another very significant reference, so far as Indra's original character is concerned, is to be found in 1 32 14, where the mighty Indra is said to bave been overcome with fear when, after killing Vr̥tra, he thought that some avenger of the enemy was following him Such a reference would be hardly understandable in relation to a god, who had been conceived as a god from the very beginning

harmonious relations between the heroic leader and his loyal followers seem to have been disturbed on certain occasions (I. 170 2, 171 6, VIII 7 31 ) It must have been either cowardice or treachery on the part of the Maruts, which had estranged them from Indra Indra is represented as telling them, in derision, that they were not eager to accompany him when he went to the battle field, but that, when he was zovited to a sacrifice, they did not want to leave him alone (I 165 ) This realistic legend relating to the temporary estrangement between Indra and the Maruts must have been based on an actual episode, and would thus prove the historicity of Indra as much as bis essentially human character The facts that Indra is described as wandering in various forms (IIC 48 4, 53 8, VI 47 18 ), 48 and that his ene mies did not first realise the greatness of his prowess or altogether refused to believe in his very existence (II 12 5) further confirm the primariness of the human traits in Indra's personality as well as his historicity 
More prominently and frequently, however, than the mere human traits have the heroic traits in Indra's personality been celebrated in the RV fodra's name itself verily comprises all notions relating to virile power 9 He is often very significantly called, or compared with, a bull, who was regarded as the symbol of such power (1 165 11, II 16 4, V 31 5, VIII 1 1) Indra is superhumanly mighty (I 80 15, VI 21 10, VII 21 7, VIII 50 2), he is dreadful (1 84 2,7, II 21 2), he is, indeed, 10. vincible (IV 17 19,30 3,5) No one born, past or present, can rival him (I 165 9) Several epithets expressive of excessive power, such as Sakra, sacivat, Satakratu, manasıān, etc, are

frequently attributed to Indra Indra's susma and nrmna (IT 12 1) are often referred to and his eternal youth and vigour (II 16 1, III 32 7, VI 24 7, X 86 11 ) have become almost the ballmark of his personality But there is also another side to Indra's heroic character He is exceedingly generous (I 84 19, IV 31 7, VIII 14 4,24 21, 81 3) He freely bestows goods and wealth on the pious man (II 194, 22 3. VII 27 3), and this he can easily do, for, he possesses all treasures (I 30 10, VI 43 8 As a matter of fact, Indra's liberality had become so yery characteristic of him that he almost entirely monopolised the proud epithet maghavan 50 Indra's wisdom and prudence also are frequently celebrated in the RV (1 62 12, II 16 2, VIII 96 3) 
It will be thus seen that Indra's personality presents a curious combination of human and superhuman' or heroic' ele ments As a matter of fact it is this combination of the “human and the superhuman', which makes Indra's personality so 
• living' and so attractive The incongruity between the human aspect of Indra s personality characterised by sansuousness and similar other normal weaknesses, on the one hand, and tric superhuman aspect characterised by miraculous powers, genero sity, and similar other traits of beroic perfection on the other, is not due to the more intense anthropomorphism of Indra's nature 51 It is rather the result of the sincere efforts on the part of the Vedic poets to present a realistic picture of a historical human hero, who while accomplishing almost superhuman deeds, suli exbibited the essential humanness of his character in the light of what has been said above, it would be very interesting to see how the Vedic poets approach their favourite national god Jodra, in varying attitudes — sometimes in a 'crouching, pusil lazımous spirit and fear of his violence', at other times, on remarkably intimate and friendly terms, but always exhibitios great devotion and fidelity towards him, a firm belief in his mita culous powers and a 'touching reliance upon his goodness!

On the strength of tlie evidence adduced so far, we may dow be justified in concluding that Indra must have been primarily a human bero - indeed, essentially a historical personality -- that, in course of time, he must have been elevated to the position first of the national war god and then of the supreme god and that, later on, naturalistic or cosmic elements must have been superim posed on his personality 53 How can we account for this growth of Indra's personality? In order to be able to answer this question satisfactorily, we shall have to go back to the cultural history of the ancestors of the Vedic Indians 
As indicated in another paper, we may assume on the strength of linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture historical evidence, that the proto Indo Europeans had their Ofiginal home in the Ural - Altaic region Some tribes from among this proto IE stock migrated from their primary Urheimar towards the South Eastern direction and ultimately reached the Iegion around Balkh There they lived for a considerable length of time before further migrations started from among theo? As a matter of fact, these tribes remained in the region round about Balkh so long that they almost forgot their connections with their primary Urheimat For our present purpose it is neither neces sary nor relevant to go into the details of this whole problem of the original home of the Indo Europeans and their early migra trons It may only be pointed out that these people, who lived in the region of Balkh were the proto Aryans in the initial stages of the proto Aryan period, there took place some stray and desultory migrations mainly towards the South Western Asiatic region But even after these small scale migrations, the

It was, indeed, in this region that the 'Aryan' language and religion attained characterisation' In other words, the common primary form of the languages and the religions of the RV and of the Avesta must have evolved wbile the common ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians lived together in their common home in the Balkh region The most characteristic fea. ture of the religion of these people, which we may call the *Aryan' religion, seems to have been the concept of Asura Varuṇa 56 In the course of the evolution of their religious thought, the Aryans had realised that this universe, vast as it was, was not 'chaos' Every single phenomenon -- big and small - in cosmic as well as human life was governed by some definite law The universe was, as it were, magically bound' down and thus strictly regulated It was, in other words, cosmos' The concepts of the cosmic law, rta, and of the administrator of that law, the cosmic magician Varuṇa, represent the most outstanding contribution of the Aryans to religious thought in general that age, the life of the Aryans had been so closely bound with nature, from several points of view, that it was but inevitable that they should have evolved the religious concept of the cosmic magic bondage No doubt, there must have grown, among the Aryans, several other religious concepts and practices, such as lof instance, those connected with Soma Haoma and fire, but the Asura Ria-concept seems to have completely dominated the Aryab religious ideology 
As has been already indicated, the Aryans did not live in the region around Balkh permanently Further migrations started from that region As compared with the major primary migru.

tions of the Indo-Europeans from their Urheimat in the Ural Altaic region, the migrations of the Aryans from the Balkh region may be called the secondary migrations in the history of the Todo European pcoplcs Some tribes from among the Aryans who were of a peace loving temperament moved towards the South West Gradually, and without having to encounter any serious hindrance, they migrated to the north of Iran and subsequently settled in that country These were the ancient Iranians As may be expected, they had brought with them, to their new home, the Aryan language and religion in their basic forms Naturally enough, in course of time, the ancient Iranians must have deve loped the basic Aryan language and religion in their own peculiar manner The other Aryan tribes, however, were more ambitious and warlıke From their home in the Balkh region these adven turers set out on a mission of conquest and colonization towards the South-East Tbis, however, was not an easy task On their odward march these people, who were really the ancestors of the Vedıç Indians, had to encounter serious opposition from several antagonistic tribes Their gradual progress towards Saptasındhu, where they ultimately settled down, makes a long tale of a series of wars But through all these wars, the early Vedic people were finally led to victory by a heroic compatriot of theirs, whom they very appropriately called Indra 
It may be presumed that the tribes who tried to arrest the onslaught of the Vedic Indians came from various stocks From the descriptions in the Ry, it would appear that they were racially and culturally quite different from the Vedic Aryan adventurers They are generally said to have been black skinned (I 130 8, II 20 7 ) and snub posed (V 29 10) Their speech was barbarous (T 174 2, V 29 10, 32 8), they did not perform any sacrifices as the Aryans did (I 33 4, VII 6 3, VII 70 11), they did not worship the Aryan gods (II 31 19, VIII 70 11), and, above all, they did not recognise the national hero of the Vedic Indians, namely, Indra (IV 23 7, VI 18 16, also cf II 12 5) 
These antagonistic tribes, who are variously described as having stolen away the cattle of the Aryans (II 12 3, III 30 10, VI.

IV 24 3) For, they looked upon him as their one compassionate helper (184 19, VUI 66 13, 801), as their deliverer and advocate (VIII 96 20 ), as their very stroogth - & veritable wall of defence (VIII 69 7) Never rodeed did he fail them (X. 152 1) With his special thousand pronged weapon, vajra (1. 80 12), he smote down the barbarous enemies (I 101 5, VI 23 2), and gave land to the Aryans (IV 26 2, VII, 33 5) He thus ensured for them a smooth career of conquest and coloni. zation It is, therefore, no wonder that such a leader should have soon become a national hero and then a national god of the Vedic Indians 62 A warring people would naturally glorify to the utmost a warlike god 63 This heroic god of battle, though a later addition to the Vedic pantheon, soon surpassed all earlier gods ( 11 12 1, 111 46 3), who yielded to him in might and strength (VIII 62 7) Even, the important older gods subordt.

nated their power to Indra's divine glory and kingly dignity (VII 21 7) This elevation of a national hero to the supreme godhead must be assumed to have belonged to a period subsequent to the bifurcation of the Iranian Aryans and the Indian Aryans Such an assumption alone would rationally explain why Indra is traditionally regarded as derānam ānujävara, and why this supreme god of the Vedic Indians does not find place in the Avestan pantheon 
Such then is briefly the story of the genesis of Indra's godhead One thing, however, must be necessarily emphasized in this connection It will be casily realised that all the warlike exploits, which, in the RV, are attributed to Indra, could not have been accomplished by one single individual The credit for many of them must certainly be given to the historical hero 
But when history becomes mythology, an individual also tends to be more or less tumed into an institution Such is normally the course of mythological development particularly in the Veda When, therefore the historical Indra was transformed into a national war god, all mighty deeds of prowess ---real or imaginary - came to be regarded as his handiwork It may also be pointed out, in this context, that the warriors of the Vedic age soyoked Indra for help not only in their battles with the Dāsas and other inimical tribes There was a period in the history of the Vedic people when different Vedic tribes fought among them. selves In such civil wars, both sides invoked Indra for help (11 12 8) Indra is, therefore, often described, in the RV, as the valiant vanquisher of the Dasa foes as well as of the Arya foes (VI 22 10, 33 3,60 6, VII, 83 1, X 69 6) This fact would again confirm Indra's essential character as a war-god 
This elevation of a historical hero to the position of the national war.god of the Vedic Indians was accompanied by the superimposition on the original character of Indra of certain features which were derived from a significant mythological concept belonging to the common Aryan period it has already been pointed out that the most predominant religious concept, which was evolved during the Aryan period, was that of Asura

concepts 9 The elevation of Indra to the position of the national war-god — which mythological phenomenon was restricted only to the Vedic Indians - conferred a new meaning on the vrtra - yrtrahan concepts Those abstract' concepts were, so to say, given some 'concrete' basis in the course of the development of Vedic mythology The historical hero, Indra, overcame a number of human foes who had 'resisted' the onward march of the Vedic Indians These human foes, thus, naturally came to be looked upon as the Vstras "o And correspondingly the more or less colourless and abstract divinity, which overcame resistance, damely, Vr̥trahan, came to be merged into the bistori. cal hero, who actually overcame the human Vr̥tras ?

69 As pointed out by BAILEY (BSOS VII, 975), the interpretation of the expansion of the Vythragna worship gains much from the consideration, in the monograph by BENVENISTE and RFNOU (pp 63 ff), of Hellenistic Artagnis, Armenian Vahagn, Chorasmian Arthaga, and Sogdian Vasagat 
70. BUDDHA PRAKASH suggests (ABORI XXX, 163 ff) that the Vetras defeated by thc Vedic Aryans actually represented a specific pre Volic Indian people He is inclined to identify them with the Verctatat or the Oraturae mentioned by MEGASTHENES in Indika BUDDHA PRAKASH further points out that the Vrtas possessed the elements of the Dasyus and the Asuras, that their habitat was the Himalayan range of the North - Yes (Incidentally it may be mentioned that, while discussing the question o "The Cradle of the Indra Vr̥tra Myth", K CHATTOPADHYAYA (Pror AIOC, 529-33 ) suggests that Semucchiosk in Russian Turkestan, which, accord ing to him, is identical with the Vedic Saptasındhu, must have been the region where that myth came to be cvolved), and that their religion was characı rised by serpent-symbology (cf in this connection RÖNNOW S Views mentioncu in foot note 59) Considering, however, the facts that the word, ulap, occurs in neuter plural that the Vr̥tras both among the Aryas and me Disas are mentioned in the RV, and that, in the Avesta, the word, iara, occurs without any historical siga ficance. It is difficult to accept the idenus fication of the VF ras with any specific people Vytan indicates foes in general. 
71 That the concept of Vithragua is specifically Aryan, and, therclore, carlier than that of Indra, which is specifically Indian, is confirmed by the fact that the word arthragna, occurs in the earlier strata of the Acesta, such as the Strozah the Yasts, and the Afrigans, while the word, andra, represent. ing the demonisation of the Vedic god, Indra occurs only in the later strata, as also by the fact that, in the Avesta, the concept of Vithragna receives a more or less detailed treatment, while that of Andra occurs only in a casual manner As a matter of fact, the name Andra occurs, in the Adesta, only twice (Vid X. 9, VIX 43)

Indian historical current and an ancient Aryan mythological current thus combined to form the later Vedic mythological concept of Vr̥trahā Jodra As against this, among the peaceable Ancient Iranians, there was no scope for such historical concretisa tion of the concepts of Vr̥tra - Vr̥trahan Those concepts have, thereforc, conserved their original abstract sease in the Avesta 72 It must be pointed out, in this connection, that, even in the RV, the frequent occurrence of the neuter plural, vitrānı (VI 22 10, 60 6, VII 83 1 ), betrays the original impersonal and abstract connotation of the word 
The history of the concept of Vţtra is closely linked up with the course of the evolution of the lodra mythology as a whole Originally the word, vrira, significantly used in neuter gender, expressed the general idea of resistance. It was in no way connected with the concept of Indra, which, as a matter of fact, had not then even arisen This was the state of thupgs 10 the common Aryan period When the histor cal hero, Indra, came to be glorified among the Vedic Indians, they personified the impersonal concept of Vr̥tra, which they had inherited from their Aryan ancestors Vftras then came to denote the human foes, whom Indra, the national hero of the Vedic Indians, valantly put down Soon Indra, the national hero, was defied by the Vedic poets Corresponding to this deification of the human Indra, there took place the demonisation of the human Vr̥tra At this later stage of the Rgvedic mythology, the hustorical human Vytras were collectively transformed into the one 'demon', who prominently opposed Indra, the great god And still later, when Daturalistic elements came to be superimposed upon Indra's ongina personality as the result of which Indra came to be

regarded as the rain god, there was a corresponding naturalistic transformation of Vr̥tra's personality so that he came to be looked upon as the cloud demon 73 It will now become perfectly clear why, in the Avestan mythology, there is a divin ty, Vrthragna but no demon, Vrthra, why the Avestan Vrthragna and Andra are in no way connected with each other, why, in the RV, Vrtahan lost his character as an independent divinity and that word became merely an epithet of Indra, and, finally, why in the RV, the word Vr̥tra, 18 employed, 10 neturer plural, to denote the human foes, and, in masculine singular, to denote a demon 
It has been already pointed out that the origin of the religious practices connected with Soma Haoma must be traced back to the common Aryan period The ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians, who lived together in the Balkh region, must have soon discovered the remarkable properties of the Soma plant, which grew in abundance on the slopes of the Müjavat mountain situated close to their common habitat The intoxi cating juice extracted from this plant must have been originally used in connection with some primitive magic ritual Anthropo logical investigations would amply testify to the practice of the primitive priests taking some such intoxicating decoction with view to producing in themselves a peculiar magic orgiastic ecs tacy 74 With the rise, among the Vedic Indups, of the valiant hero, Indra, Soma drinking came to be naturally associated w him It may be said that, in a sense, the intoxicating drink began to be used for a purpose which cannot be said to have been strictly ritualistic A draught of Soma, before entering battle, would banish all fear from the hearts of the warriors and put new vigour in them This must have, indeed, been a most common experience 75 It is quite understandable that Iadra, the tvartior

leader, should have been described as indulging in the Soma drinking more freely than others As a matter of fact, in course of time, immoderate indulgence in the Soma-drinking came to be regarded as a distinctive trait of Indra's character - at once the strength and the weakness of the national hero And, as shown elsewhere, the Vedic poets have actually treated it as such in their glorification of Indra Indra became somapā par excellence (II 12 13 ) He is often described, in the RV, as getting exhilarated by a drink of Soma for carrying out his warlıke deeds (II 15 1; 19 2, VI 47 1, 2, VII 222, VIII 92 6) Whatever Indra accomplished he owed to the magic power of Soma Sometimes however, the Herculean head of the hero must have become befogged by an overdose, and it is such a condition which has been beautifully caricatured by a Rgvedic poet an X 119 The Vedic poets rcfcr to Indra as a thirsty stag' (VII 4 10), or a 'thirsty bull' (1 130 2), or a thirsty buffalo' (I 16 5) Indra is so eager for a drink that he cannot wait until Soma is drawn for hım (X 116 4), but 'guips down cask and lancet and all *** 
The concert relating to Soma is thus the second Aryan religi ous concept - the first being the Vr̥tra-Vr̥trahan concept - which has been combined with the Vedic Indian historical concept of the national hero The more or less secular significance with which the concept of Soma came to be endowed on account of its connection with the historical warrior, Indra, must, however, be considered to have been but a temporary phase With the clcyalion of Indra to godhead and the gradual development of the regular Vedic ritual, Soma again attained, in the fullest possible measurc, its original migico-ritualistic significance (which, as indicated above, it must have never lost altogether). and Soma worship became a cry prominent feature of the Vedic religion 3

In view of the continued warlike activities of the Vedic Indians, it was but natural that they should have elevated their national war god, Indra, to the supreme godhead in their pan theon This action on their part gave rise to quite a serious mythological upheaval It will be remembered that Asura Varuṇa was the supreme god of the common religion which the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians had evolved This Asura dominated religion was inherited both by the Indian Aryans and the Iranian Aryans The Iranian Aryans seem to have faithfully stuck to that religion As a matter of fact, 10 the normal life of those people, there does not seem to have occurred any very significant event, which could have influ enced their religious ideology to any appreciable extent of course, in course of time, they developed the Asura-religion of their Aryan ancestors in their own peculiar manner, so that it eventually took the form of the religion presided over by Ahura Mazdah The case of the Vedic Indians, on the other hand, was essentially different As has been already pointed out the Vedic Indians were ambitious adventurers They, therefore, set out on a career of warlıke activities, valiantly fighting their way towards the Saptasındhu country in this their new career, they must have found that the cosmic magic Asura religion, which had come down to them from their Aryan ancestors was not at all adequate Awarring people, as suggested above necessarily wants a war god - rather than a god presiding over cosmic law - as their supreme god 'The Vedic Indians, therefore, transe formed their national hero, Indra into such a war god, and 14 consonance with their new way of life and thought, worshipped him as their greatest god Thus, in the religion of the Vedic Indiaos, Indra ultimately superseded Asura Varuṇa In other words, the new Vedic religion prevailed over the ancient Aryan religion

A critical study of the RV would show that, in that Veda, three distinct pbases of the relation between the ancient Yaruna religion and the new Indra religion can be clearly marked Some passages in the RV (I 24 6,25 10, IT 27 10, VII 87 5,6, VIII 41 7, X 132 4) are still found to glorify Varuṇa as the world soyercigo They thus seem to preserve the memories of the religious ideology of the pre Indra Aryan period This represents one phase The major portion of the RV, however, clearly indi cates that Varuṇa religion was being pushed into the background and the Indra religion was aggressively coming to the forefront The RV-hymn, IV 42, is a highly significant document in this connectic Varuṇa is shown in that hymn to assert his right to supremacy and to adduce valid reasons in support of his claim (st 1-4) Indra is made to say that Varuṇa's arguments did not concern him in the least and that, in virtue of his being the strongest god, he - Indra – must necessarily be regarded as the supreme god (st 5-6) Eventually the poet recognises unreser vedly the supremacy of Indra (st 7) This hymn thus represents, in an unmistakable manner, the supersession of Varuṇa by Indra 8 According to PERRY,79 another hymn, pamely, RVX 124, exhibits the transference of supremacy from Varuṇa to ladra in a very peculiar light Agdi is there represented as abandoning father Varuṇa and going over to Indra The fact that hardly a dozen hymns in the RV celebrate Varuṇa exclusively wbile Indra is glorified in nearly 250 hymns is again clearly indicative of Indra's ascendancy over Varunia 80 As will be shown later, this mytho

logical supersession of the Asura by Indra, which represents another phase of the Indra-Varuṇa relationship, gained a peculiar significance from two points of view -- first, from the point of viety of the relations between the Vedic religion and the Iranian religion, and, secondly, from the point of view of the political history of the Vedic Indians Still another phase of the relationship between these two mythological currents 15 marked by a spirit of compromise. It must be remembered that, even among the Vedic Indians, there were some groups who continued to adhere to the Varuṇa-religion They must have, however, seen the signs of the changing times Instead of either giving up the Varuṇa religion altogether or dogmatically sticking to it in the face of the generally prevailing Indra-religion, they, very wisely, tried to bring about an honourable compromise between the two religions They argued that, after victory is won by the war-god, Indra, Varuṇa is needed to establish law and order 
Indra conquers and Varuṇa rules this was their slogu (VII 83 9) Such attempts at a religious compromise seem to have been made particularly by the Vāsiṣṭhas (VII 82 2,»,, 84 2, 4, 85 3) $1

Side by side with this superimposition on Indra's personality of the character of a rain god, which represents the last phase in the process of the becoming' of lodra,10there occurred the merger of another mythological currrent into the Indra-mythology. A comparative study of the ancient mythologies of the world would show that most of them have one myth in common, namely, the myth relating to the contest between the hero and the dra. 
104 As pointed out by OLDENBERG (Rdl d Veda, 143 ). Indra 1 the rain god also in Palı literature Thug is quite understandable The super imposition of the character of a rain god on Indra's origipal personally represents the last phase in the growth of Indra It is therefore, natural that is last phase should have been mainly adopted in later literature It may, bow ever, be motioned in this connection that in Pall the word, syira, seems to have disappeared altogether (HILLEBRAXDT.

gon 106 The significance of this universal myth is quite obvious It should, however, be remembered in this connection that only the general basic skeleton of this myth is adopted by the various ancient mythologies, the details put into it being different in duffe Tent cases in other words, we find the concepts of Hero' and 
Dragon' in almost all ancient mythologies, but these concepts do not necessarily have the same contents everywhere 107 The ancient Aryans also adapted of course in their own peculiar manner this myth of the hero and the dragon in the general scheme of their mythological thought Iadeed, the Vedic Aryans must bave found the adaptation of this myth particularly easy In their new mythology, they had already deilied tlic historical hero, Indra The most natural thing for them to do, therefore, was to identify the hero of the ancient dragon myth with that historical hero Indra's principal enemies, both human and cosmic, accordingly came to be known by the name, Abi (dragon), and several new elements, derived from the apcient dragon myth, came to be introduced into the Indra mythology 10% So far as thc RV Is concerned, with the identification of Indra with the hero of the ancient dragon myth, the growth of the persopality of the Rgvedic Indra may be said to have come to an end 
106 The various forms which this universal hero dragon myth has taken in different ancient mythologies are Zeus and Typlion, Hercules and the Hydra, Apollo and Python 'Thor and the Serpent Marduk and Tiamat, Gilgames and Humbuda Innara and the Dragon Thraetappa and Azı Dahata.

In order to be able to answer this question, it would be necessary to trace albeit briefly - the evolution of the Marut mythology In the Rgvedic mythology, the Maruts arc associated mainly with two gods, namely, Rudra and Indra Just as the Maruts are designa ted as indrapresthah, the followers of Indra, they are also called rudrijāh, the children of Rudra How can these two concepts be correlated with each other 7 It is neither possible nor neces sary in the present context to go into the details of this enthe problem The following hypothesis may, however, be put tonia as the only one which would satisfactorily explain the various aspects of the mythology relating to the Maruts At one stage in the evolution of the Rudra-mythology, Rudra came to be repre. sented in the RV' as the god of death 100 and the Maruts belonged

originally to the paraphernalia of that god. Etymologically the word, marut, may be derived from the root mar (= to die ). It would seem likely that primarily the Maruts were the personifica tions of the souls of the deadlio and secondarily the messengers of the god of death. As the messengers of death, the Maruts seem to have formed a uniform, well-disciplined, homogeneous group. It has been pointed out, in another context,111 that, in the course of the development of the Vedic mythology, Rudra's character as god of death came to be gradually obliterated and that, soon, he came to be superseded in that role by Yama, who, incidentally, was not originally the god of death This must have inevitably resulted in the breaking up of the original connection between Rudra and the Maruts - even the few references to that connection, which have been preserved in the RV, becoming gradually less under standable. The Vedic poets then gave to the mythological concept of the Maruts quite a new significance. In doing so, they emphasized a specific feature of their original character, namely, that they formed a uniform and well-disciplined group. The Maruts are like brothers, among whom none is the eldest or the youngest ( V. 59. 6; 60. 5). They are equal in age (1. 165. 1) and are of one mind ( VIII. 20. 1, 21). They also look alike with their golden mantles (V. 55. 6), golden helmets (V. 54. 11), and armlets (II. 34.2). They always move about in fixed forma tions - thrice sixty (VIII. 85,8), or thrice seven (1. 133.0). These peculiarities of the Maruts must have presented to the mind of the Vedic poet the picture of the formations of well-disciplined soldiers in their uniforms. When, therefore, the memories of the original character of the Maruts were being gradually dimmed, the Vedic pocis must have naturally thought of associating them newly with their war-god, Indra. That the connection betneen the Maruls and Rudra represents a prior phase of the Marut-mythology is clearly indicated by the fewer and more or less vague references

in the RV to that connection 112 On the other hand, the referen ces to the association between Indra and the Maruts are many and quite distinct Moreover, the transference of the Maruts 
Rudra to Indra would appear more logical That the Maruts could have been transferred from a prominent god of the . official Vedic pantheon, like Indra, to Rudra, who was admitted into the Vedic pantheon almost under duress, 118 1s, indeed, inconceivable 114 As mentioned elsewhere, the Maruts are repre sented as increasing the strength and prowess of Iodra (III 35 9, VI 17 11) Tbey generally assist him in the battles (IJI 47 3-4, VIII 65 2-3, X 113 3 ) 115 Attention has already been drawn to a couple of passages in the RV, which seem to show that some features of the mythological connection between Indra and the Maruts may have been the reflections of the actual historical connections between a war-lord and his lieutenants In 
112 Attention may be drawn, in this context, to the very significant obsce vations made by L D BARNETT ("The Genius A Study in Indo-European Psychology", JRAS 1929, 731-748) According to that scholar, the strikus fact that just the Maruts have some serpent attributes (which do not belony to any other gods in the RV), such as ahibhanu (I 172 1), ahimanyu (I 618,9), ahtfufma (V 33 5), would indicate that, in the Vedic rcligious tradation, there was some old connection between the Maruts and the serpents." would also seem to confirm the original connection between the Maruts and Rudra (The later connection between Rudra Sıva and the serpents 13 weus known) BARNETT further points out that the Maruts of the RI art origin a host of geni, whoss primary duty is the guardianship of the Anya and his family The ord.nary man, the ranker in the Aryan armies, saw. the Maruts the celestial counterpart of humsci (BARNETT emphasizes the parallelism between the Maruts and the Fravaxis of the Apesta ) Ini Der arusche Mannerbund (Lund 1938, Sug WIKANDER has expressed some interesung vicws on this subject WIXANDER tries to prove that the ve word, marya, signified not merely a lusty young man but a member of particular society vowed to a particular cult The maryas wert, indeed, carthly counterparts of the Maruts in heaven According to tbat vhow! the two word, mary and marut, arc etymologically connected with a other

I 165 6 and VIII 7 31, the Maruts are described as having left their leader, Indra, in the lurch Elsewhere (I 170 2, 171 6) there is a clear reference to the serious differences between Indra and the Maruts It should, however, be remembered that such Incidents must have been but rare, and that they perhaps only help to confirm the historicity of Indra's original personality 
When in the course of the development of the Vedic mytho logy, a cosmic character camc to be superimposed upon the personality of the national war god, Indra, and when Indra was consequently transformed into a raid god, a corresponding trans formation occurred in the character of the Maruts also The trusted lieutenants of the war lord now became the allies of the rain god In other words, the Maruts came to be regarded as the divinities connected with storm This is the final phase in the evolution of the character of the Maruts as presented in the RV, and that is why, in later mythology, the Maruts are usually re presented as storm gods 116 
Another god, with whom lodra is associated in the RV, is Brhaspati-Brāhmaṇaspati (II 23 18, 24 12, IV 49 1-6, VIII 96 15) A critical study of the Rgvedic hymns, which celebrate Brāhmaṇaspati, would clearly show that that god is obviously a conscious priestly creation Without going into the details of this question, it may be pointed out that, through this god, the priestly community must have originally thought of glorifying the magic power of prayer The word, brahman (in Brāhmaṇaspati), must be understood in the sense of the magic power of prayer As indicated above, on account of their warlıke way of life and thought, the Vedic Aryans transformed Indra therr Victorious 
116 It is interest ng to note that the Vedic god, Vayu is rarely connected with the Maruts. He is only once referred to as having created the Maruts from the wornbs of the heaven (I 134 4 ) Had be naturalistic character of the Alarut been primary, there would have occurred more frequent references to the association between Vayu Vâta and the Maruts See, in this connec tion St & WIXANDER, Toyu Uppsala 1941 WIKANDER says ibat in the Tilcs, myths and speculations relat ng to Vāyu Vata we have clear traces of an old relig on which must have played an important role in the common Todo-Iran an period According to him, Viyu 1 at3 was not perely a god of Wind but also of breathing the soul of the universe

warrior leader, into the supreme god of the Vedic pantheon At that time, it must have been the anxiety of some Vedic poets and priests – an anxiety which is, indeed, quite understandable - gene rally to impress upon the people that it was not merely the valour of the warriors, blessed by the national war-god Indra, which helped them towards victory In order to be truly effective that valour has to be necessarily aided by the magic power of prayer This anxiety, on the part of those Vedic poets and priests, may be said to have been mythologically expressed through the creation of Brāhmaṇaspati In this context, attention may be drawn to the very significant fact that Brāhmaṇaspatı, like Indra, is a god of specifically Indian origin The Vedic poets have consciously set this god by the side of Indra and have represented him as having been responsible - together with Indra - for the victorious battles against the enemies (II 23 18, IV.49 1-6) Sometimes this concern to place the magic power of prayer on par with warlıke yalour seems to have got the better of the Vedic poets As the result of this, in some passages, Brāhmaṇaspat alone is credited, by the Vedic poets, with having accomplished the heroic deeds which are normally - and, of course, more naturally - attributed to Indra (1 40 8, II 23 11, 24 2, VI 13 1-2, X 67 5, 103 4) Some of Indra's exclusive epithets also have been applied to Brāhmaṇaspati - such as, for instance, magharen (II 24 12) and sajrin (I. 40 8 117 The obvious incogruity between the basic character of Brāhmaṇaspati, as clearly indicate by his name, and the generally warlike traits, which are sometimes attributed to him, can thus be rationally accounted for 18 
117 It is likely that a peculiar reaction of this tendency is to be in the passages where Indra is referred to rather incongruously-as Aplaun (VI 20 3) brahman (VI 457) and brahmarahas (VI 45 4 ) 
118 As was to be expected, in course of time, Indra, the national god of the Vedic pantheon, came to be regarded as the prototype and guardian of kingship in ancient India (A XIX. 24 2, MIS II 14 AB 23 I, SPB III 9 1 16 18 ) The Shami is said to bave chosen Indra * lord (AVXII ! 37) In AV (III 46) the king is significantly reless as human Indra Corresponding to this development of the Indra-com. Brāhmaṇaspati must have come to be regarded as the symbol of saccrue (TDI 7 7 4 )VRTRAHÃ INDRA

The history of the evolution of Indra's personality, which has been set forth above, would now make it amply clear why the Vedic mythology, as a whole, is so very greatly dominated by that god As indicated elsewhere, in course of time, Indra came to be regarded as the very symbol of the official Vedic religion This fact is fully confirmed by a peculiar mythological device which is sometimes employed in the RV Side by side with what may be called the official or hierarchical Vedic religion there had existed, in the Vedic age, several other currents of mythical and religious thought These latter seem to have been in vogue either among the masses of the Vedic people (as against the hierarchical classes) or among the non Vedic people It may be presumed that the religious and mythological ideology of these people was, for several reasons, found to be more or less unacceptable by the guardians of the official Vedic religion, which gradually tended to become sophisticated and hierarchical Their gods, therefore, must have originally received but scant recognition at the hands of the Vedic poets and priests In course of time, however, the religious cults of the masses - both Vedic and non-Vedic - must have effectively asserted themselves Consequently their gods must have inevitably forced their way into the Vedic pantheon With a view to properly consolidating this new position acquired by the popular' gods, the Vedic poets, who sponsored them, brought them into close association with Indra - more often artifi cially than otherwise Such association with Indra, the symbol of the official Vedic religion, served the purpose of settiag the seal, as it were, of official recognition for those gods 118 The association of Indra with Viṣṇu and with Pusan, which is demon strably artificial and the result of an afterthought, belongs to this category 120 The popular gods, Viṣṇu and Pusan, were, so to say, granted official recognition by being brought into association with Indra Except on this assumption, the relations between Viṣṇu

and Pusan, on the one hand, and Indra, on the other, would remain wholly ununderstandable 121 
Indra seems to have held the position of the official represep tative of the Vedic religion even in later times 122 The govardhana mountain episode in the career of Kispa 123 is only a mythological reflection of the historical contest between the Vedic religion, on the one hand, and the newly developed popular Bhāgavata reli gion, on the other 124

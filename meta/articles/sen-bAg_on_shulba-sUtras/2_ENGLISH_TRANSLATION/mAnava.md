1.1. Now we explain (the measuring with) a cord.
1.2. A cord of correct length with ties (at both of its ends) is stretched properly
along the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā).
1.3. By the middle of a pair (of nakṣatras) Citra and Svāti, Śravaṇā and Pratiśra- vaņā, Kṛttikā and Pratikṛttikā, Tiṣyā and Punarvasu, having risen 86 angulas (above the horizon), is (fixed) the eastern (cardinal) point, and it is (brought into a line) with the ties (of the cord).
1.4-1.6. (The cord) for the altar of the new and full moon sacrifice (dārśikyā) is 6 aratnis long, each (aratni) having the measure of 24 añgulas. The east-west line, east and west corners (prāci, amsas and śroņis) of the altar are fixed by means of drawing arcs with the help of a cord (marked) at 24 (= 7+17) angulas and 8 ( = 1 + 2 + 5) angulas. The cord is (then) placed from south-east corner (amsa) to the south-western corner (śroņi) and with this distance and with south-western corner as centre, is drawn an arc in the east. Having taken the centre of the circle at south- east corner, an arc is similarly drawn in the west. One end of the cord is now placed at this point of intersection and the portion from the south-east corner to south-west corner is cut off by means of drawing arcs. The same is repeated in the north, east and west.
1.7. The mound (khara) for the eastern fire (āhavaniya) is a square of one aratni, that for the western fire (gārhapatya) is in the shape of a chariot wheel (rathacakrākṛti) and that for the southern fire (dakṣiņāgni) in the form of the half moon (candrārdha).
1.8a,1.8b. A circle is drawn from the middle (point of a square drawn for āhavaniya) with koți measure. With third part of the length which lies outside (the square) together with the original (inside) length (i.e., half of the side of the square) is described another circle (for gārhapatya). Draw another circle with the half of the square circumscribing (second circle). The half of this circle is it (dakṣiṇāgni).
1.9. After having taken a cord equal to the distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavaniya, a mark is made at the third part of the other (i.e. western) end (and another at one-third distance from the east end). One-fourth of the middle part is left out (from the mark at the east). Now the terminal knots of the cord are fixed on (the two poles put on) the (two given marks) and the two cut ends are stretched towards south thereby assigning the (place for) the dakṣināgni.

1.10. Having interchanged (the end-knots), the place of the northern pit (utkara)
is fixed.
1.11. An extra length of a piece of cord is taken as long as its (original) measure. On the middle of the increased cord is given a sign for fixing the pole, and on the increased piece of the cord within this sign, a nirañchana mark is given at the middle
1.12. By this, the method of construction of all types of squares has been explained.

2.1. The pole (îṣā) is 188 añgulas long, the axle (akṣa) is 104 añgulas, the yuke (yuga)
is 86 angulas; this is the measure of the chariot of the Carakas.
2.2. After a mark is given at 188 añgulas, two marks are given at 6 and 9 and a tie
is made at 43, the measures being in angulas.
2.3. By this the altar for fastening animals (paśubandha vedi) for worshipping Indra and Agni is explained. This is measured with ratha units of the Carakas. The other paŝubandha sacrifice has (a prāci of) 6 aratnis.
2.4. The (mark at) six aratnis is for prăci, at half an aratni is for nirañchana, then at half an aratni for froņi, and then at half an aratni the mark is for amsas. This is the measure of the pāśuki vedi.
2.5. From (one end of) the tie marks are given at 1/2 aratni for south-west corner, then at 2 aratnis for fixing it on the western point of the east-west line, then at 2 aratnis for north-west corner, then at 11 aratni the nirañchana, then at aratni (the mark) for the south-east corner, then at 1 aratnis for north-east corner, then at 1 aratni for the (eastern) tie. The māruti and varuṇa altars are constructed with this cord.
2.6. The whole cord is 10 aratnis long, the nirañchana mark being at its middle. The mark for prāci must be at 5 aratnis. This is used to construct a pointed paityki vedi.
2.7. The whole cord is 7 aratnis; the nirañchana mark is at its middle. The mark for
prāci is at 5 aratnis. This gives the pointed paitṛki vedi.

3.1-3.3. The sacrificial hut (prāgvamsa) occupies (on the ground a square area of
side) 10 (aratnis); the hut for the wife (patniśālā) (a square) of 4 aratnis; the end of the (maha) vedi is at a distance of 3 (prakramas) from the prāgvaṁsa; and the sadas is one prakrama away from the western end of the (mahā) vedi. The (praci of) sadas is 9 (prakramas). The havirdhāna (a square) of 12 prakramas is 4 prakramas from the sadas and 10% prakramas from the yupavaṭa. One pada is allowed for the yūpāvaṭa, and
128
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
the remaining belongs to the uttara vedi. The agnidhra hut is (a square of) 6 aratnis. The cord (required for this) measures 36 prakramas.
3.4. Marks are given on a cord of length 36 (prakramas). The marks for (mahā) vedis, sadas, havirdhāna are given (on the cords) at 15, 21, 3, 3 and then 12. At the soma sacrifice, the best construction is done with (a measuring) cord.
3.5. Where the length of a rectangle is 3 padas, and breadth 1 pada, its diagonal
(squarred) will be 10 padas measured with a cord.
3.6. From a knot (at the end of a cord) used for the construction of the sadas, another knot is made at a distance of 13 (aratni); the same technique is applied for (shorter) length of 9 (aratni); this gives the best division for sadas.
3.7. Take a cord of 10 akṣa and 11 padas; the 24th part of this measure is stated to
be also the measure for the ekādaŝini altar.
3.8. Wishing to construct the sikhaṇḍini (vedi), 21⁄2 (angulas) should be left from the end of the mahāvedi; 71⁄2 angulas are known to belong to devyavedi. From the east this vedi looks like a lock on the crown of the head (sikhaṇḍinī vedi).
3.9. Five and seven (prakramas) and then one and one (less); this is called kaukili
vedi, according to Caraka.
4
4.1. If the sacrificer be short by birth or through illness, what measures should be
used by the priests ?
4.2. Six tuṇḍas made from the upper cover of a lotus stalk make one bāla of a three-
year-old calf.
4.3. Three bālas of a three-year-old calf are equal to half of a mustard seed; two
mustard seeds equal one yava.
4.4a, 4.4b. 1 añgula 6 yavas placed side by side; 1 prādeśa = 10 añgulas; 1 vitasti =
12 angulas; 1 aratni = 2 vitastis; 1 vyāyāma = 4 saya (aratni).
4.5. A man (puruşa) measures 120 angulas according to his own limbs; but standing
on his toes, he measures 125 añgulas.
4.6. 1 kṛṣṇala = 3 yavas; 1 māna = 3 kṛṣṇalas (berry); I nişka = 1 mānas.
4.7. Altars are constructed with (square) bricks having sides one-third (40 angulas) and one-fifth (24 añgulas) of a purușa. The half-bricks are prepared for fire- altars of three layers.
4.8. The (first) layer has eight by eight bricks, the second has eight by eleven; the layer should be placed alternately; the final layer has eight by twelve.
5
5.1. Now we shall explain the bricks required in future (construction).TRANSLATION
129
5.2. A bamboo rod equal to the length of the sacrificer with uplifted arms (120 ang)
is measured out.
5.3. A second (bamboo rod) equal to 144 ang. is taken up, and marks are given at 120 ang. (one purușa), 144 ang. (increased aratni), 132 ang (increased vitasti) and at the middle of 120 ang. (purușa) in each bamboo rod.
5.4. After clearing at the head, poles are fixed at each of the marks at two purușas
and at their middle as in the case of a pañcāngi cord.
5.5. Two bamboo rods are then fixed at the middle poles and a sign is given at a
distance of one purușa towards south, where these (rods) intersect each other.
5.6. A bamboo rod is fixed at the centre pole and held over the sign towards south;
then a pole is fixed at a distance of one purușa.
5.7. The second bamboo rod is fixed at the eastern pole (on the head) and held towards south from east; poles are fixed at the distance of one purușa and also at their middle; the same is repeated in the west.
5.8. By this the northern half is (also) explained.
5.9. At the middle poles on the southern side of the square (thus formed), two bamboo rods are fixed and held towards south, and a sign is given at a dis- tance of one puruşa, where these (rods) intersect each other.
5.10. A bamboo rod is then fixed at the centre pole (on the southern side of the square) and held over the sign towards south; then a pole is fixed at a distance of 144 ang.
5.11. The bamboo rod measuring 144 ang. is then fixed at the middle pole on the eastern (half of the southern side of this square) and held towards south, and a mark is given at a distance of 144 ang.; therefrom towards west a pole is fixed at (a distance of) 60 ang. Likewise, (from the middle pole) on the west.
5.12. (In the same manner) the construction of the northern wing is explained.
5.13. For (the construction of) the tail, vitasti should be used in place of aratni
(that is, marks should be given at a distance of 132 ang.).
5.14. The head lying eastward of the eastern side is to be measured by half purușa
of the pañcangi rod.
6
6.1. For the garhapatya fire-altar, the bricks should be constructed with sides o ne-eighth of a vyāyāma and one-fourth of a vyāyāma (i.e., 12 añgulas × 24 angulas) and with both sides one-fourth of a vyāyāma (24 angulas × 24 añgulas).
6.2. The first type of square bricks is to be made with each side one-tenth of a purușa (i.e., 12 añgulas × 12 angulas); the second type (rectangular) with sides one-tenth of a purușa and one-half of (this tenth) purușa (i.e., 12 angulas × 6
130
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
angulas); the third type (rectangular) with sides one-tenth of a puruşa and one-tenth increased by its half (i.e., 12 angulas x 18 angulas); and the fourth type (square) with both sides one-fourth of a purusa (30 añgulas × 30 angulas).
6.3. Their height is one-fifth of thirty angulas (i.e., 6 añgulas); but the height of
nākasat, cūḍā (fire baked), and ṛtavyā (seasonal) bricks, used in the middle (layers), and of vaiśvadevi bricks used in fifth and sixth layer, is half (of the former set of bricks).
6.4. Loose earth is placed in the space between bricks so that these are
bound together and not separated.
6.5. These materials are placed in the holes for the (grouping of) bricks.
6.6. The verse runs thus: "The pits are dug for keeping the vessels, the heads of
animals, tortoise, wooden mortar, two wooden spoons, pitcher and bricks, and for walking (of person in attendance).'
6.7. (The bricks) are to be placed in all directions within the body, at the juncture of head, tail and two wings, facing towards east, north, east to west, south to north and dividing them equally; depending on the contents, four bricks are to be placed towards cast and five towards west of the seasonal bricks and half (of these bricks) towards north-eastern side of the garhapatya fire. The rest (of the fire-altar) is covered with square bricks (12 angulas × 12 añgulas).
6.8. The same method from south to north is followed in the second layer, the
remaining area being covered with square bricks.
6.9. What is done in the first layer is repeated in the third and the fifth, and the arrangement in the second layer is repeated in the fourth; alternate layers (of the fire-altar) are laid in accordance with these directions.
6.10. Then in the (case of) āgnidhriya and (similar) other constructions, the area should be divided into nine equal parts. In the āgnidhriya, a stone is placed in the middle; in the hotriya, (middle portion of) each side is covered with four turiya bricks (30 angulas × 30 añgulas); in the brāhmaṇācchamsa (hearth), four half bricks are placed in the corners; in other types of fires such as the mārjāliya and the pasu-śrapana (the butcher's fire), six adhyardhā bricks (18 añgulas × 12 angulas) in twos with the prāci in the middle, are used.
6.11. Twenty adhyardha bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed eastwise in the two amsas, twenty in the two froņis and in the tail, twelve bricks on the eastern side of the two wings, turned towards east and west, and five bricks on both sides of the head; the remaining (area) is filled with square bricks (12 angulas 12 angulas). This is the first layer.
6.12. In the second layer, twenty (adhyardhā bricks: 18 angulas × 12 añgulas), turned in the direction of north-south and south-north, are placed at the śroni- amsa-paksa portion of the fire-altar; eleven on both sides of the tail; and five turned towards east on either side of the head; the remaining (area) should be covered with square bricks (12 angulas × 12 angulas).

6.13. What is done in the first layer is repeated in the third and the fifth, and the arrangement in the second layer is repeated in the fourth; alternate layers. are laid in accordance with these directions.
6.14. In the three-day worship, two (layers) are constructed on the first day and three on the second day (covered with loose earth on the third day); in the six-day worship, one (layer is constructed) each day (covered with loose earth on the sixth day); and in the twelve-day worship, the construction should be made with one layer of bricks and one layer of loose earth on alternate days.
6.15. By following this method, the construction is made throughout the whole year.
6.16. (The bricks are placed) while reciting the mantras at the beginning and then
touched at the end; that is the characteristic of a purușa.
7
7.1. A bundle of darbha grass, a lotus leaf, two idols of gold, a gold brick, a pebble, svayamatṛṇna (brick), dūrvā bricks (with engraving of durvā grass) and rice- gruel, all are placed in the middle; towards east and in the middle of five cornered space are placed svayamātṛṇṇa (bricks); in the middle, north, south, sruca and kumbheṣṭakā bricks; the remaining bricks are placed in the holes to the west side of the svayamātṛṇṇa (bricks); the west like (brick), a brick consecrated with mantras, towards north of the one of the first interspace; a brick connected with their sides and a brick consecrated with mantras towards north; then in the east two seed-pourer (retaḥ sica) bricks; in the southern interspace a ṛtavyā and a dvitiyā brick and in the east at the fourth place the seed-pourer (retaḥ sica); a brick embodying cosmic light (viśvajyoti), a circular (brick), a seasonal (ṛtavyā brick), and dharma, aṣāḍa, kūrma and bṛṣa bricks are placed; and that is the end (of construction) towards east. In the northern interspace towards the south-east are placed svayamātṛṇṇa bricks from the east; to the east the mortar and the pestle; and near the head to the north-east within it is placed one vessel (ukhā).
7.2. To the west (of ukhā) the purușaciti with its head measuring one purușa is cons-
tructed with thirty-six bricks in the west and nine (bricks) on the śroņi.
7.3. So runs the verse: "Three (bricks) are placed on the neck, six on each of the two shoulders, two on each arm, nine on the body, five on each leg in the west, and one on each hand and foot."
7.4. After having equally divided eight apasyā bricks, in each ninth interspace is placed prāṇabhṛt (brick); in the north-eastern interspace first set (of ten); in the south-western second set (of ten); in the south-eastern (the third set); in the north-western (the fourth set); in the second interspace towards south of the svayamātṛṇṇa the fifth set of ten; in the ninth interspace the supersized joined brick like that of the prăṇabhṛt. In the south-eastern interspace is
132
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
placed the first (set of ten); in the north-western (the second); in the south-western (the third); in the north-eastern (the fourth); in the second interspace towards north of the svayamātṛṇna the fifth (set of ten); the vaiśvadevi (bricks) are placed near each quarter towards north-eastern inter- space, towards south and north in the junction of the wings and their two interspaces towards east of the head of the Atharvan.
7.5. The head, two wings and the tail are divided into equal interspaces and then
the first region (for first interspace) is fixed.
:
7.6. In the first interspace on the head, loka bricks are placed side by side; likewise in the fourth interspace of two wings along east and of the tail along north; towards west of the svayamātṛṇṇa are placed bricks which had been previously joined side by side; in the southern interspace are placed vaiśvadevi bricks, and the northern interspace (is filled) with loose earth.
7.7. In a large sacrifice, procedures, as known through sacred texts, are followed with (chanting of) gāyatri and rathantara hymns of praise in the construction of the head.
8
8.1. In the second layer towards east of the svayamātṛṇṇa are placed ṛtavyā, vāyavyā and apasyā (bricks), in required number, in the first, second and third inter- spaces respectively. In the southern interspace are arranged the sets of three bricks (ṛtavyā, vāyavyā and apasyā) from south to north; (another) sets of two bricks (ṛtavyā and vāyavyā) (are placed) on both sides north of the ninth (interspace); the remaining space is covered with apasyā bricks.
8.2. In the (construction of the) third layer, ten (pranabhṛt) and twelve (bṛhati) bricks are placed on both sides of the ninth interspace; seven square (samici) bricks are arranged in the east, seven in the west and eight half bricks (ardhotsedha) consecrated with mantras on both sides of the svayamātṛṇṇa in the eighth interspace or in the last (uttama) layer.
8.3. In the fourth layer, the first (rtavyā bricks) are placed first on both sides of each of the ninth interspace. From the east to the middle of the northern interspace side by side; in a similar way (are placed) the spṛta (bricks in excess) from the east to the middle of the southern interspace alternately. In the sixth, seventh and eighth (interspaces) are placed seventeen groups each containing a pair (of bricks) and in the south fifteen groups each containing three bricks in the north.
8.4. In the fifth layer, one prāṇabhṛt on each of the (fire) places; chanda and virāja (bricks) in the remaining places, similar to atimātrā bricks in excess in the sixth, seventh and eighth interspaces as many as are required.
8.5. After having covered with half bricks, half stoma bricks (or portions) are placed from the south to east, a pair of bricks in the west, and a group of three

(bricks) in the north; these make a total of thirty-one bricks. Also a group of three (bricks) are placed by (the sides of) nākasadas in the west. It is then covered with loose earth, yava etc. and by the required number of bricks with names sprinkled with clarified butter. Thẹn the turiya (bricks) (are placed) in the middle in the same manner as the prāṇabhṛt and the atimātrā; in the north, one vikarņi (is placed) in the middle with svayamātṛṇṇa.
8.6. This is about (the construction of) the suparnaciti.

9.1. The decrease (in shape) suffered by the bricks due to drying and burning is
made good by further addition so as to restore the original shape.
9.2. The decrease is always by one-thirtieth part of the original; hence the same
is to be added to have the original shape.
9.3. A brick of 150 (sq.) angulas decrease by 6 (sq.) añgulas; the area of the brick
other than this is deformed (or not natural).
9.4. The (gārhapatya) fire-altar measures 9216 (sq.) añgulas; the measure for angula
and vyāyāma is to be determined.
9.5. The area of each hearth (dhiṣṇya) is fixed at 1196 (sq.) añgulas.
9.6. The area of the fire-altar (agniciti) is 111600 (sq.) angulas.
+
9.7. The original or derived area is 71⁄2 (sq. purușas); then area for head being 25
(sq. pada sq. purusa) is added to it.
9.8. The area is also 800 less 1 pada (799 sq. padas); the kṣetravid knows what the area
of the limbs together with that of the head of the altar should be.
9.9. The body is to be made of 400 (sq. padas); each of the two wings of 120 (sq.
padas); the tail of 110 (sq. padas); and the head of 25 (sq. padas).
9.10. Thirty-one, thirty-three and fifty square bricks are placed; half bricks are
considered for non-square places.
9.11. In the placement of hundred bricks, where there is shortage or increase of
area, the intelligent (person) must use broken bricks consecrated with mantras.
9.12. The bricks for the wings, the tail and the head are placed on the square pṛṣthā;
where the space exists, that is vanished.
9.13. The placing (of bricks) for the rathantara, bṛhalloka and gāyatra yājñiya is remem-
bered by heart and done wisely.
9.14. The number of bricks used (in the construction of) yayuşmati is always fixed;
the number of bricks used in each layer (citi) is being discussed; listen.
134
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
9.15., 19.15a. There are, according to experts, 186 (bricks) in the and 80 (bricks) in the second; 113 (bricks) in the third; 104 the fourth; and 356 (bricks) in the last layer.
first layer; (bricks) in
9.16. By all these yajuṣmati layers the fire-altar (the agni) is produced; lastly, it is
plastered with loose earth.
9.17. By this, the yaju (smati layers as quoted) are constructed; there are thousand
(bricks) to be laid with (the use of) sands.
9.18. The fire-altar suitably constructed is like a cow that is produced; the sacrificer
milks always (from this) the desires for the yajamāna.
9.19. He who knows sixty Prajapati (lords) as samvatsara goes to the heaven
(brahmaloka), the firmament and the abode of the sun.
10
10.1a, 10.1b. According to the vaiṣṇava (measure), the geometrician, the calculator, the dictator, and the one who has taken up measuring as profession are always honoured by the śulbavids. The construction (of the altar) is effected by dividing the earth which has been measured by us (since it belongs to us); the best measure for sacrifice is obtained when the construction is done in one's own house.
10.2. The ground should be plane (or level), the sanku straight, and the cord (made of muñja grass) be free from knotch (or be smooth). There shall be no cons- truction in the beginning of the nakṣatra citrā; this is done when the tithi and nakṣatra are in good accord with water (varuṇa).
10.3. The breadth of all (altars) should be towards east; the altar should be made after the body of the yaska; the height of that altar is equal to arva (16 angulas); and the cutting (of the altar) containing five layers should be at the knee (iānu).
10.4. In the second layer are placed half of ṛtavyā, nākasat and pañcacoḍā; the area
for the construction of the altar is 71⁄2 (sq.) purușas.
10.5. The (construction of the) havirdhāna is completed by a container, of the mound by means of pots, of the cātvāla by animals and of the mound with fire by materials of the sacrifice.
10.6. The half circle of area 1 (sq.) aratni is (transformed) into a four-cornered
mound; by following different methods its volume in aratni is found.
10.7. Having drawn a line equal to 24th part of a purușa in the east, another line of equal length is drawn in the west; towards south is drawn sixteen (angulas) and towards north thirty (añgulas).
10.8. The cātvāla is made one prakrama towards east; and the place for immolation is the same as one prakrama; the (area of) the cātvāla is to be increased depen- ding on the increase in the number of animals.
TRANSLATION
135
10.9. Multiply the length by the breadth separately and that again by the height;
this always gives the result in cubic measure.
10.10. Multiply the length (of a right-angled triangle) by the (same) length and the breadth by the breadth; the square-root of the sum of these two (results) gives the hypotenuse; this is already known to the scholars.
10.11. (There shall be no construction) with (the use of) fire and water in śravaṇā
and abhijit, bahulā and tiṣya, citrā and svāti.
10.12. The prâci-bhāskara is to be protected in the night; this is found as the east-
west line by means of a ŝaňku set up in a circle.
11
11.1. If the sacrificer be diseased or short (in height) from birth what should be
the measure to be used by the priests in this case ?
11.2. A thick cord of hair, a mustard seed, and a yava, (each) six times of previous
one; one prādeŝa is to be equal to 12 human angulas.
11.3. Two such (prādeśas) make one aratni; one prakrama is equal to one aratni; that (prakrama) is considered to be two prādeśas for purposes of measure- ments of a fire-altar.
11.4. A measure of four prakramas is always less by 11⁄2 añgulas.
11.5. There are eleven yūpas, four increased with four at each sacrifice.
11.6. In some altars there are two fires with no use of bricks. If the altars
are constructed separately, the fires are so constructed.
11.7. One hundred and twenty añgulas of a man always equal his five aratnis or ten
padas; depending on the man's stature, the measure may be smaller or larger.
11.8. Eighty-six angulas are known to be equal to one puga; one akṣa measures eighteen (angulas) more (i.e., 86 + 18 or 104 angulas); all ratha measures are done as per prescriptions of the texts.
11.9. Now begins the (method of) construction of a circle. Having desired to construct a circle out of a square, the (following) method has been enuncia- ted by the experts; listen to it.
11.10. The line joining the point of intersections of triangles formed in a square (that is, the point of intersection of two diagonals) and the corner (of the square) is stretched towards east; that (which remains inside the square) together with one-third (of the part projecting outside the square) forms the radius of the circle.
11.11. One puruşa (measure) produces a square of one purușa; its diagonal produces (a square of) two purusas; the diagonal of this (second square) produces (a square of) four purușas or two purușas produce a square of four purușas.
136
MANAVA-SULBASUTRA
11.12. One side (of a right-triangle) is two purușás, the other side four puruṣas; two rectangles, each having two such triangles make as quare of sixteen (square) purusas.
11.13. The fifth part of the diameter added to three times the diameter gives the
circumference (of a circle). Not a hair of length is left over.
11.14. Divide the diameter of a circle into ten parts and leave out three parts. The
square drawn with this (as side) and placed within the circle projects outside.
11.15. Divide the square into nine parts by drawing three (parallel) lines from two
sides; drop out the fifth portion (in the centre) and fill it up with loose earth.
11.16. A man measures four aratnis; for construction with sand, the use of half-arm
(i.e., one aratni extra) is also considered.
11.17. The sides (of a right triangle) are made with 3, 4 and 5; those of others are made by multiplying (these numbers) with desired (quantities), as may be required in the (construction of) altars; this has always been prescribed by ancient teachers.
11.18. For round lines (in altar), the measurement of layers are done by a multitude of measures and their changes; the measures are calculated by length and breadth.
11.19. The (unit of).double the measure of length is found from a (newly) constructed square or from a five-joint cord (pañcāngi) or as explained by the ancient teachers.
11.20a. 11.20b. Here is the method of construction with a five-joint cord; with this the measurement of all altars with the exception of kanka and alaja is done; I shall explain the markings (in the joints of such a cord).
11.21. A cord of double the measure, with marks at both ends, is given a mark at the middle, then another mark at one fourth (of the second half) which is nirañchana and then another mark at the middle (of the second half); the distance (from the nirañchana mark to the end of the second half) is equal to breadth; (with this) the required square (is constructed).
11.22. The east-west line (prāci) then becomes equal to the length of the original measure; two ties are given on (the ends of the) (increased) cord, and a pole at the middle.
11.23. After fixing the western end of the cord at the middle (pole) the cord is stretched towards east-south corner by the nirañchana mark and a pole is inserted at the middle (of the second half); the same is repeated towards (south-)west, and in (the north of) the middle; this is done in the vāsuvedi.
11.24. The ties should be lifted up for the measurement of the western corners.
11.25. Draw (straight) lines from amsa and śroni in the direction of each; with amsa and froņi. (as centres) and distance between them (as radius) draw lines

137
(such that these intersect); fix poles at the points of intersection; with these (as centres) and with the same radius (as before) draw.curves on both sides.
11.26. When it (the altar) contains bricks, no line should be drawn in the remaining
two sides (east and west).
11.27. At the eastern and western third post the rubbish heap and the southern
fire (dakṣiņāgni) are correctly placed.
11.28. Other parts are drawn from the middle (line) with nine añgulas.
12
12.1. The half measure lessened by its sixth is known as the viseșa. The viŝeșa and
the measure (pramāņa) produce the diagonal of the measure.
12.2. Take the other half of the measure; increase its (measure) by its twenty-fourth part and give at this a sixth knot with a mark, known as nirañchana, (used) for diagonal; the remaining (part) is the transverse side (tiryanmāni). The froni is half-hand away from the knot.
12.3. It has been advised for (obtaining) the āgnidhra.
12.4. That which is the diagonal of (one-fold) fire-altar is, with the original, the diagonal; in this way the twentyone-fold aśvamedha fire-altar is obtained.
12.5. (The length of) I purușa and (the breadth of) √10 puruşa produce an area of
11 (sq. puruṣas).
12.6. The diagonal formed of two sides each having the length of 1 purușa is not smooth (not an integral number). The fire-altar from 1 to 101 fold has been achieved by increasing its side (as discussed in 12.4.).
13
13.1. In right-angled triangle also (vide 12.4.), the hypotenuse of √16 angulas will
give value in prakrama for the sautrāmaṇī sacrifice.
13.2. One-third of a prakrama (i.e., 10 angulas) is for (the construction of) the saumiki, the queen of the serpents (sārparājñiki). This with 3 and other with √3 serve the purpose of the altar previously mentioned.
13.3. In the soma sacrifice, one prakrama equals 14 angulas or it should be measured
with 1200 (sq.) angulas as in the case of the animal sacrifice.
13.4. Give a mark at one-fourth; draw circles with one-sixth, one-ninth, one-seventh
and one-ninth, and in (each of) half side; there shall be no circle (in the west).
13.5. The sāvitṛ and similar altars should be constructed in four days; the aruṇa
(altar) should be made knee-high and filled with water.

MĀNAVA-SULBASŪTRA
13.6. The gārhapatya (fire-altar) has two forms e.g., the square and the circle; the square is constructed with a side of one vyāyāma (i.e., 96 angulas) and the circle with a radius of half puruşa (i.e., 60 añgulas).
13.7. The (rectangular) bricks having length one-third of a vyāyāma and breadth one-seventh of a vyāyāma are to be made and (arranged) in the first and in other alternate layers (each) with 21 bricks.
13.8-13.9. Rectangular bricks (used in other layers) are one-third of a purușa long and one-sixth (of a purușa) broad; its breadth of one prathika (20 añgulas) is arranged along the length (of the altar), the breadth and the length of the middle and the remaining layers being equal. The two bricks each of 20 angulas at the two corners equal the length of the brick (i.e., 40 angulas); (by this arrangement) the cleavage (is prevented). Three corner bricks (of each layer) are replaced by six half bricks (to make each layer of 21 bricks).
13.10. (Here have been used) a number of four-sided bricks measuring more than a
prathika by one prathika.
13.11. In the circular (gārhapatya), there are four kinds of bricks measured with the
parts (of a puruşa).
13.12. Four (square) bricks are placed in the middle; two more (such bricks) to the east and west of them; two each on the sides; then one of the bricks looking like half-moon is divided into two half bricks; the remaining circular parts are equally divided; thus 21 bricks (are made).
131.3. Alternate layers are done with bricks facing north.
13.14. Types of bricks used (for fire-altar) together with the chanting of the gāyatra (metre) include one-and-half, quarter, half-quarter and the fifth of a purușa (padyapāda or pañcami).
13.15. Taking a cord two purușas long and four times the original cord, marks are to be given at equal intervals by an expert; this is known to be pañcāngi by the learned.
13.16. From the middle (of the cord) between ties marks are given at (a distance of) one purușa increased by one aratni; this is called the gayatra measure and used for the construction of a square; at the end each wing is increased by the gayatra (24 angulas) measure and the tail by what is left after taking off 108 angulas (from a puruşa).
13.17. When dried and burnt, bricks (usually) lose one-thirtieth (of their size).
13.18. Then after a place is washed with water and sanctified, it is divided into three
or four parts.TRANSLATION

13.19. Adhyardhā bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed,-20 on the north and the (southern) amsa of the prācī, 10 in the tail (on çach side), 12 on each side of both wings, and 5 on both sides of the prăci. The number of bricks are 15 on the head, 84 in the two wings, 85 on the body and 30 on the tail. According to some scholars, there are 99 quarter bricks in the tail, 20 each in śroņi and amsa, 10 on each side of the tail and the wings.
13.20. (In the second layer) ten adhyardhā bricks are placed in the head towards east
and north.
13.21. Bricks in the first (layer) are connected together and turned towards east and those of the second are connected by mantras and intended for aśvini.
13.22. The piling of bricks is done by alternating (the above layers) upto the height
of the knee.
13.23. For a small area of (side) 3 padas, the dhiṣnya (fire) of one layer is to be constructed with 4 kinds of bricks; for more layers it is done with mantras concerning the fire-altar.
13.24. There are 4 adhyardhās (18 angulas × 12 añgulas), and the two in the middle
are to be (divided into six parts) (nakula caturbhāga).
13.25. In the āgnidhriya, a stone is placed in the ninth place (i.e., in the middle).
13.26. Then we shall explain the hotriya. The two nakula bricks of pada measure (12 angulas × 12 añgulas) on the two amsas and śroņis are divided into four quarter bricks giving 14 bricks in each of the triangular directions. In each direction there are 8 quarter bricks.
13.27. In the brāhmaṇācchaṛśa, there are 11 bricks in the middle, two sets of quarter
bricks and a nakula brick (12 añgulas × 12 añgulas).
13.28. There are three quarter bricks (12 añgulas × 12 angulas) on each side and two adhyardhā (18 añgulas × 12 angulas) bricks in the middle, in all eight bricks.
13.29. Six adhyardhā bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed on the mārjālīya; its amsa is situated in the southern side of the (mahāvedi) for cooking of sacri- ficial flesh. In the west, three bricks of 12 angulas × 36 angulas are placed for washing the vessel with water after the sacrifice is over.
14
14.1. In the syena (fire-altar) there are 371⁄2 parts in the left wing, 4 in the head, 26 in the body, and 15 in the tail. The alajacit has 17 (parts) in the tail, 2 in the head, and the same (number of parts) in the body and the (two) wings (as in the śyena). These are measured by (bricks of side) one-fourth of a puruşa intermingling the joints of the parts.
140
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
14.2. In the kankacit, 8 parts are in the tail, 4 parts in the feet and 7 parts in the head; the body and the two wings have the same (number of parts) as in the Syena.
14.3. In the construction of syena, alaja and kańka (fire-altars), 81 parts are spread out in the tail, 4 parts in the body, 2 parts in the head and 5 parts in each of the wings.
14.4. In the fyena, alaja and kanka (fire-altars), two-cornered, three-cornered and four-cornered (bricks) are used in the tail. The five (bricks used) at the ends of the wings are those obtained by cutting (the original bricks) by the diagonal.
14.5. Two parts are added to the tail in the alaja which is filled up by three- cornered (bricks); three parts are transferred from the tail of the śyena to the head of the kanka, and two parts are again cut off (from it) for each foot of the kanka.
14.6. 12 parts are measured along east, 20 in north; 15 parts for kanka and 131⁄2 for
alaja in the north.
14.7. A cord (for the construction of vakrapakṣa syenacit and others) should have 12 parts or 12 parts; a mark is given at its middle and that for the nirañ- chana at one-fourth (of the second half).
14.8a. 14.8b, Marks are given (in the cord) first at part 4, then at 5; in another
(arrangement), in the middle and at parts 8, 9, 10 and 11.
14.9. Then it is stretched on the prācī (line) and a pole is fixed at (each of the marks at) the middle of the two (end) ties, and at 8 and 4. Fixing the (eastern) tie at (the pole at) 4, the cord is stretched (by the middle) and the nirañchana mark is given at the middle.
14.10. (The cord is) again stretched from the middle pole (after fastening the tie at it) and a mark is given at 4 parts. The cord is similarly stretched on both sides of the pole at 10, marks are given at parts 2 and 4, and then (a place is fixed) in the east at 5 parts. Poles are inserted at four places at equal distances apart.
14.11.14.12. Then the cord is stretched on the east-west line with ties at the pole, at 51 (part); (again) stretching it at the two western poles, two poles are fixed at 7 and 8, and at 4 and 9.
14.13. A tie is fixed at pole 8 (middle pole of the second east-west line), and the cord is stretched by keeping (the end tie) fixed at the pole 8 (middle of the third east-west line), and two poles are fixed at parts (10 and 11 not inserted before).
14.14. (Having) fixed the tie at the first two poles, the cord is stretched by the
pole at 8, (then) a pole at 10 gives the middle of the tail of alaja.
TRANSLATION
141
14.15. A tie given at mark 11, is fixed at the third middle pole and stretched by the mark at 3; again a tie at 2 is stretched by the mark at 10; and poles are inserted at these two marks; the same is done in the northern (wing).
14.16. The mark at 2 is fixed at the northern point of (wing) and is brought to the
south after stretching it into two equal parts.
14.17. A pole is fixed at the fourth part (from eastern amsa point), and the operation is repeated in the opposite manner. For this (purpose), the cord is stretched from the fourth part.
14.18. The pole is to be fixed at 71⁄2 part in the case of the kanka (cit); this is known.
14.19. Having given a tie at mark 3 (of the cord) and fixed it (in the pole at 8
i.e., the middle pole), the cord is stretched by (the mark at) 10, and two poles are fixed at these two marks. The same is done in the northern (wing).
14.20. This is the cord with 12 marks (used for the measurement of area) of the
syena (fire-altar).
14.21. Four kinds of bricks are prepared with one-third and one-fourth (of a purușa). These are one-ninth of the original (40, 40), triangular (30, 30, 30 √2), half-triangular (15 √2, 30, 15 √2) and five-cornered bricks (15 √2, 15√2, 15, 30, 15).
14.22. Two five-cornered and two half-triangular (bricks) are placed on the eastern (side of the head). One each (of these bricks) is placed at the top of each amsa and at the top of each wings in both sides.
14.23. The middle of the body is filled with one-ninth (square) bricks surrounded by triangular bricks; five triangular bricks are placed in the end of (each) wing.
14.24. Two of the triangular bricks are placed oppositely in the joints between the body and the tail, together with (two) five-cornered bricks at each of the west side; in the joints between the head and the body are placed half- triangular bricks, and the head is likewise filled up with these (half- triangular bricks).
14.25. Two half-triangular bricks are placed on the joints of the wings (one at each western corner), two at the junctions of the tail, fifteen at the tip of the tail, and twentyone at the end of each wing.
14.26. The construction of the falcon-shaped fire-altar is thus completed by using cords of shorter and longer units for the measurement of its area and by (the arrangement of) bricks in alternate layers.
14.27. The wing of the alaja (fire-altar) is not bent; such is done in the previous layer; the tail is worked out from the middle with cord used in (the measure- ment of) syena.
142
MANAVA-SULBASUTRA
14.28. Two poles are fixed on the ninth part from the eastern point; construct a triangular brick (15, 15, 15 √/2), being one-fourth of a square brick (30, 30); this is so in the alaja due to half of its wing being not bent.
15
15.1,15.2. The same as 4.7 and 4.8, being repetition.
15.3. The fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle (praugacit) has an area one half of 15 (sq.) purușas. Join the middle (of the eastern side of the rectangle of area 15 sq. purușas and sides 20 aratnis and 19 aratnis) at 10 (aratnis from either end) with the north-western and south-western froni (points) to form a triangle; the bricks are accordingly made.
15.4. In (the fire-altar in the form of) a rhombus (ubhayata prauga), there are 21 squares (each of side 72 angulas); half of it lies opposite to each other; the two amsas and śroņis are cut off so as to form an isosceles triangle on either side (of the common line).
15.5. The samūhya fire-altars are (built) without bricks in the (four) cardinal directions; cātvāla pits are constructed in four sides and are dug for waste products; this has been prescribed.
15.6. A fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit) should be drawn in the form of a circle or a square. In the fire-altar in the form of a trough (dronacit) there is a handle (tsaru) which has an area one-tenth of the original (fire-altar). 15.7. (For the circular droṇacit) a square is drawn within a circ`e as in the case of the gārhapatya altar; it is measured with one-twentieth part (of the square drawn on 72 añgulas); for the varuṇa (altaṛ) it is done with half-part.
15.8. After the area inside and outside (the squares) is measured, it is divided into ten equal parts (by means of ten parallel lines from each side); there should be a triangle in the corner and joints in alternate layers.
15.9. Each brick used in the square has an area one-thirtysecond (3) part of the square (of side 72 angulas) (i.e., 162 sq. angulas); the bricks of one and half times (adhyardha) are also made; these are like the gayatra.
15.10. (For the drona fire-altar) of 1,000 bricks, each brick must have an area of one-fifteenth part of the square (of side 72 angulas); bricks of one and half times (adhyardhā) are also made; then each layer is known to have 200 bricks.
15.11. (In a construction of thousand bricks), there are 250 one-and-half bricks (adhyardhās), 150 square bricks, and out of 1,000, one-hundred (is always used) for wings of each layer.
15.12. Each of the bricks (used in the second and fourth layer) has an area of one- thirtyfirst part of the square (of side 72 angulas); one thousand square bricks are placed altogether.

15.13. The circular (fire-altar in the form of a) chariot wheel (rathacakracit) covers an area of 101 (square) purușas; it has nave, spokes, and empty interspaces between the spokes and the rim accounting for the excess (area).
15.14. (Each of) twentyfour (spokes and interspaces) covers a rectangular space of
length one purușa, and breadth purușa; these cover (a space of) 3 purușas; half of this space is used for spokes (since half of the interspace is left out).
15.15. Now I shall explain the making of the interspace; the side on the rim is 4 purușa (i.e., 34 añgulas roughly); (the length) is ‡ (sq. purușa) (i.e., 92 angulas roughly); it is placed on the nave at an interval of 24th part of a purușa (i.e., 5 angulas); from that 8th part, it will be formed in the shape of an isosceles triangle (prauga).
15.16. The nave is constructed with two bricks; the spokes are made of four, and the felly of three and their parts; the alternate (parts of spokes) are hollow.
15.17. To measure the interspace of the nave, a circle is constructed with one-fourth of the diameter, i.e., with 43 angulas, and that of the rim with 62 angulas.
15.18. The remaining layers are done with reason and right proportion.
15.19. He who follows traditional methods and measurements appeases hell and goes
entirely to a world with makers of ŝulbas.

16.1a. 16.1b. Another type of fire-altar in the form of a chariot-wheel (rathacakra), as explained by Viṣņu, is to be piled up by the performer; it is three times as large and 7 (sq.) purușas are embedded in its circle by the learned.
16.2. An interspace of 3 more (sq.) purușas is left out from the specified area.
16.3. Its rim (becomes equal to) the breadth of spokes, and the diameter of the
circle and bricks used are made by the third part.
16.4a. 16.4b. The nave is drawn with purusa; it has space for grass; the rim is larger than spokes by purușa; it is the dwelling (of Viṣņu); it has the measure of 3241 angulas and a circle is made in the middle with its 20th part.
16.5. The bricks in the first layer of the chariot-wheel (fire-altar) are known to be
344.
16.6. In the second layer, there are 24 more bricks; five-cornered and three-cornered
bricks are (used) in the joints of the rim and spokes.
16.7. The five layers of the chariot-wheel fire-altar are filled up with 1,768 bricks.
The fulbasūtra is concluded.

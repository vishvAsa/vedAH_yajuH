The late sections of the yajurveda saMhitA-s list a wide range of professions that do not appear in the earlier parts of the shruti. This corresponded to the emergence of an agricultural economy (detailed in the incantation of the vAjaprasavIya vasordhAra rite = "chamaka"). This, in our opinion, marks the incorporation of the Harappan jAti-s within an Indo-Aryan framework:

## Manufacturers
